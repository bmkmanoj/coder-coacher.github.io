host Josh Owens along with my co-host
Ben Strahan hello everybody so I think
we've got an awesome show lined up today
I'm actually pretty excited I'm stoked
Eric Chris key and Dave with us I guess
they've created feathers yes is that
right yeah
tell us what feathers is so it's a
minimal we'll call it service-oriented
j/s framework so it's geared for her no
js' the browser and react native and
it's just a really thin wrapper overtop
of Express actually and a couple of
WebSocket libraries like Sokka Deo and
and Primus so but gives you a bit more
structure to your application and we try
and put it the whole point of it was to
really make it easy to transition from
kind of a monolithic you know
application where you've got all your
all your services or an MVC LAN like all
your controllers and models all in one
app and split them out into multiple
services what do you need to scale it
out so yeah that's the high level
version of feathers I guess actually you
know I only heard of it maybe with the
why are the the hacker news post that
went up the other day like I'd I've
heard mention of it but it didn't really
like radar until the the 2.0 kind of was
mentioned today
start at the beginning beginning or at
the when when it has its current form in
the beginning beginning was actually a
Java app that I wrote for my thesis in
2010 there was even a PHP version that
was about this long live dismay in
in PHP because then no js' came around
and so you could say six years but I
think the real birth date was more
version 0.4 paraguayan if we reduce that
one two years ago yeah probably around
two years ago
really I got in a young you know let's
go back and look like even the one dot
oh we probably didn't release until two
years or a year and a half year ago ish
yeah so basically that the core has been
pretty stable and been on for a little
bit but I think the 2.0 we did so we
added some pretty cool things that we're
really happy with that makes it a little
more than just like the API framework
for Express yeah yeah tell us tell us
about some of the big changes you know a
2.0 yeah I think you know 2.0 was really
with 1.0 we it's funny we never had any
luck I think did boycott Canadians and
hacker news actually so we are really
surprised that it made it up to the to
the home page because it took a couple
days and we're like okay another flop
guess that's not gonna whatever but I
think with 2.0 is really more about
branding and a ground like kind of
solidifying more the marketing message
around it really like with with feathers
of the core actually didn't really
change we had a couple breaking changes
like I noticed you guys mentioned on the
on the podcast last week that we were
following or trying very hard to follow
proper assembler so with core like there
were a couple breaking changes that we
that we found and we're gonna be doing a
v3 coming up with some breaking changes
that we do know about those will
probably will come a little later this
year like later in the year but they're
really small I mean just cuz core itself
is actually really small now what we
really tried to do with the 2.0 releases
in December we kind of decided while
we're gonna take this either from just
kind of being a side project that we've
been using you know for consulting work
or for own personal projects and we're
either gonna go for it and actually make
it a proper you know something people
want to consume or we just keep it the
way that it is right and in December we
decided to obviously go a bit more full
bore on it and a lot of bulk of the work
was just around you know documentation
we did some of the plugins like probably
the big one for this release was
authentication but really we rolling out
stuff that we found then everybody finds
that they need in almost every
application right so just making it easy
but to build out apps really quickly but
also entirely optional I think that was
the big big key thing for us is keeping
stuff as plugins are totally pluggable I
think a universal thing was pretty
pretty cool too and that just happened
by accident but is like hey hey every
little bit in the client and we were
like yes and then we had this version
that you can use on the client just as
well as on the server and you use it
transparently pretty much now and I
think that's really fun feature to use I
think for myself I find I use so coming
like this this used to be called a
meteor Club podcast and we renamed it so
we've got like you know I think for me
like the universal piece I find the
place I use it the most is with the data
kind of the data modeling you know on
them on the front and the back end and
being able to have that kind of common
API that's shared in both spots is that
kind of what you guys are seeing as well
now that you've released the the
universal support or how are people kind
of using that feature yeah I mean that's
exactly it
it was like Dave said it was kind of by
accident I think some some guy howling
on his first name Mikey on github he
just said hey you know be cool as if you
could actually use this on the
because initially we were just looking
at it it's just a server-side
implementation and we hadn't you can
still talk to a using rest library or
sakyo or Primus or whatever on the
client but we didn't bundle it all up
for you and then you know like Dave I
guess one night was like holy shit I
think I actually can do that so let's
just try hacking it out and you get it
in night and then we refined it from
there and that's where we're seeing
there's actually a really powerful
accident because that kind of then put
us into the same space is a bit more
like meteor I think but even some of the
other clients like frameworks I mean we
want to stay view engine agnostic
because that's kind of what people have
their own personal choice for and we
have some stuff coming down the pipe
that'll make managing data a little bit
easier but that's yeah primarily what
people are using it for and and what we
recommend is you know use feathers for
your back-end stuff and you know your
front-end kind of data management or
applications sake but you get to pick
your own view engine and and a nicer
accident that kind of came along with
that is feathers actually doesn't have
like on the client side doesn't have to
talk to a feathers back in if you're
implementing socket IO like in some
cases it kind of does but if you're
doing basic rest stuff like we give you
that service and hooks kind of that plug
ability on the front end and you can be
talking to an existing restful api on
the back end that isn't that feathers
out so it actually yeah it became it was
kind of interesting I think one of the
big things that attracts me to feathers
is the flexibility that you have with it
compared to something other than like
meteor that we come from one of the big
things is the flexibility with like
databases and even like touching like
local storage although I saw that your
sequel support is like pretty amazing
can you guys talk a little bit on that
and like how the challenges of it or
the presidents put on that yeah I'm
interested so what's interesting because
we did have a couple of database
adapters but they were just like
implementing that that basic interface
and that was it
and I think with that version actually
we started making it more like having a
share test suite that make sure that you
can do the same kind of currying over
those different tab yes and then realize
that it was actually not that hard with
having that in play to to add like
different or amps and different
databases because there are a lot of
them and they're like the ones that we
chose as Orange and specific database
implementation was really interesting
because it it makes it it actually made
it pretty easy because most of em
support all of the stuff so all we had
to do was map our query syntax that we
had from before to what the or else
we're doing so that was actually not as
much of a challenge right now I think
we're learning a little bit more about
the nitty-gritty details because some
some stuff to be honest like sequel eyes
we made the test path against our
adapters right but there's a little more
to it when people build like a big big
app which are most likely equalized
questions but they come up if somebody
somebody uses it combined with that
right so when a Eric is working on
making many to many relationship
examples and things like that and we
probably want to like make that share
test suite also a little more like over
making it cover more than the current
acts and stuff that we describe there
the tailmon for that totally is that
that well you have to change it for like
six or seven different libraries and
each one is a little bit different so
it's been good so far because I don't
think none of the adapters is more than
a hundred and thirty lines ago so it's
really it's really like the worms and
the database drivers are doing most of
the work for us which is pretty nice
yeah which I mean because you're coming
from
it's already available to you and I
think a number of people like you guys
are using Express you're using you know
node and you also like I thought it was
interesting to like diving into the the
JSON web tokens this is really kind of
my first exposure to that but it seems
like that's more of a standard than say
something like authentication over DDP
or something like that so that's really
interesting like can you talk about like
what JSON web tokens are and yeah sure
I'll kind of take that and kind of
follow up a bit on on Dave stuff too
that I think unlike the client being an
accidental decision the database stuff
and wrapping Express was a very
intentional decision because I think for
us like because we're a small group and
because we're not you know we don't have
any official backing other than the
consulting work that we do that we have
it's good it's good and bad right like I
mean you have we've got time constraints
and we also have you know financial
constraints so with that we have to make
pretty smart decisions and that means
that we leverage as much as we can from
the community like Dave was saying we
did right and we it's still around but
the first database adapter we wrote was
an in-memory one and then the second one
was a MongoDB one and we actually
started going down the route of MySQL
and Postgres and and in reality we had
those built we just didn't publish them
because we took a step back and went
this is absolutely insane like you know
there's all these great ORM s we should
just see if we can wrap those and
translate them because if we try and
write you know otherwise are gonna write
15 to 20 different database adapters and
try and maintain them all it's crazy
so I like Davis saying a challenge there
is that it still kind of feels like
we're maintaining some of those because
we do get questions that come up with
you know around sequel eyes around water
line but I think the benefits outweigh
the drawbacks there
and then I think regarding the choice to
go with JW Chi I mean we really gleaned
a lot from acero and what they're doing
it's all zeros a like sort of like a
sass platform that'll that manages
authentication for you and they've built
some really really awesome stuff
including you know they're really
pushing JSON web token and the
intentional choice behind that is we
wanted to make it really easy for you to
scale your app like go same from day one
and with Xero or with a JWT
it's stateless so you can as long as
you're using the same secret on the
server
servers that you need to talk to you
don't have to worry about sticky
sessions and stuff like that and I know
that's a challenge that that meteor
currently has is there's there's some
and you probably know more about that
than I do Josh actually but that there's
they rely on sessions I think right now
still in order to synchronize state the
server with meteor the server kind of
keeps track of the state that it's sent
and so they like to use sticky sessions
to make sure you're not reacting and
enforcing a new server to grab all that
same data it's already kind of tracking
in memory so that's why they use sticky
sessions which isn't like super hard
I think nginx is a one-liner you use
like IP hash or something like that I
know it's funny it seems to come up
we've seen it come up a few times in the
slack group that people are like oh my
god this is you know it's so nice to not
have sticky sessions and like I've never
had a real problem with that like Heroku
does it well engine access like you're
saying a one-liner where you can load
balance that it's not really that much
of a problem in my opinion I think the
thing that is maybe more interesting to
me is with JSON web tokens so meteor is
like super close to being able to do
kind of a service-oriented architecture
but the problem is there's no way to
share any kind of like authentication
state between basically multiple meteor
applications and so
someone's created something that's like
you know an API key system that can work
but there's no way to like say I've got
these apps on this same root domain that
can like just use this this JSON web
token so that's kind of a bummer it
would would be nice to use something
maybe a little more standard inmediately
but who knows I'm not sure how how
tricky you know I guess full disclosure
like I've done some stuff with meteor
but I'm definitely would not kiddin
consider myself a meteor expert by any
means I think yeah Jason Webb token and
that was part of the initial design I
think when they did it and this is only
from me reading through the spec and
reading through the awesome stuff on all
zeros blog but they you can encode
whatever in the token so you can Jason
encode stuff and so the nice thing for
us is that it makes it pretty easy that
if you want to do similar stuff like
group apps or channel things or only you
can actually save all state inside the
token and when it gets decoded on the
server you can actually check the some
of the values that are stored inside of
that token in order to be certain way
that's very cool I like that so um do
you find any challenges with scaling
with the real-time aspect like what's
the yeah but that's like I don't like
those types of questions cuz it's like
it's like Oh Twitter was built with what
oh we must use that that must be the
coolest Oh what was Facebook built with
oh we should use that I know I'm using
those two on purpose so that it's like
I'm like it's a pretty fair question
though I mean like I'm not gonna you
know we're not gonna deny that feathers
is pretty fresh right but we think that
everybody you know everybody started
from somewhere right and so I think as
far as we've had some people kind of
come out of the woodwork I don't even
know really what they're scaling what
type of volume they're dealing with but
it's been kind of weird because really
like I was saying prior to 2.0 you know
I think we had
800 stars like github or something and
so you're like well okay some people
obviously seen this but you don't know
if people actually using it you know and
we weren't really promoting it that hard
because we weren't sure if we were gonna
you know frankly if if we were a really
great solution at least from my
perspective any day was a lot more
thought into it than I was
because he did a thesis on it but for me
even though we've been using it for a
year year and a half I wasn't we were
over the last year and a half we've been
kind of constantly looking at the other
frameworks out there and trying to
figure out are we just reinventing the
wheel like is it yet another framework
because we're pretty sensitive to that I
mean like there's so much awesome stuff
that comes out of that but it's also
everybody a lot of people talk about the
JavaScript fatigue right I'm fatigued
and I think we've been really really
careful about making sure that we are
actually offering something unique and
different and approaching it in a
different way because otherwise you
should just go use a different framework
gun I think from the scaling story like
coming back to the original question
we're still kind of finding people that
are doing it like I actually had a call
with a company today that is looking to
switch over to feathers they've done
they've done stuff previously with
feathers one and this is the new company
and they're looking to switch over
because their node back-end is
unexpressed and this time that's not
that great but they recently were
featured in Apple AppStore and had 1.2
million downloads the last like 21 days
so I think you know the fact that we're
a really thin wrapper over top of
Express and the fact that core has been
really stable for the last you know two
years or a year and a half I think
definitely shouldn't shy people away
from from trying it out and worrying
about scaling and and going forward like
that's that has been our goal from day
one is being able to scale so we've been
really thinking about the architecture
and we're continuing to do that making
it easy to scale and we'll be having
we'll have some some guides and stuff
coming out over the next little
to kind of show you how you can break up
your app and take it scaling out on
docker and scaling out on on digital
ocean or AWS some are the big thing that
that in the meteor world we've been like
kind of measuring how many concurrent
users you can connect to like a server
is that like a relevant measure for
feathers I think a lot of it is kind of
like Eric said right because it's such a
thin wrapper everything that applies for
us and socket IO also applies to feather
this is really I mean there's some kind
of specific things right that you can
take a service and just move it to
another system and then connect to it
and you don't it's really easy to do but
when it comes to scaling and load
everything that applies to socket IO and
Express this is twice feathers - and I'm
off my rule of thumb was I think 10,000
connections per server but I've only
done like it's only my personal
experience so simultaneous socket
connections to service which is great
because no can handle a lot and I'd love
to see like some more performance
benchmarks but I think we're also
thinking that if you know the modules
are super lean and the architecture is
small it's much easier to figure out
where the bottleneck is right
you don't have to go through this entire
giant system to figure out where your
problems are because it's so decoupled
and then they're all small modules I
think it's pretty easy to find out where
the bottlenecks are so you know kind of
focus on that and not saying you have
the solution to scaling but we're hoping
that the architecture that the whole
system has helped with making it easier
yeah and you know the interesting thing
is - with the approach of using Express
and the other options the choices that
you've made like supporting the
different ORM s that you do like it
feels like you could probably find a lot
of these answers on Stack Overflow or
elsewhere right like you can go to
reddit.com slash are slash node and
probably find a post that's close to
what you're thinking about like just
because you're using feathers as the
glue doesn't mean that you're stuck off
in no man's land hasn't encountered it
before before so yeah he even set that
cross dedication initially but it turned
out that actual socket and HDPE double
ET authentication is actually something
that hasn't been done that often so that
was why we decided to like Eric did a
lot of work and making sure that it
works very cool let's talk about
authentication for for a minute so I
went through this tutorial really quick
yeoman kind of makes authentication
out-of-the-box and I didn't dive too
much into it and I was like man this is
perfect I can ask these guys to like
dive in for me then so tell us about
authentication with express not express
sorry
feathers yeah sure I mean I think that's
a good good little Freudian slip
actually it's really not you know we're
not doing that much I think the only
thing that's really kind of a little bit
different I'd gone and initially we had
gone and done some stuff we did a
feathers passport plugin that we
recently deprecated and that's we were
using for for one decks because all the
authentication stuff is built on top of
Passport again like trying not to
reinvent the wheel the only thing that
we've written ourselves really is just
some service wrappers to make it a
little bit more feather Z over top of it
I guess the the socket kind of the
wrapper for some of the socket events
and then the last thing is the actual
token implementation then we're just
using JSON web token there knows no
Jason web token module underneath I
guess the one thing that we are doing a
little bit different it's kind of
interesting all the implementations out
there of socket IO authentication
require you to pass stuff via they kind
of exposed stuff over the query string
which I thought was kind of like
that's pretty big no no like you don't
want to you could potentially have a
malicious proxy in between right that
you don't want to expose your your auth
token so we've been pretty careful of
that as well and basically what we do is
we wrap it all in in the header for your
request and then once your socket is
connect is authenticated then it stays
all kinda kitted until it gets
disconnected on either end and so if
your initial request is happening over
HTTPS which it should be then it's not
really that easy for an attacker to get
access here to your auth token so I'm
curious it's just kind of looking at I
actually hadn't looked at passport
before so if if I wanted to add like you
know Twitter social login would I add
the passport module for that to get that
working is that how that would work with
feathers
yeah it's kind of funny though Twitter
so we only support OAuth 2 and not Oh
auth 1 and Twitter's probably the only
big one out there that doesn't support
OAuth 2 authentication we've got an
issue we're not sure when we want to
plant a because the thing with OAuth 1
is it requires it requires sessions in
order to do the actual authentication
and so we intentionally left that off of
this first release just to kind of see
how some of the stuff plays out frankly
I'd rather focus a bit more on the the
scaling aspect of feathers first and
then come back to that to see you know
can we still do all the stuff we want to
do now that we're bringing in session
based authentication I've actually been
thinking a lot about it the last couple
days too because Twitter obviously like
I want to use Twitter so do other people
it sucks that they don't have a lot -
I'm really hoping that maybe they'd roll
it out but realistically we probably
would end up moving a bit quicker and
yeah I think the more I've been thinking
about the last couple days is probably
actually not too too bad because in the
end the only thing you're using this
session for is the initial
authentication call and then we just
exchange it for a JWT so whenever you
authenticate with
others whether you use oauth2 or OAuth
one or local authorial ike some sort of
password less stuff that we're working
on right now in the end what we just
exchanged that once you've authenticated
we exchange that for a JWT and then you
get it back you get the JWT back and
then you use that for your for your
subsequent requests after that so I
don't think it'll be too too bad but
definitely yeah no Twitter support right
now
no OAuth 1 support but there are a lot
of providers that offer a lot - did you
specifically ask that Josh but is like
the one is like perfect but so but auth0
can kind of handle that for you right is
that true like I haven't used all 0 but
for other Olaf services and then you you
kind of get there yeah I mean like I
said we we modeled off very much after
officer Oh like I was looking at their
dogs
I think they hired Jared Hanson who who
was the creator of Koz board you know
they created or are one of the major
backers of the JSON web token spec they
built their business around it and
they're really sharp sharp team I
haven't actually had a chance to talk
with any of them
but looking at their stuff their modules
and their documentation we really looked
heavily at how they're doing it off 0 so
I guess once we land kind of Twitter
support and password list off from a
from a high level perspective we offer a
lot of what austero does for you but
they do some really awesome stuff on top
of that like they also do audit logging
you have the ability to revoke revoke
tokens which we don't have support yet
for you can do Refresh tokens like they
build a lot of stuff on top and that's
pretty rock-solid I think the big thing
for us is we'll probably have a guide
coming out soon that shows how to do all
0 but we didn't want to
law necessarily forced developers that
if they wanted to use authentication
that they have to kind of go either
passport and still do it all yourself or
go the osteo route and maybe end up in a
paid situation well the thing that I was
looking at is that passport has like an
all-zero
component that you could add so you
could really like if you're desperate
you could get Twitter authentication
that way currently right
yeah okay okay all right so yeah people
uses their - sorry go I'm Josh
good good one other question that I saw
that was coming up in hacker news posts
was about how real time the actual lake
data could you maybe talk around that a
little bit because I think you know for
me coming from meteor land I'm aware of
like doing a blog tailing and getting
you know however fast the server can
process the hop log you know we're
getting that pushed out to the client
they're getting that real-time which I
will say in all reality I'm not sure how
much like up to the second real time
this I need in a web app like I want
some version of it but at the same time
like I don't need it for everything all
the time either which is kind of where
meteor leaves you you know what does
that look like like what's the delay
time how does that function that kind of
thing it's very interesting because
hacking news even like this discussing
about the term real-time what it means
in other computer science fields and
what it means in web development right
so I think feathers and socket IO and
meteor doing the same thing that we as
web developers consider real-time right
it pushes information to your clients
without the client having a pull for it
so I think that's that we can all agree
on that definition of real time because
even people didn't agree on that so like
I don't know you have to have the terms
to talk about it okay so built time for
feathers means that and that's probably
pretty important that it's on the
service level so it happens at the API
level or you know you can use the API
internally to you don't have to go
through the API but it happens at that
service level so basically any service
like let's say you build a service that
talks to another REST API or to
something that claims to be a realistic
yeah and you still get all
those events that created updated etc so
that's why it's possible for us to
support so many different databases
right one of the thing that we've been
talking about a little bit is to because
there is some databases that support
change feeds there is there is some
MongoDB habla scaling and then there is
rethink DD with a change feed so we've
been talking about building this is
because it's actually basically you just
you have your table and then you listen
to changes on it and then you admit the
same kind of events that feather stuff's
already right so we're definitely
looking into that that's on the roadmap
I don't know if I'm gonna if you want to
touch that for SQL because triggers are
not my thing
yeah so somebody else wants to take that
on but we're definitely planning on
doing that for rethink DB and then
MongoDB so that even if you stick things
directly into the database you'd get
like those real-time updates but we also
notice that it's a key I know not as
important as you might think initially
because as long as everything and
everybody is using the API it right
you'll still get all those events anyway
so we focused like the set of service
pattern focuses specifically on that
kind of level of abstraction instead of
trying to hook into the database doesn't
answer your question
I hope couldn't it yeah one thing that
I'm curious on now was your description
of that is I don't know if you guys
heard about the new project coming out
of meteor development group called
Apollo which is like adding reactivity
to craft you all pretty much I would
like to hear hear your thoughts on there
unscripted so it's been kind of funny
seeing a lot of this stuff kind of come
out because we've been proud
typing some of that already for a while
and I guess we want to talk about it too
too much because I was kind of gonna be
a little bit of a big bang hopefully but
I don't know in some regards of maybe we
could consider it a little bit of an
arms race like we're also trying to do
something so much that and I think um
because it makes a lot of sense like the
guys the people at meteor not they're
not dumb they're very smart people like
they they understand and they've really
pioneered a lot of the stuff that's
happening that were even doing right I
wouldn't say you know we we modeled a
lot of stuff off of what they did but I
remember when meteor first came out that
was around the time that we were kind of
tinkering with the idea of feathers and
they came out with this massive
explosion of pretty awesome stuff like
we didn't have all the real-time stuff
that they did at the time it was very
much just service-oriented and I think
what they've done is really pushed stuff
forward and
the next step that we see is yeah making
it easier I mean really what graph QL is
trying to solve is making it easier to
query the data that you need especially
across relationships right that's really
challenging really challenging for
Facebook too when I imagine they've got
this massive MySQL charted cluster of
normalized tables like you know huge
problem for them so we know we're also
kind of chasing the same thing and
reactive programming makes a lot of
sense as well because you know even I
was just switching to promises there
supporting him a nice promise gene for
hooks debugging now it's kind of crappy
you know reactive programming makes it
really really easy to translate and
transform your data you get one stream
of data as opposed to right now with
feathers you have to set up three
different event listeners essentially to
get those real-time changes on your on
your data so yeah that's all stuff that
we're kind of looking at doing and maybe
Dave wants to chat a bit more I think we
had most of it there's a proposal and
the issues we try to keep up issueless
pretty pretty small and tackle them
quickly so the ones that are still open
are
so things that are discussions and
features there's warning for making the
API its reactive which is what Eric says
you basically do a find and then you
subscribe to it and you always get when
something happened or create or remove
or something
your list is going to be readmitted so
that works really nice with a lot of
things friend here from Vancouver wrote
yoke which is a reactive library like
react but with actual rxjs screens so
there's some things that can be done
really really nicely for that and once
that I've been playing with that
yesterday a little more so um it's
pretty fun and it works really well too
and based on that it's actually not that
much of a step from there to go into a
graph QL graph and looking oh somebody
created a new user looking at the query
and then inserting the user in the graph
where where it belongs right so there's
because of how this is all set up I
think we can do something that might not
be as powerful but at least lets you
have a real like a reactive rack you out
query so when something happens and
feathers it'll update the graph for you
that's neat but it also needs class
graphical support we've been talking
about that a little bit actually because
um it's schema definitions across
different databases or kind of hard and
one thing I think graph killed as well
is defining schemas and associations so
there's a lot of nice synergy did I use
that word right marketing word shit did
I did a lot of good there's a lot of
good things that we can do combining
those and building on top of that so it
wasn't just because we wanted to do the
same thing we've been like playing with
that idea even before meteor announced
qualifier project but I I think it's
going to be kind of similar except for
that it sits on top of with feathers API
so it's gonna be interesting I'm excited
to see more about it
very cool do you guys have like an ETA
of when next I did new stuffs gonna be
coming out because like he said it's an
arms race yeah I don't know no with that
funding we could do it but unfortunately
that's nowhere at I don't know even
reactive API so I'm hoping like
hopefully we can get the prototype out
pretty quick like with them next week
good we've been playing a little bit for
a while and it's just a couple of tricky
things to figure out that probably
should be polished before you let people
try it even though it's still an alpha
version so that's going to be pretty
quick the graph QL stuff needs some more
discussion because there's people with
other ideas saying you know what about
Jason API or swagger which is aa similar
problem when it comes to the definition
of a schema right so um and we don't
want to be just like dictate on this is
how this is going to be done right
exactly
okay flexible but I think that scale
would be some worth exploring Wow very
cool so it sounds like some pretty big
changes and you guys one of the big
polls is the flexibility that you guys
have and what you were just mentioning
doing graph QL or reactive graph QL and
being like okay this is like the way to
go you might not want to do that so
that's interesting there's a huge
conversation to have around that Terry
did you want to mention anything more
about we just try and be careful not to
we move really quick but I think the
reason we're able to move so quick is
because we're leveraging a lot of other
people's project like not a code that
we're writing I got even say in the last
three months if I spent more time
writing and updating documentation and
and and answering questions that I did
writing code like authentication was a
pretty big piece that I did a lot of
work on the last little while but we
really didn't touch
and so I think it's kind of gonna be the
same thing graph QL and the reactive
stuff will be kind of similar like we
spend more time kind of thinking and
kind of prototyping some of it then the
amount of code that actually goes into
it but the big thing for us to is also
making sure that everything is optional
or as optional as it can be right so
even the stuff that we talked about off
blog tailing you know you shouldn't have
that baked in by default like most
people don't need that some people don't
even want that because that exposes your
your database to to risk right if you've
got it behind you know if you got it
exposed publicly like you might not want
to have all clogged tailing you might
not want it for performance reasons as
well so I think having all that stuff
optional and be the same thing the craft
QL like you don't have to use you know
graph QL you'd have other alternatives
if you wanted to roll them yourself you
could or you know at least fallback to
the wave feathers is right now and
that's the thing that is maybe most
interesting and exciting to me looking
at feathers is that like you guys are
using passports yes and you know I've
mentioned before Express and you know
when I take a look at meteor on the
other hand like they're using connect
you know they're using they've got node
wrapped in fibers which is you know left
us at this point where we're still on Oh
10 whatever 43 or whatever the latest
version is which is kind of we're kind
of lagging way behind now because
there's all this code that they've
written that they have to support it
wasn't necessarily standards-based or
there weren't good options there
necessarily right back when they sort of
meteor connect kind of was the standard
and now Express has kind of superseded
it which is interesting but at the same
time now they have a huge base of kind
of legacy clients almost which is funny
to say and I guess in JavaScript LAN
like oh you're two years old that's
totally a legacy but yeah I definitely
think like even now people are clamoring
for like Oh web pack support or hot
module swapping or any of that kind of
stuff and it's not super easy to do a
meteor because they've written their own
build tool and everything like that so
it's it's a good point and it kind of
brings up to me like what what's it look
like like can you easily add web packs
and feathers yeah absolutely
we're because we're completely front-end
agnostic I mean we let people choose
their build tools for that reason it's
funny like when I kind of going back a
bit to we were talking about with fibers
and meteor being stuck on node 10 I okay
I was super excited when I saw meteor
quite a few years ago and I was like
geez this is amazing like these guys are
just gonna kill it and it's crazy that
they raised so much money like I thought
from a business perspective that was a
really interesting play but it for them
the ability to do some really awesome
stuff and I remember I started playing
with it a little bit and then I dug into
a bit of the code my saw they were doing
stuff with fibers and there was a big
debate about that shit on on like the
node.js Google Groups when it was back
then and that was actually a big
turn-off for me like that and the fact
that they weren't using NPM and so it
took me quite a while to actually come
back to meteor like until the last six
months maybe and I came back and built a
couple quick apps on meteor just to kind
of see what they're doing and see if we
were doing anything that was a little
bit different or or better and yeah I
think that's I'd be curious to talk with
some of those guys off the record like
if if they feel like that was a like did
they make that choice intentionally
because of the funding or did they make
that choice just because they made the
choice and thought it was the best
architectural one at the time and be
really interesting to hear you know a
bit of a story on like how because it's
easy to to hypothesize but it'd be
curious to know like how the funding is
actually implement affected their their
culture some
architectural decisions from an
outsider's perspective when I look at it
out I go like well maybe they were
forced to to you know to try and have
some more proprietary IP right or
something and the way that we've really
tried to approach it because we don't
have that is like we have to leverage as
much of other people's stuff as possible
there's no way we'd be able to maintain
all that stuff ourselves like it's not
possible yeah I think that's a more
recent change that's maybe happened at
MDG I think that to me having been in
the community for two or three years it
feels more like almost a not invented
here syndrome you know like we didn't
build that so we don't know if we can
trust that and therefore we'll go build
our own thing because I mean if you look
react has been around almost as long so
for them to come back around and settle
on it now is interesting I mean granted
it was pretty pretty early on back when
they you know that's not fair either
because I mean blaze was almost a year
and a half two years ago now so I mean
react was certainly further along and
they could have made that choice to
leverage someone else's work or even
vue.js right like they hired the view
Jas guy like why is that not a big thing
immediately and so I think it affects
decision-making to like what you were
mentioning err click they did raise a
huge incur money so now you got
resources available and like that
affects how you make decisions then
feathers is like you guys are scrappy
you guys are you guys just like put like
you're like okay what do we have
available to us what's to the community
okay how can we leverage that and like
put together quickly so it's a different
decision process to go through it and
like hearing you talk about that and how
you're leveraging other work and all
that I I'm curious to hear what you guys
are thinking about like the recent drama
that went down was expressed and if you
guys are concerned in any way that that
was kind of like settle down and in
effect feathers in a negative way
yeah definitely yeah I mean to be
pointed definitely I mean we've stated
I'd say Dave and I like we stayed pretty
with feathers you know we did a push and
now we've gotten a little bit more
attention which is nice and also tough
at the same time because we're finding
that we're having to spend more time
answering questions and and in doing
podcasts no well I used to have
discussions with you guys especially
after watching the other one we got to
see kind of how you approach stuff and
this is a great way for us to kind of
answer a lot of the questions that
people have been hitting us with in in
slack as well so hopefully we'll be able
to kind of push this out and people be
able to go okay these guys aren't just
full of shit but yeah I think the stuff
with express is really like open source
is just such an interesting space in
general from business perspective it
gets really messy or can be really messy
and with express I mean we are relying
on it but actually one of the things
that we have slated for v3 is to become
agnostic so even the engine underneath
we're looking at becoming agnostic so
that you could use Express if you want
especially if you're already on an
existing Express system or Express app
you can start you know incrementally
rolling over to a feathers app without
having to completely rewrite and that's
stuff that we have done with with
clients before but the other the other
one is Khoa comes up you know what
generator support so being able to use
coal underneath or even individual
modules because really all that Express
is doing for us is content negotiation
and routing mainly right you know
there's some niceties in there but
that's primarily what it's doing
underneath because Express actually is
just a grouping of small modules now too
so that's kind of where we'd like to get
to that's super interesting
so one thing is that wasn't actually
just a knee-jerk reaction to be
expressed drama we were talking about
that before and after we had this PR
land for making it work on the client
realized that well in reality if you've
caused in color on the client it
basically has like an if Express
placeholder instead of expressed so you
have some of the get and set API but
it's like 50 lines of code that just
exposes some of the methods from Express
so we could do the same thing and use a
different framework underneath so that's
where that proposal came from so I think
that that flexibility it's going to be
helpful I personally don't think that
Express is going to like go away anytime
soon and even even the exposure and what
the community talks about is extremely
different sometimes to was actually used
so if you look at Cora as like I think a
hundred thousand downloads on NPM a
month and experice has 25 million so
there's still quite a difference in the
number of people talking about it and
the number of people actually using it
right so I honestly don't think if it's
going to go away anytime soon so we want
to want to keep the options open because
the spirit is that it's flexible and
modular but not because we're afraid
said what we build it on is going to
fall apart makes sense
keeps you guys flexible for whatever
comes next after that even so that's
cool that is like major architectural
decisions that will help you stay like
going forward whereas a lot of libraries
end up game like pretty heavy and bogged
down going forward so that's pretty neat
to hear that I'm curious I want to
circle back because throughout the whole
conversation up to this point it kind of
sprinkled in like the things that make
you guys unique which is the resources
that are available to you how you guys
approach other open source libraries and
you guys are talking about how 2.0 at
the very beginning it was focused more
like
yeah we're like a push on branding
document a big documentation push and
all that stuff I want to hear from you
like you guys what what do you guys see
as your unique selling proposition like
if I was gonna be a marketer out there
because you did say early on you
compared what you guys are doing to make
sure that was even relevant
compared to what else was going on so I
think you're asking what what are there
synergies just just kidding man giant
developer block cat yeah I guess I'll
step in so I mean we put together on the
under still Canada right now it's on the
docs inside of why feathers we put a
little thing that has a feature
comparison table but also uh we tried to
put a fairly you know as best as we
could an objective comparison between
some of the the common frameworks or
more common frameworks out there and
kind of how feathers is different
there's a lot of overlap I mean you know
we won't kind of beat around it there's
quite a quite a bit of overlap between
we know what feathers provides and what
firebase provides and what parse does
meteor sales and and Derby I think the
biggest thing that I've noticed is like
well one how modular we are that's a
real big one the bigger one for me is
that like I said we like to you know on
the definition could be debated but we
like to say that we're service-oriented
right and like I said the original goal
was to be able to move from a monolith a
gap to services or micro services fairly
easily and the that's really more of an
architectural concern but I think our
that's how we kind of get around it is
just how your code is structured but
also the
composition of hooks and services like
that was what Dave did his thesis on and
that's that's a super-powerful
architectural pattern that keeps things
super flexible but also really
consistent and I think that's probably
the biggest the biggest difference you
know from a feature or from a marketing
or feature perspective that's definitely
what we we tried to focus on I guess
another big one like meteor is probably
the only one other than us now that
supports bi-directional socket
communication like you can do it with
the other frameworks but you have to
implement some stuff with feathers and
meteor like feed your meteor I think
calls it da P right but you can send
data over sockets as well as just as
receive notifications and that's the
same thing you can do with feathers and
then I guess lastly would be like the
database support like you mentioned
before because we wrap some existing ORM
and because we've implemented some
service adaptors ourselves you know
that's probably a pretty big
differentiator there especially for
people coming from meteor we so you're
not necessarily locked into Mongo I
think for feathers too though that's
probably the the big differentiator some
of the stuff that we have coming for
feathers 3 I think that'll be really
where we start to set ourselves a bit
more apart from other people hated oh
yeah I forgot all the time you spent key
buggin yeah and you know I guess I spent
a lot of my time doing react native
stuff so feathers plays really well with
reacting react native the service
pattern mates really well with angular 1
as well angular 2 is kind of still alpha
beta ish but angular 1 it it actually
works really really well
with react native like you know there's
some hacks there's even one that kind of
got broken recently with the version of
beta 2 era with react native version 22
but we spend quite a time trying to see
how you could get sockets like sake oh
and Primus working in in reactive it's
luck that ILO has a little bit of a bug
where they require the Navigator to be
there and makes it hard to debug then
react native because they put their
other console and a web worker which
doesn't have the navigator so anyway
this is an open issue on socket for that
but I think those are that's another big
one is that we support react native
really well out of the box and and it's
super easy to do to build mobile apps
now which is nice yeah I still think
that's kind of the Dark Horse feature of
meteor was when they added the cordova
support and you know now you look at any
like e cordova support like react native
would have been ten times better
everybody
maybe that's harder to predict that's
one of those things you know even a
meteor it was like we could we could
maybe do that and they did in like a
little point release like yeah you can
add platforms about maybe trying out the
react native stuff it's pretty sweet
I mean like we're obviously biased but
and like regardless of whether you love
feathers and not like right now in react
native land it's the easiest way to get
authentication going with a back-end
like hands down it's the easiest way and
I think I think I saw something that
somebody had done meteor DDP for react
native as well so there might be the
ability to do it with meteor too but
yeah that's that's something we're
putting a pretty big emphasis on because
for a couple of us that's where we spend
more of our our fun time and where we're
focusing some of our consulting effort
is around yeah
like that square very cool so talking
about consulting that that goes to my
next question which is maintainability
and you know people are gonna be
depending on feathers jas if you guys
really push it which is what you guys
are doing a great job doing build a
community around it all sudden like
there are gonna be larger apps being
built around it there are going to be
consulting firms like adopting this and
really wanting to drive it forward how
are you guys structuring yourself so
that you guys will be able to maintain
this going forward into the future like
financially and with time and everything
yeah that's totally a fair question I
mean that was also what at least
definitely for me weighed in in in the
decision and kind of november/december
on whether we were actually gonna push
this forward or whether we were gonna
just keep it as a kind of a side thing
so I mean we're we're very invested in
it it's kind of it's something we've
talked about a ton in terms of you know
at some point how do you make money on
open-source or how do you make money
supporting an open-source thing and so
whether that's just consulting ourselves
which is kind of what we've been doing
currently but I think ultimately for us
a lot of the guys in the core team are
product people and so we're looking at
taking a bit more of a 37signals ish
model where we have built a product or a
series of products that are built on top
of this technology and then I think you
know whenever you have a business
involved in an open-source project it's
in this unit of a longer discussion but
it there's risk that it pollutes the the
project right yes
we're also trying to be really sensitive
to that in it sure look like if we built
a product on top of feathers and we need
something in feathers in order to push
that product forward I think it's fair
to say that that that probably should
make its way in that being said though
we're also trying to be very sensitive
you other people's concerns and other
people's
stuff if they're depending on feathers
as well so I mean I guess to cut it
short like you know we're very invested
in feathers we've made the decision to
actually follow through with it and I
had a post on media medium maybe a
couple months back unlit if you
I feel like open-source has really
changed and that people now have been
trying to use it as I didn't hear that
last bit you kind of say that as a way
to get notoriety or as a way to like s
their career progress you know whatever
and I think if personally if you make
that conscious decision to try and push
something out then you now and I could
be argued but now you kind of owe it to
the community to give them at least a
very long heads up like a fair warning
that hey I can't support this or you
know I need contributors or I'm willing
to support it until till acts like you
need to treat it like a product and I
think that's really you know coming down
with the marketing push with all this
stuff that we've done we really tried to
look at our open source project with
feathers like a product that makes sense
because I go into your site you see it
like there's a link for training that
opens up straight to an email so it
would assume like consulting and then
there's like there's a higher Russ link
so that's part of your guys's push to
like to drive it as as a product right
or at least for a way to to acquire
customers yeah definitely I mean it's
kind of funny we put those those links
in there thinking that nobody would
click on them and we a couple of us come
from startup space so we're used to
tracking metrics and like monitoring
that stuff so your monitor I was looking
at and going like holy shit there's
actually quite a few people that clicked
on that stuff we should probably do a
bit more in that area you know weren't
really thinking that anybody would click
it so we didn't invest putting any time
into like a branding page or even
linking back to the consulting site we
thought well I'll just put something in
there and see if anybody hits on it and
it seems like some people are interested
so
um yeah I mean like if you're looking
for consulting work you can contact us
and we'd be more than willing to to see
if there's something that works out but
yeah I don't think people should be
right they shouldn't be afraid of of
adopting feathers for fear that it's
going to go away because we're putting a
lot of our livelihood into it and
there's always risk when you when you
accept or transition to a new technology
but I think the fact that we are a thin
wrapper overtop of Express and Express
has been around for a long time a lot of
the existing libraries that we're using
like Passport they've been around for
quite a while are very popular and
they've been maintained for quite a
while but you know feathers itself
really I hate to say it isn't isn't
doing that much other than giving you a
nice architectural pattern to follow so
it's pretty safe bet I think that's what
it sounds like
yeah so continually plan wise to because
there are so many small modules right
it's really easy for people to take
ownership and we have people transfer
modules to the main organization already
which was really which was awesome to
see and when a module is just 200 lines
of code it's much easier to you know
give ownership or share ownership with
people versus you have this giant thing
that somebody has to make sense of so
we're hoping that that is going to help
to make it easier to contribute and from
what we've found so far and launch
deputy wise to write is easy
maybe make it easier to contribute
obviously there's more of a contingency
plan from the contributors and we've
already found that there were with some
great contributions just because we had
to make it quick and easy for ourselves
to get out new releases and get up up
and running quickly so I'm hoping that
that part of the strategy also works out
that's awesome people come from meteor
totally understand that making it easy
to contribute well guys it's been super
great talking with you guys everyone
who's listening
check out Eric and Dave on Twitter go to
go to Ikea hub check out photos j/s also
go to feathers Jas calm
the documentation I am so impressed with
the documentation and when Eric was
mentioning that they did a big push on
documentation like no joke it is super
easy to get going with feathers and it's
almost like tutorial level a grade where
where it's gonna be walking you through
everything and I think that it's really
neat and required from feathers because
they do tie in with a bunch of other
technologies and libraries and open
source thank you guys very much wrapping
it up and we can't forget it we got to
do pics for the week yeah I'll start off
because that I was like nice night I
stole your thunder last time so well I
don't even know what the pic I I totally
forgot last time yes I stole your house
of cards last time oh my gosh uh talking
about house of cards
everyone's been Ben watt binge watching
it and I was still like in season one Oh
forever and I finally got to season two
episode 1 that that's huge that's huge
that there was a subway situation guys
yeah I need to remind you oh my gosh
that was a crazy scene oh I can't wait
to watch episode 2 that anyway but my
pick of the week is this cool thing from
Garmin the Garmin Bebo I don't know
what's this called the vivosmart a chart
with the rate monitor on it so totally
cool I like it I've been I've been
wanting to get like a heart rate monitor
for a while Fitbit HR I heard kind of
stunk with a with the heart rate Apple
watch just I've known people that they
returned Apple watch just because they
just aren't it's not what they expected
and so I didn't want to make the
investment yeah and wait for the next
version I have been super impressed with
this thing super impressed offer the
price 150 bucks
heart rate it's awesome and it has a
broadcast mode so I can like hack hack
to get my heart rate and like do cool
stuff with it
whoops
tooth and mobile half side bill anyway
that that's my pickup love it go buy it
I get I get a dollar for every everyone
that's bought in the next month maybe
I'll jump in because I'm following suit
a little bit so I think along that line
the fitness stuff like I've been finding
it very hard to stay motivated all the
time so I got my bike you probably can't
see it I'll see if I can show so I have
my bike set up on a trainer here in my
office I basically just don't leave my
office anymore
my family misses me a lot but I've been
I saw the Fitbit blaze and I was like
Nana that one actually looks pretty
sweet the new one that just came out but
another pick for me is I think I'm gonna
end up getting the wahoo fitness trainer
for my bike which basically allows me to
take the wheel off and it's got power
resistance and stuff like that I got a
bunch of the other wahoo sensors and
their paces so definitely recommend
their product very cool very cool
Dave yeah so that's probably something
totally different
I liked dark music and I grew up in
Europe and your your bass is known for
gigantic alternative festivals luckily I
found the Canadian version of it which
is sometimes even better because you get
to see the bands that I've seen with
15,000 other people in that little bar
my favorite bar with 500 people and hang
out with them over the weekend they were
doing announcements for this week for
this year sorry
it's a terminus festival Tom and if it's
awesome every year it's like keep
discovering new music there's a lot of
small artists and big artists coming in
and just having a good time
it's moreover they called it industrial
stuff on my camp so I'm really looking
forward to that it's going to be it's
going to be a good time and if you are
American you can pretty much get there
for free because the exchange rate is
pretty firm half
great oh my gosh seriously yeah that's
funny all right so we're all done with
pics let's go
yeah my my pic it's gonna be the new
audio and video equipment setup so after
we had the we did the crater podcast I
had the crackling robotic mic problem
and then we did a space dojo show on Elm
and I had to use the iMac mic which was
subpar I went out and got a Telefunken
Telefunken mic and pop filter and I've
got a new c920 webcam which is a little
whiter and now you can can really see
that teal behind me so that's my pic
like I like if you're gonna do something
a lot of spend a lot of time doing
something you should probably invest in
and good tools to do it with so that's
what I did this week I have 100% agree
100% agree actually I'm gonna a shit
even thought cuz I'm wearing them I've
got this was absurd like these cost me
so much money but they Sennheiser
momentum wireless headphones and I'm in
the same boat like I use my headphones
all day much all the time like if you're
gonna be using stuff every day you
should invest in good stuff it makes you
feel good makes you more productive so
