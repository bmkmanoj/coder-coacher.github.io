host josh owens along with my co-hosts
who can go first Ben Strahan number one
yeah I'm a numero dos Ramsey linea yes
cool guys and we have our special guest
with us this week Richard Feldman
welcome Richard good to be you yeah
Richard hey MA you work for no red ink
which is a company that specializes in
something what is that we make grammar
and writing software from English
teachers so middle school high school
primarily nice uh but you guys you also
do uh like you primarily use Elm right
yeah for the front end so it was just
normal ruby on rails on the back end we
got into Elm about this way I guess
eight months ago ish um eight or nine
months and and so now all of our new
front and stuff is an elm and to be
honest we pretty much update our old
react code rewrite an elm at every
opportunity but it's still like a
minority of our code base because like
react at coffee script and stuff had
like a three year head start but it's
been going really really well nice so
I'm actually not super familiar with elm
so could you maybe give us like a little
history on what it is and why it exists
I guess yeah sure so basically Elm is a
functional programming language that
compiles the JavaScript and the main
motivation was the the Creator Evan
chaliki he actually just gave a keynote
where he laid out a little bit of this
at that erlang factory yesterday in San
Francisco and he basically had some sort
of pain points getting into JavaScript
and he was thinking about you know I had
some of this work that I did on on his
thesis in at Harvard about some like
functional reactive programming stuff
and he was like I bet I can make this a
nicer experience so he kind of sat down
designs of stuff and after quite a few
years of evolution ended up with elm and
so I came into a much later the game
it's uh it's basically the problem that
it solves is maintainability it makes it
way easier to maintain applications and
the best statistic I can give for that
is that we've been using in production
for like eight or nine months and we've
had no runtime exceptions for my elko
not even one think a pilot just catches
them all and that's not because we have
a weird use case that's just normal like
yes it's theoretically possible to get
them like there are ways you can do it
you can either write something that
infinitely recursive till it blows the
stack you know some there are definitely
ways it can be done but it's just normal
for ell programs just to not crash
because the compiler catches all the
bugs ahead of time so that's what the
experience we've had stuffs way easier
to refactor it's just it's just a very
simple elegant language and I have a big
fan so is Elm essentially like if I can
correlate it with something and I know
I'm going to get this wrong so tell me
where I'm wrong but is it like react and
flux and mpm and i don't know like web
pack all into one and not webpack i
would say flow instead of web pack okay
okay because it has its own compiler and
like building and builder and all that
stuff so yeah absolutely okay so it's
all hid stuff in one mm-hmm okay so it's
super ambitious very ambitious okay Wow
and is there like any official support
by like some big players so so
previously um Prezi was the biggest
company I guess I guess Prezi is still
sort of the biggest company so they
hired Evan to work on it because they
they have this big legacy flash code
base and they were like okay so we know
we're not going to be on flash forever
because that's that much is clear but
they're like what do we want to go to
and like okay well obviously like html5
stuffs the future but they were like
well we talked a lot of other companies
and they all hit these maintainability
problems when they get like these really
big JavaScript code bases and actually
it's so Prezi start this conference
called em locker short for millions of
lines
code and that was the mas that was the
name of the conference because that was
kind of what they were concerned with
was like how do you you know what you
have such a big project how do you make
it all manageable and l was the solution
they ended up coming up what they said
this seems like the right solution and
so they actually just hired Emmett to
just keep working on l and that's where
you worked for like a year or so and
then we hired him because we've been
were smaller company the prezi like we
only have you know like a dozen or so
engineers whereas they have hundreds and
we basically have have made a sort of
because we're a smaller company we can
move faster we've made out like our
primary thrust whereas presidents just
using it like in a very minor capacity
relative they're all code base for us
it's like a very very big part of our
code base and part of the reason we
hired Evan was and again he just works
on help he doesn't work on our product
at all but part of the reason was just
for recruiting purposes we want it to be
like hey you know this is the type of
place you can come work and you know
we're hiring we've been hiring for a
while and just being able to say you get
to come work with the creator of this
amazing language you'd be surprised how
many people apply saying like hey I
heard Evans working there and I want to
work with people like that it's pretty
cool that's awesome and how long ago did
you guys hire Evan oh like a month or
two um oh wow okay so yeah yeah
relatively recent so we had in
production for like seven ish months
before we hired him mm-hmm pretty cool
and so like is your hopes coming through
coming true like it's kind of like early
to say but I am a witch hopes you said
you wanted developers to like come on
and like / to working with you guys just
because I've been most part of the team
and everything oh yeah absolutely
actually our most recent hire he
basically it's aaron vonderhaar he's the
creator of elba format which is uh if
you're good go format or go foamed and
some people call it uh ok so I'm seeing
a mix of yeses and noes so so
essentially go formats purpose is for
people to write go code there's you
always have these debates on teams like
okay should we use to space indentation
or force base 10
should we you know how where should new
lines go and so they eventually decided
let's just settle this let's just make a
tool that just formats your coat
according to a comic convention the idea
is like yes individual people have
different preferences but that will be
like overridden by how nice the tool is
because every time you save it'll just
format your coat and everybody will
follow the same thing um and so we were
like that seems like a great idea we
should have that too so Aaron wrote that
and so now we have it that's great so
every time I say it just makes my coat
look beautiful and and so everybody uses
it actually just had a meeting earlier
today about how we're going to go
through and take all of our old elm
files that haven't been run through all
four men just get them all up to speed
so that everything across our code base
uses it and we don't have to ever have
to have a debate about that stuff ever
again yeah that's pretty funny because
I've been on teams where people are like
like they actually force you to switch
editors and they're like we're all going
on this editor and we're gonna follow
these standards and everyone's gonna get
in line we're all gonna be a happy team
because we're not having any editor wars
or like you know I'm spacing or any of
that crap so that the editor things a
little bit weird to me because it seems
like well if you're using different
editors like you know if you're using
you know sublime and i'm using adam like
what's the what does that hurt me that
you're using a different one i guess the
only one way I could think is like four
pair programming because sometimes they
were repairing a lot yeah okay cuz then
you have like somebody uses like VIN
bindings then you keep having to press
crazy buttons I say being guy who uses
sublime with it bindings so guilty well
I mean you know pairing that's how I
learned them so I mean oh there we go
yeah I was on textmate and then paired
with someone and he was using vim and
I'm like I'll learn them and now he's
been and team wats all the time nice i
remember textmate yeah i keep going back
and forth between vim and sublime and
like sublime with vm integration it's
like I like sublimes like you I touches
better but vim has better bend
integration obviously and so I yeah I
actually just like switched back again
recently from The Oval but go back and
forth
funny I still have a dream weaver oh man
nice notch what did that be horrible oh
my god I would you know I Lincoln and
see if I get some recruiters yeah I
don't think you want those jobs nice of
like grudging respect if you did that I
do somebody who he used on nano and he
just he actually had it like tricked out
with syntax highlighting and everything
you just just yeah I'm gonna kill master
all right so I getting back to Elm so
you mentioned previously that I guess
most of the your code bases is reactive
that is that accurate yeah so can you
walk us through like the process of how
you started piecing out react components
without I i can give you a high-level
overview but we actually wrote a blog
post about not only how do we did it but
it walks you through doing it on the to
do NBC um flux repo so it's just like
you check it out and then it just walks
you through like ripping out a
store replacing it with L um yeah so the
short version what's your what's your
blog URL Oh tech liked eech no reading
calm cool and that that particular blog
post is called walkthrough introducing
l2a j/s web app um so one of the
interesting things about Elm is that
I've never actually seen another
language that does this but um so so
like I said one of those main you know
selling points is maintainability and
one of the ways that it is able to offer
that is because it has a much smaller
set of things to work with the
JavaScript so JavaScript there's like 10
different ways to do everything and
elders not there's a much smaller number
of ways you can do things and because of
that the compiler is able to make
certain guarantees because it can be
like oh you're doing this thing that
doesn't match up etc and and as a result
of that when you're interoperating with
JavaScript code um you know JavaScript
does have such a
bigger array of different ways to do
things and so the compiler can't you
know make those same guarantees about
JavaScript code that can about Ellen
code so when you're interoperating with
javascript it's not actually code
sharing it's actually just communication
so it's basically like you use the same
kind of techniques to talk to JavaScript
as you do to talk to a server like it's
just like sending data back and forth
and the difference is that instead of
going over the network it's just more of
a conceptual thing you're just like you
know talking to it quote unquote it this
way and so because of that what you end
up doing when you're like trying to take
out part of a piece of JavaScript code
and replace it with Ellen code is the
first thing you think about is like
where's my API boundary and so it's sort
of like a pub subsystem or else like hey
hey JavaScript I'm gonna broadcast these
events to you and I'm going to listen
for when you want to send events back to
me and so a flux store was actually a
really convenient place to introduce L
because flux stores already worked that
way they're just like broadcasting
changes whenever stuff changes and then
they're just like listening for changes
from the view and so we just basically
took one of our flux stores and we just
gutted all the methods and then had each
of them instead of like having business
logic they would just send an event over
2l or they would listen for a response
from Ellen that just passed that long to
react so we actually only ended up
changing one of our source files which
was just to take out all the
implementations and then replace them
with calls out to our own code so it's
not good wow that sounds that's awesome
so when them how is it set up I guess
it's watching files whenever you save a
file it be compiled is that yeah there's
different uh I mean that you know you
can use all your sort of normal tricks
if you're using it with web packet and
obviously just got your web pack watcher
there's a stand a little thing called
elm live it's on NPM so you can just do
npm install hg l dash live and basically
just yet it just watches your code
whenever something changes that
automatically recompile is it and if
you've got a browser where they're open
that
loads in the browser for you don't have
to go over and hit refresh very cool
very cool when I guess it works wits
like I don't know if this question is
even gonna make sense but like it does I
hot module replacement with web pack and
execs all that stuff still ah that's a
good question I actually don't know so I
actually wrote the original Elm webpack
loader but it was like very simple and a
number of people have like i just added
a bunch of maintainer zand they been
like adding more features I don't know
if that one works but so and like I said
naw reading or I think I said maybe I
didn't so I know everything we use some
ruby on rails for the back end and so we
don't actually have web pack yet we've
been working on migrating to it but so a
lot of the stuff that we have as far as
like compilation and building and stuff
like that has has to do with the rails
ecosystem and not the more standard web
pack browser if i type j/s deck very
cool so like if we're comparing a Elm to
a lot of other languages and the big
thing that that you say L Miz is great
at is like compiling and reducing errors
and everything um I imagine like that's
like the main elevator pitch when you're
comparing it to like angular and react
darling yes sir is that like the one big
thing or is there some other like things
in the Elm Ling that like kind of stand
out as superior as well um I mean this
is this a lot of little things I mean
the overall the experience is really
nice just because it's been sort of
designed from like a cleanroom
perspective like Evan basically didn't
sit down and say like how can I make
JavaScript better he was like how can i
make front-end development like a nice
experience hmm so part of that is those
that designed around like
maintainability what other partners just
like these really nice little details so
one example of this is the compiler
errors are just really really nice so
when you let's say you you're passing
something a record which is basically
like an object and you instead of
writing out phone number like it's like
it's this user
object n scott like it doesn't fields on
it instead of writing phone number you
write you like have a type one you say
like fo n number so the compiler area
you'll get like a JavaScript you would
eventually get like undefined it's not
function or so k because try to access
it would be there but an L not only will
you get at a compile-time error but
you'll actually tell you like hey uh you
were supposed to say phone number but
instead we had phone it'll actually
should like to show you a hint I can
literally say it looks like you have a
typo and it'll say like phone number
phone number so it tries to like help
you out as much as possible and give you
like the shortest path to fixing the
error possible so that's good i'm
compiling but like what about like after
compiling and you're debugging and the
browser and all stuff do you head do you
guys have any like debugging tools or
anything like that kind of like how
react some really nice dueling with
chrome um so there aren't like chrome
extensions for say so there's el reactor
which is the like time-traveling
debugger and that's kind of like the
original demo that honestly and
everything we don't really use that in
practice just because like typically if
you have something that you're where
you're running like and and you're
surprised about what's going on at
runtime no it's not so it's not usually
a crash it's usually just like oh my
steak Adam right place um but for that
perspective at that point because
because the way Elms design you you have
in the same way that Redux is you have
sort of a single state Adam so you can
pretty much just like spit that out of
the console and be like okay what was it
um and that's good enough for us we
haven't like wanted to go for anything
fancier than that i'm kind of like
excited by the prospect of some of the
like that i know some of the people
working on that project the
time-travelling debugger and l and
there's a lot of really exciting stuff
like on the horizon that just goes way
beyond debugging um but it's not out yet
so pretty much I think we're probably
just going to keep sticking with like
console logging stuff until that comes
out no cuz yeah so far that's been fine
we don't like to overcomplicate things
if we don't have to yeah as in along
with like over complicating things so
you're saying that one of the benefits
to elm is that it it you have like few
rounds
on how to accomplish something compare
script and like you seem really
satisfied with working with elm and so
sure it gets to answer this question but
the question is like have you come
across situations where it's like it's
really frustrating that like Elm doesn't
support something that that you want to
try to accomplish or or it's like a huge
work round to accomplish it yeah for
sure um I mean it's definitely like a
you know for one thing the helm
ecosystem is waste of all in the
JavaScript ecosystem like javascript is
so huge it's been around for so long
that you know if you got a particular
problem you could probably just like
google it and find somebody wrote you
know a modulus somewhere do to do that
that's just not the case oh they all
know just hasn't been around long right
um and I think people get into that
argument like to soon where you're
almost going to be like suppressing
innovation if you like you're trying to
compare apples to apples right away when
something new comes out so now oh yeah
yeah absolutely and I mean there's also
just kind of a you know it's a series of
trade-offs right so it's like the
problems I used to have this the
specific thing that made us say or I
guess made me say like we should really
give a real try was this project I
worked on that was like three months
long and it involves several redesigns
because we kept going out and trying it
the field and it just wasn't effective
like we would show with the students and
they just like work learning it really
okay this design must be bad let's go
back and redesign it and every time we
did that getting it back to an MVP
version where we could show it students
again um in theory that should have been
like some refactoring and just like some
you know making some changes but in
practice it was just so error-prone like
stuff just kept breaking and I was like
man I've been doing L on the side and I
know this like doesn't happen this is
like a very different experience where
you make a big change and you have to
move stuff around the like wires into
other things and I would just tells you
all that places you fixed and like
pretty much always once it compiles it
just works and I was like the exact
opposite experience I was getting here
and I was like okay after based on that
experience I can did the whole thing and
react and by the end of it I was like
alright let you know fool me twice shame
on me I know better than this
let's let's try on elm and see it what
it does for us and since then we've had
like really big ambitious projects that
have you know a ton of code ton is going
on and we were able to just make changes
to them and it's fine like it's not
arduous it's like you know we've always
had parts of our code base in the past
where we're like Oh Debbie we're gonna
make a change to that feature like
that's scary like I don't know what
that's going to do I don't know what
custom i can give you on that because
that's just going to be a giant
nightmare you have to try to that
without introducing progressions oh and
it's like you know we have tests on this
stuff but like the the problem with
making serious changes to hold code is
that you break all your tests you know
if you're making a small change and it's
like you just want to make sure that you
didn't you know mess up the logic
somehow the tester you know totally have
you covered um but when you're making
like serious design changes then you
have to throw out tests and suddenly all
bets are off but the own compiler
unfortunately it just like picks up the
slack there because it's not based on
your having to write stuff it just does
its job no matter what changes you made
um so now when we have our big pieces of
you know a big features that are done in
elm and we need to make changes do it
more just like yeah that's not
intimidating at all that'll be fine you
know your skews the estimate that's kind
of interesting you brought up tests like
what yeah what does that look like uh oh
and now I'm like what what were you guys
using before are you sticking with that
now I mean obviously like there's
probably some kind of integration with
rails that you're doing or cucumber or
something right yeah yeah yeah great
question um so our tests break down into
three categories so we have unit tests
and then we have integration tests on
karma and then we an integration tests
on capybara so the difference between 23
is basically a unit tests are by far the
fastest to run previously we were using
jasmine and mocha for that and now for
ellen tests there's a unit test protocol
LMK test you may notice a convention
here this which is that and it's very
intentional is that Elm likes to have
its tools named after what they do so
you have like Elton test which is for
tests you have el package which is for
your package manager at revel and stuff
like that
so uh oh yeah and then we can sort of
like Jasmine for a mocha for JavaScript
unit tests um and then so our
integration tests karma is like you know
just brings up a headless phantom vs
instance and runs your tests with actual
stimulated clicks and stuff but doesn't
actually touch the database and then
capybara actually is like completely and
setting up database like actually
mocking out you know saving things and
recording things and so forth so we are
integration tests and and like
end-to-end tests have been totally the
same we haven't changed our karma or or
candy bar stuff it's just the unit tests
which obviously uh you know we use el
test instead of jasmine or mocha 19 so
maybe we can let's take a step back a
little bit and maybe people who aren't
aren't definitely with functional
programming can you talk a little bit
about what makes em so maintainable like
why functional programming is a good
thing and then maybe talk about like
composition and and all the good stuff
that comes with the functional program
sure yeah um so I should mention that
I'm not like a big like functional
programming zealot by any stretch I'm a
very practical guy like I just like
building stuff and what drew me to L was
not like you know I don't want to like
apply my knowledge of category theory
which is zero you know somewhere it's
very much the opposite it's more like I
have these problems that I keep seeing
and you know as I've been building more
and more software over the years and I'm
like you know this this seems like it
might be a solution to them let's find
out it turned out the answer is yes um
so basically so okay a concrete example
of this is like um you have you're
running your application and all of a
sudden you notice that like your local
storage and I'm just going to use local
storage because it's kind of the
simplest example but they're like local
storage ended up with a crazy value and
you're like okay who did that likes one
of my functions like wrote something the
local storage that I wasn't expecting
and now local storage is
a bad state so the question is like who
did that and JavaScript the answer is
like literally any function right you
can just write like local storage dot
whatever equals whatever else and that's
just that's just going to happen right
when that line of code gets run on and
so you just basically have to like
search over your whole code base to try
and figure out where it happened or like
when you're debugging you have to step
through line by line until and just
watch it and see what when it changes um
so in contrast L basically the way Elm
does effects things like that is it's
always with a return value so like
JavaScript you sometimes you return a
promise and you're like okay so I'm
gonna return this promise and then I'll
chain them together with them and it'll
be great but as we all know that's not a
sort of it like something that helps you
with debugging because promises is just
an option it's not the only way it's
like one of many possible ways so you
could have synchronous rights via local
storage you could have a sync via call
back or you can have a cig via promise
you can mix and match however you want
it's just up to the API off whereas an L
you only have one way of doing those and
it's always through return value it's
called a task and so a task basically
works like a promise except that I like
similar to a call back when you
instantiate a task it doesn't do
anything right away so it's like a
promise and that you can chain them
together and it's got this built-in idea
of error handling with like you have
either the success or the error case but
that's the only way to do it's like the
only game in town in the entire L
languages is a task or something like
this so all the api's are written in
terms of this which means that if you're
looking at a given function you're like
ok did this function touch local storage
all you have to figure out is like what
is this function return so if this
function is like returning a user object
you're like no could not have possibly
touched local storage because it has to
return a task if it's going to touch you
know any of this stuff it's going to
touch local storage at all um look at
another function you're like oh what is
this function doing and you're like this
function returns a task but I noticed
that the the error type of that task is
like an HTTP error which tells you oh
this function is only talking to the
network it's only doing Ajax stuff is
not touching local storage either and
furthermore you know
that each of those functions all the
functions that they are calling could be
to blame either because all they can do
is return stuff so based on this you can
just immediately rule out like entire
enormous chunks of your code base as the
potential culprit for this bug because
just by looking at what they return and
the only reason that you're able to do
that is that Elm has this guarantee
across everything good like this is the
only way to do it you can only do it
this one nice way and nobody else is
allowed to break the rules and do
anything else because the compiler will
guaranteed nobody else is breaking the
rules that's a house a very thorough
great example thank you cool yeah I mean
it was it was impressive Thanks okay so
I have another question oh so I'm I'm a
front-end developer by trade and so like
I do a lot of front-end animation and
stuff so he's like a lot of you know
third-party intervention libraries
whatever how like how how easy is it to
integrate that type of stuff in town ya
like like jQuery plugins you know like
d3 like stuff day like people really
rely on yeah okay so um I can speak to a
couple things I can't unfortunately give
you like firsthand experience on
animation because I basically don't do
much of it I know that Elm has like
somebody has written on some like
elevation libraries with like
interpolation and stuff like that but I
haven't personally used them so I can't
really say what the experience is like
they're um as far as third-party stuff
so we actually use a jquery datepicker
on one of our most complicated like lu
eyes and again it's using that same
method that i mentioned earlier of like
sort of the client quote-unquote
client-server communication model so
basically like user clicks in the box we
send out a request to sort of JavaScript
land and say hey bring up that jQuery
date picker it shows up user clicks on a
date you know we have an event handler
on that and then we say oh we got the
result now we know what date it is send
that back to hell and then that's it
it's basically like that page is like
ninety-nine percent elm and then just
like one you know like
the lines of JavaScript talk to our
jquery plugin and what's funny about
that is that like we're like we hate
that thing so much because all the bugs
on that page of that jQuery datepicker
like the elder stuff is always totally
fine but then like whenever we have
something you know like blow up on that
page as always because that date picker
and we're always like we should just
rewrite an element like now we can't be
right at the picker and he'll come on
that's ridiculous nobody does that but
we're always like just just like on the
cusp of doing it every time we have a
problem with it but uh we still haven't
we're still using it in production like
that suit that's the same story with
like react like a very thank you i was
at like sprout social here in chicago
and we had a whole meetup conversation
just about to date picker and how they
didn't want to rewrite it and they just
like how to heck react to work with
jquery events melons up yeah and so that
does bring a good point is like um you
know has how easy is that and the answer
is that like it's definitely more work
to do that from elm than it would be
from javascript like in JavaScript you
can just like drop that sucker in and
just like call a function you're done on
an elm it's actually like you actually
have to like you know set up
communication between these two it's not
trivial so if you're if you're building
the type of application where you're
like mainly what we're going to do is
we're just going to grab like a dozen
off-the-shelf components and wire them
together like I'll be totally honest
like Elm is probably not the right tool
for that you know it's just going to be
like more work and you're not going to
get the benefit like Elm is really like
to get the benefits out of Elm it's
really like for the type of application
where you have like a big code base
that's written in house like you're
maintaining it over a long period of
time like that's really where it's good
mm-hmm now you guys have your own like
package manager right l does yeah okay
like would that be something where like
uh the extra code that you need to wrap
the jquery plugin with is that something
that could like end up on this package
manager um yes and no so like you can't
package up so before the show started
we're talking about atmosphere and and
how a thing that started happening on
atmosphere is that people would just
take an NPM module and just wrap it up
an atmosphere and then publish out an
atmosphere and how do brands like
explain what the problems that are you
imagine things get out of state there's
three exits like all this bad seats so
so actually the L package manager has a
rule which is that you're not allowed to
publish like JavaScript up there you
only allowed to publish code on the l
package manager so if you want to you
can publish something that says like hey
here is an API for talking this
particular JavaScript library but you
got to hook it up yourself so you as an
end user are responsible for hooking
that up and dealing with whatever the
packages but there's not going to be
code oh my gosh that's a potential to
get some like massive stack overflow
point son that's what I'm talkin about
also I'll tell you why that design
decision was made so one thing that's
true about the Elm package manager is
that semantic versioning is
automatically enforced across every
packager so what that means is if I make
a breaking change to my API like I say
like I delete something or I change the
waist like something arguments that
something takes and I try to publish
that without bumping the major version
number it will automatically detect that
and reject it and say no you have to
pump the major version of her because
you made a breaking change huh yeah yeah
I don't know many of them have something
has that yeah like honestly that that's
probably the the hardest thing like so
many people get that wrong yeah i mean i
remember one like there was a version of
underscore that came out and it was it
was quote-unquote a minor version bump
but it actually broke stuff and like a
lot of people were you know
understandably kind of surprised about
that to put it gently but yeah in
elements like you know if you make a
breaking api change like you have to
both the major version number and like
if you're adding stuff you have to pump
minor version up you can't call out a
patch release if it's adding new
functionality and again that's not only
is that automatically detected that you
can actually there's a command you can
repel packaged if and you give it a
package in two versions and it'll just
generate a diff with actual like pluses
and minus doesn't show you exactly what
chains are the API between us too hmm
it's obviously it can't they can't like
you know translate the implementation
into English or anything and be like oh
this function used to use this algorithm
now uses that algorithm but as far as
the actual AP items like it's very aware
of that and it's like very powerful what
it can do so I guess that's like so that
if you can't use like NPM packages or
like jQuery plugins in Elm packages and
that kind of like makes a lot of sense
one like your team says man let's
rewrite this thing an elm No okay okay
that makes it now opens basically just
like it's like let's make a really nice
ecosystem and let's like do whatever we
can to preserve that and so in a lot of
cases it's like well we could do the
expedient thing and make it so that like
those are permitted but now all of a
sudden you can no longer rely on this
guarantee that we have across the whole
packages because we all know NPM does
not enforce that so as soon as you're
like we can just bring this in and
include those in the ecosystem no longer
can you say across the whole ecosystem
that semantic versioning is guaranteed
that that's valuable to be away so like
not to be like one hundred percent
inclusive but instead like be able to
build a very opinionated and like
functionals I don't know a little word
that just comes my mind framework to be
that it's more functional both it just
thing is that it's actually not so much
like opinion in as it is like it's
really very much the case that like Elm
is driven by these guarantees and it's
so like okay if we we want to guarantee
this we want to guarantee that like
you're not going to get runtime
exceptions I guess except in these like
very unusual cases like we want to
guarantee the semantic versioning is
enforced everywhere things like that and
then from that it's like okay now with
these guarantees in place like what
solutions make sense and so the first
light red flag you can raise is it's
like oh we could go this way but that
would break one of our guarantees is
that worth it and a lot of cases the
answer is like well no I mean we've been
able to you know have this guarantee and
the only way we can keep it is if we
don't do this thing so let's not do this
so a lot of cases those you know those
questions of like should we allow this
should we allow that get answered very
quickly by like oh well if we do that
then all of a sudden semantic versioning
is out the window because NPM does the
for semantic versioning um so yeah I can
I can definitely see how if you're
coming at it you know not knowing about
like
the whole history of everything you know
it's like it seems like its opinionated
but a lot of case it's not really
opinion it's just like well there's only
one way we can do this and preserve all
the nice dear its use me what I have so
let's do that way so there is a way that
like you can like implement elm and like
bully screw it up by like messing up the
guarantees or are you saying like people
are protected by the Elm link itself
please guarantee yeah that's the thing
right it's like in JavaScript you can
mess all those things up and so the
question is like do we let people
intermingle JavaScript and elm in the
package manager and then the answer is
like well not if we want to go and have
all the guarantees but yeah the Elm
language does actually force all those
guarantees that's interesting so a good
point to know is like when you're when
you're adopting elm uh it's not that
you're going to be given up javascript
because yeah now you're going to be
totally interacting with it and using it
in your project like almost one hundred
percent yeah I mean it's more just a
question of like what fraction of your
time is spent writing l versus
JavaScript so like our front-end
programmers spend like 95 or 7 i'm
writing elm and then five percent
javascript unless you're like
specifically maintaining a legacy
feature where you're like okay i need to
make this one change and like i'm not
going to rewrite the whole thing at help
just to make that one change that you're
ridiculous but like for new stuff for
stuff that we've already converted over
to elements like yeah it's like
ninety-five percent element then maybe
this is one library where you're like oh
I can save myself a few hours of
implementation time I grab this library
off then p.m. or whatever then we'll
just grab it and you know talk to it
with element and move on very cool so
like with the state management that you
guys have an elm I assume like you guys
got something similar as to like react
component where you guys gotta take
things out and add into another project
pretty simply in yeah they're definitely
like some conceptual differences there
but like from an organizational
perspective you can definitely be like
yeah we're just going to like you know
take this here's all of our logic that
needs to happen related to that thing
and then like and go from there there
are some like implementation details
that like people kind of like have
various like it's pretty interesting
because like people have different like
preconceived notions about like where
things ought to go coming in on but I
and like just talking about those
guarantees like when you have the
guarantees you do it down it sort of
leads you like naturally to this one
particular architecture which is known
as the Elm architecture but it's like
it's kind of like a weird thing to take
credit for because like Evan Evan as
Evan put it he's like this is kind of
like the only real way to do it that
makes sense so it's not like we like
invented this like amazing new thing
it's like oh well if we want it to work
in a system and not blow away any of our
nice guarantees then like this is how
you do it well then people come in like
why did you choose to do it that way
it's like well I wasn't much of a choice
um but yeah but a long story short yet
so you can definitely package up your
logic and you know groupid at the
components and things like that the Elm
architecture basically describes how to
do that in a way that doesn't sacrifice
any of the guarantees of l that's weird
because now we're seeing like in
JavaScript land you like like redox in
particularly like explicitly cited the
Elm architecture is liked its
inspiration dan dan was like I came
across this thing called the Elm
architecture it seemed really cool so I
ran with it and so forth but uh it's
interesting to see because you know of
course in JavaScript you you have all
these different options that make sense
and there are lots of different ways
that you could do it which is of course
why there are lots of different you know
implementations that do things in
different ways whereas an element's
pretty much like this is the one
canonical one and and it's interesting
to see sort of the bleed over there
we're like you know the JavaScript
people are starting to take inspiration
from Elm actually other you're like it's
funny like ever since haven't started
posting like demo so like the error
messages and help that are really nice I
started seeing like similar things like
show up in other languages for the alike
Ellis let's do that it's pretty nice I'd
had to see like that's like been the
number one marketing thing for helm and
how I heard about it initially is
leaders in the JavaScript world are like
hey it's pretty neat what Elms going
yeah and then people are coming over to
it because of that because the
endorsement or just a little mentioned
trusting yeah I mean is what is right
it's hard not to try it and and like
walk away thinking like oh that's just
like whatever like
usually like you tried if you actually
build something whether you're like whoa
this was like very different than what
I'm used to and I kind of don't ever
want to go back yeah i mean that's
that's probably true like me with react
as well like i just said react like i
started about a month and a half ago and
i was like that was weird and now i'm
like why the hell would i do it any
other way yes I don't uses the same like
virtual Dom style rendering that react
us where you just like you just right up
and more specifically it uses the
stateless component style that came out
and react about 14 it's like that's all
L pass it's all stateless components
like you're just like View Function
taking what I need to do to rent like
the state that I need to do to render
this and then just return the Dom
structure that I want that's it yeah
that brings up something interesting too
because like I'm looking at this post I
keep hearing things about Elm native is
this like a thing yeah okay so this is
basically i was at reactive 2015 last
year and i was meeting up with like
andre stalls and aussie and like a
couple other people and um we kept
talking about how like one of the the
most common things that people were
asking at the conference is like does
elm have a react native story yet like
is there a way to compile elenco to
react native but i was like no no like
nobody's working on that and we kept
chatting about this and I think Aussie
was like he's like I bet I could just do
that like what if what if we just try it
out and so he and Andre got together
some weekend they just like put together
a proof of concept and totally worse so
they they put it up there like as far as
i understand it it's like very much not
ready for primetime yet it's like the
first proof of concept they put together
was just like a very like hello world
plus like a button you could press to
like change something on the screen
right but like since then it's been
getting more and more activity and like
yeah so I saw last week somebody else
tweeted that like they'd started using
it for something I was kind of like whoa
I didn't realize it was that far along
yet but I definitely have not used it
myself and I I also know basically
nothing about react native so I'm not
going to claim to to be up on that like
you'd have to ask one
but but it definitely seems like a cool
project nice yeah I have a question so
is there any difference to like using
CSS styling is is it pretty much like
the same as react or not it definitely
can be so um so the way we've been doing
a flowing time like you use SAS at the
riddick and and so we you know basically
just keep our style sheet separate on if
you want you can do inline styles react
I actually came up with a project
recently which is trying to get the best
of both worlds so it's called lcss and
it's a CSS preprocessor which means I
realized I just erased all of my
credibility as the same person because I
said it wrote a CSS preprocessor but I
did and and the motivation was basically
as like okay so it seems like the nice
things about inline styles are that one
I guess if there's a few things that
people who are like advocating for that
site on but but some of the things are
like you get to co-locate your styles
with your code and that you get to like
you know share like constants and things
like that like not only in your style
sheet but also with your view whereas if
you even with SAS like you don't really
have your sass variables like being
shared inside your code or they can like
reference each other um and so basically
I was like okay but what if we had
something like SAS except where the
language you're writing in is Elm
instead of like sasses language and so
it's still just spits out dot CSS files
but now that it's in the same language
you can actually like share code between
your style sheet and your view not for
logic but just for things like like
class names and things like that so
check it out so this is this is what it
does so basically you can say like here
is an enumeration of all of my classes
and all my IDs for this particular
component and then you use that those
same enumerated values like rather than
just raw strings you just like share
those actual constants between your view
and your style sheet which means that if
you're ever like oh I don't think i'm
using this
my lady work you can delete it and if
you are still using it somewhere else
compiler will break and tell you about
it it'll be like oh hey you're using
this thing that's like not referenced
anymore so now you can actually like
delete your styles with confidence and
be like oh I know that this isn't being
used anymore because the compiler would
have told me if it wasn't and what's
even cooler I didn't even think of this
originally when I started doing it but
another guy who Luke westview started on
by coming and working on the project
pointed out that hey it's the same
language so if you want you can just
like literally put your style for a
particular component like in the view
like right above the component right
just like have it in the same file but
just like run elves compiler on that
file to generate the JavaScript and then
run LMK CSS on the same file to generate
the CSS and like each of them is just
going to like see some other stuff that
doesn't care about like Elmo CSS doesn't
care about your view code but doesn't
matter it's not hurting I think that
it's in that file with it it's just
going to ignore it just you know about
CSS and advice rissa with the javascript
part um so now you can organize stuff
where you just have one file with like
here's my styles here's my view function
and they're just like right side by side
in the same language coexisting on we
actually have a proof of concept of that
um my coworker noah wrote this thing
that is basically like a generator um
for like Elm code that like deals with
client-server interactions so we have
these things called encoders and
decoders which basically take like JSON
and then wrap them up and whatever
representation you want to use
internally because a lot of times it's
like you don't just want to use like the
same exact thing that you got from the
server like just the raw JSON I pretty
much always you want to turn it into
something a little bit nicer to work
with and so he just wrote this thing
where you just get stiff like those like
CSS to SAS or SAS the CSS or whatever
like websites we're really just like
have on the left your like paste of JSON
in here and on the right it just
generates like a good starting point for
some like Elm code to like do the
decoder and encoder and stuff so you can
just copy paste in your code and just
like get a good starting point basically
to reduce you know like mechanical work
that would otherwise you like you want
that code to exist but you don't want to
have to write it all out by hand so then
you can just copy it in and just tweak
it anyway so for that project
he used Elm CSS in that style where it's
like using the stylus right there in
line with the View Function say it works
it's pretty gold and then along the way
I accidentally ended up implementing
post CSS in there too so like I had like
a namespace feature that I wanted to
implement and originally I just like
baked it in and I was like kind of
showing it to some people for a code of
you know like you realize that like
you've got this like representation of
like what your style sheet is going to
look like but if you just like expose
that then people could write you know
like an auto prefix or on top of that or
like a name spacer on top of that I was
like oh yeah you're right oops I guess I
accidentally implemented post CSS so
basically I ended up with like a CSS
preprocessor that is SAS plus post CSS
but written in elm and like you use L
code to write in it data is that like an
open source somewhere yes can I become /
Artie Feldman / l dash CSS awesome cool
does that actually generate it is
actually generates stuff with CSS files
or does it put them in line there yeah
generates dot CSS files and there's a
little like node-based CLI so you can
just like npm install hg m dash the SS
and then you can just like feed it the
files that are in a particular format
and it will spit out CSS files somebody
is working on a web pack lunar but I
don't think it's done yet cool well I
think that's that's all the time we had
I'm curious so like where do people go
to like learn el Oso the website is Elm
Lang org um I have not personally used
it because it's been a long time since I
needed a tutorial but I've heard really
good things about Ellen tutorial.org a
lot of people have said that that's like
the they had a lot of good success
getting through that and like it was
like a really good introduction to hell
also on our company blog if you want
just like a practical like I'm going to
build a thing at l on we have another
blog post that's called building a live
validated sign up for middle and it just
basically assumes 0l knowledge zero
functional programming knowledge
just like all you know is JavaScript if
you walk through that blog post by the
end of it you've built a liability to
sign up for like validates email address
and talks to get up to see if user names
available stuff like that um as it nice
awesome well thank you for coming on the
show Richard we don't have to be here
yeah this is why I'm i'ma like
immediately going to go check out like
literally right after that very cool
well I hope we have a one one other
thing I guess as you mentioned is just
that like there's a mailing list called
LM discuss like Elm dash discuss be
Google that like super super beginner
friendly um like you just like ask a
question on there and you're just like
hey I'm stuck on this or I don't
understand this I like within a
ridiculously short period of time
several responds with a responded like a
ridiculously nice answer at least that's
been my experience so recommend man wow
that's some good marketing there okay
guys let's do this let's test this out
so let's uh let's tour pics I don't
think we did them last time do we do oh
we totally forgot about him last time
yeah so normally what we do at the end
is just pick something that has may be
affected or change your life in some way
it could be it doesn't even have to do
with programming right like just
something that's pretty awesome so yeah
yeah like preferably something not to do
with programming so like we proved to
the world that we've gotten out hard
society and before we do our pics i do
want to say we now have a sponsor
digitalocean digitalocean spice racks
huh I'm a customer yeah yeah I'm a
customer two craters there uh yeah so if
you're interested check them out
digitalocean com you use the coupon code
crater 10 I believe it is and you'll get
a like a ten dollar credit so check them
out so pics who wants to go first
I mean this is lame but uh tom clancy's
the division just came out I'm a big
video gamer and it has been crossing my
productivity so I guess it's not like I
know it's really good though I love it
hey good game nice nice so also my kids
oh nice nice i like that also i have
offspring um uh yeah i'll say house of
cards like if we're talking about
productivity kill her just like that one
killed off even finished it uh no oh
we're still like I think we've got like
two episodes left yeah I'm like way
behind on client work so I've been
working every night but it's like every
other night I'm like there and we watch
like three episodes mo it's like I can't
do this anymore i'm like dreaming about
political stuff oh goodness and that's
boil it oh man i was actually gonna do
house of cards by Eddie's so I'll to do
like something else so like I'll buy
some time nice all right so I'm gonna
pick the book flex by ferret steinmetz
so it's I don't want to give any
spoilers away but it is video game
related or it turns out to be a little
bit later on on the basic premise of it
is that the idea that it's like modern
day times except that the one thing
that's different is if people get
sufficiently obsessed with a thing then
suddenly they develop these like magical
powers where they can like control that
thing or do things related to that thing
so just as a hypothetical let's say
you're really really obsessed with video
games that might give you powers such as
like you can make a medpac happen but
you can't just like summit as many med
pax's you want it has to appear in the
context of like a level like real life
rear like works to become a level where
you have to go find a bed back about
where it would be a video game level so
imagine a world where you have people
like with those types of powers and then
mayhem it's
it's very very interesting entertaining
like lots of lots of game jokes alike
nods to anyone who's into like video
gaming and nerd stuff very cool book
nice i'm gonna have to check that out
very cool that sounds really cool that
does sound really cool yeah it's a
sequel out now to called the flux so Oh
flux hmm yeah nothing to do with like
react to address it done uh I don't know
I'd had to say there's this thing that
wife and I were like just cracking up
like crazy we found a youtube channel
called bad lip reading Oh bad lip
syncing yes yes oh yeah I was leading
but it is like like voiceovers yeah my
gosh and we found the one like with Ted
Cruz and I just like if I met the guy in
person I knew him I would like imagine
that's that's who he is like it's like
so bad if you guys know what I'm talking
about yes totally I remember the first
time I saw that it was like a Rick Perry
video lip syncing that he's done a
McDonalds commercials too he does like
the NFL Donald's commercials where he'll
do the delivery yeah it's pretty funny
it's good stuff yeah YouTube's like
addicting I could see why I like date it
made they made like YouTube bread
because things are getting like pretty
good on it so no no we'll see ya like so
I think your kid maybe aren't quite old
enough but like I that's my kids are
either on youtube or minecraft and
that's it that's all that their life and
I had it kinda uses out now it's PBS
kids all the way yeah kids were getting
to like my oldest daughters almost five
inch one day she just well that's what
i'm thinking like I just overheard her
iPad and I was like uh huh it wasn't
like that be anything like yeah but uh
it was like okay no we had that problem
too but our daughters 11 and she she she
looked at some stuff she should have
been looking at and it turned out like I
don't even know that stuff was on
youtube so i was like shocking to me
no there's a youtube it hidden from
videos or what huh not watching Donald
Trump videos yes what your old would you
have to carpet-bomb dad but though
there's there's a good YouTube kids app
you should check out Ramsey and they let
ya this cream euros a little better I
guess just don't let your kids watch a
Skylander boy and girl channel don't
know what that is okay no product is
like my kids watch it and like all of a
sudden like all all craziness ensues in
my house and i'm just like i just know
it I just yell I just know what it is
I'm i turn off sky later boy and girl
right now yeah they do everything calms
down selling away just a warning all the
parents out there i'm showing my all
right guys thank you for this episode
really appreciate it Richard and who
knows maybe maybe you've got some meteor
converts that it could be writing at
home so I think so thanks for having me
yeah yeah alright tune in next time guys
alright take it easy bye ciao this video
