2016 welcome crater fans i'm your host
josh owens long with my co-host Bobbi I
her hey Abby how's it going it's pretty
good man i'm actually outside of the
starbucks right now oh nice because uh
you know I tum some family drama that
I'm taking care of the house back in my
hometown so not in LA today but it's
super hot here and there's no good
internet around here I'm like in the
desert were you so I'm in the inland
empire in pomona california but no one
will know where this is it's like a
small town I'm right in front of the
starbucks in front of a yoga studio
there's a bunch of girls walking out
which is cool but that's it nice nice
yeah we missed last week cuz I was out
of town and I had a similar problem i
was in nashville and like I could not
find stable internet to save my life
like I even went over to a starbucks for
a little while and it was still kind of
crappy internet so yeah I don't know man
it was I can do deployments from
starbucks that's for sure yeah yeah I
have to play yeah you need you know like
probably the coolest deployment system
I'm sure there's a lot of cool ones out
out there but the coolest one I've I've
heard of was Twitter they had one called
a murder and it was like it was a lake
it was a play so a group of crows is
called a murder of crows and so yeah cuz
they're birds and Twitter yeah anyway um
but they use bittorrent and so like they
would just put a release out and it
would be out there as bittorrent and
like seed onto a server and then like
all the other servers will pick it up
and install it and run it oh cool yeah
yeah yeah super cool so then you'd only
have to see the toilet long enough for
one server to get it and then you're
gonna go yeah that would work from
starbucks hey I think so alright a
murder in it so today we're going to
talk about meteor 1.4 and
be of course that's becoming a theme
like I noticed any time Mac is a talk he
just throws and Beyond hunt Olivia
Apollo query batching who's hiring
someone asked crater who's hiring and
automatically starting development apps
all right yes so I actually just
finished watching this and I thought it
was an interesting talk from Matt de
Burgh Alice at MDG he gave it for
whatever they call their their monthly
night thing now just Debbie a meteor
that it yeah uh yeah so it was it was an
interesting talk to me like I feel like
they've been dancing around this idea of
like working on Apollo for a while which
is interesting and you know the the
thing that they've not outright come out
and said is that you know they're there
they're basically abandoning the idea of
mini Mongo and my clients like caching
and that kind of stuff and in opening it
up to more databases instead they want
to pursue graph qol and paulo and i
think he basically said that in the long
term they see it being a complete
replacement for DDP so like yeah I'm
glad he said it and I think I knew it
was coming but at the same time like I
don't think it's gonna be a super
pleasant experience for everyone
involved you know yeah oh no once again
once again they make these announcements
and they say that they're they're
worrying about professional developers
you know they keep saying professional
developers mm-hmm really I don't I think
you have to have been in developing a
product like this for a couple years for
you to even have an opinion on what a
professional developer is like honest i
watch this and I was not I was not happy
with it because when i watched 1.3 and
beyond it was going to be so easy and
all that we already talked about this
before but
right like checkup or it's gonna be hard
for playing let me eat your app it's
gonna be hard yeah transitioning is
tough like so I think if you look at to
me like I've spent the last three years
understanding DDP and how it works and
how to scale it up for performance and
what are the security implications of it
like it's a little bit frustrating to
think that that that is going to be like
that knowledge is going to be all for
naught at some point and you should
really be looking at graph qol and like
I'm also glad that they've come out and
said this statement because you know
like I I am now not going to push anyone
towards like using DDP at this point
like i'll be looking at other solutions
for client applications in the long term
you know I I think you know I it's
interesting for you because you guys are
somewhat kind of entrenched with DDP now
aren't you yeah we're like slowly
digging ourselves out of the hole you
know GDP GDP didn't work out for us not
like I'm not the something success story
that everyone else has with how easy PDP
us because you know our our app was not
the right pic for me to year in the
first place you know i can say that now
because we've scaled out of our
beginning phase and now we're in this
intermediate where we going next phase
no its beginning DDP was great because
we had 50 users yeah like it was great
yeah no load bit not nothing you know
and I don't know the meteor too much
promises us these fancy new things and
it's going to be zero cost or a zero
effort but I realize that it's not even
true because they don't even know our
app they don't know what's kind of scale
yaar they don't understand the business
that we're trying to solve so how do
they know that it's going to be easy or
not I don't trust that anymore well I
mean I think the thing was Apollo is
that it'll be better right because now
I'm not tied to Mongo I'm not tied to
how things should specifically work like
there's trade-offs right and like it
came up at the end of the talk someone
said like they were talking about
breaking apart all the immediate 14 like
you're no longer going to have pinned
core packages like there could be an
update that comes out to blaze if
anyone's still using it and like you
could upgrade that version without
having to have a full media release and
there was a question at the end and
someone said like aren't there
trade-offs between having kind of like a
like a guaranteed release kit like
version that packages everything
together and it's been tested and
everyone knows that it works purses like
these piecemeal kind of updates that you
can pull in little by little it's kind
of interesting um and I think that you
know that's that's what we're
approaching here as well like that
there's going to be a trade-off when you
go to Apollo like you're not going to
get a lot of the automatic integration
that you got with you know meteor and
live query and mini Mongo and that kind
of thing like I think that you know the
biggest thing for me is the the account
system was the account system look like
and how do I handle lake and you know
and after doing this for three years
like I I think we've had this
conversation a few times like I just I'm
not sure like instant reactivity like
real-time reactivity matters all that
much anymore yeah you know they keep but
they keep preaching like community
standards and they said the excuse for
the way the media was built originally
because there was no standard right
that's not true that's not true because
there are a bunch of big companies
writing JavaScript before meteor existed
that used standards right maybe es6 and
if no do six modules those was not a
standard back then but AMD was totally a
standard and common jess was a standard
you know like I don't know no I can go
on this ranch for a long time but the
thing is like
I really feel a 1.4 and Beyond means oh
you're just coming to media right now
okay well one point from beyond is good
for you right what are people who saw
that one point two apps what about
people who have been updated to 1.2 or
even one point you like you literally
are going to crash other people's
businesses because they don't have the
dev resources to upgrade right they
don't have these resources to change
their infrastructure so potentially you
just like ruins on business as you keep
doing these things I don't know now it's
not it's not on them to do those things
but they don't have it a clear upgrade
path where's my upgrade path in 1.4 like
they haven't thought about it yet yeah
yes there's actually no upgrade path in
1.2 1.3 there's a freaking guide article
but what does that help what does that
help if I did all this package space
stuff where's my where's my guide how do
I get after this you know what if I what
if I have like what if I have a thousand
Global's and I in my app how do I get
out of that like I I think what this
indicates is that you should really like
not just rely on one technology stack
you should really just continue to
experiment and learn and play with
things and Prime Minister train um leak
this weekend I've got a client project
and I could choose to go with meteor or
like I just said screw it i'm gonna use
Apollo I'm gonna use Express and I'm
gonna use passport and I'm gonna not use
and wheeze react obviously um and I'm
not gonna bother to even try meteor for
this thing and uh you know see how it
goes so I can learn it because I need to
know for the future like if if graph qol
makes sense like I I may even play
around with relay you know so who knows
yeah um i think that uh it's not it's
better to have a knowledge of what's out
there don't be focused in one area like
i'm pretty sure this is gonna be the
basis of my talk for for me here camping
or
I need to get good topic yeah so good
yeah because like I've been through this
a couple times um wasn't really like
there was no particular reason I left
rails but it just didn't feel like the
right solution anymore and and so like I
was looking for for better things and
meteor looked interesting and I think
that you know I still stand behind if
you could load a nap and half the time
like that was worth something especially
rails felt like I could build things
faster than other platforms so but I
feel like that's disappearing so was
this problem in the rails committee when
rails for I think came out like people
rails for was a big change right yeah
yeah the rails three yeah but I remember
and rails for that the community members
behind it and the team behind it they
were getting people ready for it I
remember people getting ready they were
like hey rails 4 is gonna be a lot
different it's gonna be good but we're
gonna help you get there yeah I mean
well if you look at it like this entire
time that I've been in the meteor
community they just released rails 5
like this week so I mean there's like a
long psycho to get a new version out and
they play with ideas and oh yeah you
know the big the hard change is going
from rails to two rails three like there
were major shifts there and like that
what that was a super pain point for a
lot of people as a matter of fact like I
don't know what github is now but I
remember like the longest time like
rails form was coming out and github was
still on like rails 22 23 because like
they just had customized a lot of things
and just couldn't make the move at that
point so yeah it's tough it's tough it's
tough yeah yeah rant over okay let
legacy sucks yeah for the end of the
month is legacy right and JavaScript
Amelia especially yeah okay well that's
1.4 and beyond yeah yes let's talk about
Apollo this is all good it's all good
what's up with beyond the beyond card
okay so
people listen to the show I I think
couple shows going said Apollo is not
all ready for prime time or anything I
think after next week i will say you
should start using Apollo in production
because we are about to finish the three
critical features that would that would
make us on par with relay those features
being bash query which is we're going to
talk about right now a pagination like
out of the box you can page night data
and lastly uh who is a you know how do
we handle mutations how do we handle the
results of mutation right I mean let me
go into these things real quick so batch
wearing is the topic of the article
today and so imagine it is so like today
if you subscribe in media here if you
subscribe to different pieces of data
with two different subscriptions right
and you won Kang into a merge box
problem if you're like requiring
different fields or whatever but there's
no easy way to bundle those requests to
tomorrow go by taking the queries and
putting them together and say hey I want
this batch of data there is no there's
there's nothing like that today uh we
have to hire yourself Frank and to do
yourself exactly and yeah work pop we
build some you know bad batch processes
that queries but yeah that's one thing
so batch quarian comes in really really
nicely because all you get to do is you
set an option in your query and the
Apollo client itself will will
understand what queries are coming in
it'll babs them in one request and will
just send them to the graphical server
out of the box so it's up to you anyhow
and it's opt-in or opt-out so like it's
actually opt in so um you get to decide
if you want to do which is the best
thing you know it's we have more control
and all that the interesting thing about
this feature is it was a it was built by
the Apollo intern uh so this guy's an
intern he's he's very young his name's
David I think and he goes by Poincare on
github and he's been killing it for the
the project like he's been doing a lot
of great work and this is you know you
know one of the one of the things that
he shipped or his internship as great
code great quality I run reviewed it so
bad sprain is great I want to talk about
the other features to page a nation so
in media pages nation is a little tricky
i know sasha has an article about that
because there's different types of
pagination you can have right you can
have like your numbered pages infinite
scroll but like you know as your page
nating what if like data changes so like
you might have you know an item that was
on page two now it could be on page 3 as
well you know these little edge cases
with H&amp;amp;H day so what we are going to do
in in apollo is having a way to fetch
more data what you need to do instead of
like going by this like cajun a chain
rule we're gonna let the UI decide what
a page means in terms of like you know
visually but page nation and Apollo is
just going to be fetching more data and
you're going to either appended to a
list or prepend it so you get to decide
if you want to put the new data that
you're fetching in the front of the in
the list or the end so you can either go
backwards or forward and that'll also
work for infinite scroll fetching more
and then going on so that's an exciting
feature in itself for the Apollo project
relay also does a page nation via these
things called cursors because you need
to know you need to know the points that
you are at and the edges around the data
that you need to go to that's cool and
the last great feature that I think will
is already in its already emerged is
mutation results so before you made a
mutation you had to specify the way it
returned in know the way the data
returned to be ey and upon Apollo you
can actually specify custom like a
custom reducer or translation layer so
if I make a mutation I can say okay well
the results are coming back but I will
actually want to process them
differently for the client which is
really cool so now you can actually do
very custom results if I mutate a to-do
list I can actually when I return I can
actually put that to do
at the top of the list or the bottom of
the list or in the middle or i can
actually you know only add that to do
and delete all the other ones i can do
custom things with my data once i
initiate something so that is another
very flexible tool that people will be
able to use so i think by next week
we'll have the react native stuff will
be fixed because i'm fixing that today
but we'll have all the tools that you
can do to get started and i think that i
will start recommending it after after
the next release like Firsters start
using it i actually start using it right
now if you're listening do they start
using right now it is a uncomfortable
now because we have a feature parity
with relay and which is great because
now it's only more stuff that we're
going to build that's better so start
using it and i'll be talking about
Apollo at meteor NYC just about the
reactant Apollo into creation so I'll go
into a lot of these these details and
stuff like that if you're interested but
I was start using it today and that's
why I think Josh isn't using it for his
client yeah because I'll be recommended
it yeah you know I I think it's really
interesting like query batching I
actually got into a discussion with tom
coleman about this because media
recommended a published composite which
is actually really really terrible for
this this particular problem right here
because like if you fetch a record and
let's say you have 10 child records that
you need to loop over you're gonna end
up making one query and then 10 more
child queries for that whereas like it's
always more efficient to just make two
queries one for the initial data and
then another query to fetch the other 10
child documents because like that
round-trip overhead costs you something
and when you you're doing it like 10
times a hundred times something like
that like it does add up yeah I'm like
oh it's only you know let's say 50
milliseconds per per query but I like 50
quiddity that's gonna start making a
difference mm-hmm
yeah oh yeah another great thing about
you know using Express and grab ql and
other technologies you don't have the
burden of white query I know at the
Immunity developers that I know are very
cautious to database operations right
the fact that should be cautious about
database operations this house because
database is a heart of the application
you're worried about making queries
because your CPU is going to go up in
your server is going to go down why are
you even worried about that if you're
worried about it when you have to go to
another technology I think the the
difference like the part that's gonna
become interesting is that like it's no
longer like I can't just call someone up
and say like how am I gonna am I gonna
scale this like I can't just like I have
to instead of like finding a meteor
expert or something like that I have to
go find like a database expert which
maybe is easier i don't know um yeah but
you know there's definitely not going to
be like the community i think is gonna
be more disparate and less knowledgeable
i don't know like you know i don't know
the right way to say it but I think so
ideally what we're planning on doing is
putting more work in the graphic UL
server so the client so these bash query
is the first part but we're imagining a
world where the graph ql server there's
a lot more for you how do you leverage
that guy on your server instead of the
client and this this constant lag of
connection now the worried you worried
about leveraging the graphical server
and putting more work into it and it's a
worry with anything is latency so if we
figure out the latency problem and you
can start doing complex joins in your
graph GL server can handle that
complexity and with the lowest latency
and you have nothing to worry about and
that's probably our next that's like the
next you know chapter of it so but i
honestly think you'll get a lot more
performance games if you just use like
you know i would like to start let me
rephrase that i wouldn't take a take on
a pin meteor with Apollo and take an
express app with the pollo I'd get bet
you that the Express Apple Apollo will
perform and scale better just because
isn't that scare you know that scariness
of life aquario if no cpu batallon
operations so yeah anyway that's the
stuff that's the update nice i'm
actually tweeting this next story out
right now nice good there we go each um
yeah so i like this post someone posted
on crater yesterday and said like who's
hiring and i think it's a great question
like i haven't asked the question pop up
yet so you know i pinged the space dojo
slack channel and a couple people popped
in and put their their info in and i
just put a tweet out as well um yeah I
think so like the client that I'm doing
work for right now I know they're hiring
there in Canada there in Winnipeg um
like they're probably looking for
on-site people um but I know like okay
grow and differential are always hiring
and I know differentials opened remote
people i think i'll grow might be as
well i don't know yeah i think so and it
looks like there are some people hiring
in Paris Germany San Francisco so like
this is a good thread number one to go
read and then I think the other thing
like this got us started talking and
like I think maybe this is central theme
today which is like what what can you do
to make yourself more hireable dmem matt
so yes totally after you told me about
this i started thinking pretty people
about it and like I think the when I
went to customer day this year or this
last customer day all the media shops
differential was there and some small
companies and they kept asking the media
team how do we hire meteor developers
and my boss
and I were sitting there and we were
like oh yeah you don't have iron meteor
developers you don't hire those you
either hire people who can build stuff
and teach the meteor or you hire people
who have you know the willingness to
learn and all those things there there
are so many other qualities that make
you horrible than the technology you
know yeah and so from my opinion is if
I'm hiring for a meteor developer then
I'm already already lost because I'm
hiring for someone who's like stoked in
in scope you know if I want someone on
my team personally I want someone who's
maybe well-rounded or he's like an indie
expert at something that is kind of like
you know essential to my stack right
like we have a database scientist
scientist who just knows everything
about databases like who's a nerd about
that he's like a database nerd you know
yeah we hired a CSS nerd you know it's
got a nerd freaking nerd about CSS then
like so much so that our pull request
off often get heated because he's saying
well you gotta do this because of the
CSS I'm just like oh man that doesn't
even matter but you're a nerd so let me
let me appease you but I like that stuff
because you bring so much more to your
team if you have those type of strengths
and opinions and all that stuff so I
think it should be well-rounded I don't
think you should I don't think people
should be hiring media today should be
hiring good developers you know yeah
what I've often found that to be the
case so like my client in Canada
actually did the same thing recently
they went out and hired two people and
they were just JavaScript people and
they had done some react work and had
never used meteor and part of my job is
to like sit down with them do a little
pair programming and like the very first
thing I did was just kind of walked him
through the code base and just
explaining like oh this is live query
this is DDP here's how you can look at
like information going back and forth
it's it's similar to what I do in my
training class but like it's just
basically data dumping to them but in
the context of like their application
and trying to level them up as fast as
they can to start contributing business
value to the
the projects that they're working on
yeah yeah so I to me like if I were like
getting sort of a meter I would actually
start looking at react or I don't know
graph ql or react native or anything and
and start playing with that stuff as
well because it's gonna like even just
building a sample app will go a long way
for you my opinion also if you're if
you're building a company that is very
server intensive I would not I would not
hire a meteor developer to do that I
would hire someone who's built a lot of
back ends and scaled a bunch of
different services and stuff because
they can always bring that knowledge to
meteor instead of them knowing media and
having to figure that other stuff out
you know which we haven't we hired a
software architect from ebay and he was
a piÃ±a he's a really smart guy and when
he came into meteor just super skeptical
because like he's skilled he has scaled
so many big company apps he came in and
he was just very skeptical and very
light just not impressed with the tools
for someone like him why there's so many
tools for product developers there's not
a lot of tools for people who were just
hardcore like back-end hardcore like
database hardcore cooling and scaly and
all that so he took an adjustment for
him to learn this javascript way of
things and after and even now he's still
skeptical but he knows how to operate in
the system that is meteor you know so
that's another recommendation is hire
someone who's who's good for the their
nips job and they can always teach them
anything yeah yeah definitely leaks more
people are gonna pick things up yeah
totally just the truth like I you know a
certain PHP moved to Ruby I remember
starting in svn running and actually in
CVS move to svn move to get like these
are things that that makes sense you
know like it as technology evolves
people are gonna learn it and change
like and right now I thoroughly enjoy
react and yeah three years maybe that's
not gonna be the case right like I'd be
like oh that's terrible what a stupid
idea react was but you know
yeah maybe it'll be like huge is or
something yeah yes yes indeedy all right
so the last story i sprung this one on
you i don't know if you happen to watch
the video so i did not watch the video
yet but i did hear the announcement this
morning for it do you mind just like
telling me about it and then yeah swap
it out for this yeah I've been doing a
cookout of videos and I try to keep them
at like 15 minutes max and i enjoy too
because like now that I have this imac I
can do 4k videos so like it if you can
do like top-notch video like you should
go watch this thing but anyway um hotel
is like so the one thing I missed from
rails land is they had gosh no I can't
think of the name of it but there was
this automatic app starter and oddly
enough it was built with node um under
the hood and like it would start a rack
app for you which is like um rails
conformed to rack for a long time anyway
like you just be able to say like I've
got a rails app and you start it and you
manage like what port it's running on
and all those dependencies and that kind
of thing and all I have to do is type in
a domain name and come up and run my
local version for me and then like it
would have a timeout and so after like
10 minutes will go away like since I
moved a meteor like I found one but it
didn't quite work the way I wanted to
and there were some problems with meteor
and like database ports not gonna
mention so the Gannet wrote that
actually we wrote as hotel and so now
you just NPM install hotel and then you
know you you basically get this same
kind of functionality but it's not
specific to actually any kind of
development environment right like it's
not tied the rails and rack it's not
tied to meteor a node or any of that
stuff like you install it using node but
you just give it a command line it'll
start the application for you as long as
the app that you're trying to start
takes a port and yeah Oh start the app
for you and
you can take a proxy config and pop that
into your machine and then you can start
typing in like you know I've got crater
conf dev and Booya it pulls up the
Jekyll site for me without any bus yeah
so it's it's really really cool like and
I think nope uh I think it's it's worth
taking the time to like get your tool
set up the way you want like it feels
like it may be waste or like a big yak
shave to work on your development setup
but actually think it's not um like it
saves me time in the end like today back
it off here I gotta go fix the I gotta
make some changes to create a comp
website and all I have to do is open my
editor make a couple changes check the
web page I know you have to start
anything once it's good ship it off to
get how every word up you know yeah this
reminds me of a service called now have
you heard of this service club now yeah
it kind of reminds me of that we're not
in the same vein but the ease of use and
just shipping quickly shipping version
super quick and having that instant
feedback in and yep you have to have
these tools like without these tools
your and to spend hours it's doing stuff
that you probably shouldn't be doing it
go spend time with your kids and like
why wasting time on this you know I
remember my first development job to to
update and a lot of people still do this
look to update our live side we
Association to SSH into our server get
pulled did all this jazz in there you
know run these configs and then get push
and then like you know like that just
seems so weird now right I think the
times our change in deploying and stuff
you know with like going SSH into your
server get pulling the storms code doing
all this jazz like there are so many
tools out there that do it for you right
now is specifically all that stuff so
yeah you know what let's talk about
let's talk about code cottage for a
second because you this is like your
third woman thing or 2nd 4th 4th I did
one on Khedira I didn't really announced
a very well but yeah I only knew about
the two
um I think these code cards are super
helpful like like but it's kind of
reminds me of egghead egghead videos are
like 10 minutes 15 minutes long and you
get a lot of information that you can
just go digest real quick and then you
know try it out or do something later
maybe we should do more maybe we should
do some crater crater podcast sponsored
code cutters like maybe one one day we
have some like we review some article
and then we you know also release of
cotta with the podcast that'd be cool
that's interesting yeah you talk about
it yeah I definitely want to like so in
the future and like if you have um if
you have ideas let me know but yeah that
includes like any of the listeners out
there to like tweet at me but um I plan
to do I want to do is series of building
one application like very very tiny 10
minutes like get a framework installed
build an application and then move on to
the next framework and just try it and
see what that getting started experience
like and keep it to like 15 minutes or
so and now see how or we can get yeah it
also adds to the learn other stuff
mantra you know like where another stuff
do other things exactly exactly I like
that a lot I think that's a good idea
yeah yeah also another thing this is
besides the whole show or anything but
another thing I wanted to say was like
like the crater podcast you and I like
we're going to be doing some Apollo work
together to so people should listen to
the show more because you're gonna get
insider info on Apollo if you're
interested and there also might get some
educational tools out of the show itself
that we might give to everybody so stay
tuned on that you know get excited about
it yes indeedy is yeah i think if you
listen to the cauda it's really good
teaching style and if you're not
struggling if you let it if you're
struggling run and grab killed right now
if you like the style am i helping help
other people you know we can we can
incorporate the styling yeah yeah yeah
awesome alright man well thanks for
being on today hobby and as always thank
you to module
digitalocean for sponsoring and you can
go to patreon and check out the patreon
page P a treo in a calm / media club
should figure out how to fix them it's
kinda everywhere uh-oh we got we have to
do it they do the plug about patreon
because I don't know if people
understand what the value of patreon is
for the show oh yeah hey Kara keeps
lotsa it does it does so like I so I
handle the Youtube version of the show
if you watch that I upload that thing
edit it and upload it but I actually do
hand this off to an audio editor to give
it a slightly better quality and he
handles that and then I have a VA that
then uploads it all too simple cast so
that it gets to your device um and like
that stuff costs money and you know
running I don't know like just running
the space dojo slack channel kind of
takes my time and curating all that so
like that's that that money comes in and
just helps me kind of run all the
behind-the-scenes stuff cuz you know
simple casts I think it only cost me
like you can paying them like 20 bucks a
month I'm thinking about adding a third
podcast I don't know so yeah that goes
but uh you know so like all this stuff
just it costs some money in that helps
out with those costs so really an uber
appreciate it and I do try to deliver
some value like if you go to the
ten-dollar level you get into the
dislike channel so and like with more
with more patrons there are more
exciting things we can do with the show
you know we can scale the show a little
bit more than we want because the show
start up as a meteor show right and you
have bigger ambitions now in together
yeah I think to me like if I had enough
people on board I could actually afford
like I've got a quote from my designer
to make a pretty version of crater with
react and like customize it to look more
a little more like crater but actually
like fresh design um and like that's
it's gonna cost like 900 bucks so like
we're gonna gotta get them the funds
there somehow for that so I've been
trying yes don't drink your copy today
and donate the five bucks
to the crater podcast and we can keep
show guy yes and yeah cool sorry for the
plug but I wanted to say that that's I'm
fine thanks man no rabies all right
