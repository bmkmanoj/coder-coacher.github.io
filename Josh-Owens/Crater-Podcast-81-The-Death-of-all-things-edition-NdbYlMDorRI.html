to 15 15 monkey J Dave hmm I'm jealous
welcome crater fans i'm your host Josh
Owens I'm your co-host been Strahan
welcome what I got my if you're watching
I got my old school media shirt on all
right on back before blaze died oh oh
wait sorry are we gonna be talking about
today by the way today about velocity
dying oh is I router dead Oh Phoenix is
a meteor alternative what what what my
head just spent spun off oh yeah the
cost of frameworks and a rebuttal little
bonus to post in one discussion and the
death ablaze with death Oh blaze we had
a lot of death going on you should have
been our halloween has been been been
that was bush league you didn't link up
the r.i.p blaze and the show notes there
i just was shocked that it was it in
your Sean oh it's initially so I just
had taken yeah just gone through a
crater and like trying to get the trying
to get it all in a certain order and
Penny wanted to play war so we were like
ah just tiny truth you're really
disconnected sounds like play cards book
list over here I'm like I don't get it
too bad he's gonna be mad at me that's
right i'm such a diva so yes yeah this
is like this is definitely like the
death of all things addition or
something oh my gosh yeah oh goodness
okay so yeah whats for just diving um
it's it's been a while right I mean we
didn't do it last week and mini maybe it
wouldn't all feel piled up and wants
show had we done it last week but zovi
Oh announced that they're not going to
be working on velocity anymore and it
turns out they were the only guys
working on velocity still so at this
point so velocity is that is the test
runner for a meteor yeah
and uh you know they've done really
interesting work and they've been
focusing on you know building a great
testing environment and I you know I
think it it really boiled down to you
know reading reading between the lines
here it boil down to the fact that it
just it looks like mdg didn't really
want to accept the pull request or I I
don't know exactly what happened there
but basically a pull request is set out
there since May May ninth and you know
they've they've been trying to maintain
compatibility going forward but it's
it's you know it's all fallen on yonas
and Sam and I just I think it's becoming
too costly for them and so they just had
to kind of say we can't we can't do it
anymore yeah they had to make a tough
decision I mean I know that they're
involved in their own startup yeah and
like gosh if it takes up someone's life
it definitely trying to like break a
start-up into new a profitable business
yeah is so that makes total sense on
their part yeah I'm shocked at is the
title which is saying handing the last
view back to mdg well then what was MDGs
response then they didn't have an
official response that is yeah and so
the interesting thing is if you know
where to look you can find a response I
don't you know I still don't I don't
think it's super official but from what
I'm hearing out of customer appreciation
day at meteor you know they're there
perhaps working on well they've said in
other places that they're also working
on getting module support into meteor
and theoretically that that should make
using standard testing tools from the
node environment maybe a little bit
easier so um but you know at the end of
the day you still have things like
end-to-end testing or integration level
testing that you want to do and they're
still going to have to be some work done
there
so people thought that the testing story
with meteor was was weak uh oh just like
got a whole lot weaker right I mean it
kind of did right like I did you know
here's my here's my problem with this
like don't don't ask the community to do
stuff and then expect them to do
something and then don't like support
them like they they actually like came
out and said it was the official testing
framework of meteor and then ah yeah you
know it just it looks like they really
weren't working with the team so I mean
that's that's just I don't know it's
another instance of I managing open
source is hard and I think that's really
what this boils down to yeah and I think
there is going to be an answer coming in
the future like you speculated where you
know meteor is going to be shedding its
MVP scan of of like having so many
things done in-house and they need to
become a profitable company so they're
going to be looking for community at
large to fill some of the gaps that was
taking up a lot of MDGs time right yeah
I mean I've always maintained I don't
understand how you could expect galaxy
to take off when you're trying to do all
this stuff that they're doing you know
like like building that business in and
of itself is gonna be a hard thing for
them to do because they're gonna be
hiring support people and DevOps people
and like that's so far out the norm of
what they've done for the past two years
like that's gonna be really really tough
for them mm-hmm um and you know I think
I kind of think that's what we're seeing
like they're still hiring developers and
doing things but yeah I don't know they
I mean from the very beginning anyone
who ran a business and then saw that in
the past and then saw that mdg came on
the scene they're a for-profit company
they didn't separate their open source
stuff into a non for profit company it's
still part of the for-profit you always
know you always knew there was there was
something coming down the line no they
have to be in the black and they're in
there keeping the stuff in-house so
well I always knew something was coming
and so last city is dropped MDGs not
picking it up so I I will say you know
the one response we did get in the
meteor guides area of the github repo
and the issues discussion Tom started
talking about testing and you know there
was just a bunch of back and forth and
sashko essentially said uh you know it's
it's there's nothing's gonna happen on
that front yeah so well nothing's going
to happen on the list velocity
specifically rightful yeah yeah so like
blood testing is not like totally
ignored by mu G right right yeah but I
mean that's you know their response to
this article essentially is that they're
not gonna be doing anything with
velocity but that's not to say you know
Sam and yonas still want to make sure
that chimp which is the basis of meteor
cucumber is still gonna function and
they're trying to make sure that it
functions with jasmine as well and he's
got some really interesting stuff up his
sleeve you show me some ideas he's got
he wants to do almost like an end-to-end
testing with jasmine but it's got a
really interesting uh reuse case spin on
it so you know hopefully he can reveal
that in much greater detail soon but it
looks really interesting too so nothing
yet test it just means i think it'll
change how you test and how you run
tests and that kind of stuff so yeah
yeah and hold tight community at large
there's going to be some changes coming
with testing yeah i also think that this
means with the next release of meteor
like 13 velocities highly likely to
break so it'll continue to work for now
but as soon as a release comes out you
know they're not maintaining that huge
backported patch anymore so beware when
you say meteor update yes
cool tell us about the dead routers the
dead router so there's been a long talk
for months now that's like Oh Flo
routers the way to go you nuts I mean
that's just you really write if this was
your opinion I guess I'm saying I guess
that's just my opinion no I'm just
kidding aashka said something to that
was the big hint yeah they hinted that
routing was going to come into core and
then everyone's like wall what does that
mean was that mean and sasha was like
take like start using flow router mm-hmm
and there you go like it was like okay
now we'll routing come into core I don't
know I thought people really took that
yeah I don't think so he did but people
really took that and started using flow
router and so new projects came along
and like even on this show we've talked
about this before and I said um there's
more instances of iron-router out in the
wild right now but I was always under
the impression that new projects right
there would be more people using flow
router with new projects yeah um and
then uh vinly came out from France the
guy who runs fast o sphere mm-hmm and he
came out with his awesome medium post
about his iron router really dead and
he'll that's to back it up it was like
what you know what's interesting to me
is like we didn't talk about festo
sphere got upgraded um I don't think we
ever talked about that on the show now
which I wanted to but we just had so
much talk about lately and that was that
was awesome and I was kind of looking
over it and poking around and that's
when I noticed he actually had stats for
like all time downloads and like per
week and per month downloads and that's
when I started looking and thinking oh
my gosh like iron-router still like in
order of magnitude bigger and downloads
per week than flow router
yeah yeah you could look at that but
later on so okay so iron riders not dead
it has like seven times more downloads
but what if you look at the trend line
iron-router is going on a huge nose dive
mm-hmm so but the interesting thing is
you don't see like maybe just the size
of the graph right now is throwing it
off but I don't in comparison you don't
see a huge upswing in low router either
that's why I was going to say
iron-router is going down flow router is
not going up right I mean it is but not
at the same velocity that the iron
router is going down rain so I'm like
there's just not a lot more meteor apps
come now so maybe my privacy like there
should be a consistent number of growth
of apps right well you know here's the
thing so the interesting piece here is
this maybe signals that we have people
on older versions of meteor than when
updating in their version of iron router
is fine and they're not pulling a new
version because they're not updating
mm-hmm that's always a possibility maybe
they're locked into aberration and it's
already on their machine so these stats
come like when you type meteor add
package name you know that's when these
stats occur like they're created because
your machine goes out and it sends and
actually like meteors doing some creepy
stuff they actually have the ID of the
app that's checking in so they can tell
which which app is pulling in the
package and then yeah yeah most people
don't know that I'm gonna make some
dirty named apps now I don't know how
that works exactly but I think it's just
a string and the file you said you're
not meteor folder there's like AI d phi
um and so i think they track those stats
that way and you know this again I've
got a number of apps I just sit there on
my machine that aren't being updated and
haven't been touched in long
and that very well could be it I mean
we're still on 114 one of my client
projects so um yeah that could be it too
yeah and it's not the full picture like
like I'm sure there's a small amount of
people may be super small maybe two jet
is using react router yeah that's 42 I
mean we do have this this big split
that's starting to happen now that we
have you know angular and react in in
the in the framework as an option so you
could be the two so at the end of the
day what should should this like uh like
say like hey should we like advocate for
a certain router right now I honestly
don't think people should be used in
iron Roderick I don't either so the
reason the reason I would say that is
because it's not being actively
maintained and so I think it starts to
fall into that same kind of like he
hasn't come out and said he's not
actively maintaining it but it falls
into that category like velocity where a
new version of meteor could potentially
break it and you know maybe a little
while before we see an update to it not
if if ever you know because I just think
Chris Chris doesn't seem to be
participating in the meteor community
anymore from what I can tell oh maybe
I'm wrong again another guy with a
startup mm-hmm trying to make some money
trying to make a living and you know and
it's really hard to do a major open
source project like I I was on that
project for maybe a week as a potential
maintainer and I was at differential and
we were trying to figure out like can we
throw some weight at this thing and
maybe help out and no it was just too
much we did the same uh like talk it at
ok grow yeah yeah it's like do we want
to pick this up before flow router
really was something big
yeah yeah yeah but anyway so i would say
moving forward and wink wink people
should be using reactor outer think you
might be thinking differently yeah I'd
say I mean I I think flow routers a
perfectly fine choice I think Aaron dota
will continue to maintain it you know
I'm curious like he's using react but I
I think maybe he's using flow router and
that's that's definitely a choice
because the the renderer is separated
from the router and so you know you just
have to make sure the renderer does the
right thing mm-hmm okay definitely
definitely an option but you know flow
router has more of sash goes blessing
right yeah so wait so my question would
be because I haven't even looked at
react router is that something that's
coming from outside of meteor yeah okay
okay so that's a no comment okay yeah I
don't know that's that's interesting
given our upcoming discussion yes anyway
before we move on we talked about Chris
having a start-up and say I'm having a
startup I think we should give those
guys a shout out because they're awesome
oh yeah definitely so well obviously I
mentioned zovi oh and I think he's
working on a project called simian see
me and I oh uh and Chris yeah I guess
that's a start up I mean um he's just
doing a training videos which I think
must be probably know about but evented
mine yeah yeah check those guys out
Simeon is is like a collaborative uh you
can make this so long if you go through
all these simians cool man i think it
should get some interesting yeah sure a
collaborative way to like share your
tests with your team yeah go check it
out
indeed alright so Phoenix Phoenix your
alternative yes and I'll just say I
posted something on crater as well and
you know some some interesting stuff
happen we talked about done Jess and uh
you know though the author got mentioned
in the tweet and he listened to the
episode and i really liked having that
interaction that haven't outside of the
meteor community oh yeah and you know he
cuz it's done j ass it's jas yeah yeah
totally that's just what I'm saying I
don't know you say is this Phoenix Jess
no no what yeah sorry Ben what so just
for the record it I want to google know
it made no part of this yeah yeah yeah
just like josh is like killing gosh on
your dick we finish uh yeah so it got me
thinking like where's where's crater f
like I liked that interaction happening
and I wanted to see more of it and I
think that meteors definitely opened
itself up to try and play nicely with
the rest of the community slowly I think
we're getting there maybe with NPM three
support and module support and web pack
support will actually get all the way
there I don't know that will be
interesting um which they're all working
on by the way yes but I I actually I got
up gosh what what they did did the blaze
thing come out
there was nothing like three days ago
Wednesday maybe I got up that morning
and just I don't know I was I was
feeling like you know all right
something needed to change so i changed
the tag line two I'm crater to like
building JavaScript apps but then I
realized like oh that's that's probably
a big area to talk about and I think the
thing that we're all really interested
in the thing we like meteor for is the
fact that we're doing real-time stuff
we're building web and mobile apps using
real-time stuff so changed that tagline
and that seems to coincide with the fact
that a lot of people media club are
talking about elixir in Phoenix I don't
know it's really interesting just in
case JavaScript apps was too big of a
subject yeah we brought elixir in yeah
definitely well so here's the thing a
lot of replying in the house a lot of
people are using react with Phoenix and
they offer their own web socket
implementation called channels and but
the thing with Erlang which is the
underlying vm that runs elixir and
Phoenix is written an elixir is is that
you know you get that like it's built
for scalability you can yeah really
easily just say I need to run a bunch of
these I assume processes I haven't even
gotten that deep in it but and it should
be able to handle that for you like it
was built for that specifically and the
language was built this is like what
your tell ko's like build stuff with so
like the reliability of it has to be way
high because people get really pissed
off with their phones don't work yeah so
uh you know it was interesting to me and
i will say there's a lot of back and
forth in here talking about elixir and
phoenix and it looks it it looks
interesting to me if i had time to play
with it i might yeah we have some like
elixir like moles
in a chat room mm-hmm to say the least
and and even this week there was an
announcement that like a cutting-edge
brand new startup that started and is
launched in production with meteor has
moved to Phoenix already yeah like
people are moving out of meteor yeah
well I mean in in the Phoenix or at
least one person is so far yeah that's I
mean people are gonna change their tech
choices I think that's fine I could see
people starting off with meteor and then
they have to like they're growing they
have growth so they need to like start
pulling things out putting new things in
and like really customizing their stack
for their for their situation but to
move from one framework to another and
I'd be I'm having it stay excited I'm
like like what big start off with
originally usually yeah meaning hero did
it I mean they didn't they didn't go too
far they went to the mean stack so
obviously they were still in the jas
face but yeah we've had the same
conversation with people that start off
with with me dear and then they moved to
like rails maybe if they were less
technical co-founders and stuff then we
were like oh poo poo on that him but I
have to say it's a different story I'm
not comparing Phoenix any liquor to
rails and all you know it really need
it's a really neat choice it's actually
sounds I mean one of the bars one of the
hardest things to do is scale those
those web socket connections on a small
server and I think that's you know he
who does that best wins Rashid she who
does that best wins couple things like
you lose isomorphic code right you do
yeah okay i mean it's it's a trade-off
right but at the same time you go from
like this uh single threaded event loop
processor to like a completely different
kind of mindset and framework that is
supposed to handle the scaling a lot
better yeah mmm
I am saddled on how we're ending this
yeah so all I'll say is that you should
go at least read 25% of this this thread
um let's let's see does it tell me how
many are in here response wise but go to
the bottom maybe it's a long thread it's
super long and as with any I think
meteor forum thread they eventually like
die down into like terribly hard to read
things because they get so long and 110
replies yeah 111 is what i'm showing oh
yeah 101 boys we do know yeah you're
better at math I'm you oh yeah so I mean
it's worth at least paying attention to
a lot of good links in here a lot of
good discussion I mean if you're looking
for something and you're concerned about
scalability I you know it's probably
worth looking at now if your startup
like what is the going rate or the
availability of elixir developers and
hurling developers I have no idea um
I'll today I know in Cincinnati I know
uh just about the same amount of both
right now so Oh probably along the same
lines I think it's like anything you
know the the one thing that I think was
super specialized for a long time was
objective-c developers but I don't I
don't think that's you know or i'm
guessing elixir developers are not
pulling in 2x what most developers are
like objective-c did there for a while i
wonder if it's hard to find them though
mmm popularity javascript through the
roof and people can like jump on Devon
do under new media o knowing JavaScript
but not knowing anything about meteor
and still like produce really rapidly in
a project yeah won't disagree with that
yeah lotta things away oh sorry sorry my
kids are probably streaming netflix
right now yeah keeping up my bandwidth
right so let's move on yes the cost of
frameworks hahahahahaha let me scroll to
the top of this very long article this
is written by away me I have to scroll
the bottom to get his name and at the
top stay at the bottom I think it's at
the bottom Paul hello my name is Paul he
works at Google on the chrome developer
relations team and so he wrote this
article the cost of frameworks and
basically it's an argument or not using
a framework but but writing everything
out from scratch using javascript but he
does a really awesome job laying out
both sides of argument so much so that I
had to like well it's reviewing it I had
asked Josh like what side is this guy
coming from but it's a really there's
actually a lot of stuff to talk about in
this article oh yeah totally so the
benefits of using a framework and the
benefits of not using it or the cost of
that and I think he sums it up pretty
well and I want to get right into one
thing big bold letters developer organ
amex first user needs and that was that
was the cornerstone of this argument was
hey do we develop do we use a tool
because it's fast to develop and we
could leverage other packages that
already made we can get going faster but
at the other hand um you know you're
going to be sacrificing stuff for the
user because you're going to using a
framework a framework Oh what kind of
stuff are you sacrificing yeah a
framework is built for like a lot of
different use cases in mind so you're
going to have a big codebase a fat code
base and in the case of meteor like much
much of that code is being downloaded at
the initial load of every client yeah
and to be fair like he was just
comparing the client side of things so
meteor was not mentioned in here but he
talked about polymer and angular and
react and back right ember and regular
JavaScript and the the piece that I
found super interesting about this is
like some of these things like the time
like he measured the size of the library
to download and like the time to
actually get a bootstrap did he talk
about time to interactive yeah yes yeah
and so he shows like the jas was
requested it arrives the data is
requested the data arrives and then the
page is like ready to go mm-hmm some of
these took like over like ember took
over two seconds actually they were if
you look at this list reacts react with
j sx not transformed and amber were like
the big losers in the benchmark i
thought that was interesting yeah yeah
and then vanilla at the bottom hey i
also think it's a little I i I'd really
be curious to see ought to see if I can
maybe run these myself but I'd be
curious to see angular 2 in its current
version like what's that bootstrap Tom
look like because I have a feeling like
that's probably faster as well
yeah and it and I think he summed it up
correctly like like this is the argument
to have um not so much like Oh what
framework is better for what frameworks
faster that's all I me people tackle it
at but he really did against user
experience uh and pinned it against uh
just regular JavaScript vanilla
JavaScript yeah so I mean that's his
take right you know real argument that's
the real conversation right there though
over things too high so you should just
go right plain old JavaScript apps
possibly yeah it's like you are going to
be sacrificing a a perfect user
experience to get to use this framework
right and still I like his argument I
think has some really interesting merit
to it like you can go look at stats from
amazon and they talk about how they've
been ever been able to measure like a
hundred excuse me uh 100 milliseconds in
latency translates directly to like X
amount of dollars lost and so they're
absolutely always trying to figure out
how to deliver JavaScript or you know
the HTML as fast as i can to that
browser because they don't want to lose
the signal mmm now we're talking about
again I really think this the next
question is right after the what's more
important users or developer experience
hand in hand with that is well what
stage is my business at mmm yeah that's
a good point that's a very good point
and I think that's where the rebuttal
comes in here and you know Tom Dale's
not my most favorite JavaScript
developer in the world he's been very
anti meteor um but I I think I really
really agree with him here that
frameworks make it easier to build
things you know
yeah yeah we have an extra extra visitor
in here yes haha guess my wife left that
was my youngest daughter um so you know
he starts arguing about like our
frameworks worth it and you know here's
a key line he says in my experience it
boils down to app developers
overwhelmingly use frameworks because
they have to support code for years dev
rel I guess that's developer relations
people love small libraries vanilla jazz
because they don't have to support big
code bases for years and can quickly
bang out demos with the latest and
greatest um and you know that's
interesting and I think we'll we'll
segue into that more um but you know I I
definitely think that he says here in in
here what is the execution time of real
world apps of approximately similar
complexity and maybe apps built with
frameworks are still slower but my
hypothesis is that for any apps of any
larger amount of complexity the ones
that start off vanilla will accrete
their own franken framework that
performs similarly similarly to if not
worse than an off-the-shelf framework
like he says has amber angular but I you
know you can insert anything there and
two because you're gonna have a
different perspective of the problem
that you're trying to solve from day one
trying to build and then like day
hundred here's the thing for me like if
I decide to go I mean if we so we rely
on a library and open source library
that is on NPM for doing monko stuff and
an option changed and performance got
worse with Mongo queries a memory and
a bunch of people were having trouble
scaling their media apps and meteor
brought in some experts and they took a
look at it and I like oh here's your
problem you didn't notice that this
library got tweaked in this way and you
didn't change your arguments and you
know boom you've you've got bad
performance all of a sudden and so they
were able to put out that fix in one
over whenever the story was like you
probably look it up but um it I think to
me that's that's the power of a
framework and if you're on your own just
using the library and you didn't notice
which can be very common mistake um you
know you're just you're just kind of
stuck there looking at the bad
performance and really you don't like it
maybe you can find someone to call on
maybe you maybe call strong loop like
meteor date and bring them in to help
but chances are you may not be able to
afford them so I don't know it's really
interesting yeah I think I'm Pro
framework yeah once I become a unicorn
then I'll be rolling my own yeah nice
until then that's that's the last stage
of unicorn is like rolling your own
framework yeah well the last stage is is
open sourcing your own framework and
having the world adopted that's less if
unicorn no the last stage of you not we
go people just like making it rain on
you make it i right you're a unicorn all
right you are a snowflake so I think the
the other interesting thing you know
were kind of talking back and forth
about this is he ends with you know he
doesn't really think that slow
performance on mobile devices should
really be the problem and that a lot of
frameworks are optimizing for slowest
browser which he says is chrome on
Android which is a little shot in there
too I think um and he says what we're
manufacturing our manufacturers are
making CPUs faster a browser vendors are
making their JavaScript engines
faster and he says here's hoping chrome
catches up to Safari soon framework
authorizing their code for slow browsers
and frameworks are working on reducing
startup costs for your strategies like
dead code elimination and server-side
rendering so you know I think there's
there's a lot of interesting things
happen and he's very true you know this
is very much like a bandwidth and a
hardware issue and um you know they
think more I get some gains out of
making browsers faster with each
iteration of nos release but if nothing
else like it's just inherently going to
get faster as we get more bandwidth them
more powerful CPUs here's the thing the
world's moving to mobile two thirds of
the world is going to get internet soon
what's it what's that look what type of
speed of what is their LTE speed going
to be without Facebook balloons or
whatever in the air and what kind of
devices are they going to be using when
you trade in your phone at Sprint
t-mobile or whatnot where's that phone
going there's probably stock piling up
going over to Africa or something like
that right so like they got like a bunch
of like Android tues two point oh it's
not like that oh I mean so if when the
two thirds of the world comes online
what is that going to look like that's
when we could like fully say okay this
is this is what we need to build for we
can we can assume them oh it's gonna be
faster better that's a few clear-cut I
mean if that were true I would think
they'd already be happening to some
extent and I'm not sure it is and i also
think like there's very few globally
reached like applications in my opinion
that's what i was going to say next is
like I think as developers we're not we
don't have a world view come on yeah
absolutely i'm definitely isolated to
you know my view in ohio or the US or
north america i think that's gonna die
think that's definitely going to change
come in the future yeah so there is a
couple things at play right now
um all right let's move on next one cuz
I think this next one's gonna be pretty
late so I in case you missed it you're
living on a rock the CEO of what does
need again god what it was no don't do
that um there was that was a bad
reference to a stupid joke I made I
should have made um uh yes hook totally
threw my mojo up in um I'm sorry bruh
did my bad yeah no it's all good um I I
really want the article though gosh you
should have linked it been oh I'll send
it to you right now I got it bomb pop
next steps how do I even like do this
chat thing that's all right Craven's
pastor crater was faster than been
trying to paste a link mmm take that
Google developer relation guy Paul and
he'd be like what crater what yeah uh
yeah so Jeff came out with an
announcement and it was called next
steps on blaze in the view layer and you
know I think many of us have been kind
of scratching our head and wondering
what's gonna happen with blaze we feel
like they're not working on it they've
come out and said they're not working on
it we don't like there's definitely
performance problems inherent in blaze
when you hit a certain kind of size of
an application things definitely start
to get slower and I we need some fixes
huh only um is only used in meteor apps
yeah yeah absolutely and no they they
tried an experiment with a spun-out
blaze to be its own library and came
with tracker and all that kind of stuff
in it I'd say fail pretty bad um like I
went out the other day I was right
I think that was before space bars right
no no it was it was around the time of
10 I was out there for like an August
dev shop and they had just announced it
html5 dev com um and you know as is
typically like hard to do they I don't
think they've fully committed to it to
like make it an open source thing and
never really found an audience for it
either so if you go look like i don't i
don't think that websites not being
maintained and like they started a
google group which looks like you know
moth and like dust balls tumbleweeds
rolling around so i mean like react
definitely has a much bigger community
behind it as far as a front-end
framework goes i mean angular dust
killer does to yup angular's like the
800-pound gorilla here right um but but
react comes from the backing of facebook
as well and so you know there's there's
some interesting stuff going here and i
think that it's really really hard to
expect that mdg could even compete on
that level and so and it takes man hours
mdg is like very limited on engineering
what's not it it's not even just the
engineering main hours right it's like
the open source support and um you know
trying to like it's a whole separate
marketing job basically they'd have to
take what they did for meteor and kind
of replicated on a smaller level for
blaze and they'd be building a wall
around blades yeah yeah and we knew we
had a feeling this is common when they
be when they you know added really easy
support for angular and react and we
even talked talked about all the stuff
we had yuri on it on the meteor club and
hints at this all the time and so for
meteor you had the choice angular react
or blaze yeah uh essentially then with
those three like they would need to keep
blaze at like a competitive
level as reacting angular if they were
going to move forward rate which they're
just not doing yeah it's a huge effort
to like ask that um yeah and they're not
even putting in a minimal effort here in
my opinion you know well again in their
startup and so they got their happy path
and I think then this is like this this
is why Jeff like wrote wrote this forum
post it's like hey I'm laying the cards
out I have to communicate this probably
this is hopefully a leaf being turned of
like them having better communication
may be like this is coming from the top
down this is coming from the CEO so
here's what I'll say okay number one
they did it slightly wrong in my opinion
they should have had a post on the blog
that said here here's our announcement
meteor 13 is coming you know we're
shooting for a quarter range right just
just give us like q1 2016 we're gonna
try to come out with meteor 13 here's
the things that's going to include
here's actually some github issues where
you can follow along and if you care
about this thing you can comment here I
think that would have been great post
and everyone was like oh yeah you know
cheering it cheering along and then boom
hit him with this you know I never want
to be like okay haha gosh I i don't know
may that through patrol right then yeah
but I still think like you would have
had a lot more goodwill coming into this
post then then they had I think I think
yeah if you spun it with some positive
news then yeah you're right I think yeah
you're right that you're dead right bro
I mean I you know I like to think about
marketing from time to time and that's
it's just a marketing move yeah yeah one
way or the other but one way makes
everyone feel a little bit better I
think so so I tell us tell us what
they're doing so what's good Josh or
what a jet a Jap actually announced uh
so what he announced is that they're
starting to investigate what blaze too
would look like in that you know they
want to be able to build off of react in
the community there and do something
interesting and so they want to have
blazed to which will be a much tighter
integration of templates and tracker and
react output versus what react offers
today so it sounds like basically a
blaze too will be kind of like a mo
react transpiler almost where it'll take
what you're building in a template and
kind of put it together into the correct
react syntax and spit that out and you
know I think there's a lot of
interesting things that come along here
right they have a big component
ecosystem that you'll be able to tap
into which happens to that runs off mpm
right mm-hmm and I here and then 13
we're gonna get like an upgraded NPM
setup so definitely plane headed in
there like so blaze is like a
cornerstone of meteor mm-hmm you know it
is definitely a cornerstone of the
packages that are available on
atmosphere hmm yes it is disadvantage of
oldness fear is his blaze related oh you
know I it's gotta be a huge astronomical
number and I asked uh Vinay if he could
maybe pull these numbers you did yes I
did but he couldn't figure out how to do
it um he said I didn't have that kind of
data on it but I mean if nothing else
like I'd love to see like just search
for the word blaze like I I came up with
a hundred results he caps the results of
that so I bet there's a lot there that
are related to blaze and if there's an
enterprising individual you could just
pull in all the packages and look
the package as for the word blaze and I
think that would also help you figure
that out but I you know were were so
okay I think yet that was fine and the
community responded and a lot of people
you can see right away someone's like
what's that look like for my code and
then someone else said yeah like that
sounds great and and then Aaron Otis
said what about blaze reacts like let's
not start from nothing and you know la
dee dah you goes bad huh is that what he
said sideburns yeah sideburns has been
renamed to blaze react Oh has it whoops
yeah I'm behind all the time uh-huh get
with it get with it no that just
happened this week I think um but then
Evan you jumps in and he says hey I'm
gonna be the guy doing the investigative
work and probably building something
here so you know I kind of outlines who
things and one of the things that really
struck me here is that however we've
come to realize like he starts talking
about sideburns and react blaze or
whatever you call it um that what blaze
is super easy to pick up there's some
inherent design decisions to make your
UI harder to bug to maintain when the
scale your project grows which some
people have run into I think you know
and he quotes someone as to some of the
problems uh-uh so instead of keeping the
old API and treating reactors low level
implementation deal we want to embrace
the the strength of react the component
model and its related JavaScript API and
providing on top of it with people like
about blaze which is the templating and
the reactivity and then just ask for
like you know what's what's this look
like or what do you like about this what
do you not like about this so he's just
asking some questions trying to get some
responses um and you know I think that
riled up people a little bit more
because it sounds like it's going to be
pretty incompatible and sashko came
along and you know this is the one that
really kind of struck a chord with me I
think one hundred percent foolproof way
to
Oh will be to just start using react now
the blaze to thing you know I use the
air quotes because he put quotes around
this thing is mostly for people who
don't want to deal with the details of
reactant it's j sx syntax but if it
works for you then I'd say that's the
way to go but I think it's deeper than
that right like we've got this whole
give me to your data and like the way
that that functions you have to like
really start thinking differently about
how your reactive data works with react
was it in this was this was it in this
page or was it somewhere in the meteor
guide where Tom said listen guys we all
knew that react or blaze to was going to
be like a total rewrite that was going
to like break your stuff Tom ya know he
definitely said that in here but I don't
I don't think that's necessarily true
either there's been several aborted
attempts to start up a place to project
and I don't know like I feel like even
if it was a total rewrite that doesn't
mean it's gonna like break everything
right um spark to blaze broke a lot of
stuff and it was painful and we got
through it and that's fine but I you
know I think switching to react under
the covers and you're telling me like
it's not going to be in any way
backwards compatible like that's a lot
more I don't know scary to me um and so
I just started like after reading sash
goes host you know I don't I given
what's happened with velocity and given
what's kind of happen with blaze where
this is the first thing we're hearing
about it I don't believe anything that
meteor says when they say something's
going to be a hundred percent foolproof
right like that's the can't say that
well a lot of people have been asking me
this week like what or have a scan us
like where do we think the future of
MDGs going to be like what are they
doing right now there's some stuff
happening and response has been follow
the money follow the money like they
need to get in the black and this blaze
a to conversation you can do the same
thing I you know what mdg is putting it
top of their priority list right now is
keeping their galaxy customers happy
absolute and all the galaxies users use
blaze a huge percentage of them mm-hmm
so yeah I would agree with that right
I'm just going to play that those are
the real the opinions and the
conversations that those clients give to
mdg that's going to really be what's
tears please to so that we could do like
a bunch of conversation and talking now
but I think that's really what's going
to happen and unfortunately that's like
behind closed doors or private
conversations we don't really know yeah
all right so I just I'll give my
prediction they're gonna shed any weight
that they can shed and rely on the
JavaScript community to do as much as
they can without them having to write
code to maintain that stuff so this is
bigger than blaze now right hey it is so
the conversation your character yeah
yeah the conversation here is definitely
about blaze but i think it's the tip of
the iceberg and the trend you're gonna
see mmhmm yeah yeah so we know that
they've mentioned in the past like they
really like what web pack has David
Greeks Greenspan wrote about that and I
think we talked about on this on his
podcast I don't do be do me I think we
did yeah yeah there's a post out there I
don't know if we talked about though
yeah but a web pack they brought
reacting super simple they now we now we
know they're there talk about blaze and
blaze too and and react under the covers
and we know that they want to bring in
better support for EM p.m. so all that
says to me is exactly what you said is
that they're gonna start start shedding
weight on the packages that mdg
maintains and they're going to focus on
a great developer experience yeah
they're going to make a wrapper around
all this cool tech that is maintained by
a larger community and is not scope
specifically to an mdg stack well bring
it in and they're going to have it be a
happy path for developers
from start when you say meteor create
all the way to deployment right but
you're going to be using webpack you're
going to be using NPM packages instead
of atmosphere my prediction maybe maybe
we have some inside info edameh well I
don't I mean so atmosphere is gonna be
like you can't pull the plug on it can't
just be like poop off no you can't eat
right I think it'll die I don't think
it's fabulous yeah I don't I don't think
its core to their business and you know
frankly uh mpm is doing a good enough
job so I think that's fine you know the
single biggest problem that I had with
this is the fact that as an early
adopter like to have I feel like some of
sockos responses of late have been a
little flippant or off-putting to me
because they just feel like and I think
I said this in one of my posts like
they're not really building apps with
meteor and so it's not super painful for
them to make these choices well
otherwise you have to deal with some
griping from us they brought percolate
in they have their consulting arm now
and they I know that when they fired up
galaxy I the first clients to galaxy
they like gave them a bunt and we had
this conversation about class craft
where they came in and there they went
above and beyond to get these companies
going on galaxy they looked at their
code intimately offered suggestions so
they have first-hand knowledge now of
the largest apps green they do they do
but at the same time they're not really
like for them to just flippantly say
like a velocity it can die blaze can die
like reacts around you should just you
know suck it up and deal with it like I
feel like that's some of the response
that we're getting from a couple
developers and that's not the response
you necessarily want to hear after you
build a big business on blaze or
philosophy or anyhow follow the money
follow the money they're gonna they want
to make their clients happy they're
going to do it
and if sashko is coming across a little
harsh I would and you know we're bros
but I'm playing the devil's advocate
here it's a joke sasco comes across
harsh it's probably because he knows
what's coming down the pipeline with
meteor and he's super excited and so
these congregation about about
maintaining all this old cold he's like
oh why is this coming up again come on
people and we just don't know what he
knows right we're not excited about what
he's excited about but that's like my
son kind of getting an attitude with me
when I asked him about his homework or
something like I don't know about your
home life gave you the number don't get
an attitude with me that is a great
analogy right there it's saying like you
know clue us in I mean all of us here at
the end of the day we're all trying to
build businesses around using this
framework in you know none of us likes
to hear that we made a bad decision
because we made that decision based on
what they were giving us mm-hmm so to
hear that you know switching to react is
the way we should go that's a that's a
big deal for a lot of businesses that
are already around that is that is and
it's even bigger deal for the companies
that have built on top of plays and they
have maybe five to ten million dollars
in bc funding mm-hmm you know and then
going back to your investors you know at
your meetings at your update meetings
and saying oh we're going to like have
to like rebuild this huge part like our
whole our whole client side is and our
templates are going to be you know
rebuilt and react yeah so they're there
they have that in mind they are having
the painful conversations they had to
deal with that right now I think they go
as yeah yeah I think um I think they
have to you know Abigail kind of summed
up my concerns nicely with a list of
kind of questions that they should be
asking um and ultimately Evan you came
back and addressed a lot of it as well
um and I just want to mention this
because I I do feel like I'm trying to
find it here I don't feel like they're
listening in this thread and kind of
processing everything that we're saying
and that's that's awesome I like that
that's a good point
yeah um so I I think initially like
Evans post sounded bad but it's really
gonna be not as bad as it initially
sounded I purposely stayed out of this
whole conversation this whole forum post
because I was going to get lost in the
minutiae of it all mm-hmm and there was
just so much like there's a hundred and
seventy-five like yeah little responses
to read on this thing and like I don't
want to be notified by email of all this
oh here you go okay I found it so it's
really hard to address every question
this thread so i'll just do it generic
Q&amp;amp;A here and he just said like we're not
trying to reinvent the wheel here old
blaze will continue to work and it
should be totally possible to use both
at the same time in a project and i
think that that to me is awesome because
that means an incrementally upgrade and
pull it when it feels like you know oh
my gosh this piece of our app is like
amazingly better then you know you can
kind of do that so a blaze too is not
going to be a version update Oh blaze
template een package it's going to be a
whole nother package name right yep and
it seems likely it'll be inferred oh
thanks to Abigail everyone seems to be
calling it that now so in the thread so
you should just go read it's pretty
funny um and yeah so they believe that
you know I'm putting it out there I
think it should be called blunt blunt
yep yep the blaze is gone you just got a
blunt left and you're terrible I i do
not do drugs I don't advocate it yeah
that's not even like the blaze is gone
that's not what you call that a plan is
a different thing well maybe I hope man
I don't terrible terrible then I'm
trying to be funny on something I don't
know anything about um so yeah I don't
know
where does he say blaze in its current
form doesn't work very well if we made a
hundred percent backwards compatibility
react checks a lot of boxes in terms of
what we want to see in a better blaze
this is almost sounds like Matt wrote
this uh the same amount of effort is
what resources required to maintain a
computing solution with feature parity
in the same level mine stare is huge
it's probably not best friend Ichi gosh
there was something here I really liked
it now I can't remember hmm but here's
the kicker right like the single hardest
problem I've dealt with recently with
crater is server-side rendering spider
wool is horrible uh and I should I
should even I don't have the image on
this machine but I've got an image where
there's like 50 phantom j/s spun up so I
welcome better SSR yes like you know
Google can single-handedly kill crater
if they want yes so yeah and we just
revamped okay grows website and we built
in react and we used flow router SSR and
it was great it was not like some crazy
ordeal it was really nice traveler to
work with and pages load really fast
they really do I like I was really
impressed first once it was live I
loaded up on my mobile phone I was like
holy cow what so I'm happy with it yeah
one more Phantom good good you're done
you're done with the conversation I am
excited about okay so yeah so the old
people or the old apps that's yet to be
seen what what your environments going
to be like what your uphill battle is to
be to upgrade they have some sort of
understanding they have some big players
that are paying the money they use this
old stuff right now so I don't think it
can be very painful what I really like
to see is that we are going to be
getting out of the meteor cultish
mentality we're like so much is built by
mdg so much is like nicely packaged
together and and
all our knowledge can't really go and
apply to other technologies up right
right now blaze is going to be gone the
atmosphere is going to be washing down
plasa t it's going to be gone in
adoption to more industry standard
testing methods and test renders we're
going to have a web pack coming in we're
going to be depending more on NPM we're
going to be on react or angular and
meteor and what mdgs build is going to
be this nice developer wrapper around
all these technologies right that is
exciting because it is exciting we are
going to join this this javascript train
right in the future rather than having
our own strain on the side we are now
going to be part of the node world Maura
yeah in you know to to a point we had a
conversation offline I think you know
something like auto form is really hard
to maintain but in a react environment
maybe that's not so hard right like I'm
sure there's already components out
there that help you work with forms yeah
and you know I think well we can better
leverage larger communities to our
benefit and that's that's really what
that's about yeah and so I'm going to
start getting plugged in more with other
meetups around my area if meteor is
going to become like a wrapper around
these like other technologies well then
the real drive is these other
technologies so in meteor is just a nice
you know it's going to be I don't know
maybe a little bit more important than
the editor that you use by but it's
going to be developer experience a
rapper so yeah I I think there's one
other key point here that have been made
that I also found interesting is that
it's maintained by a dedicated team at
Facebook and it's used in production by
many serious businesses and those
serious businesses like we're not
talking small we're talking like Airbnb
we're talking netflix you know all kinds
of businesses that are doing super
interesting
in our society today so mm-hmm that's
that's not nothing yeah and that's so
that's a community we're joining so
people it's time to get off the blaze
train and be happy because you're about
to get on a uh I don't know who's that
dude who made Tesla Elon Musk Elon Musk
you're about to get on his a tube train
its tube train that's all those dog no
it's that I've totally drawn blanks here
you're totally gonna enter the tunnel no
time to go 800 miles an hour from LA to
San Francisco this was a long episode
I'll just say thanks for sticking with
us guys there was a lot of stuff we
missed last week ah so appreciate your
tolerance on a longer show but I think
we had a lot to say hopefully don't
freak out okay no matter what blaze will
stick around I just think at some point
it will become unsupported and that
sometime is probably not 1.3 maybe it's
it's well I guess you know we're talking
to oh right that's what semantically
versioned if it was there in 10 and they
drop support for it then we're gonna be
looking at 20 and hopefully they get a
little bit better about announcing when
these things are coming out I still
think we've heard about their blaze
investigation let's hear about 13 what's
going to be in there come on chef cue
that up for us yeah I think mdg is doing
a great job yeah at like a business plan
on what the stack is going to look like
in the future a business plan well
they're talking about what the stacks
going to be in the future that is
congruent with them making money as
business well I like it I like it I like
it come because value you can't have we
won't complain like oh they're too slow
there did not getting all this stuff out
well you know frankly uh might be a lot
faster if they're not having to write
every single line of code themselves
yeah it's gonna be awesome it is really
going to be awesome mdg and meteors
going to be here to stay
for a very long time they're going to
have developers be super happy working
with with what they have what I guess
what we're asking for is we want to hear
more from Matt and Jeff absolutely
that's a that's what we want we love you
guys so much that's what I think we
won't always ask for yeah definitely
yeah yeah all right all right team yeah
