22nd 2016 welcome crater fans i'm your
host josh olins one with my co-host been
do good welcome Ben hey how's it going
good it's been a while yes yeah
podcasting I'm glad to be back at it
though yeah so yeah we been about I
guess about a week a little over a week
since we got back from space camp and
just decided to try to get back to it I
know I've been particularly busy Abby's
been busy so I asked Ben to hop on him
maybe we can get an episode done just
raskin hey what what happened so good
here we are glad to be here so uh 1 if
you're looking for there's gonna be a
lot of videos coming out on my channel
soon on youtube if you happen to watch
that got a number of videos from the
summer bit of mobile comp and then also
have the videos from space camp as well
which was pretty awesome but today we're
gonna talk about goodbye meteor hasta
LaVista Oh graphical summit videos react
15.4 is out and yarn versus NPM which we
were talking about uh you and I before
the show like I don't think we've we've
done a show since yarn came out a melon
think so yeah so no I'll talk a little
bit about yarn to find an interesting
alright so yeah I read here it's a big
one um yeah so Aaron Oda like if you
haven't been paying attention maybe you
didn't notice but there hasn't been a
lot of activity going on over an aaron
knodel and
with the stuff they're doing with meteor
um and I think that's because he's moved
on right yeah and that's essentially
what this post confirmed I talked to him
when I was in New York had dinner and
over at Lauren sands Ram shells house
and he you know it was just clear to me
at that point that he was mostly moved
on from meteor was doing a ton of things
with it and you know when I privately
asked him about flow router he said it's
probably better if you yeah you know I
think at that point he was kind of done
but I think it's just like eventually
i'm glad he said something right like he
has a lot of projects that have a lot of
users and it's probably better to go the
route of saying something than not
saying something like iron router and
just kind of let it stick he's you know
the gist of the post is it was fun i'm
glad i got to do it uh I'm more
interested in other technologies now and
he's looking for people to help out with
the open source projects so if you use
fast render flowroute or muff any of
that kind of stuff don't find the repos
and go open an issue or find an issue
that someone's already open that's
talking about like taking over the
project because it's the only way these
things survive at this point yeah well
obviously really very notice been great
for the media community I think
obviously we joke around about which era
nada bot made this cuz he was doing a
whole lot of stuff just all the time it
was crazy um you know i think you're
right i think i remember manter came out
or mantra came out seems pretty
interesting and the eid kind of led the
the react charge um and then slowly
slowly started doing more react things
and yeah I think you're right it was
they were even doing a bunch of graft
you all things before I think even
Apollo had started
yeah yeah and so yeah I think it if you
were paying a little bit of tension or
you know had seen some of the stuff he
was doing I think it made sense um so
yeah I think you handled it cleanly and
I still appreciated all the things they
are noted so yeah definitely I mean you
know even like I've been busy working
with foot cardigan for the last couple
months and trying to get there meteor
app ready for production launch and you
know the last thing that I did we put
the launch on hold up because we're
getting too close to their busiest time
with black friday and cyber monday but
like the last pieces that i was working
on was SSR and like his hand is like his
fingerprints are just all over
everywhere you go and you're looking at
SSR a meteor like he pioneered a lot of
that early work so very appreciative for
that and certainly made my life a lot
easier in terms of getting that piece
done four foot cardigans definitely I
appreciate everything that he certainly
brought to the table and you know I
don't think that he's focusing on
storybook at this point we don't know
what's gonna happen with Khedira like he
didn't reference shutting it down or
anything but at the same time like I
can't imagine they're gonna put much
effort into it so I didn't leave a
comment on the article like what what
does this mean for khedira uh actually
no I'm thinking about it did he respond
oh um no doesn't look like it so I don't
know yeah yeah that's interesting i also
know that he said he started a new
medium publication so if you're
interested in staying in the araneta
loop javascript mantra was what he
called that mm-hmm there's a link at the
bottom and uh actually I'm because I saw
that the other day he he posted some it
was it was the next day s story right oh
yes yes that's the other interesting
thing like I'm finding next
yes I realize like I I didn't put it on
let's talk about but I didn't want to
talk about a little bit because I've
been playing with it as well and like
I'm super impressed with what they've
put together so far and you know I
honestly like it a little bit better
than create reactor um and I don't know
like I'm i'm super-interested to see
them push forward and get a little bit
more support so that's got its own
router and it's got server side
rendering built-in by default and it's
just react in web pack and the thing you
do is make sure you put any of your data
fetching in the get initial props and
it'll make sure that it gets word
properly further summary yeah and then
they just use the file system has the
the routing API right yeah yeah
four-page names yeah you just make a
file on the pages folder and like
that'll stitch it together and yeah yeah
there zeit zeit I'm not sure how to say
it and I've done some really really cool
stuff yeah yeah like that's the other
thing to like you know having having
played with numerous deployment options
for the various things I've built over
the years like they they have now about
sh and like that was stupid simple to
deploy yeah next is app and you know and
like other people have made a bill pack
for Heroku as well so if that's your jam
um and then I was playing I'm planning
on playing around with dokku or Doku I
don't know it was cool yeah and uh so
since you already have a bill pack like
theoretically you should just be able to
use that bill pack and throw this up on
digital ocean as well so then the new
crater comp site I'm getting ready to
launch the credit column JavaScript
edition for 2017 super excited about it
but I built the entire thing and next
Jas and rather than doing anything
create the database i actually just have
a javascript file that has an object in
it that just giving them and like it
just renders that out and react and you
know good to go I mean if it's static
why why not make sense um yeah we should
have a brush as I you say his name
mm-hmm on the space station podcast just
yeah that that's not a bad idea i'm
asking onto the uh it's no big one no
cuz he's definitely gonna be given he's
agreed to give a talk at UM greater comp
as well so I'm jinx I've been about that
he was excited to hear i was using next
Jess as well so yeah I don't know like
if if you're if you're looking for is
like the number one question I'm getting
right now is like is me you're dead and
I'm dead I definitely feel like it's at
this point where it's moving slower yeah
um a lot of the rest of the communities
out there the JavaScript communities and
what they're doing and like people
building individual pieces you can can't
I together and build something great I
also think like in general they're
moving slower than they ever have as a
team right because they really just have
one guy this um excuse me and like it's
just not my keys I appreciate been so
much mark I super smart guy but never
gonna be able to move at the pace that
they used to move and I feel like you've
lost a lot of their innovation and
things that made them unique or special
as a platform to choose like a lot of
that starting to go away and I don't
know like I people are asking like oh
what's gonna be the next big thing like
i have no idea for me like I'm building
react apps and I'm just interested like
the piece I haven't figured out is how
to get data to the front end and you
know maybe that's maybe that's uh Falkor
or maybe that's
I'll back you all oh I have no idea
right yeah but I'm interested in
learning and I think to me next jess is
gonna continue to push forward and
probably be that piece on the front end
that makes the most sense and if it's
not maybes create rock tap react up or
something like that but definitely like
I don't I probably going forward won't
be building a lot of media absolutely
yeah I think it's I so they soak
reactive has this mpm eject script right
where they just eject the config and you
can't undo from that once you've
rejected like that's that and then you
handle it yourself and it's almost like
meteor is a more way more overarching
build system that you can't eject from
so that's why it's kind of you know all
in or not it at all well in you know
part of that was uh I think there's no
way to eject because you're locked into
their package system right yeah and like
we got we got a like a partial eject
button like we can i jacked half the eff
yeah with the NPM support that Cayman
1.3 but the problem is like I I still
haven't heard anything about 1.5 um and
I I don't like they can't even I don't
know okay I'll just say it like I I feel
like they've moved the majority of their
team over to Apollo and working on
Apollo and um our next story to me
speaks a lot about where meteors head is
that or MDGs head is at about them um
and like they just they haven't even
like 1.5 they made the changes they it's
gonna be all about Apollo but I haven't
seen any stuff coming out about 1.5 or
where they're out with their Paulo
integration and it seems like if
Apollo's their next big thing when they
want some smart media integration
they're like ready to go
you know being it so i don't know like
I'm very very confused by how they're
operating I honestly like if i had to
guess um like you know you keep hearing
about how they want to turn things over
to the community and get them more
involved but i'm just seeing those
things kind of flounder as well so I
don't know like I'm not feeling super
great about the future of meteor at this
point but I've probably felt that way
for over a year now so it's not none of
this is a big shock to me yeah I think
there's just been a shift to focusing
more on Apollo and and realizing that
you know they started doing this I guess
full stack JavaScript jobs pretty close
to before anyone else was doing things
like this now we have all these
different ways there's a ton of
different ways to handle all these
things if you look at the react
ecosystem and what people are doing over
there it's like a lot of different
approaches and it's moving really fast
and so because of that and because
meteors desire to have legacy support
just unlike migration story is really
good there they're kind of trapped in
this older system um um I think you know
again having NPM is a way to to
hopefully make that more feel more
futuristic and stuff but you're still
hooking into their build system which
seems to be really complicated along
with you know there's only you said it
there's only one guy working my
meteorite now mmm fellow Ben and yeah
that's that's tough and so they're not
moving very fast I I wouldn't said that
meteor is dead I think there's a ton
happening in Apollo and I think they've
been doing a really good job I guess I
guess marketing is the right word
marketing that and and building that
where I think a lot of people even
outside of the meteor community are
using Apollo oh yeah well i think that's
that's the great piece about like
building so I've come to this conclusion
that libraries are probably better than
frameworks I think that it's it's fine
to have loosely created frameworks but
maybe not like tightly coupled
frameworks like I think meteor is so if
you look at you know if you look at
meteor vs graph qo like the
decision-making process
that is like I gotta buy into a whole
lot of things to start using meteor what
is if I want to use graph ql I can
actually just set that up and start
using it in a piece of my app right like
plenty of people are using Apollo or
graph q on general with you know rails
or Erlang and elixir and Phoenix um or
you know there's there's a number of
people that are consuming this without
necessarily having to buy into any one
particular thing like you don't even
have to use react in order to use Apollo
awake or graph ql like there's a relay
you know there's a ton of options to get
this working with react or angular or
any of the other frameworks like view or
you know feathers or so I mean there's a
there's just a ton of options out there
right now and so I you know I think it's
just easier to buy into graph qol and so
yeah it's probably why that makes a lot
more sense for them in the long run
business wise because of you to build a
product for me here graph ql like
getting a full stack by and for meteor
is a really tough sell and i think
that's that's what they've seen over
time that's caused them to shift their
focus in the graph ql and do things like
the graph ql summit there we go yeah
graph chill summit was super cool um and
they were there was a ton of talks uh
from a bunch of different people they
had Lee buyer in there one of the guys
who I guess helped co-found graph ql uh
super cool they had a panel that have
been using graph killin production you
should check out the videos um you get a
chance to watch any of these Josh I have
not yet I'm uh I'm gonna try to sit down
over thanksgiving break and kind of
speed through them I tend to watch
youtube videos at like 1.5 speed or Jim
speed if I can stand it it depends on
the speaker but it's definitely a good
way like I love watching YouTube videos
but um yeah I definitely like I'm
excited to hear about the the talk from
shopify and what they're doing graphic
you up so that's that's probably the
first one I'll check out and then you
know obviously like lee lee's a good
speaker Cemil um excited to watch his
talking yeah he's a great speaker um and
so he talked about just four years of
graph killer four years in and kind of
so he had this little sheet that was a
best-case scenario his kind of
predictions and he said um basically
said in in two to four years large
companies and text giants would would
start to pick up graph ql and we've seen
that happen no github I'm obviously
Facebook is using a github is released a
public I think it's in beta still but I
think they have almost I think it's all
an update somewhere that said they had
pretty much everything I'm all their
api's under graph ql now i'm still in
like a developer beta or a preview but
it's pretty cool and i think we'll start
to see more of these companies choose
graph ql um yeah I think the advantages
are super awesome and I'm a huge fan of
graph kill so yeah I i think you know
again like I've talked about it before
like it solves real-world problems that
I think exists with how rest operates
you know like I've talked about before
working at godaddy and the transition
from like this amorphous like API that
that was just kind of built haphazardly
for a backbone app but like you know we
were trying to switch it over so that
there was a unified API between the
mobile and the JavaScript application on
the front end and like that was that was
a really difficult thing to do and I
think we're a few all kind of solves
that problem and similarly like as a
consumer like that's as someone who's
creating the API to be consumed that's
that's definitely promise it solves the
other problem is you know as a consumer
of an API it can be very very
frustrating to have to like build up
this series of rest calls that you have
to do you know and like I'm gonna grab
this data first and then I need this
little piece of it and I'm gonna go grab
this other data from this other call and
then like that allows you to start
iterating over and making a bunch of
call
to get data out of an API and I think
that that graph qol equally solves that
problem and frankly like the developer
tools just have always impressed me as
well I think that's that's just a super
important part of building something
that you want like high adoption in like
build really good developer tools that
make everyone's job a little bit easier
and it's gonna become a big thing in my
opinion um that's that's something that
the graph here all team has done well
yeah and I also saw this recently graph
doc gear a PhD SC um on the to FD github
account know what that is but they
essentially just take your your graph
qaul schema and they convert it into a
static page that's all the you know the
documentation for it and it's the same
thing you get in the editor but they
make it a static static page which is
pretty cool um but yeah I think the
tooling is great I maybe graph kills
just ruined to me and it's like I never
want to write rest again cuz because why
yeah I don't know it's much better to
just say this is the data I mean and
here's the piece you need to help me
build that and then give me the data
back you know and um I think you to me
the apollo team is doing super
interesting exciting things as well you
know like they've they've actually got
better subscription support out now so
that's starting to look interesting so
yeah I'm kind of excited about it it
does you know it it it's an interesting
dichotomy because like we were talking
before about meteor and one of the
things that is super easy to do is like
get started and not have to feel like
you're doing a ton of boilerplate that
kind of thing like doing a graph qu elle
project like i actually put one on hold
for a little while because it just felt
like there was so much boilerplate
involved with getting everything set up
like you just I don't know I got
frustrating it's like that uh I'm a
developer Twitter account and there have
you ever seen that yeah I am developer
or whatever yeah
like yeah they're like there was a tweet
where it's like oh we did a hackathon
this weekend and oh how'd it go uh well
we got we got babel configured yeah that
was it good oh it definitely feels like
some of that stuff can be a little tough
and so like that's also why i'm excited
to see things like next and create react
app and it makes some of that stuff a
little bit easier but there's still a
lot of setup that you have to do ya know
say maybe we just need to create graph
qi lap but uh you're still think that
that's hard because I mean you have to
define a type system like it is
boilerplate because you're saying okay
you know that you're defining the schema
which is kind of boilerplate II um why
am it's what I give it like I have to go
like right the resolvers I think we need
just a little bit of convention over
configuration type of stuff in a graph
ql project and just say like I resolvers
folder and my resolvers just live there
and you know i don't know like auto
loadings probably not a great thing so I
it's gonna be hard to make a case for
that but um just like wandering all the
little parts together like you know you
gotta get you gotta have the the schema
define and then why are in the resolvers
and the queries and the mutaters and all
that kind of stuff like just seems like
a lot to warren and then like you've got
the express app and then you've got like
a separate app for the front end and you
gotta get them to talk together and then
feels like you're finally doing
something yeah there's a lot but it
takes a while we'll see yeah but it's
great to integrate grass ql with react
the better segue would have been doing
yeah I tried so yes 15.4 came out and
one of the big things like and maybe you
if you haven't read yet like you haven't
done a deep-dive or you don't follow dan
mom you might not have seen it but um
part of the the 15.4 is that they have
react perf integration with chrome tools
now and so if you haven't usually a perv
you can just throw is like a little ?
you just throw on the end of your react
bit and it'll pick it up and fire off
the reactor stuff and but it'll give you
a flame graph and it gives you the
breakdown of like what it was doing for
each component and win and that kind of
thing and so if you click on the link in
the show notes uh go scroll down about
about a third of the way into the
article profiling components to chrome
timeline and that's the thing that one
is super interesting me about this
release so assuming so the notes here
say load your app with ? react
underscore perf yeah they are only
string i'm assuming they're talking
about create create react app maybe
that's a good question uh i would have
seemed sad because you'd have to hook
into the room okay yeah um yeah so but
you know you get this lovely like flame
graph that shows you what's going on and
it gives you it shows you like hey this
this component was mounted and then it
was updating and this one was mounted
updating so it gives you a really good
breakdown of where you're spending the
time um and then I don't like I haven't
done a ton of using the the timeline tab
but it says don't record more than 20
seconds so good copy I'm a lot go home
apparently it's a lot of data I'm
guessing um and then they've they've
done some other things like you can mock
out refs for snapshot testing and but
the probably the single biggest thing is
they made the move in in 0 da 14 to
split out react dumb from react itself
but apparently you know it wasn't a
fully completed move
and with this this release apparently
it's now a fully operational battle star
I don't it secretly lived there so you
shouldn't have any problems unless you
were grabbing methods right not it
wasn't like a huge change it's just if
you were under the covers like using
pieces of react by loading individual
libraries like this might be something
that you'll have to pay attention to
when you upgrade but yeah for the most
part it's it's kind of a silent and easy
thing to migrate to actually haven't got
two apps i need to move them to the
newest version let's see how I mean it's
so like the way they do versioning is if
you don't have any like deprecation good
mornings then it's you should upgrade to
the next version alright this that's
breaking changes isn't it so yeah one
reacts 16 comes out of you have no like
deprecation warnings you should be fine
but if you do have them you fixed them
and then the next version whatever that
up for kitty deprecated warning blog
message just said those will be removed
so pretty cool way of moving along but I
don't know I don't know if even react to
be 16 is on the horizon right now
because I don't know i don't even know
this about crater much but reactive been
working on this react fiber um I'm
assuming that's gonna be version 16 I
think so yeah but they'd I'm as is he
excited about that because I convinced a
lynn clark to give a talk have you seen
her speak before i have not yet it's
been it's a GS I have several on my
backlog but I know I've read a bunch of
her stuff that she's getting its really
good she does the the cartoons um and
she did a good talk at react off last
year that was like it showed redox and
the various kind of front end data
management options she did like a
cartoon version of that but she's gonna
do a cartoon version of like what is
react fiber and wife
so I'm pretty stoked about that but like
I saw today they've got like is react
fiber ready yet calm yeah that's nice
that it's like that I like it cuz
they've got like the test suite on there
and it shows like I think 98 a 1.4 yeah
the prey one-point-four percent passing
yeah you know we're gonna hopefully
that'll drop soon but it's a big huge
effort to like rework how everything is
rendered yeah just really the
implementation so v16 shouldn't be like
from us or from consumers have reacted
shouldn't be too different I don't think
I think the plan is to pretty much
support the same at least es6 API I
don't know what's gonna happen to react
to create class and that but yeah
they're gonna but all of a sudden
ideally perf civ go should be much
better um and there's been other
libraries I think Inferno another talked
about um I've seen people talk about on
twitter being like basically a fiber ish
implementation they do really well / fly
so so that's really cool to see ya yeah
i'm i'm super excited for all that and
you know if you're whenever you think
about upgrading you gotta think about
how you gonna get the libraries there
yeah which brings us to yarn and then PM
yourn so another thing that's come out
of facebook or lease it wasn't just
Facebook a couple of people from
facebook in along with and I should have
the list ready but uh I know you hear
dia cats which is one of the big ember
guys as well but there was other people
too uh it's called this thing yarn yarn
package said github.com / yarn PKG /
yarn um and yeah so it's NPM except it's
way faster uh so yeah it's faster I
would say the other big thing is like is
shrink wraps by default right so you get
the lock file and
like the versioning between deploys is
better um you know I like i don't i
don't know how many people you shrink
wrap like you have you ever used mpm
shrink wrap well i haven't but i know i
know i know people who have and they
like shrink wrap wasn't always perfect
it was still possible to to mess up and
and i guess when you get really big apps
with a lot of different i guess
translated it can shrink wrap can be
funky sometimes um but yes yarn set out
to solve that because you know facebook
was trying to or all these companies
we're trying to get rid of the it works
on my machine excuse by with yarn and
just having completely the same build
every time you run you run yarn so yarn
is the equivalent of NPM install you can
do yarn add which would be NPM install
bash Dash save whatever package so yarn
add package name and then it by default
adds it to the package.json as well
which i think is cool because sometimes
you forget to run npm install dash dash
save and then you push and somebody's
like you didn't save it yeah what of
like why is this broken what did you
break yeah break anything understand i
could be safe um yeah so that's cool but
uh so the other thing and then the
reason it's so fast is because no no i'm
not exactly sure how they're doing is I
think it's pretty straightforward where
you just you just if you've yourn
installed or yarn added react 15.4 point
now before then the next time it added
it just pulls it from the cash um
directly and so their installs are super
fast where you could essentially have
you could yarn install or yarn things
offline so i know people have kicked
around the idea of having like an NPM
package that's just like a yarn warm-up
essentially where it just installs like
the the top I don't have 2000 packages
or something and so you could just work
offline essentially what you people yeah
and so like if you the thing is if
you're from the media community uh this
your yard is probably closer to how
media itself like their package system
works
um because they they tend to have a
global cache and so most people don't
realize like you have this the dot
meteor folder hidden in the root of your
home directory and it's about all those
files in there they do some linking
whereas when yarn does everything it
looks like it actually copies the files
as far as i can tell into the node
modules directory the interesting thing
is like this is this is like a drop-in
replacement for mpm mm-hmm um you know
because it's still using you know the
same NPM package registry it's still
using the node modules folder it's still
using the package.json so like
everything is like a one-to-one kind of
replacement and they're they're very
very interested in making it speedy you
know like there's always those jokes
about like um waiting at the PM like
fetching packages prompts or whatever
downloading the internet it's my go-to
joke yes um but you know I think it's
it's super interesting to see that they
they undertook this this project and
like I've used it and I'm quite happy
with yarn again this is something that
next is kind of out of the box prompts
you to use yeah but it's just it's
really really interesting to see and so
the the story in question is actually
from one of our community members Chet
corcos which he was at Space Camp it was
fun to hang out with him um and he just
ran some timings trying to understand
like what's the difference between
what's the speed difference between yarn
and mpm and you know he so he did a
fresh install and then a second install
and timed it out and with NPM install on
first try it was like same application
right so we're just we're trying to
compare apples to apples 111 seconds to
do the NPM install and then the second
install ran in 27 seconds and for
comparison you're
say map 53 seconds to do the first
install in 0.48 second so about half a
second to do the secondary install um
and so you know it definitely is a lot
faster yeah it caches successfully and I
know I so it yeah like it's a drop-in
replacement for the NPM CLI which is
really just a client for or NPM because
I guess NPM obviously there's the
registry and a bunch of other stuff too
and so when am I as Mitchell thoughts
was wow this is amazing so why don't we
just convert everything to yarn and just
never use NPM again well maybe not ever
but so yeah at the same time that this
was announced the NPM ain't ketab a blog
post saying they were they think yarn is
awesome um and they're not the first you
know seal our other implementation of a
MDM client to exist like hey there are
these other ones um yeah we're still
really excited to see yarn we hope it
succeeds uh what you think is
interesting cuz um when they released
what was a version for today yeah for is
out I I don't even know what the
breaking changes are but had to see for
his out so I think cuz they be young
people on the Iron team were on
JavaScript air uh recently I guess
that's a second last episode um these
unsetting it for now but we'll see uh
and they talked about you know they just
had different goals like if you try to
drop in yarn to a really old no npm be
10 or or sorry node be 10 and 0 b 12
like it might not work things are a
little different um ran BM is really
again really focused on backwards
compatibility yarn is not so much
they're pretty much I don't even know
what versions have notice for I imagine
it's for enough but maybe it's six
enough yeah I'm trying to probably for
I would think for for sure like the
project I was on canvas version four
node okay then then yeah definitely for
oh yeah and and for is still currently
like the long term for today so um
anyway there's this is a um I'm looking
this is like you can search for chichis
that kind of show you the difference
ligands um but I really think so to me I
give you who two cats a lot of credit
here as well because um i think for him
to step up for me involved in this is
pretty awesome too because you know he's
got a lot of knowledge about dependency
management like he he started out in
rails and really am the berber community
and working on that kind of stuff and
built bundler which was you know you had
rubygems which was ok but bundler was
really the first kind of dependency like
serious dependency management that that
we had in in the rails community and so
he worked on that pretty extensively and
i think he had a lot of knowledge right
and so like they're tilde which you you
who cats is a co-founder of like they
spend a lot of time working on ember and
building apps that way so i think this
is definitely like mpm there's problems
that needed to be sold here and i'm
super glad that he got on board and
certainly helped out with that yeah so
it's pretty exciting i've also seen that
you should not random yarn side note you
should not publish your yarn dot lock
file to a library you're not locks are
supposed treatment for apps um and yeah
because I way your your apps don't get
bug fixes and stuff if they rely on
sember as it should be but yeah you can
google that if you're curious I know Dan
and some other people talked a lot about
that it was pretty interesting but it
seems really cool yeah I me um I may
throw the announcement into the show
notes to the Facebook announcement I
kind of walked you through why I think
that's worth taking a look at vanilla
and I think I'm pretty sure I like I
can't find it in the article now but I'm
pretty sure like the yarn client
downloads the various dependencies in
parallel that's really it's one of the
reasons it's faster I would think so
I've seen I've seen in the various you
know again like Chuck's article a lot of
people posted um just various metrics
and I've seen ones that would install
cuz somehow it'll still be tittles
without the cash so with a clear cache
it'll still be 10pm yeah yeah well
definitely look something faster if you
look at that article like it like it
almost beat em p.m. on the second
installment I think the first install
took a hundred eleven seconds make an
install with NPM took 27 seconds uh yarn
only took 50 seconds on its first
install so like it's it's it's already
really close to what a cached version of
NPM is doing so yeah um I think it's
like super super fast and like this is
this is the kind of thing like I'm I'm
excited to see because I think like you
know moving this stuff along making it
faster again super great for developers
and another reason like I'm excited for
javascript is because these kinds of
things are important and people are
working on them and even though like you
know we're all just trudging through and
dealing with mmm and its slowness in the
way it functions and the weirdness for
answering crab lake I'm glad people are
thinking about this stuff and trying to
figure out ways to make this better and
yeah look certainly like brought a lot
of people to the table but a lot of
other outsiders not at Facebook helped
out swell definitely I know they got a
lot of knowledge from the one of the
co-founders our founder of cargo um
which is the rest package manager which
is supposedly super awesome when I think
is very similar to how yarn works but
you know what exactly sure awesome stuff
the JavaScript world is moving on we are
always fatigue he's good hey JavaScript
great again when I was cooking it's
always getting great great yes ah
alright well thank you everyone for
tuning in and thank you ben for hopping
on its course then get back on the horse
I'm actually like I need to follow up
but i'm kind of excited i think the the
Falkor guys we might be able to snag
some of those to get on the space dojo
show let me ask me John I'm super
excited about so sure definitely look
for us to be putting out more content on
YouTube and on the podcast feed and I
may even have another podcast brewing
soon so I could be exciting alright
