25th 2015 welcome crater fans i'm your
host josh owens along with my co-host
and Strahan the mouthing mind Benjamin
Strahan how are you Josh I am fantastic
fantastic I'm drinking a nine percent
alcohol beer so very good I came across
a silly facebook video a while ago and I
thought of us and I was like man we
gotta drink this this silly beer Oh
online so like while the show is going
did you see the two polish guys or
German guys drink helium beer no oh my
gosh that's bizarre it was hilarious did
it change their voice yes autos fake it
was all fake yeah I did a lot of
research on it too and I was like man we
got Josh and I gotta do this it's baked
yeah that's a bummer well so it could be
interesting like our podcast is too long
but could be interesting to like use a
little bit helium maybe we'll do that in
opening one day just like yes helium
hello challenge hold on today not even
close how you doing Ben are you doing
that forget about it yeah Oh what are we
doing here man Judith uh well I'm having
a great day because we sold out a space
camp yes Oh boom congratulations on that
thank you I'm I'm so excited like wendy
and i have been brainstorming trying to
make sure it's gonna be an awesome time
so i showed some of the people the
t-shirts that amanda put together so i'm
gonna try to get those order this
weekend so awesome did you get my
request for the extra large tall or what
our large tall oh wait no you have a
beer beer allergy that's what I was you
did get it yeah all that I said Wendy
Ben has a beer allergy
well he'll have to regulate did you see
the other the other thing at the bottom
oh gosh there was another piece yeah you
had like additional notes I did took
advantage of it cuz I figured no one
would write in there you know someone
someone wrote in about you on their
additional no no they did not yes they
did they totally did they said I'm a
little scared of Benjamin Strahan no
they didn't yes I kid you uh what's that
form thing I use type form that's it
yeah I got a log in oh yeah for the
record someone hijacked my computer and
uh huh uh huh put in your email address
likely story it wasn't my email address
either haha yeah it was like spanky ha
ha ha ha I look at these things you know
I do I was testing you uh-huh ah you may
smell a fart when I'm around but I can
assure you it did not come from me
that's right as said by bench it's right
Spanky at Penn Street and that count
nice he's scared to meet me yeah uh it
was uh sir charles Watson oh I think he
said just kidding at the end but he said
uh benster scares me JK he is the bottom
bunk we're bunking together oh yeah yeah
oh so yeah you know like I gotta I gotta
figure some of this out cuz like there's
a guy that has a CPAP machine for sleep
apnea but he bought a pack room it's
like yeah gonna figure out how to are
those things noisy so I hear I don't
have first-hand experience but my wife's
ex had one and she said they were noisy
so hmm I have to find a volunteer to
bunk in that room
all right anyway uh anyway yeah on with
the show on with the show the first ever
crater podcast so technically this is
the 75th show that feels kind of like a
big deal is it yeah everyone thank you
for your support yeah I've been at this
a while and yeah so we're changing the
name to be crater podcast so we're going
to talk about some different things
today so what are we talking about we're
talking about graph ql no i totally
typed that wrong i typed graph sequel
apparently it's muscle memory SQL uh we
have some notes everyone if you're
wondering what he's read a graph ql and
relay we're gonna talk a little bit
about meteor one point something
something came out i don't know what
that was yeah uh collection by reference
blaze plus blaze plus bus and query
constructors cool all right let's get
into the show yes my tabs are i totally
missed that totally miss what I'm
supposed to be your co-host I'm supposed
to catch that oh yeah oh oh man I'm so
delayed all right for those who watch
Gary Vee yes yes I'm a fan of Gary me uh
so yeah Aaron Oda wrote something uh
let's see three days ago I didn't read
it tilted a little behind the times and
then heads down you've been heads down
to you told me that before the show Yeah
Yeah so the he decided to play with Greg
qol and relay and that they're open
source and kind of comparing trast was
more like just looking at it and kind of
thinking through how it works and what
could be better um what I'm kind of
interested in and what I asked him down
in the comments is like
is this compared to you know your
experience with me here so far because
he said like I have a meteor bias so I
need to like not put that in the article
and I think you mentioned meteor in one
spot but to me like I even though we're
the crater podcast now I think we'll
still always have a little bit of meteor
slant to it um I'm curious like how does
graph ql play out versus um you know
meteors server side offering kind of
thing yeah and he didn't really cover
that so I think we'll we'll still be
waiting on that maybe he'll listen to
this and maybe we'll get another article
next week that would be awesome but yeah
it looks like I mean he talks about how
relays handling optimistic updates and
graph ql is kind of handling the
quitting for data type of stuff so they
kind of work together hand in hand it's
a good read i I'd recommend it he does
have some suggestions in the end you'd
like to see that the mutation updates
and simulations right the latency
compensation should come out of graph ql
and not necessarily come out of not
necessarily live on its own and and
relay like i can see some advantages and
disadvantages that right so if we're
talking about the latency compensation
if you think about it like i tend to
write my meteor methods to be isomorphic
so they run on both the client and the
server and then if there's like a little
weird side effect that doesn't work in
the client i'll just run it like thrown
if server statement in there and run
that one line of code but if you're the
most part like I right 11 little
function there that handles doing
everything and it should work relatively
the same in the in the server and the
client right and i think that's that's
what he's getting out there with the
with the first um
at least that's what we're used to yeah
when he was explaining graph ql at the
top it was pretty interesting that he
was going through where people would use
this and a big benefit was like jumping
into existing apps and having to be able
to plug graph ql under there so then i
could see where relay would be a
distinct difference in that situation so
i don't know i could see where we're
facebook was making that decision to
separate the two yeah yeah they did but
at the same time like I think maybe
gives you a little more power to be able
to to modify like I have really handle
it in a different way but I still think
you could probably send down some
simulation code from graph ql and then
you know override it if you need to on
the relay side you know and that
probably helps a good bit because
chances are in a bigger team anyway
you're gonna you're gonna have those are
gonna be like two separate teams kind of
working on things yeah in a bigger
project interesting I like it yeah yeah
like I said I it's good read I think you
know it's probably dense like if you're
gonna try to wrap your head around
everything it might be a little tough I
know I've read it twice I actually give
you this story first and you're like but
you take it um so I think it was like
hot potato yeah oh it's yours oh but uh
no I think I think it's a good read it's
probably worth reading even if you don't
understand it read it two or three times
and even pretend you understand it um
but yeah I think I think the better
article at least for the media community
would be like how does it actually
compared to meteor and how does he feel
like it is it worth learning you know
like I think a lot of us respect her
anoda and kind of respect his opinion so
yeah definitely worth hearing that
that perspective and we have to like so
isomorphic code it's like come in
mainstream and we have to I don't know
like go where the flow goes goes what I
Kevin sick man it's like I'm drinking
are you diet geez take me home I'm
something for you by the way it's like
okay so me so Facebook is is kind of
like driving this and now a sudden they
they put this out there and they have a
bigger stage right now so they do yeah I
mean they have more eyeballs on them
naturally because they have such a big
platform yeah so then the question is
when people have choice they're probably
go with that with the thing that that
more people are familiar with you know I
it's it's probably worth pointing out to
like uh facebook is at a level that most
of us will never attain with our
businesses or are apps that we're trying
to build so I mean I think react is
probably a good thing but at the same
time like I don't exactly like turn to
big tables as my go-to database just
because like it helps Google scale to
infinite higher numbers than I'll ever
even care to dream about right right so
I don't know i mean that's interesting
as well probably worth pointing out yeah
dude so we had something amazing happen
I was totally I was closed on my
prediction but I was I was off by a
couple days I was gonna just say like we
were predicting different dates like the
year of year in here yeah I'm pushing it
out we are I thought I really did
honestly think it was gonna be August I
was maybe a little disappointed it
wasn't yeah so everyone we're talking
about the release of meteor 1.2 like
what meteor says it is one of the most
ambitious releases other than one point
oh and it brings a lot of new things and
it really i don't know it's starting to
shape up to have meteor be a serious
player in the community
and in that sense I'm saying that
they're opening up to the community
media has always been like hey we got
everything for you we're full stack we
got everything for you and now they're
like opening up and they're like hey
we're full stack but now you can take
things out you can plug things in we're
more modular yeah that was one big
announcement and so now there's support
for angular and react as well as blaze
the cool thing is is you started up and
and you have blazed off the bat but you
can easily remove it now whereas before
you couldn't and it's just like media
remove and it's not blaze it's like
blaze dash something there's something I
forgot but it's a package yeah move it's
pretty simple and then you can add
angular or react you're off to the races
without the needed a fluff or get out I
mean like a lot of this stuff like at
least the package rejiggering that they
did isn't anything new like if you go
look at your your meteor version right
like it's all listed there um they're
just kind of changing the umbrella I
guess and what's included in how it gets
to you um in a way that makes more sense
which is I think helpful right that's
one thing yep I you know I'll be honest
I kind of wish we would have seen a like
a 111 come out or you know something
along those lines really before 12 came
out because when we had a number of
things that were sitting behind here
that were interesting and honest I don't
think they've been dipped in awhile and
yeah like I was talking to someone today
and they pointed out that there was
something that was completely
undocumented on the docks website but it
was already committed and it had been in
in the branch for months and months and
months and it just SAT there because 1.2
wasn't out yet and that's what was that
differ number wasn't differ it was not
in attacks either yeah it was it's a
simple one but it was something else it
had to do with an environment variable
i'm pretty sure but you know I've
frankly there's a lot of things that
aren't documented
working with Dean last week and we
figured out how to flip on one thing I
wanted to do for a while like easily use
clap front and turns out there's a
undocumented environment variable and
there's also an undocumented method you
can call within meteor that will let you
set a CDM prefix so there's actually two
different ways to do it um and that must
wasn't documented either but I mean
there's a number of great things in here
right like rate limiting we saw a blog
post drop about rate limiting yep two or
three months ago and that was folded
into 1.2 we've got some i flogged
optimizations should help with the load
on your server they're using something
called fences now to kind of handle that
so akma script 2015 that was a big one
right like the ECMO script should have
been one point to the angular and the
react stuff should have been one point
to the I feel like the op log
optimizations maybe the rate limiting
like that stuff should have maybe
dropped in a in a 1 point 11 yep they
updated Cordova hey Dale using NPM now
for the package manager yeah and they're
using Cordova five mm-hmm so that was
big stuff uh so this was a good update
it was and all the frustrations that
josh is talking about i think is like
right on but the cool thing is and maybe
we could talk about this it right now is
that a big forum post came out called
the future of meteor and people could go
there and like read up on everything in
there there was a great conversation
going on and sashko like took it would
stride and said hey like I is all this
all means to me that we got to step up
the velocity of the stuff that were
pushed now you're trolling me you know
so here's the thing like at least uh my
comment and error notice comment was
more about how does the community
participate in this stuff because I feel
like it's hard for like me as a
passionate developer to participate in
this and like both sashko and glass or
kind of gave non-answers that like oh
yeah
is all on our to-do list yes like I
don't frankly at the end of the day I
don't give a crap about what's on your
to-do list I want to know how I can help
you with that to-do list to make my life
better um and I still don't you know i
emailed some people at MDG I don't feel
like I have a clear answer you know I've
got a pull request out there that
doesn't have a clear response on it and
everything's still on their shoulders
yeah I still don't feel like I have a
clear understanding of how we as a
community works with mdg no not you want
to make that better I don't think it's
broken but it could be better yeah yes
so yes every glasser sashko we want to
work with you yeah totally like I you
know it's a great like to the to last or
to an upcoming story about blaze plus uh
you know Lauren sands Ramshaw opened a
ticket and said like hey this is a
problem and like you want to know what
do I need to do to fix this and they
they talk a little bit through like a
couple different ways to do it but then
like Aaron outage comes out with blaze
class hmm I don't know what's the right
way to do it III don't know because well
and so here's your anota he's coming out
with like crazy stuff right and he's
always like pushing the envelope fixing
things making things better improving
things if the story was better with
accepting PRS and having clear path on
accepting PRS you think Aaron Oda would
be like making all these separate
packages or you think he would be like
more of like a PR kind of guy you know
that's a tough call so I'm a PR kind of
guy I'd rather fix it in the framework
rather than create a package um no
semantically there's not a ton of
difference but frankly you know I i was
even unaware like I sent a pull request
that added a feature to blaze I needed
that I wanted and I found out later that
there was a package that included like a
bunch it's called a blaze or template
template extensions from aldi and I had
no idea that even existed and frankly I
wouldn't even think
go look for that right like I just I
just wanted like a way to get at the
parent templates data context or the the
parent templates instance or something
and like that didn't exist in any good
form and so you know I made a pull
request with fully tested and document
and all that kind of stuff and it's it's
just sitting there and I think the
problem with the package system is it's
it's got 6,000 plus packages on it now
and even with the metrics that
atmosphere is applying to it I still
feel like it's sometimes hard to like a
word you use is different than a word I
use for something and all of a sudden
we've got two packages that do the same
thing more yep I don't want yeah yeah
okay I think it's better to be in court
personally so this was interesting I was
not to carry the sound longer but I was
listening you do what I carry this
almost all all the well so like we all
know the drama that when I would node an
io j okay and now they came back
together and what did they do they
establish a board but that board isn't
isn't making really the direction like
they're more marketing focused and and
who's really doing like the PR stuff and
in the code it's it's like driving
committee right that's underneath the
board and the driving committee is made
up of actual like community people and
they're the ones that are really like
touching the code a lot and deciding
what's going in and out and so it's
almost like they're like a middle
committee to like really like move it
forward so that it's not getting stale
it's it's it's it's staying fresh what
everything that I owe wanted to
accomplish right and so when I'm hearing
you talk like that I'm like oh it's
interesting because like what what note
is now and the issues that they had
before sounded similar to the issues
that we're having as in the sense of
like the code and we want it to be
moving faster and things like that and
now I'm seeing like where they're at
what they set up and the boards and
everything and it's interesting it's
interesting it is it is I still don't
know that were there yet and even even
if we were there what does that look
like right like I mean Joyent took over
uh-hum I feel like you're you're baiting
me to mention like meteor interviews and
uh Abigail talking about for King meat
eater oh I wasn't at all no it was even
my mind but I sure they didn't come to
my mind but yeah there was this is a
bigger issue maybe we should dedicate
our first crater episode to all media
you know in all honesty this feels like
a meteor club podcast topic more than
anything right yes yes we could probably
explore this thing for two or three
hours if we wanted to um and you
mentioned that earlier today like we
should get some open source project
managers on here and talk about what
that looks like so yes that's right hmm
so that's something to talk about it
sounds like we're both very passionate
about it and so I think because of that
I'm gonna move on to the next topic
hahahaha good idea we don't want to talk
about passionate stuff yeah we just use
you alright so collection by reference
yeah so if you if you number one stop go
read this article I think it's good I
think you should know about some of this
stuff um we like Ben and I have had some
private conversations and I talked about
similar stuff this and I'm like well
that's just metaprogramming and you were
like what's better programming yeah and
and so like we started getting into a
deeper conversation about that and it's
just idea that like you know if you're
going to share a code between something
or you want something reusable you kind
of have to do this this meta programming
which is like maybe taking a class of
something or an instance of something
and turning that into like a version you
can work with and I don't know like this
is Rick very hard subject to talk about
but basically
it's it's it's using kind of like
strings or variables to do your
programming so if you think about it in
the sense of let's say we have blog
posts and let's say we have I don't know
what's something else you have on a blog
that you might comment on images right
and and you have comments in the
database and you have images in your
blog posts and you want to be able to
add comments to either images or blog
posts you know it was fairly common in
the rails world to kind of create this
acts as you know whatever kind of
inheritance set up where a comment could
belong to either a blog post or an image
and so it's similar to that like you
have to use meta programming to kind of
accomplish that and so this this post
from David Weldon is a good post in
which he talks about how basically you
can either if you're in the browser
environment you can say window and give
it some square brackets and then give it
a string with a capitalized object and
it will look up this collection for you
and return the collection so you can
call find on that and and similarly you
can call root in the node server and do
the same thing and you know I've I've
used this for a little while if you look
at there's some packages that kind of
rely on this and make it work and there
are other ways to get at this stuff too
there's another package called
collection oh gosh well here someone
mentioned in the comments uh just
totally slip in my mind now it's a David
Burl's package and I really can't think
of the name of it now but um he's got
like a collection instance or something
like that but I mean that the idea is
that you can programmatically access a
collection and kind of do things with it
uh which I think could be helpful right
absolutely I'm did you read this post I
I just glanced at it
okay I'm gonna keep it up so I can read
it more afterwards yeah well and so he
gives he gives a good example here in
that they're incrementing uh some stuff
on games and videos and it's like scores
and views right but he's written one
increment function so like finding the
right use case for this is a little
tough sometimes but it comes along and
it proved that presents itself if you
know about this pattern um and he takes
the collection name and an ID and a
field an amount and he'll increment the
field on the collection to certain
amount and he uses this um this little
trick of calling root or window to kind
of make it work it's a good trick the
only thing I think you have to be
careful of and I asked them to edit this
because I think potentially you can open
yourself up to a security hole if you
take a collection as a string and
convert it on the server and then just
do a phone call in particular if you
look at uh I think it's andrew ms ow i
probably saying that wrong but um he's
got a package called autocomplete out
there and he suggest that you take a
collection and a selector and some find
options and just trust them all from the
user the problem is uh it's gonna be
like I can have any I could hand you any
collection name and any selector in any
option and you're gonna return me some
data so it's kind of like just basically
installing auto publish for anyone
that's paying attention so that's the
trouble um so in his uh in his example
okay he did add some security stuff here
to make sure that you know it's coming
across like you want um but in this
example here you probably want to make
sure that the what's being passed in
collection wise is gay more videos right
like if you have an increment function
and you want to say like oh you can run
these collections you probably want to
make sure that it's being passed in as
those collections right you don't wanna
like if you think about you have a user
collection and they have like a
subscribed for months number and it's
set to one and someone goes in there and
says oh I'll just give myself 12 more
months yeah yep like that that's gonna
be bad so well double edged short here
totally yo blaze plus plus plus plus
plus so a flow router is a pretty
awesome router it was removing the data
context I mature outer and it was doing
like template subscriptions and things
like that I also do it encourages you to
do templates was good yes yes I'm sorry
I said yeah yeah it removes uh
subscribing from the router yes which I
think I'm of the mindset that that's the
right track to go yeah absolutely yeah
yeah um with that oh let me miss my ham
but with that people were saying oh I
want some more control and all that
stuff and uh there's a few other things
that came up in the community I'm John a
blank right now anywho people know this
at era nota turned around really quick
and release plays plus which is a pretty
cool package and it improves blaze with
rendering data so that it doesn't
rerender the whole template and so on
Coderre he posted a awesome blog post
set interview in urdo introducing blaze
plus the next generation of blaze
templating and it talks about the blaze
plus package and yeah what do you think
about it Josh I'm a little mixed here so
i think the ideas are interesting uh my
problem is
you know like I was hesitant to try out
flow router because I've seen Aaron Otis
start things and shut them down I think
flow routers probably here to stay but
you know reading the comments it sounds
like he's not actually using blaze plus
anywhere he just kind of made it it
could happen and that you know it's a
thing the community needs well I agree
with that I also think you know maybe we
need maybe Aaron Oda needs to do his
work somewhere else where other
interested people can kind of
participate in the github and push it
forward I I don't know you know like
I've seen velocity kind of uh you know
wax and wane with the permit
participation and I don't know what it
takes to run a successful open source
organization or even just a singular
project I I think a lot of this stuff is
tough again this is one of those things
like I would love to see the discussion
opened and a deeper kind of discussion
going to you know with mdg to understand
what their thinking is towards this kind
of stuff would they be open to this kind
of stuff being folded into blaze because
I the crux of the problem is this right
like if I publish some data to the
client and it's got a B and C and you
know I put a and B on the page but then
the server text see changed it sends an
update over a DDP the client gets it it
rear enders the entire template even
though it doesn't need to and you know
Aaron Oda in this is proposing that we
go to more react like structure which
you know top down like you have a root
component that's passing data down to
children yeah uh but the problem is you
know if even if the root component
doesn't rely on something that changes
is going to rerender everything um and
this is gonna be a problem that we have
to deal with it I think blaze plus kind
of deals with that a little bit and I
don't I think it's an interesting
solution that if it can solve some of
this performance
that you have on the client it could be
a good thing so this is like when I
react people say have smart parents and
stupid children yes mmhmm yeah yes but
the but the problem is that any time you
pass that data from you no parent a
two-child be and you've created
essentially a what they call it a
calculation in a mediator and anytime
that reactive data changes it's going to
rerun that that calculation and rear
under that entire template side honestly
what we're saying is blaze needs to be a
little bit smarter hear about how it's
it's again choosing what it rear enders
that's that's really it's the crux of
the problem and I'd love to see it
solved you know if if some data doesn't
change like I don't I don't want to
rerender a bunch of things just because
a parent template changed and blaze
actually spark had a much bigger problem
with this and yeah but they've cut it
way way back dude when window 8 came out
so it's definitely improved but i think
you know here we are OA came out like
what the hell that was prime my second
month of differentials it's been over
two years now we've been living with
blaze like I think we could maybe
upgrade it a little bit I don't know in
a while it has been I still remember
those um def shop chats that uh was it
David Greenspan he was given he was
rewriting blaze right yeah it was like
three of them he gave a like little like
teasers I I will I will say this like
Greenspan is probably one of my favorite
guys at MDG like whenever he gives a
talk he's very very methodical gives
good talks um even like the the
dependency management stuff that he did
like ass oh that's gotta be the single
most boring topic you might already
talked about and like he shows a like a
he wrote a piece of code where you use
the constraint solver dis solve a Sudoku
board and my a second like if you
blinked you missed it but it was done
yeah so it solved it I swear it was so
fast it likes I'm comment like that yeah
he at least had a button you had
oppressed yeah look blank and they press
the button it would be like that you
know yeah yeah it's impressive those are
impressive talks yeah I always watch
those talks two or three times yeah so
you know I I'll be honest like I love
that era notas pushing this envelope
right if you look like he's definitely
pushed the envelope a lot prior write a
blog kind of started as an experiment of
his made its way in the meteor so you
know my hope is that MDGs listening to
this and maybe we'll see some awesome
stuff out of blaze for for 1.3 or how I
don't know I don't know how versioning
happens maybe it's one point two point
one I hope I don't wait to 1.3 if blaze
is being updated like I think I
understand semantic versioning and then
I look at people updating things I'm
like I don't I don't think that's
semantic versioning West yeah but it's
to be fair it's it's every project not
just a BG yeah um all right all right
Todd here it's getting hot in here so no
no I can say it to you I'll leave the
song don't worry so leave on all your
clothes in fact go get you with your
check it and zip it up right now oh my
god I'd be sweating if that were true
guardian oh I see I see the problem I
have nest just turned out my AC all
right so all right oh yeah Sasha Sasha
velilla ever meteor yes I you know I was
torn there was again like so many good
post this week I
men going and checking out crater and
look at the daily and probably look over
the last seven or eight days at least um
probably even longer because we didn't
do what we didn't do an episode last
week so a lot of good time uh there were
two or three particularly good ones from
okay crow boom yes whoo-hoo those guys
again I don't know they're like they're
like the best meteor shop right they
send me money I don't know what you're
biased everyone's while again email says
hey can you join me in this meeting and
I have no idea who this Paul guy is a
guy who are you what am I talking about
we do what here huh I love okay grow
yeah I don't know i was i was so torn on
like this last story but i don't know
I'd like I Sasha's been putting out some
good stuff too this is a good article it
is uh and so you know he talks about
publications and some of the stuff for
that you might want to pass into a
publication in order to get some
information out of it and you know he
shows you simple find that's great but
sometimes you gotta duck a little bit
deeper and you need more than just a
simple find um you know maybe you need
to pass in some parameters like I want
to do fine for this user and you know
and so your option at that point is to
move to a separate publication or start
passing in some parameters and he talks
about like the if you just pass in just
a big ol parameters option object like
that that's actually pretty terrible
door opening it up yeah yeah it's like
it's like saying oh we're gonna have a
security hole but you've just created a
security hole this the size of a Mack
truck and you know they're gonna they're
gonna drive their big old publications
are all is is meant to run just on the
server and like secure your data you
know you anything from the client into
subscribe right publications like
totally is just on the server yeah
little now you're you're you're passing
options publication options from the
okay yes power hahaha yeah but I think
the key here is you know he's kind of
creating these these query constructors
on both the client in the server and
then just kind of reusing that latest
post function to kind of take what's
coming in and pass it through this
function and then pass out what you need
that make sense yep yep okay yeah no no
I'm not criticizing the article I was
just like kind of given a general
overview no I want to make sure i'm
explaining it okay yeah um so I think
you know this is uh this is a really
interesting pattern I actually have not
used anything like this so i'm i'm
really glad he shared it even if I never
use it like having read this post a
couple times it'll probably affect my
thinking and maybe I'll borrowed from it
at some point or thank you just you
never know when you're gonna need this
stuff you know especially when you're
freelancing on multiple projects yes
it's always loved it did these are the
little tidbits that you can like just
throw in it's quick to understand yeah
hey cool i could use this yeah and at
the end he gives you some real world a
little bit of real world examples from
telescope it kind of shows you how he's
actually using it to power the different
categories in telescope not categories
but views right like top or daily or any
of that kind of stuff and they're really
just they're the same publication uh
you're returning the same objects you're
rendering the same templates you're just
kind of deciding the different data that
comes across the wire and gets displayed
and this is a good pattern for that yeah
yeah it's good stuff
said it are we done I think we're done
yeah you could totally tell I didn't
have coffee or a new energy drink today
I could tell you can tell I had beer too
I think I talked a little much and I may
have time gonna have to bring it 100
next time yeah I need to make up for
today just saying first created a
podcast will flat there been I'm just
kidding no I'm Dean I'm Dean everyone
who's listening I'm d Gnaeus uh you know
what step it up this has not been this
is sustained does not been my kids my
kids come up to me and said that this
reminds me my kids always come up to me
and I like I give them instructions
writer I say hey stop playing with that
hey it's time to go to bed editor right
and there is a Lissy but Dad but dad and
they say whatever but Dad I was Tom am
NOT a but Dad I have nothing to do with
butts I'm not dead yes I'm not nothing
than that Ben but Dad I need that ice
cream yes I you know what let's have
some fun here let's see how many Space
Camp listener or how many people go in
his face camp listen to the show okay so
I've been doing some fun stuff last week
my wife and I took like almost an entire
day to try to plan everything out for
the weekend and make sure we were on
track for everything and that included
like you know I got together the form of
the t-shirts that use them I'm glad I'm
glad you're planning this event we
ordered a 13 board games off amazon last
week so i'm pretty stoked about that
have you are you a board game guy no no
i've had drama is it in a childhood oh I
had a brother that just would refuse to
lose yeah monopoly not a get not a good
thing haha you're not so i'll say this i
went to a board game night and
a friend of mine at it near here it was
actually walkable and which like a lot
of beer to be fair but we played some
fun board games they played some crazy
board games I don't think I'm going that
far they had this one where you're like
it's like clue but you're like one guy's
dead and he's trying to give you clues
to how he died and like you're a
telepath and you're getting these clues
and trying to figure out how this person
died that was that looked terrible that
was like the Harley hour long game I was
bad um but no there were a lot of fun
games like resistance or I guess it's
similar to werewolf if you like that
okay so you got these board games I got
the board games and they're all sitting
in the front of my house i'm pretty
excited about that i'm gonna order one
more I went to game night and had a lot
of fun playing one so I'm gonna order
one more I thought you're gonna mention
the other thing that we were talking
about the other thing I'm going to
mention we're gonna have a hack day
alright and that's on the website but
the thing I think most people don't know
is that i'm going to buy generally order
up some raspberry PI's and we're not
when I'm talking like Grandma mama yeah
we're not talking about grandma's pie
here we're talking about like computers
and we're gonna have a hackathon were to
break into teams of four ish maybe and
you're gonna hack for the day I'm still
deciding if it should be random or what
but I think I'm gonna make it random I
think that would be more fun and no
longer it's hard cuz I you know I don't
want options in I don't I don't want
like the okay grow team to let me try to
dominate I don't know combinations
actually gonna happen I've even told
some of the sponsors about this I'm
pretty excited though and yeah you like
a gown you told me this yeah I got so
excited I yeah yeah don't anyway should
not tell anybody don't tell polish and
this you know funnily enough this is all
wendy's idea
Oh Andy yeah we're trying to come up
with like a nighttime activity and
that's when we decided on board games um
which I thought we might do but and then
she's like what about like we started
with arduino 'he's but then we wanted to
do something that you could still play
with meteor on and so we ended up with
the raspberry PI's and so I don't think
we have much in the way criteria that's
me for how you when um but we do like I
think there's going to be like a most
awesome app and maybe most creative app
and um you know those might be the two
categories and then the teams that win
will win the raspberry PI's right cuz
we'll have we'll have at least eight of
those and if two teams of four win and
then we may give like best app you may
get like a patch or something that says
you're the most awesome hacker ever or
something I don't know yes so not a
ribbon yeah a ribbon yeah blue ribbon
yes mm-hmm this is my blue ribbon
winning code yes we're like a patch like
a boy scout at cuz we're I can't exactly
what meteor I don't know we'll see but
uh whenever we're having some fun with
this it's good stuff yeah wait so while
we're talking about Space Camp I'm I'm I
might not have a van Oh the space came
vans not gonna happen all of a sudden
the guys m.i.a oh you didn't give him
money yet did you no I did not okay well
I mean you can rent vans even from the
airport idea yeah yeah those options

mile yeah if they come knocking on the
