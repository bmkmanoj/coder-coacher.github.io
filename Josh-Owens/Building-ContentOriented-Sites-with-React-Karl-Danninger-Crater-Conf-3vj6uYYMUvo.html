remote cough given to a live audience in
February 2016 this video was made
possible by sponsors like modulus I oh
okay grow calm and space dojo calm if
you would like to find out more
information about upcoming conferences
be sure to go to conf crater on Io and
put your email in the form that pops up
in the lower left corner enjoy the video
alright welcome back crater call fans so
this talk is going to be put on by coral
damager from ok go ok go ok grow
building content oriented sites with
react so I think um this welcome Carl
right I like totally off my game today
um so you get this this talks totally
coming out of learnings that you guys
did like building ok grow calm as a
react app with us or and that kind of
stuff right holy so yeah like we we
wanted to do some exploration figure
that all out and I wasn't happy with
like the current solution so this is the
byproduct of that awesome alright what
you can get on into me cool so am i
sharing is this all working all I'm in
the wrong spot ok uh so my name is karl
denninger i work for ok grow and I want
to talk today about content or eight
sites with meteor and reactive course
kind of necessary ok can I like so it's
just a weird thing I can't really get
out of so people unfamiliar with
JavaScript frameworks ask me um
they all didn't ask me about like can
JavaScript do content because like
there's some misconception that you know
these like single page apps of like
let's say two to three years ago weren't
crawlable first of all and like I guess
we've come a far like a pretty we've
come pretty far as far as like a bunch
of JavaScript frameworks being able to
do this and I mean even Google is a
little bit agnostic to JavaScript like
one hundred percent JavaScript sites as
far as like being able to like curl for
content but you know as spoiled nerdy
developers that we are we want to build
heavily content oriented sites but we
love JavaScript frameworks too much so
there was a couple problems with meteor
one it's not indexed properly by
crawlers again not so true with Google
coming out with like the whole like
being able to curl JavaScript sites but
we can't really rely on that right now
if you're building content oriented
sites solely in like you know templates
you're going to have an enormous first
payload because you're sending that all
down and there's some weird behaviors
that come along with like JavaScript
framework sites so route changing
leaning you not exactly where you expect
if you're scrolling down those three
points I'd like to talk about today so
one not being able to index properly by
crawlers so like this question got asked
i think a year ago actually josh has
more views and more likes but this guy's
answer is pretty or all I really needed
so a while ago meteor and SEO weren't
really besties like there was spider
Bowl which again like didn't really work
out in a lot of use cases like I'm a big
fan of deploying on Heroku ever really
worked out for me there
I know people have had problems with it
onto the ocean and it really you know it
was just a little bit flaky pre-render
is kind of cool but it seems well at
least for me that it's just another
layer of complexity that I don't want
meteor actually wrote this blog post a
couple days ago saying that like you can
automatically pre-render using
pre-rendered I oh but it's only
available for galaxy professional and
Enterprise editions like unfortunately
I'm not really ready to shell out 500 a
month for that but I mean reactant
meteor is pretty cool and I mean this is
this is kind of the bandwagon everyone's
jumping on right now and and I don't
know it seems to be working out pretty
well and there's no real like thought
overhead just being able to write your
app as you would so I have to give
credit to error nota it's funny that I'm
right after him but there's a like being
able to write react templates will
effectively be able to run both on the
server and on the client side and this
ties into using flow router with react
leoch there's a branch for SSR this is
coming out fairly soon with lower outer
four point oh yeah so I just wanted to
show you guys a quick curl of what you
can expect like oops so this moved some
work and you guys still see this yeah we
see your code right now yeah okay um so
something you'd expect a crawler to be
able to do is to see like you know
content on the page before using like
things like floor addresses are
you'd see something like this this is a
big shame on me because I'm not using
anything on my site you get like an
empty body which is not really cool now
if we were to read do that using like
those two technologies that just talk
about react layout and floor addresses
are we get all of our content as if like
I bought wood we're scraping our site
and see so here's my actual blog post
and that you can see all this stuff I
mean it's pretty ugly but hooray we have
a server-side rendering meteor app using
react so that's really cool so you're
going to have an enormous first payload
if you're writing all your content
statically in templates again not that
cool being nerds like what we want is to
be able to write content preferably
somewhere else markdown being something
that feels good we want to store and
deliver that stuff from again something
that isn't executable the private
directory that meteor offers is actually
a pretty cool solution and I'm going to
talk about that in a little bit being
able to query content via Mongo mini
Mongo like we're still used to that
stuff coming from meteor lands so why
not now come of this is we still don't
want to break a CO and server-side
rendering so writing content should feel
good markdown is like a pretty standard
way of doing content especially for
non-technical people like everyone can
do this even I don't know if you guys
can you guys see my mouse I hope so but
this top section in between the three
hyphens line 1 through 8 like you can
have arbitrary attributes that can help
define what a piece of content could be
and the cool thing about writing content
is it could be anything this is a
somewhat bad example
because it's a blog post but I don't
know like if you were having if you have
like some partials in your site that
were static just like text like why not
ship it like from mark down right into
your site via like son Cory there's
great tools out there like to help you
write better mark down especially if
you're not in technical being see these
things side by side like input and
outputs and little-known fact is github
is an amazing spot to be editing these
files as well yeah and having what
happened to the scroll keep thinking
this is a page being able to have like
assets as well within the same directory
as where your markdown files are is you
know awesome especially for
non-technical people to see images or
videos or any type of link within their
page as they're editing so private this
is kind of like a black box for most
people I overlooked it for years
developing meteor apps but it seems to
be a really powerful tool where you can
just store static content and then
deviate up how you would on the back end
so on the right hand side here is a
little bit of a structure of how I'm
doing a simple blog so under private
there's a Content folder with all my
posts organized by dates and here i have
my markdown file post md alongside all
of the images so when a non-technical
colleague goes into edit something or
needs to change something up all these
images are still going to work even if
he's looking at it in github um I wanted
to quickly show you guys like how this
stuff works so this is a little bit
scrappy but I think it's really cool and
it's only 40 lines of code so there's a
couple things that
help with this stuff so being able to
like sync files from private directory
just like read them out so there's an
MPN module called glob helps you find
the path names and the actual content of
these things you can loop over them and
then i'm using another npm module called
markdown parse this basically gives me
some things that I really wanted like an
automatic HTML parser and I needed to
rip out those attributes from the head
which is called front matter I'm just
going to go back up to this I'll here so
lines one through eight frontmatter just
arbitrary like a value pairs stuff so I
can use them later like I could even add
in one saying this is partial for team
bios for instance like use this partial
here so when I'm later on doing my query
like you can query wherever you want so
I'm going through all this stuff I'm
doing a little bit of hockey stuff to
find all the images within the files and
and replace them with my custom private
assets because of course like I have
these assets within my private directory
which means that they won't be served in
the normal sense and then I'm doing a
very normal insert right here so with my
assets my HTML and I markdown and my
attributes being that like the first top
section of money markdown file the front
matter being able to have this stuff in
a manga collection as well like on the
client and the server side now if I
wanted to take this a step further you
can actually define collections with the
name of null this will create an
unmanned ajaan synchronized local
collection this could be beneficial if
you just want to like have all of your
content in memory instead of like in an
actual MongoDB instance because of
course like if we're just doing content
like straight content you may not like
need a database and I mean it's a simple
is doing something like this like on the
server side we're going to create
contents without a name and then on our
client side which is going to fake it so
that we can keep our DDP and reactive
stuff still happening and the cool part
about this is like it's as normal as
subscribing to exactly what you need so
building like a content oriented site
should feel exactly how should you know
just building a straight normal meteor
app just with like react components as
your templates and yeah being able to
query exactly what you need so like like
a post index which finds everything with
a date field for instance again just an
arbitrary value I mean it could be
anything like any type of partial on
your site so another kudos Tara nota he
has another package called picker think
it's meteor hacks picker this is a
server-side render out that allows you
to serve like assets from the server I
just decided to call it something
different so like when I'm going through
my HTML it's easy to find the things per
page I mean you can do whatever you want
here but again thanks aaron owed again
meta tags kadir team has another package
called duck head if you want to
manipulate your meta tags depending on
like the lifecycle of your components if
you have like a main layout of some sort
like a main layout react component this
is something that you would actually
want to do during the component will
mount step so yeah like you have
complete control over the stuff
especially like the output of what comes
on the server side I want to talk
quickly about cdns
I still want to be able to use local
assets and development and then have
some type of gold herbal set in
different environments I think this is
very important to me so like being able
to have things set globally like if
something exists here line 39 I want to
use it if not don't and then I usually
end up registering some type of global
helper that sets the thing the one
problem with this is that you have to
remember to like prepend these things to
image sources or wherever you're using
the thing the cool part is is if it's
empty if it's just empty and you have
like / path like some absolute path um
it'll find it locally but if you have
CDN prefix set in your environments
staging or production whatever it is of
course it's going to pull it from there
you could do the same thing in CSS like
if CDN prefix exists prepend it if not
just use local assets so josh wrote a
really good piece on setting up cloud
front this is pretty much the exact same
method I use to get our assets on cloud
front so it would just google jones club
front if you're curious about how to get
that all started so my third point is
that the route changes can leave you in
some awkward spots so in traditional web
when you're hitting new pages it's like
loading all content fresh right it's
like like initializing a reload and
fetching new data but in our single page
JavaScript meteor land apps this is
sometimes not the case and you could end
up in some weird spots so it's I said
this a little bit early but why should I
worry about it it's just some weird
thing
that you know some people tend to
overlook in the previous generation of
web development but in JavaScript land
this is something that we actually have
to be a little bit careful about so I'd
okay grow we have a package called
router autoscroll this does a little bit
of magic for you and some state
management so if you hit the back button
for instance if it remembers where you
were guys want to give you a short
little example of what I mean by all
this stuff I need to get out of here I
just want to make sure that my server is
running it is so I screwed up my site
just a bit so I could show you guys what
happens on on most sites so I'm going to
click have a lovely day on my site and
I'm going to show some content as you
know I was kind of like halfway down my
page that's also not cool I mean I
should probably be taken straight to the
top depending on on what type of site it
is so let's say this is some blog
article i'm reading through and i go to
the bottom and i want to go to the next
page i'm gonna click have a lovely day
is going to take me some other page
again I'm like kind of in limbo just to
get give you some context this site it's
just zoomed in so if I were like on a
phone just to make it more obvious about
what's actually happening well content
is changing and I'm being left in a
little bit of a limbo state there's a
difference between like where the
content is so this top two paragraphs
are part of a layout or yeah layout and
this could happen in flow router or iron
rod or any type of router everything
under here is part of a yield so this is
the stuff that's actually changing so
again if I were to hit have a lovely day
like one left in some weird spot instead
of you scroll to the top easy fix would
be like meteor
add row' router autoscroll
you
basically what this is going to do is
take me to the top of the page so I'm
going scroll down I read my article
click on have a lovely day and instead
of being stuck in some weird state
halfway down the page I'm scroll to the
top again this is like a super edge case
but some weird gotchas and in modern
JavaScript land that lots of us
developers have to deal with and back to
this talk boy where is it oh yeah that's
it that's all I got so um one thing I
want to do is plug meteor weekly calm if
you're not already subscribed you should
be Rishi Kumar and myself put a weeklies
or we try to every week and if you have
any questions please tweet them out at
me I like to go a little bit more in
depth with those three things that I
brought up so I'm planning on writing
some blog posts um if you're interested
in seeing like or me diving into any
more or deeper into any of those topics
just shooting out the tweet and i'll
make sure to write about it and thanks
good thing alright thanks Carl so uh uh
apparently we have 46 people in the room
but 101 votes on the first question oh
okay all right so have you tried a
reactive I think it's called reactive
helmet
have you taken a look at that at all for
react and I'm not like setting metadata
I was looking at it the other day at Lee
ok Google na active helming it isn't
necessarily what i want i'm getting
actual helmets what yacked but yeah i
just needed to give more love kara note
i guess get home we kid huh brings up
its react helmet sorry not reactive
element but it's made by the engineers
at the NFL great yeah awesome i thought
it was kind of interesting right on i
guess yeah i think for me like i would
rather like if I'm gonna migrate into
react I'd rather try to embrace some of
the tooling in that ecosystem because i
have a feeling people are doing
interesting things there as well you
know right well the cool thing about
like react component life cycles is that
you complete control over what exactly
you set and when so being able to pay
click wheel mounted mount or if it
updates so on and so forth you can do
that mmhmm yeah it's very interesting
all right the next question have you or
others on ok grow team performed blaze
to react migrations for CMS type apps
how painful is it if you have a team of
developers who have only used blaze do
you think it is worth migrating our apt
to react now there's a lot in there I
did that I did that not necessarily for
CNM s-type at oh I help someone busy oh
so was it an ok grow project so ok girl
calm I wouldn't necessarily count as
like a big project I mean we do have a
bunch of blog post and stuff
too bad i mean i was able to do it like
all blaze components to all react
components sorry I plays templates to
react components fairly easily there's
only a couple gotchas like for instance
there's I have like some arbitrary
JavaScript running on some of the blog
posts to do syntax highlighting stuff
like that like it's easy to put in like
a template on rendered but in a react
component it really depends on how
you're hitting the page if you're coming
from a route from within the site the
way that the lifecycle of your a
component goes through is actually
different if you're coming from it from
a link somewhere else like I don't know
in a Google result like you click on a
link / blog post right it'll actually
run a little bit differently so you have
to keep those edge cases and in check
for that example the syntax highlighting
I needed to initialize my syntax
highlighter on will update and did Mount
which I thought was funny but seems to
work that way ah so I guess the the
other part of the ocean is is it worth
migrating their app to react now like
what are your thoughts there too oh you
definitely do have more control over
life cycle again like react is pretty
powerful in that way so I helped someone
part of our code club so I run a code
club every month here in Toronto it used
to be a meteor code club we recently
rebranded it to be JavaScript code club
just because we're trying to embrace a
little bit of a larger community
bringing in react folk angular folk
whatever and so I sat down with a guy
and he had a fairly large
10 site is is pretty much all content
being delivered it was meteor app and
blaze and the SSR was super important to
them and like being able to be indexed
and what whatever so it was a little bit
painful but I mean we got through it
still fairly quick I say it's worth it I
say it's worth it there's a lot of stuff
that you'd get out of having everything
in react versus blaze so if you're going
to take the bullet now I guess you
should seeing as everyone else is
embracing it I've done it for two
projects but they were fairly small but
I mean again it's pretty like once you
get in the groove of like moving all the
templates over and like handlebars to
you know nested functions within your
class it's not so bad its rightful to
from every single person voting on one
thing supposedly supposedly i emailed
Sam like I don't know what's going on
man someone's broken a part of being
cool what are the benefits of using
meteor for a content type site compared
to something like wordpress oh well
funnily enough WordPress is moving or I
think their newest version has moved to
node so also I've been morale is it the
admin site
ok so I take that back but we're nerds
man we're nerds we want to use like the
coolest tools we want to use what feels
good so that's a total benefit being
able to like build something in meteors
like jet fuel compared to something as
obtuse as WordPress I don't know I just
I just enjoy it I'm pretty sure a lot of
us would anyway as far as benefits again
like if you're doing in react it's more
control I'd say yeah I don't know I
guess my thoughts are like it's still
there's a ways to go with JavaScript
CMS's um yeah well because I made on it
really comes down to the SEO right like
I use ghost because I did not want to
deal with pre-render and you know we'll
talk about that in the next talk to I
think that it's maybe it's still more
expensive than people want it to be so
yeah yep I agree yeah I'm being able to
write oh I was just gonna say being able
to write like a meteor app as you would
with the benefit of being able to like
serve content the way like in a in a
pretty like low-level way is pretty
beneficial especially for non-technical
people who are also like always editing
our site right I want them to be able to
do that without like coming to me and
saying hey I don't know what I'm doing
in this code base right is oh maybe it
may be a different way to ask this
question have you done any testing with
react like UI testing or anything like
that yes I actually would just start
did this like last week so I'm not the
right person to ask but we have tests
going using runner we have this plugged
into like semaphore for CI and deploying
to a staging environment very simple
tests I mean we're just looking for
certain keywords on a site that are
passable other than that I mean so you
know not yet it's probably hard to keep
it raw a testing blaze vs react at this
point because I mean you have to use
something like chimp or go to 1.3 and
try to use mocha or something along
those lines with blaze so yep
interesting oh here we go this is a good
one most content related sites also have
some sort of admin area would you
separate that out as a separate app and
connect it to the same database or would
you just make it part of the application
itself and deliver it to all your
clients some awesome question hmm only
there were a blog post on the admin area
I hate the idea of admin yeah actually
ate the idea of admin like panels that's
why I was like so on board with like
having everything kind of be static in
the back end and easily organized and if
I were to have something that's what
really that's what I did for the
mastering meteor site and I wrote a
little blog post about it and so I think
the problem here with this like that
what the questions alluding to is we
lack code splitting there's no good way
for me to say like only send this this
bit of JavaScript down or I put a
JavaScript down right and so when you
connect to some site like crater you're
getting all the HTML templates and all
javascript for all the admin screens and
everything so you know I think that
that's probably bad like when you look
and you see you got like a to Meg
horrible JavaScript coming down that's
probably not the experience you want
your people to have but you know until
we get some kind of good code splitting
tool that's what you have to deal with
and that's why I think a lot of people
over a lot of people are interested in
what packet agree with that yeah when I
and also when it comes to content like
only data down the wire right that's
like one of meteors monterrey's so like
even if you have this stuff faked on the
server side just in memory you're not
sending that stuff on first payload so
all you're getting is that HTML like
just empty until you actually need the
content depending on where you are it's
blog or whatever other page that's
serving up content apparently he meant
WordPress not meteor I don't know Oh
what would you mean right I don't know
oh okay no that wasn't actually awesome
but we're not paying attention have
paying attention all right is your ok
grow I did it again ok grow code for
serving static markdown files open
source somewhere or explaining a blog
post just curious if we could use it as
a quick start for a blown their post mmm
it is not actually in the middle of
writing it mmm all right well now you
have all the reference material you need
for the post right so that's Elijah all
right just don't see it it'll be great
I'll actually call them out and say stop
yo Josh sorry Ben I'm hungry
all right um do we have any other
questions you did so I totally rushed
through that and mm-hmm I don't know
bored Canebrake yes yes wait at this
we're space camp we could totally do
that I would work that would be awesome
so uh what what other interesting things
are you working on Carl Oh interesting
eh ah really nothing
um what else going to show you
apparently you should tell us about the
monkey in the diaper hmm what yeah you
mean Ben and the monkey in a diaper all
right okay yeah well one more I got
nothing right here and um we will come
back um c 0 ping up here we go so if
your contact con contact content is all
static coming from markdown files what
do you use DDP for I'm having a hard
time figuring out why you'd want to do
this a meteor only because we're nerds
but usually don't need to because you
can really you don't need DDP you know
so i'll relate this back maybe to a
project we did when i was at
differential we had a we did the site
and meteor and i'm not sure that it
really needed to be done a meteor either
we actually wrote like a blog and
everything and we even had like medium
highlighting and all that stuff going on
but then it turned out that was really
bad idea to do in real time but um but
yeah so we started working on a github
page and i don't if you still go
differential may still have this out but
if you go to look at like their github
organization like landing page the one
thing we did use DDP for was to scrape a
bunch of github info put it together in
an interesting way and then research
that up to a DDP client that was hosted
on the github page and we consumed it so
like we didn't need it for the main site
but we did actually park
that stuff in a media app that we we did
end up using for github kind of funny
not very cool yeah I should also
preference like you it's not like for
the okay growed com site it's not
necessarily just all content there's
like a little bit of a back end or
considered a meteor experts so I thought
why not some other things that come with
it like it's still a meteor app that
just happens to be some spots like slash
blog which is heavily content so having
an insane yeah well and I also think
like I don't know maybe this will reveal
my darker marketing side but you want to
be able to do things too like
controlling the Facebook pixel or google
analytics and doing interesting things
there and like you could use jQuery but
oh I don't use jQuery um anyway yeah
some so Ben wants to note some say react
is overkill for apps most apps do you
agree oh wait he's changing omid for
example Pete hunt says react is for
large apps that need to scale is this a
case for blaze okay oh is this a case
for blade you're asking the wrong guy
because I have a love affair with blaze
I wish more people didn't give it like
such a bad rap uh-huh it's just so easy
compared to like it can't be so to write
and Burke it in the comments he's saying
like yeah can the happy server rendered
he's right it's like yeah yeah yeah can
it though like known as lost you you
have to use the I'm a flow router like
SSR stuff right so basically you just
have to you have to put in blaze into
the server environment and the mallows
templates up and serve those up as HTML
yes okay you could do that but what I do
is with I just it's pretty why blaze why
blaze just because it's simple like
there's not so much overhead the life
cycle is pretty you know pretty
synchronous as far as like what it does
doesn't do much but it was like what you
need for fairly simple builds I have a
lot of like new developers coming into
the code club who are like gung ho about
using react even in meteor and I mean
awesome like great like one just jump in
and get started but of course you're
going to run into a lot of gotchas I
just felt like using handle bars within
blaze was like the simplest thing that
you could do and the most immediate like
ratification building something yea or
no we did some pretty complex so wait I
don't know you know it's interesting
right and I think the problem with blaze
is not a problem with I mean maybe
there's some performance issues there
right and those those could probably be
fixed and I think as your app gets
bigger yeah it gets harder to understand
what's going on in all the parts of the
app and maybe react components are a
better fit for a larger app and for
reusability across your app but I think
that the biggest reason why react will
always be greater than blaze has nothing
to do with the technical merits of each
to me the the react community will
always be bigger than the blaze
community right you're always going to
have this small subset of meteor people
that are like tied into blaze but react
can be used with anything and so like
inherently the react community is going
to be bigger
it's much easier to to google for an
answer right um bigger pool of people
yeah yeah dan react native yeah just hip
hashtag win oh so someone asked in the
comments is there a parallel to reiax
life cycle and blaze template team you
want to take that yeah i was in the
middle of answer there is uh almost you
have a look you have more control over
the life cycle of your react component
because there's more things that you
could do there's actually there's a lot
more of a granular step by step thing
you get with like the react component
versus like the only three functions
that you could call with the blaze light
cycle click on rendered on created on
destroyed versus like all the mounting
and updating with you know actual props
that you can get in react yeah but that
was like the ease-of-use thing because
it was kind of handled for you a little
bit of magic behind the curtain yeah oh
yeah hey go so Ben asked i feel like we
answered Roberts question I hope you
feel we answered your question Robert so
Ben asked how do you like using jQuery
plugins and other Dom manipulating
libraries with react like d3 and stuff
haha oh man not fun why is that I do not
like it no it's a sufficient answer it's
it's uh like you have to be very careful
about how you initialize things I've
lost a couple days just trying to figure
out why it initializes a certain way and
doesn't in others especially like when
you start nesting components or like a
component has more like a parent
components or whatever and
you you have to deal with all of that
the way that you should be writing them
and maybe this was part of my learning
is everything should be more independent
so if I'm initializing a piece of jQuery
it should probably be within that that
component itself instead of like outside
or scoped differently I'm just I mean
like if you're using react I don't know
like don't use jQuery but I mean it's
inevitable that you'll have to use a
plug-in or D 3 b3 of course you have to
you that it's like the biggest library
yeah so then points out virtual Dom is
the issue right so they're like they're
keeping track of their own kind of copy
of what should be there and you bring it
down blows up with ya so you have to be
very careful about clean up as well
alright so we've got about 27 minutes
before the the next talk starts so I'll
just take an extended break here feel
free to get some snacks I already ate
all mine sorry and we'll be back in a
few minutes and I just want to say thank
you to you Carl for coming on and giving
your talk really appreciate it yeah
don't worry yeah all right glad to be
here all right guys be back in 20 26
