second 2015 welcome crater fans i'm your
host josh owens along with my co-host
bettin Strahan how you guys all doing ah
and now you're Mike's too loud is it
really okay turn the game down maybe a
little bit game down all right mmm hello
everybody indeed hello hello so we
officially like got everything done this
week like you can go to podcast I
created on Io now and it's all
functional and got the new art up and
switched the podcast feed over itunes is
updated everyone's telling me they're
seeing the new stuff so amazing ooh that
was a lot of work and we have an awesome
blog post come out from mdg woohoo
indeed we did yeah we'll get to that uh
yeah a little bit ly jobs just hey
here's nice to see our podcast on the
top for sure that put a smile on my face
yeah yeah so this week we're going to be
talking about meteor and reactive
publishing we talked about meteor toys
too we would talk about the new media
podcast that came out animations in
transitions and the official angular
package so uh not a meteor talk yeah
definitely still a heavy slant towards
meteor that's cool we love it yep we do
so some of these sort of like quite a
few of these stories kind of dropped
today too or mm-hmm but with this first
one here the reactive publishing totally
dropped this morning and I was like
overside reactivity like that's a weird
right right and so I went and checked it
out and it's exactly what I've always
wanted on the server you now get tracker
autorun
and it's it's put right into the
publication kind of namespace there so
you can say this dot autorun it'll
properly tear things down for you when
your publications are porn down when
like someone unsubscribes basically mmm
publication and this allows you to do
things like pay attention to when other
records change right and so if you think
about it the in the mastering media
class I do one of the big lessons is
showing you how publishing multiple
cursors works and the edge cases you can
run into if you publish multiple cursors
because it doesn't necessarily like so
in that example you have users you're
following and you go grab all those user
IDs and then you do a query to get all
the tweets and all the uh yeah tweet
tweet and user information for those
tweets and the problem is that you know
when you do that you don't get
reactivity on looking up those user IDs
so if you go follow a new user those
tweets aren't going to show up at all
and the interface like they like you
would think they would in a reactive
kind of environment like this and you
know if I say it at almost every class
like if only we had tracker autorun this
wouldn't even be a problem and like we
end up writing 60 lines of code that
shows you how to push your own records
on to DDP so basically you have to watch
a bunch of cursors and do all that on
your own so having track or autorun lets
us kind of get rid of that and now we
can just say you know watch everything
that might be reactive inside of here
right we do a find a call that should be
reactive and any time that data updates
rerun this block of code and republish
anything that's related to it so yeah I
don't know what kind of performance
consumes this thing I'd have with it but
it looks super interesting in the fact
that I have to write way less code
exactly so and he gave a great example
with permissions I think that that is
something that could like home with a
lot of people so that was a good example
to see down below it's really
interesting i'm interested to da to use
this yeah totally losing a published
composite yeah i mean that's publish
kannada composite is littered like all
over that cordova project that I've been
working on because it's just I mean it's
it's what was available and how the data
was coming across from Drupal like it
was all structured in a kind of like
sequel ask way so you know I had I had
to grab multiple records to kind of get
the information we need it onto the page
and publish composites ok I just I still
think there's maybe some performance
concerns in there so yeah there is one
like you don't even like you literally
just put a autorun wrapper around the
stuff and that's it so you can use your
regular syntax which is pretty close
yeah we're getting we're getting away
from a client a little bit more
movements to more stuff over into the
server interesting stuff yeah reactivity
on the server's always been a huge thing
yeah which is 0 which being new to
meteor um you know when you discover it
you might like think oh this is a gotcha
until you start doing things in meteor
way and this just is an awesome tool to
add to the Arsenal now yeah for sure I'm
glad meet our I think that's how you say
I'm glad he put this out today and
shared it with everyone I think it's a
you know I'm an unwritten through the
code but it seems like it could be a
solid implementation and even if it has
problems like this is what like Dave a
one that has been announced so this
stuff's probably fixable if it does have
any problems
yeah absolutely so yeah coach hi guys
yeah talking about something that got
released meteor toys to buy max 7 so he
released the second media toys and he
partnered up with the guys from modulus
to broadcast the news in on the modulus
blog and props for max for making that
connection man I think that it's the
first guest post that modulus has ever
had on their blog they've had a couple
i'm wearing my modulus shirt today
they've had a couple but i think they
said in the blog post they were the
first but i'm pretty sure like Gerard
and a couple other people have some
posts up there too oh right on so I was
just thinking a few weeks back I was
like man what what is max gonna do I
know that he's going to be adding
something I know he's going to like step
up his game what is he going to do and I
going through the new features I'm
impressed I'm impressed yeah this blog
post goes to the new ones and yeah I am
looking even more at this the biggest
thing that stood out to me was he's
really taking the fight seriously about
getting rid of the council and bringing
everything to write to you in your
interface yeah I mean it's not a bad
idea I think the thing that I found most
interesting in this again like I'm
comfortable with the console so really
feel the need to replace it myself but
you know the the template stuff is super
interesting to me yep you're able to
open that up and hover over template and
it'll tell you everything about it and I
really like that feature yeah it maybe
looks a little better than than the one
that comes with constellations so I
installed it just to try out the
template stuff because I needed to take
a look at like what was happening where
a template was coming from and that
helped and Max's implementation just it
works a little bit better so yeah I'm
exciting too
mm-hmm I like the latency what's he call
it like faking the latency of it I like
throttle yes that's what he calls it
yeah yeah that is kind of cool like
you're able to just say like slow this
down so it looks like the freighter when
you hit the upload button takes a while
and and just a fact like again this is a
developer tool so it will be easier it
will be faster that's what we could do
it in other ways but I do it right then
and there when when the thought comes to
you while you're testing yeah I mean
that's right on I like the emails yeah
that one looks super interesting to me
too it reminds me a lot of you know in
the class that sam and i teach we show
how to stub out email sending and like
catch those into an inbox that you can
then test against it reminds me a little
bit of that right like it'sit's just
catching the email sending and exposing
it in an interface to you so you can
take a look at those make sure they look
right so yeah it is good stuff max you
did a great job man indeed mmhmm yeah so
if for you guys that don't know I check
out meteor toys it's ninety nine dollars
and we don't have any kind of special
discount on the crater podcast to give
you yes wait we don't we don't did at
one point did we uh but I don't know if
that works anymore well what does work
is you can go to the modulus blog post
and they do have a special discount yeah
yeah so read it on through check out
this blog post see if it's worth it to
you see if it will speed up your
development time I think it will yeah so
just go to a podcast cratered I oh and
click on the show notes link for the
modulus blog post and you'll see the
coupon code down there yeah this sounds
like us like a sponsored section doesn't
it it kind of does
little weird right people it's not we
just like what max did yeah yeah you
know I thought it was worth talking
about especially because like he came
out with did he did he actually include
the sdk for it's coming soon he said it
was at the very end a good question
let's see here yeah he said the lumen
coming blog post about it later so yeah
so you can extend it so that would be
cool so media choice is going to become
a become kind of like a platform that
will be good stuff indeed yeah all right
what do we got up next I feel I feel off
my game today I don't know I'm sorry I'm
feeling low energy here guys me too yeah
I mean we need some red bull shots
before we wrap a fall day I guess now
you know is it here's the thing like
we've almost gone from like summer to
winter and like two and a half days here
in Cincinnati it's gonna ridiculous
mm-hmm or to midwest boys and and so you
guys are going to see us as we go into
our hibernation mode my beards are going
to get three feet and my baby's gonna
double we're gonna start like slowing
down talking slower so next up is new
video podcast Sasha and Tom got together
and recorded some episodes and they
released two of them actually this week
quite a bit there um and I you know this
is number one I always love seeing more
podcasts because I hate listening to
myself and if you don't know me like I
actually don't listen to any of these
podcasts I actually pay someone to edit
these because I hate listening to things
I've already done i don't know i'm weird
so you know now we've gone from having
me
views as the other option to now having
to with meteor podcast so uh you know
that's super interesting to me um and I
was excited when Sasha told me about it
and he got to launch so I think they I
listen to about 10 minutes earlier today
of the first one and the production
quality is good and the content seems
pretty good for me you know assistant to
the wood is meteor I know a lot of that
history so I feel like what was a great
episode but I'm gonna cue up episode 2
as well and take a listen ah but it's
well and you got as figure are we the
target audience no we're probably not
right right people that buy the book or
people who potentially may want to buy
the book that's right but you know I
think it's good you know like we've got
we've now got almost a tutorial style
podcasts available Oh what is you know
we've got news we've got talk show we've
got like one-on-one interviews and and
now we've got some tutorial styles yeah
I'm kind of curious I haven't talked to
Sasha directly about that I
congratulated him but we didn't talk
back and forth one thing that I should
ask him maybe you know is after they
like cover the basics which I'm sure
they got a number of podcasts they're
like that like that would be nice and
long like after that what's next on
their agenda I you know honest I've I
have no idea i haven't talked to him
about that either he said that as far as
pacing went they were thinking maybe one
a month or something around that range
okay Oh take them a while to run out of
content in the first place yeah that's a
handful of years then yeah yeah you know
now you've got react and angular and all
kinds of new things come in i'm sure you
know a year from now maybe we'll get
some sequel support one cool thing is i
was on itunes checking out my latest
podcast
yeah the Ben and Abby show fun stuff
where we answer developers questions
when they're getting new developers
questions and stuff like that but anyway
we're under the software or how to
category and so is sasha's and Tom's a
podcast and they were they were at the
top of that whole category Oh were they
really right off the bat yeah so if you
guys would yeah I mean that's the
benefit of having an audience a mailing
list and he got it on product hunt right
away so dude Sasha also my ring sure he
did it right man congratulations and a
seat I'll say like he's he he released
at what like Monday or Tuesday mm-hmm
and we put one out Wednesday and he's
got like almost double the downloads we
do on the episode so they were comparing
stats ha I think over the long run we
get more downloads it just takes a while
to get it out there but yeah super like
I said super awesome and I'm excited I
think it's a good thing for the
community to have more content like this
out there so absolutely and it kind of
validates the medium that we're using
you know podcast is a medium to get the
news out yeah is it is it a good one
well we will only be able to tell when
more people start playing around in NC
bring more awareness to it ya know
that's a good one I've been doing this
since 2005 since my third or podcast
nice yeah very cool so next up we have
animations and transitions in meteor
done by the blog meteor life com so
interesting I i really liked article
because it does a great job outlining
the history of animations and meteor
where we came from and where we're going
and touches on a few options that we
have available to us right now
and also some of the popular libraries
that are out there for animating any
kind of web app velocity and green sock
so it's good stuff yeah I actually like
that he kind of went to the the trouble
of outlining a couple packages even
included like with the meteor animate
package he included a sample like what
that looks like and just comparing those
overall because I mean sometimes that's
the hardest thing because noticing in a
forum post today that people like well I
didn't even know about these two
packages you guys mentioned here and I
think like when you're down in it every
day or like you're in the slack chat
room like maybe it's easier to get
package recommendations but if you're
not working with meteor every day or you
don't have like someone you know who is
like it's gonna be hard for you to know
what's the right package to choose or
what what are the options right because
you know some people like one package
and not another well I also would like
to just like say this like blog pull up
I can't talk about this blog post brings
a good amount of attention to the fact
of animation and the front end where
that might not be like number one focus
in a lot of the apps are being built
right now or the guys that are building
them and we need more attention on
animation I think we have as the front
end has moved on in the future like we
suppose CSS and growing CSS was huge
there was a revolution with responsive
design that came out and now it seems
like the next revolution is interactive
user interfaces um that is really geared
towards the user and kind of bridges the
gap between real life and the screen
elements on your screen will will react
how you expected them to react based off
of
in real life just like the mantra that
like material design is trying to
achieve with their Roseanne and how
things animate in and out and we we need
a solid answer for that you know right
now it's kind of like you know you gotta
like build your own and it's kind of
difficult you have to be putting a lot
of attention into the state of your
clients and do we have the money in the
budget and the schedule to give that
amount of attention that's needed these
animations not always so it's good I
really like this blog post because it
kind of outlined the importance of it
what we need and and i think that
there's a lot of room to grow and that
is the same sediment that this article
kind of said you know there isn't a
really great approach right now and then
like here are the things that are
available to you right now but it
definitely needs some work right now
yeah and they've got the Dominic from
percolate networks at meteor yeah he
gave a dev shop talk and they then
linked to that as well just kind of like
out showing you what you can do as well
so and he did a great job on that talk
yeah yeah just outlining what to do it's
good stuff some more work needs to be
done absolutely and that that and that
is my one big argument right now with um
Cordova you know we we did it we have we
have a user interface right now you know
we can use ionic that's great but right
now what we are missing and and the
mobile the native mobile bills are there
is animations you know the rich user
experience with with a lot of animations
based on your state really rich user
interfaces giving a great user
experience
it would be an enormous effort to like
go through and build something that rich
um in Cordova so and that's performant
and you're not going to have anything
that's like going to be laggy or or
jumping around ya like like what the hon
soft guy was talking about Hans yeah
that's exactly right yep totally I get
your man fun stuff so yeah all right
it's there so uh some angular news for
the week media related of course ah
there is officially an angular package
now that you can use and install and it
will get you everything you need it
allows you to use those angular
templates right inside your meteor
project but you can connect angular and
meteor data so that you can you know
bring that data in and kind of use it in
your angular templates if you want um I
know I'm not an angular guy so I'm just
kind of looking over the list here well
I think the big thing is is that URI uh
you know he remade the first angular
package that was like really widely
accepted bringing bringing angular in he
did a great job promoting at so much so
that mdg hired him and we had him on
meteor interviews talking about that and
we knew back then that his job over mdg
was to really get meteor angular
integration top-notch as well with react
and getting to distort the official
tutorials up and I think this is a big
step in that now that the URI URI go
angular package has now moved to just
angular so now you can just do meteor
add angular mm-hmm and that's saying a
lot you know when a package moves from
community Howard package to an official
a package I mean that's something to the
chair over yeah definitely right you
know I mean it's like it's interesting
because they're they hired URI right so
like the same guy that wrote it before
right so now we just remove the prefix
but i think you know that's a commitment
that the entire team wants to see it
continue and even a fury were to leave
hopefully angular the the meteor package
would still be maintained at that point
you know and that's I think that's the
thing why most people care about kind of
an official designation on a package is
because if people's like MTG will take
care of it as long as meteors around yep
so and uh you know you made a slip up
there but that was meteor interviews it
was meteor club podcast I did thanks for
catching me yeah Oh confuse the
listeners yeah yeah quick shout out to
our boy Paul dahlman if you haven't
subscribed to his podcast media
interviews and go out and do that man
yeah gonna be awesome so uh well I guess
speaking of Paul like you guys are like
at okay grow you guys are always taking
new business right yeah absolutely yeah
okay grow is amazing and we work only on
amazing projects so if you guys have an
amazing project that you're part of a
start-up or enterprise project and you
should totally email Bennett okay grow
com yes for sure she's on it or whatever
it's awesome but Lee I mean send us your
ideas and let's let's get this thing
built it's a I love working it okay grow
because we have we kick out a lot of
things really quick and the guys that I
work with are amazing I was sharing with
Paul yesterday as we were just reviewing
like while i work at okay grow and what
i think of it every day i feel like i'm
leveling up so much more the velocity of
what i'm working on and who I'm working
with as level it is the velocity of
leveling up is just amazing so
real big shout out to them I really like
the projects that we're on and we're
looking for some new projects coming up
I believe so yeah nice yeah so like I
also do the freelancing work for meteors
but I'm pretty full up so you know if
you want to work with the second best in
meteor that's my pen I love that I had
to go there sorry that's fine i'll give
it to you i'll give it to you yeah it's
silent no no it's good stuff so did we
wrap up this week so yeah that was that
was the last story really I guess the
interesting thing that happened you
mentioned that that blog post on media
blog which outlined all the all the
different podcasts we didn't I'll have
to officially add that to the show notes
as well um-hmm definitely give that that
one to read as well yeah there are some
other interesting things that drop today
but it was after I'd already made a list
so maybe we'll talk about it next week
cuz someone it's okay this one was a
little confusing to me on the ionic blog
they did talk about um I'm glad you
brought this up not needing angular
anymore yeah read the post and I didn't
I didn't specifically see that anywhere
in the post did I miss that it gives it
in there I have it on my short list to
read on my train ride home today so I
was okay i just saw the title which is
like removing angular yeah I just uh
what are they going to you about what
are they going to use the latest batch
of ionic platform of updates for the ion
I platform have landed I'm excited to
introduce the new web client that this
new service module has a lot going for
it I come a6 support no dependencies and
it's all
as a single include for your app so i
don't know like i'm not familiar enough
with ionic to say if that's true so hmm
someone should tell us hmm because I
mean that's to me that's super
interesting because if we don't have
that angular requirement anymore like I
don't have to go kind of learn angular
in order to use ionic and I don't have
to rely on a meteoric anymore because I
mean while Nick and team have done a
great job like you is always going to be
a step behind so exactly yep yep yeah
and in its a big effort that Nick in and
the team of your differential took on
porting ionic not all the features at
ionic ass is available to meteoric you
know they have a road map with that as
well so it is super interesting I can't
wait to read it and now you've intrigued
me even more because yeah just because
you haven't you haven't satisfied me man
I wanted you to tell me more about it so
here here's the other interesting thing
like they put in a body of the crater
post they put the announcement but the
announcement doesn't match the blog post
so I don't know where the announcement
came from hmm don't know this is really
who posted in Crater yeah and you know
there's also this the official I guess
this is official a drifty Coquelin ionic
that you can install now yep that was
last week yeah so yes you can bring it
and that's dependent on angular so you
can bring that into your media project
but it will also bring angular in yeah
yeah yeah so that's what I was thinking
when I first heard this I'm like oh I
wonder if drift he's gonna release a
package that is you know decoupled from
angular yeah well now there's an ionic
platform web client here that you can
install so
stemi lean bro yeah interesting I'll
figure it out best put this one back on
for next week and we'll talk about it
more yeah I'm excited because uh us
peeps over okay grow have like just been
diving into react like crazy this week
or so then we have in the past so that
makes you excited about ionic no I'm
just like I'm seg waiting away from
angular okay as the rest of the world
also does maybe I don't know and there
are some really neat if since we gave
like ionic some love right now out of
context of our list we gotta like give
some of these other packages out there
for react like the mobile components
that are out there for reacts in love
what are those what is it like react I
think reup is one data and then there
was another one like touchstone you guys
should totally check that out yeah react
ILO is kind of like a mobile UI library
for react I'm loving that so there's
some competition and it's solid
competition it's not like poorly put
together mobile experience so I'm pumped
the future looks really cool on the
client side and they'd right guys well
thanks for tuning in to the crater
podcast as always it was brought to you
by our sponsor modulus io still the best
hosting platform available out there at
least to the public ah but from what
I've been hearing I think it still might
be king even once other things come out
who knows I just like it cuz it cuz i
can throw stuff up there so fast super
easy right yeah deploying mm-hmm i agree
man I agree I spent like I I was
monkeying with crater and this crater
podcast site and all this stuff and
like I really wanted committed to
learning docker and so like I was
spending my nights this week kind of
playing with that and yeah I there's
some if nothing else that it would have
been a huge time savings for me to just
use mullets okay mom I learned accurate
I want to put some post up about it haha
excellent yeah it's cool yeah you have
to be you have to try those things man
give up your knees because you're the
guy who's going to be writing about it
you can leave us from skating our needs
up yeah all right well thanks for tuning
in and as always we renamed the Twitter
account so it's at Crater podcast now
and the website is podcast crater I oh
and then soon we'll be getting a link up
on cratered I oh so to link back to the
podcast as well I find it that way but
if you're listening to this your it
sounds like your client already updated
you're good to go nothing else to do
just keep listening to us yeah you know
tell us how how much you appreciate this
and how much you like to new artwork he
we tweet at us at Crater podcasts or
what's going on with ionic more than we
do tweeted us as well yeah or if there's
something you want to be featured on
here that's already posted on crater ya
wanna like shut up and be like yo make
sure this makes the list and we accept
tweets and bacon do it alright alright
