I'm Josh Owens and today we're going to
talk about hotel if you aren't familiar
with it hotel is an easy way for you to
automatically start applications on your
machine without having to worry about
things like the port or you know what's
the exact command to get everything
started like you can just save all that
information and get everything started
for you it's really really easy to get
set up and get running and I find it
super helpful especially because I work
on multiple projects at any given time
and so to me the reason to use hotel is
because I can automatically set up the
proxy config so that it will let me do
fancy domain names which makes things
easier to work with one password or
LastPass or anything like that you can
also it makes it so that when you're
using something like rescuetime to track
the web apps that you're working on like
you'll get that nice domain name there
so I know I spent like thirty five
minutes working on this client site so I
used that with Waka time and I can kind
of tell how long I'm spending on a
client project give or take and then
also you don't have to remember those
ports anymore like I said and anytime
that I need to I can just go in and
start any application that I want
without having to remember anything or
even having to open a console if I don't
want to so let's get started so we'll
just do an NPM install - G hotel and
that's gonna pull it down for us
install it I actually already have it
installed so I'm gonna stop it and then
restart it so that we get the latest
version running
there we go
so now it's running on localhost mm
and we get this nice interface that
comes down you can see here I've already
got some apps set up so if I hit here on
critic off and just flip this button and
when click here we can see the log it's
starting it up this is actually using
Jekyll automatically and so I can go to
this URL here and we should see the
credit con website perfect great super
easy right and I don't have to remember
how do I start Jekyll again same thing
works with meteor apps you know so I can
go let's let's get a meteor app added
I'm in the space dojo show podcast site
and so all you have to do here is hotel
add and then we'll do meteor will give
it the settings so that we get the
settings file give it the port and we
just use dollar sign port so it's just
gonna pass in an environment variable
for us and then we do - Oh app dot log
and that's just going to be an output
file in the local directory and so now
if we go back over we should see space
dojo show here at the bottom you can
turn that on you can see it's starting
up the meteor app for us now
and this is the log the actual running
log and this is also what what's getting
spit out in that app dot log so if we
tailed that instead you can see we're
getting the same log right there and
then once it gets started we get the URL
and there's the app running pretty handy
so and this is where things get really
interesting we can go in and configure a
proxy automatic configuration file and
it will start resolving the name to a
port for us and we don't have to
remember we won't even have to know what
these random you know localhost 6 0 105
instead we can just use the proxy config
and then we'll get we'll get all that
for free so since I'm on a Mac I'm gonna
show you how to do it on a Mac so we
just go in here to our network and then
I'm on Ethernet so if we go to Advanced
you can go to proxies and there's this
automatic proxy configuration check this
off and then we get this localhost 2000
slash proxy PAC file and once you do
that then you can then you can come in
here and just say space dojo show dev
and it's gonna automatically resolve
that for us and take us to that port so
it's amazing so now I can go to crater
conf dev and now it's pulling up the
same website and if the apps not started
and you try to hit that URL it's
actually going to detect that and it's
gonna start up for you so super super
handy the other great
is you can go to let's see so in
particular when doing like mobile
development using Cordova using location
services you have to have SSL turned on
so let's try that so I've got this city
Forex app we can start up and if I just
click here it'll take me to it once it
starts
and so we can go to HTTP colon slash
slash city forks dev and if if you
figure out how to trust the certificate
then you should not get that warning
anymore it's just a locally setup cert
that's not legit but you can see now
we're totally working over HTTPS so now
like it's it's using my location and
this apps running and pulling up the map
and whatnot so super super handy I would
highly recommend getting hotel installed
again like there's a numerous reasons
that you might want to use it least of
which is you know just not having to
remember how to start things anymore and
there are other solutions out there but
this doesn't require you to run on port
80 this doesn't require you to monkey
with your host file or use sudo or
anything like that everything runs on
localhost 2000 there's even when you go
into hotel there's a if you like the you
know the little menu bar up top you can
install this OSX app which gives you a
hotel menu bar component up there that
you can use so super super handy give it
a look thanks for watching and remember
if you give this one 50 likes I'll make
another one right after it so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
