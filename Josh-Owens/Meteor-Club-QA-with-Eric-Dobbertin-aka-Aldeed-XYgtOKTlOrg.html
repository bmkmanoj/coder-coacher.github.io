month is a July meteor Club QA this
month we have Eric da Burton with us
welcome to the show Eric thank you so uh
you're there's a little disconnect here
so people don't know eric is the the guy
that goes by al deed is that how you say
that sure goes violator all deed yeah
I'll deed on atmosphere and github in
all those places so you may know him by
that name as well and so he's definitely
one of the more prolific package authors
on atmosphere and he's also recently
started working at dispatch me so
welcome to the show man thanks for
having me so what I'm kind of curious
like what what are you doing over there
at dispatched shot me can you talk about
that at all uh it's really top secret I
can't say anything okay uh actually
we're trying to be very you know
open-source friendly with everything
we're doing that we can be and you can
you know expect more of that in the
future under the dispatch username or
organization so there's already a
probably if you if you look on github
quite a few be your packages on a
dispatch that are written by mere or the
other beer developers at dispatch uh the
kinds of things that we're looking at
are possibly doing rest endpoints in
meteor we've worked a little bit with
sashko on the simple rest package and
that that vein trying real you know a
lot of things that other people are
dealing with scalability Mongo versus
postgres testing microservice
is and then like looking into ECMO
script six or 2015 patterns going
forward so a lot of the same things that
you hear from other companies and people
using meteor but also trying to really
trying to come up with patterns that we
can kind of agree on in the community
for things that people currently do in
five different ways and work really
helpful right now we're just sort of
like part of that noise but we're really
hopeful that we can work with some of
the other companies that are using
meteor and you know solidify and also
working with mdg directly and solidify
patterns around anything that's not you
know defined by the core you know how do
you how do you do this how do you deal
with security how do you deal with you
know what's the best way to deal with
certain things that everybody has to
deal with meteor oh yeah so it's pretty
interesting and some other you've you
know many of you probably heard of rakes
are AIX Morton henriksen is also working
at dispatch and has been helping at
these kinds of things he's the kind of
the brains behind the collection FS
package and ground ed and boom oh no and
I can't remember what else but so he's
pretty prolific a package writer and
meteor and you know we r us and few
other meteor developers are basically
doing you know trying to do cool things
at dispatch and yet solved their
problems they've had with these existing
apps as well yeah and so they were
originally on Rails right and you you've
kind of been hoping the port from rails
to meteor yes and no yes they were
originally on Rails they're still on
rails for the v1 REST API and for the
some of the apps the desktop one of the
desktop apps they there's a court of a
mobile app that is on meteor and a
couple other apps that around meteor and
like I said we're looking into a V to
rest api and easier and also looking
into a lot of micro services around
meteor but not necessarily porting all
the rails code at this point you know
there's a lot of it and there's a lot of
logic and so what we're actually doing
is continuing to use the the postgres
back end that's rails talks to and
implementing some rather creative
caching of that into Mongo so basically
real-time caching Adam on go so that
meteor can can use Mongo directly we're
our opinion of meteor SQL at the moment
is that it's not production ready yeah
it's certainly not supported by core
meteor yet so at the moment we're we're
going the route of having basically a
entire cache of the database that we
that we use for the meteor apps but
works pretty well actually yeah yeah
we're doing something similar with one
of my clients they're using Drupal
actually to input data and then it's
getting synced over to Mongo and then we
have a meteor app that's kind of
bringing out the Mongo data so makes
sense to me oh yeah and it's you know at
the moment it's not a completely
shareable thing but it was our intention
to try to you know come up with patterns
and sharing around that kind of caching
layer as well so because it's kind of a
common thing that people want to do yeah
that makes sense definitely right so
let's take looks like we got some
questions in here now for some of the
viewers actually whoa we just got a
whole bunch all right so we'll just got
yeah yeah really I don't it's not though
that's the funny part well maybe maybe
Tim Braden is the question
he's definitely got the most in here so
just uh if you're watching live feel
free to vote you can go to the crowd
cast link if you're watching on google+
i put a link on the page there click on
that and you can you can watch on that
page as well and then also submit all
the questions and stuff and there's a
chat so we'll just we'll take the top
voted ones here the first ones from
Lauren sands ramshaw I know that he's
hit some performance problems before and
so his question is particularly around
blaze have you hit blaze rendering
performance problems with your with
something like your data tables package
and do you have any general advice in
that area I'm assuming he means to like
track it down ah that kind of thing
actually I find the I don't recall any
blaze rendering issues with tabular we
you know that while back there was some
issues with a template nesting that were
I was causing some issues with auto form
due to the way that it kind of has a lot
of nesting going on which got fixed so
since then I haven't really seen a lot
of blaze rendering issue that that said
I'm using several of my things are using
a unreleased version of tabular that
probably has some in performance fixes
so I'm actually hoping to get that
released in the next week or so nice so
if you are having problems with tabular
my advice is look for that next release
but generally speaking of I find blaze
to be pretty good performance wise I
mean if it's you know um cheap enough
mobile device maybe not but if you have
it if you have enough power its I find
it to be pretty good awesome
yeah so I'll have to find the link maybe
if Lauren's watching he can post it in
the chat or something but he actually
had an issue where he was rendering some
stuff he opened a bug with me here so I
think that's maybe why he's asking he's
okay hit some performance stuff before
all right uh so Tim Brandon by the way I
said Brayden I don't know where that
came from apparently I missed an end
haha uh one of his questions is what
rendering framework do you prefer react
angular or plays I'm kiss blaze uh I
like blaze I like it a lot um I I
because i like it and I've been doing a
lot of projects that worry in it I know
the most about it I I like the idea of
react and I think you know for the same
reasons a lot of people do which is you
know the the backing behind it and like
the chances that it will actually turn
out to be pretty good by the time it's
fully implemented and already is pretty
good I don't know how much I'm on the
bandwagon of Port everything to react
versus blaze because I feel like a lot
of work went into blaze and it does what
it does well pretty well so but I do I
definitely do and I saw there's another
issue there about you know how to form
being agnostic and I definitely do want
to go in that direction because I you
know you don't know what the future is
going to hold with regard to components
and the rendering capabilities of these
engines so I think you know I'm not
ready to abandon blaze anytime soon for
react but we're definitely exploring
react and react native at
dispatch and some of that exploration
might impact my by thinking as well so I
guess as with most things it's kind of
remains to be seen but for now I'm
pretty happy with the performance and
the capabilities of blaze yeah I guess I
would echo those kind of sentiments for
me like i don't know i think i've said
it before like I you know I started
doing web development when I was like 16
or 17 so this was like 96 or 97 and I
remember putting like CSS and JavaScript
directly in the HTML and it felt like
you know when when CSS came along and
you were able to extract that out into a
separate file that that made a lot of
sense to me and I'm kind of the same way
like I'd rather have my javascript in my
CSS live in a different place than my
HTML and so react still feels a little
weird to me um I think I should still
dive in and probably at least build a
project with it and I i do want to play
with react native i think that could be
interesting as well so yeah I had some
some of the same um last year I had to
do a project with famous and I had some
of the same kind of misgivings about
famous at which you know I've got a lot
of misgivings of all famous actually
after trying that but I do too it's a
little bit different situation but but
it's the same idea that yeah it's like
kind of just how do you like to think
about things and I'm I definitely like a
lot of separation and a lot of I don't
know I mean there's there's not a lot of
differences when you get down to it but
you know it tamiya will probably be it
does it perform well and what kind of
tools are there her you know packages
are there around whichever one I'm going
to use yeah yeah I would think the react
component system might get interesting
like being able to pull in some exactly
some stuff yeah everyone's noticing
we're skipping over answering anything
about angular in the chat uh yeah I just
it's not that I don't like angular but I
just I really have not had a chance to
build anything substantial and within
so I don't have a good frame of
reference for it yeah I'd be in the same
boat like I built one little kind of
interactive app on a page in a rails app
like three years ago so that's probably
not enough for me to really answer
anything all right so done with that so
the the one you you mentioned before you
know I Tim said again i can't wait for
an auto form that is rendering platform
agnostic something that works with react
blaze and angular would that be
difficult to build and you know and on
to that do you think i mean are you
thinking about that and if so do you
think it'll be something like user
accounts where we're gonna have like
like a core package and then like you
know a front-end package that bundles on
top of that possibly um that's
definitely something I've thought of and
going back to last fall or even earlier
i had done experiments with pure web
components and polymer and other types
of things as potential ways of kind of
plugging in a separate component
architecture it felt like it was not the
right time to be going in that direction
yet when i taught it just wasn't like
there were too many other things that
needed to be kind of cleaned up and
stabilized about the package and and
also just web components in general need
to be kind of figured out I feel um I
don't so I think it would be actually be
somewhat hard to to do that just because
of there's a lot of magic that happens
in on a form that is kind of dependent
on the way blaze works but it's
definitely like as I'm doing new things
it's going to be on my mind to architect
it in that way but I don't think it'll
be any change to the issue backlog on
malformed it's probably a ways away and
if somebody really wants to dig into
you know if it's not me maybe it can
happen sooner yeah you fully support
someone investigating it yes yeah feel
free to hack the package and let me know
what you find out yeah well it
definitely so Tim asked that question I
think he's been working a lot with react
as well so um maybe he's a good
candidate for that yeah I know other
people have mentioned it too so it's
certainly we could probably pull to pull
together a group and start investigating
if we want to yeah that would be awesome
so I mean do you have like is there
already an issue open to discuss it or
should someone open an issue if they're
curious wouldn't want to do something
like that I don't remember if there's an
issue at the moment I know there was a
discussion somewhere but I don't
remember if it was in and I'm getting
hungry form yeah sounds like it makes
sense to talk about maybe in the hata
form github issues or something yeah it
should have an issue if it doesn't
there's quite a backlog on all the phone
right now and it's something I'm working
through but because of that I'm not even
I don't even have the full issue list in
my reign at the moment but now I do as
you know there was there is a an issue I
think discussing something along those
lines but it might not be that exact
thing yeah so I I won't say like I don't
without looking at numbers you know I'd
say you're definitely up there as far as
most popular package with auto form
maybe not like iron-router status but
I'm going to cherry pick my own question
here do you have any advice for someone
wanting to release an open source
package and how do you get people to use
your package and what's it look like
when you become a really popular package
author like what does it suck up a lot
of your time good questions well first
of all the most popular packages of mine
which probably led to people finding the
other packages of mine were written
pretty early in the meteor package days
before the you know before the
atmosphere
cited on everything and um I think part
of it was just I think there's two main
things which are probably not the things
you would think one is documenting them
really well because there was a lot of
packages at the time that like seemed
pretty cool if you kind of dug into the
code but they had virtually no
documentation and my packages definitely
need help with better documentation
sites but at least the read knees are
pretty thorough mm-hmm and the other
thing was just beat the old package
website bumped you to the top whenever
you do the release and for a while I was
doing releases daily pretty much trying
to perfect them and or pulling in other
people's health there was a lot of
people who helped along the way yeah so
I think I got a lot of visibility just
by being bumped to the top of the list
every every day basically for a few
months and also there was just not
really much in the way of packages that
did the things that mine did which is
the whole reason why I created them I I
had hoped like creating packages if
something good is already out there yeah
so I never really intended for them to
be you know popular or used by anyone
else my thinking was and it was it was
actually like for any of you who haven't
published any packages or open source
things it's um I can be a little scary
to push like to push enter on that
published command the first time or
something because you know you're kind
of putting your work out there or to you
know make your repo public or something
but it's it's worth it if if only to get
a lot of good feedback and help key
weighing your packages that you're using
any way in the things you're building
and then you know it as a side benefit I
think it brought a lot of opportunities
to me I probably wouldn't have the job
dispatch if it weren't for my packages
so that's a plug for you there yeah
that's
I just think anyone's thinking about
releasing things I would also say even
if it's like you know competition with
existing package please release it it's
i mean that's kind of how this all works
is you just if you just there's
something you don't like you kind of
either fork or do your own thing and and
release it and then you know the kind of
everything gets better as that happens
more and more kind of organically so i
think it's it's pretty cool and i
encourage people to you know make as
many packages you can even if they're
stupid and if you later realize they're
stupid just you know put a note in the
readme so people stop using it but don't
be afraid to just they never stopped
using it that's the interesting thing
right even if you put a note there they
say well that is true um so maybe you
know take that with a grain of salt but
yeah but I would definitely say you know
there was a time where it's like it some
of us probably feel that the the meteor
package realm was a little more pristine
than say no there are some of the other
package repositories just because of it
being new or basically and I think we
sort of lament like all of the junk
packages and things appearing there but
that's not really the issue the issue is
more about having good tools to organize
and find the package you want and so I
would encourage people to you know this
publishes many packages you can just
yeah yeah I would say is fine it will
flag it if it's junk but you know it's
like just do it and then everybody can
benefit from each other yeah I would
totally agree and I think you know
atmosphere kind of helps drive some of
that right like we don't we still can't
see the algorithm even though uh meteor
owns it now um I still hope they open
source it um but yeah I would definitely
say like atmosphere does a slightly
better job than some of the other
package systems that helping expose the
ones that you may be actually mean to to
use and you know i mean i would agree
like
early on you know putting out accounts
entry like just releasing it once a week
was a great way to pick up new users and
documentation is super important but I
also feel like you know for me like
there's some packages i have an update
in a while just because i feel like
there's some amount of QA I have to do
so even though I get great pull requests
like I still need to test it out and I
don't have great tests in place on some
of these packages so you know you got to
feel confident and accepting other
people's code and owning it because
you're putting your name on it and
putting it out there and potentially
causing yourself some amount of
delusions coming in when something
breaks yeah that's absolutely true and I
should have mentioned that I mean it put
as many packages out there as you want
but write tests for them yes if you have
tests for them then you can very easily
accept pull requests and that's kind of
the like the golden I'll get there so
write your writing unit tests and I
would also suggest maybe doing that and
jasmine as that seems to be the way
things are going instead of tiny tests
and we've recently converted a bunch of
our tiny test to jasmine in dispatch and
you know you get a lot of benefits out
of that yeah would you say I mean is
that primarily just because you feel the
matches are better and a little more
readable or is there some other reason
you you did that um well more there's
you know more built in Matt stubs and
mocks and um yeah i'm actually not spies
and all that kind of stuff yes wise i'm
not i'm not a like a test writing expert
and a lot of my packages could use more
tests but it's something that I
definitely if I were doing it over i
would probably written more tests you
know some of mine have a lot of tests
simple schema has a lot of tests but I
can certainly tell the difference with
with something like auto form that
doesn't have a lot of tests partially
because it's difficult stuff to test but
it's a lot harder for me to pull in
people's
code into auto form because I have to
kind of go through a lot of manual
testing of a lot of corner cases and
things like that yeah yeah I would agree
um yeah I you know but that's a very
interesting point I think for me like I
i love mdg and i love what they put out
but tiny test is definitely like the
ghetto corner of cover media itself and
i think it works just good enough for
them to do what they need to do and like
they just left it at that but it's like
I remember the first time I used it some
of the mashers didn't even do what they
said they did and so I think some I
still don't yeah is true or something
that yeah yeah let me so all right ah so
it done on that one and we'll come back
to the top here uh Ben Strahan my media
club podcast co-host asked what are your
thoughts on meteor astronomy have you
taken a look at that at all yes I have I
haven't actually tried to use it but i
have read over it I think it's uh I
think it's cool I think it's something
that I would probably have used you know
initially several of my apps if it
existed at the time I think it goes
along with what I said that just like
you know even if it's competing with
something else go ahead and put it out
there and people can decide you know
what they like what they don't like and
you can borrow from each other and tell
you everything is as good as it needs to
be so I yeah I mean I would I think it's
a little bit different way of thinking
about things and there's always sort of
like the a piecemeal approach to to
dealing with those kinds of issues as
well opposed by the the more you know
like top-down structured approach of how
you're going to deal with it under warm
or whatever you want to call it yeah
I you know I had different times in my
life I've preferred different approaches
and I think a lot of it just depends on
you know what were the needs of the app
and things like that so I i think you
know and there's there's always going to
be something coming along that seems
really good too and it's tempting to
jump ship and I do that sometimes but
sometimes you end up regretting it so I
don't know if that helps at all but
basically I would say like you know like
try different things that come out I
think astronomy is a good package and or
a good sweet and you know I hope it
actually continues to get some some good
coating behind it and get up to where it
needs to be yeah this acts are
definitely pretty pretty pretty full
there from what I've seen right effin
Lee think it's one of those things like
for me if I were gonna start a new
application I would think about giving
this a try and the thing is like just
spend a couple hours playing with it and
see what do you get you know like I I
think even just a couple hours with the
package is probably enough to evaluate
it and decide if it's worth it for you
or not so give it a try and you know
even if you end up throwing away a
branch or a throwing away even a whole
repo and starting over because it didn't
work like where you got your down half a
day like that that's worth worth it i
think in the end if even if it doesn't
work out you know you've you've learned
something and that can help I think as
long as there you know whatever you're
using is extensible that's kind of the
key if you if you don't get locked into
their way of doing things necessarily or
you have some way of like writing an
add-on package or that kind of thing and
it's okay you know any time that it's a
my way of the highway thing then you get
into a lot of you know kind of pouring
through code and trying to figure out
how you can hack it to do what you want
so that would be my only consideration
for any type of package like that and
you know there's there's a number of
other
um packages that have done you know
things similar to my packages that I
think are good packages I just they're
just not you know I don't use them
necessarily because I have to use mine
in order to keep maintain them but you
know I think well mesosphere comes to
mind but i'm not sure if even if that's
still maintained because like i said i
don't use it but that was another one
that sort of came the same time as some
of my packages and took a different
approach and I think you know that's
cool too yeah all right ah oh so this
one just popped to the top what's on the
road map for auto form that's another
question from Tim uh so the immediate
road map is catching up with issue
backlog well actually before that even
is just getting the developer anch
working and released that ah that is
basically pulling in the things in
Sasha's fork that telescope relies on so
that telescope can go back to using not
using a fork of auto form there's a
there's a couple of kind of sticky
issues with it at the moment that I need
a good chunk of time to debug so
hopefully it will get that in the next
couple weeks released and then getting
through issue backlog a lot of which I
think are duplicates and questions but
there's still a lot there that need to
get to get through so then the like the
feature roadmap is basically pulling out
the bootstrap theme as the default
pulling that into a separate package and
just having plain theme as the default
and the
and that's which sort of a relatively
small change because those they're
already quite separate within there it's
just kind of moving files around and
changing dependencies and then i'd
really like to improve the contributor
documentation so I think that it's the
code is clean enough that if there's a
little documentation around it they
could I could get help with it be it be
formally it was quite quite a mess and
then auto form five cleaned it up
internally quite a bit but there's still
some some lingering bugs from that that
I've been dealing with and so now I feel
like I'm you know pretty happy with how
it's internally architected and it could
be kind of described better in a
contributor document and hopefully can
get it maybe even some if you're
interested in you know push access or
helping kind of transition it to a more
community maintain package yeah that's
something that I've been thinking about
doing I want to be very careful about it
because it's actually fairly highly used
package and I want people that still
depend on it but kind of a slow
transition to some kind of community
ownership would be good managed
community ownership and and then just
yeah a lot of the the UI component type
stuff is probably next on the list and
just looking at how we can it has the
idea of input types already which are
sort of like UI components that are
input specific and so the idea is can we
kind of abstract that more and and kind
of help push along this debate about
blaze components and you know make that
make it so that any blaze component or
any any component ideally whatever that
is could you know sort of define
a few things about how you get values
into it values out of it and such and
then essentially you just work with auto
form it within an auto form so yeah that
makes sense to me I think like the
biggest issue for me is just when I got
started with it where do I look you know
like you've got collection too and
simple schema and auto form and it's
like you're your kind of digging through
three docs and trying to figure out like
where do I read about this particular
thing that I'm trying to accomplish and
you know sometimes it turns out it's in
simple schema sometimes it's in auto
form so kind of interesting yeah I hear
that a lot and that's it's one of those
things that when you understand the
distinctions between everything and how
they relate it makes a lot of sense but
until you understand it it makes almost
no sense right so I've definitely I mean
I've already have written kind of a
combined documentation website quite a
while ago and just never got it finished
and put up and so I'm looking I'm still
exploring how to hopefully have kind of
a community maintained combined
documentation site for those three
packages that goes a little bit more um
in a combined way through how to use
them mmhmm yeah that makes sense all
right so how did you get hooked on meet
here um well I guess it was a couple
years ago now probably wrong um I don't
know when it was but it was whenever
like maybe meteor 0.5 or something was
um and I I really just liked the idea
built a few somewhat complex apps in PHP
and just using you know like the
old-fashioned age
type stuff and I'd like the idea of
something with WebSockets for a project
i was going to build and kind of
explored a number of different databases
as well and it had kind of tried out a
few different like you know sort of
WebSocket streaming type libraries and i
think one of them was almost what i
wanted i don't remember the name anymore
but but they you know there was like a
comment from somebody that was like well
I think meteor is better than this and I
was like all right I'll check out this
meteor thing and I guess that you know
it was it was at the time what I was
looking for it was almost what I was
looking for I think this was baby just
before the Edit accounts so I was kind
of like it's like well if only it had
built in accounts and then I was like oh
look they're coming up with that next
week so yeah there was it was kind of
nice you know especially for at that
time to build a prototype it also at
that time it was not working as well as
advertised it was still very you know
rough product so I think that's a lot of
the reason why I ended up digging into
the code and writing some packages
related to the things I wrote just
because I had to fix next to get things
working so yeah that makes sense I you
know for me I came from a rails
background and I had I had subscribed to
rails caspro and he did this series of
screencasts in the pro account where he
was comparing like angular and ember and
backbone and basically was creating the
same app over and over again and those
apps you know it was basically just like
a almost like a to-do list type of thing
and you know it took him two episodes to
explain each of those kind of frameworks
and then he did meteor and it took him
you know I think like 16 minutes so it
was like oh
was half the time to build the same app
a meteor and I'm like what the crap is
this like that's quite interesting to me
and so that's when I perked up and
started taking notice and I think I got
into it around 06 like somewhere like 06
4065 somewhere around there so yeah kind
of interesting yeah I mean it's not it's
usually a kind of rapid prototyping
magic that brings people in yeah for
sure like I had a nap I built in rails
and it just wasn't working well and so I
wanted to use I looked at at node and
mpm because they had a package for doing
airplay stuff and it looked like it was
better so um you know that's kind of why
I switch and I was able to build rebuild
the entire app in a weekend which was
much faster than I've done in rails even
after like nine ten years of realist
knowledge right it was quite impressive
to me all right so do you think I should
join Hair Club for Men thanks Ben will
appreciate that what do you think no yes
no comment no comment good enough for me
all right so uh you mean a lot so this
from Tim whistle hope I said that right
uh you mean a lot to the mediator
community how does funding work for you
do you have enough free time I'm
assuming he means to work on your open
source stuff um no I don't have enough
free time at the moment that's why a lot
of the packages have a backlog I don't
I'm committed to not to not letting any
my packages um die and you know that
might indefinite some of the packages
are more important than others and that
might mean some of them don't see any
love for many many months but like I
said one of my plans is to try to switch
some of the more popular ones to a
little bit more of a community managed
system but just being a little bit
careful about doing that without losing
too much control at least until I'm you
know
happy with a whatever kind of a group or
board might might decide the direction
of them I you know my time basically
varies a lot so I've been very busy
lately just you know with taking a new
job at dispatch and up and other things
going on so I am planning for to have
more free time for the packages and the
you know a later summer early fall so
hoping i can get kind of caught up with
everything by then lease with actual
issues but i should say that I'm they're
not there's a lot of you know quote
unquote issues on github but I'm using a
lot of them in production there's
there's not really you know showstopper
issues on most of them yeah just a
little corner case right if you happen
to be in that corner case it might stop
your show but but and you know if it
really does and you like and you're just
freaking out feel free to you know bang
bang on my door over email so that i can
take a look at the issue more quickly
but but yeah i think you know i i'm
going to come up with some way to make
sure that any packages that are used or
maintained and some of the companies
that use the packages companies as in
companies that actually have funding or
revenue such as dispatch are interested
and you know maybe a sponsoring bug
bounties for some of them that they use
including not just my packages with some
of the other packages and so this has
been kind of discussed up from time to
time but never kind of solidified but
something like that could develop to
kind of make sure that the packages
continue to get the love they deserve
and also a few of them i i'm hoping
we'll get kind of absorbed into core at
some point
template extension being one example and
um yeah well apparently I've already
started to absorb that or try to absorb
that at the core I put a pull request in
and I didn't realize that's part of what
template extensions did but ok I added
like is parent data so you get a parent
template so you could like get at the
parent template yeah current one and
template extension is actually one that
was a few different peoples extensions
that we decided to kind of combine so I
don't want to take full credit for
everything in there but but it's
basically a bunch of useful things and
you know I would argue that most of them
are useful enough to throw into the
blaze package so yeah and there is an
actual there is actually an issue on the
media repo sort of planning that out or
anticipating doing that so I would I'm
hoping that that and maybe a couple
other small ones i have like a reload
extras package as well and a couple
others that are kind of just like extras
so hopefully those can be absorbed decor
and then yeah I want have to maintain
those yeah nice yeah I would agree i
think that stuff needs to needs to
happen i think looking at like um just
theming something like telescope or you
know like i will worked on letterpress
with sam as we're getting ready for our
next testing class i think that that
makes sense because people want to be
able to customize a template they don't
necessarily want to be relying on Sasha
or Sam's markup and they want to do
something else so makes a lot of sense
to me to have something like template
extensions live in core right for sure
and do you have so I guess get tips been
renamed my question would be do you have
a karate pay the count if people want to
like give you money for your open source
work I do yes all right all right just
under the LD or something yeah
there I go I don't think I don't think
it buys me much more than a sandwich a
week at this point but oh you're welcome
to contribute it's not as I don't think
money is necessarily going to make
anything go faster but yeah you know if
I can go out to dinner once a week oh I
guess I won't say no to that nice
totally agree all right more questions
so I think you started to dive into this
one Rob fallows said i would i'd like to
see is reduction in dependencies on CSS
packages do you have any plans for
example to remove the requirement for
bootstrap and tabular and so I mean you
started to elude that that's the next
step for auto form but have you thought
about it and kind of other settings like
tabular yeah I do want to do that for
tabular as well um by thinking in both
cases was kind of that um you know well
usually I try to make the package do
what I need to do for the project that
I'm making it for and so that was was
making tabular initially for an admin
project that was in bootstrap and it was
easier to make it simplistic by pulling
those files in because it gets a little
bit complex with kind of like load order
and version dependencies and stuff so I
did it that way initially but I did I
did eventually want to pull out that
dependency you know ideally it's just a
light rate lightweight wrapper around
data tables and then you can do what you
want similarly it you know since since
you mentioned tabular is that was also
done with the explicit need of you know
dealing with large collections on a
server that I wanted the table package
to manage the publications for so then
tap into
searching and filtering and all that
yeah and that I kind of had some
limitations if you want it if you're
using that already antha then you want
to eat it for say a client collection or
something that you do have all the data
published to the client already so that
would be kind of on the tabular roadmap
as well as so right now there are other
packages that rap data tables in a more
simple way and would let you do those
those kinds of things but I know if you
you know a lot of people don't want to
use two packages which I understand so
it would be it would be nice to kind of
support a simple mode say where the data
is all on the client and it doesn't have
to do it does it's probably one of the
most complex packages i have it does a
lot of trickery to get all that to work
so would be nice for a simple collection
of you if we could avoid that trickery
and just sort of you know do a clean
implementation around data tables so
those are kind of the big yeah those are
the two big kind of tabular changes that
we want to make it that would be after
this release that I'm that I need to
release which has a bunch bug fix this
in it yeah all right you close but I
think we'll be able to hit most of these
ones it oh no maybe not there's a lot
for me to all right is it one ordered
answers ah uh what's the benefit this
from all mock Corran Corran I don't know
I probably butchered that sorry man um
what's the benefit of using simple
schema package I thought the idea is to
go schema-less uh which is what Mongo is
about and what I understand more of the
future uh there were ever a question
that's hard to answer shortly um well
it's in some ways it's a matter of taste
it could be schema list but ultimately
you want to know
the schema for a number of reasons
anyway you know auto form or collection
to you know validating the input going
in and out is you know is one way
because you know even say your scheme
Alice you you know might know that you
don't want certain properties to be
visible or editable by certain people
and you might want to manage that in the
schema and you know I think it's just
really hard also from a development
perspective if you get multiple
developers at all to you know you end up
having to write down some kind of schema
right you have to track it somehow hmm
and then also just from from migration
standpoint things can get really ugly if
you're if you're too on the schema lists
train you can end up where you have like
you know multiple different structures
within your document and it can really
be helpful just from the get go to have
a schema but there's certainly small
collections where I don't bother
attaching a schema and I think it's nice
to be able to do it either way that yeah
well of course the obvious benefit if
you use auto form is that you can
generate crud forms for it so that's
that's why a lot of people do what I
guess but yeah yeah yeah and there's a
lot of extra packages too so you can
implement things like summer note or
select to based off that data to so but
yeah I would definitely echo echo that
sentiment I think um schemas make a lot
more sense once you scale past one
developer because you're you're kind of
getting out of the range of like oh it's
just all in my head and I can deal with
that and now oh hey I'm going to make
sure that this person also understands
my intentions and so I would say schema
is definitely one form of that tests are
properly another form of that of kind of
declaring your intentions with the code
and that kind of thing so
make sense so yeah I mean it it's might
be worth clarifying that it's still
schema lists the database level yeah I
mean you can you can get some benefit
out of a business logic kind of schema
and then still have the benefits of a of
not actually being forced into a schema
uh you know you don't have to like a
copy your database schema when you're
copying your database or something like
that so you know there's there's some of
that benefits you still get but while
having a little bit of control over it
yeah yeah so I think short of like
putting unique indexes or something in
place like that's really the only kind
of schema you could actually enforce on
Mongo so right so cool all right it's
the good ones from Erin Judd so have you
seen packages like utility spin and
utilities avatar move away from their
original developer to a support
organization I think some of that's from
Sasha he's had this idea of like you
know getting an organization together an
atmosphere and maybe even in github and
trying to like have it more community
supported like you mentioned what do you
what do you think about this idea is a
good way to keep up support for things
like on go work security or template
except extensions um what do you think I
think yeah it is the way I would like to
see things go I think we all yeah a
certain level would like to see that and
we talked about it and then kind of like
it doesn't happen because it involves
some work and right now you can't change
package name is that easily and all this
stuff but i think uh i think it has to
happen for the know anything that's not
basically you know i think when you had
your QA with matt
let's see he kind of was saying like
there's some things that are kind of
core enough that they would consider
pulling you know at least documenting
them or pulling them in but there's
other things that that kind of like most
people need but you know and are very
popular but wouldn't necessarily be they
wouldn't want to be you know weighed
down by having to maintain those so I
think anything that kind of fits into
that second category is really ideal for
some kind of one or more community
management groups to take hold of it
basically you know what an organization
a media organization in the package
structure that would you know have some
sort of defined organizational structure
charter members some way of getting
involved but only if you're you're
worthy and then you know some sort of
open democratic way of voting up and
fixing things would be great yeah you
know that's this kind of interesting
actually because uh we already have an
example of that with velocity itself um
you know it kind of came together and
there are a number of maintained errs
and there's a central organization
around it both an atmosphere and in
github and I I would say it's moved
forward with relatively few bumps in the
road there were definitely a few
disagreements over course structure but
and you know that did cause a little bit
of fracture but ultimately you know I
think velocity is getting to a place
where it's it's much easier to to
integrate and use with your application
and I would tend to agree i think i
would love to see maybe more of a shift
around that and there's certainly
precedents for it within the community
um and I know like what you're talking
about is around the collections packages
itself I know there's been a lot of
conversation about having like a
collections organization and
moving things like helpers collection
helpers and collection hooks and auto
form and a bunch of other things that
kind of work with that stuff and kind of
like move it all under that name space
so yeah and I don't know you know if
that in particular will be the way we go
but some kind of organization would be
would be ideal yeah and i think i think
you're right the velocity is maybe a
good experience to learn from sort of
going that I think we just need to
prioritize you know us being like some
of the package authors just need to
prioritize getting that plan in place
and just doing it you know so it's
another thing as I have a little bit
more time hopefully in the coming months
i'll try to think about and hopefully
other people who would be involved in
that are also thinking about it nice
good answer alright let's see can we do
one more maybe we got like 30 minutes or
so uh what meteor projects do you work
on when you're not being awesome
creating community packages so we've
already talked about dispatched out me
but what else um not unfortunately not a
lot of amazing projects that i can share
this moment but i I've had the
opportunity to work a number of the year
Cordova a couple media Cordova apps that
were kind of like blazing the trail of
all that functionality late last year
and that was taking up a lot of my time
those us so I pieces of those were also
worked on by differential not sure you
know how much I'm able to say about all
those but they they were certainly fun
meteor projects that eventually I
believe will be you know iphone android
apps you know with quite a bit of scale
to them but I kind of
past those off when I took the job at
dispatch yeah yeah and if anyone's
interested I I do know the guy behind
those and he's looking to bring someone
into the project I know he's got such a
great help but um I don't think that
help will last um yeah so I mean it's a
interesting well there's a couple of
projects related to that and they're
very interesting yeah you did some work
with Aaron and reaction too didn't you
yeah so last year I did a bunch of work
for them primarily looking into um dr.
izing meteor and just working on the
reaction of Commerce project that's
where the angle work security package
came out of which was primarily written
by me and a couple other ones the under
the angle works but basically you know
that's there also i think maybe hiring
so if anyone's interested but they're
building a pretty advanced ecommerce
platform in meteor ah just exciting
stuff definitely and they're actually
I've been doing a lot of work with them
as well as of late so they are fun to
work with them say that they're fun guys
yeah yeah and girls yeah its future all
right so I guess that's about it it's
six o'clock so i want to say thank you
to you Eric for coming on the show was
awesome well and if anyone wants to get
in touch with you how would they do that
um well I haven't been doing this the
social networks thing so I I'm sure a
lot of you probably are trying to follow
me on Twitter and not getting any luck
but I at the at the moment probably is
best to well if it's an issue file it on
the repo I I will be responding to those
at some point when I catch up
but otherwise you can email me the al de
ed edge email and you know I you know
someone asked about the you know what
happens when you get to your packages
get kind of popular and one thing is you
can't keep up with your email as well
sometimes especially when they're bugs
that cause a bunch of people to email
you and you can't keep up with them so I
would just say you know I might not
respond right away but I try to read
emails eventually otherwise um I'm on
some of the like community slack things
as well so the media club well I'm not
sure yeah get on that but hahaha yeah so
I guess it's like a little softball up
for me there you go if you're interested
you can go to patreon REO and calm /
media club and Eric's in there and a ton
of other people were up to like a
hundred and some people in there it's
definitely like the most active meteor
slack chat room that I've been a part of
space talk tried to give it a run for
its money but it's kind of died down
over there too so um yeah you can join
their it's like 10 bucks a month and
that goes towards helping me pay my
bills and regards to the podcasts both
of them that I do and then this kind of
stuff and then just getting ready next
month we'll be starting like a private
for anyone that's paying twenty bucks a
month we'll do a private QA as well so
all right man well thanks what we really
appreciate it and thanks for watching
guys yes thank you for the questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
