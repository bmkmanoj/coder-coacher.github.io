seventeenth 2015 welcome meteor fans i'm
your host josh owens along with my
co-host Dean Radcliffe welcome Dean
welcome back thank you nice to see you I
I I think I actually like this rotating
co-host thing to kind of fun yeah so and
I know like will save this till the end
but I know you got some exciting news
too so it's good to have ya this week so
this week we are going to be talking
about the dark side of the moon um check
is a reference to the bad things in
meteor but the moon's not really am a
meteor is it it's a moon just I just a
packaging UX gravity hurts easily
debugging meteor astronomy not to be
confused with astronomer and crater ama
so let's uh let's get into it did you
did you read this this article meteor
the dark side of the moon I did earlier
in the week and it's a you know got a
couple of things in there I mean I'm
pretty much a fanboy but I like hearing
people's you know uh critiques I think
discussion is good yeah what were your
thoughts on it mmm yeah I was like very
unimpressed actually so the the article
that I put out yesterday about debugging
meteor came out of you know like reading
this article and I'm just like man like
i don't know debugging's not that hard
and i literally googled like one of the
complaints is that debugging is really
hard with meteor cuz all you have is
console dot log and I'm like whoa that's
so not true so not true at all yeah and
so like I just I googled meteor debug
right just to see what will come up and
the first two hits talk directly about
how you can easily debug server side um
and so you know i don't know like this
this just feel
like um I don't know it's these things
aren't that hard like I the lack of
structure feels like yeah that could
maybe be a little difficult and if
you're not a discipline developer or an
experienced developer I could see where
you might struggle a little bit here and
there but the fact of the matter is
that's like a cultural discipline thing
to me not necessarily a problem with
meteor um you know like you should be
free to name your files however you want
and yeah kind of put them where you want
them to be in my opinion yeah now I'm
gonna be you know doing more meteor
projects and wondering you know whether
the lack of structure will bite at some
point but that is there is going to be a
suggested opinionated structure coming
out right for 1.2 this summer so it
might be a fair criticism now if you
feel that that kind of dictated from on
high structure is good but I go back to
like basic principles like Bob Martin
had a talk called screaming architecture
said that like you're when you open for
example a rails app the folders you know
models views controllers being the top
level of organization tells you nothing
about you know what is the domain of
this application like right you so he
advocated for a more component oriented
approach the differential boilerplate
kind of kept for a given component the
HTML Jas CSS files together I like that
I like components being local to each
other maybe even tucked into their own
packages but so I like the flexibility
and the good news with the 1.2 opinions
is that they're going to be more
suggestions than Commandments so but I
think that for a lot of people having a
standard way of doing things can ease
the cognitive burden of getting started
but I think when you've done a few I
mean you know
you want to structure them and I think
it's an advantage to not have to fit
into one structure yeah yeah totally
agree I mean I think you should have the
flexibility to do what you want and so
some of the other complaints have to do
with like the live reload you know like
he says he's got 300 files and whenever
he changes something it takes at least
five seconds to reload and so like just
today this even came up like I asked
someone like what you're I tweeted like
what's your favorite part of meteor and
someone responded and said I actually
hate live reload especially when I'm
working on my local macbook like it's
terrible and someone else responded said
oh I love DDP and then the second guy
saw the first guys response and he's
like oh hey just do you know meteor on
desh desh wants and it won't do the live
reload anymore I don't like problems all
is this really that hard and so like the
guy linked to a stack overflow post but
i don't i don't know like just again
seems like a non-issue to me i'm on i
think a 20 2012 macbook pro retina and I
I seem to be working pretty fine I mean
I really have any complaints about live
reload then he went on to talk about
debugging and that's what that's what
really got me because it's like you know
this this isn't really a thing you know
like he says debugging on the client
works well enough using chrome developer
tools period things get hairy on the
client when something goes wrong with
your templates which I disagree with
that as well that's not hairy at all and
then debugging the server side is quite
complex and you have to use the old
fashion consult up oh and so we'll get
into the other options when I talk about
yeah yeah the bugging story but I mean
this is just it's all false and I left
some comments um and then you know the
Kim another complaint was production
when it's your turn to deploy
a on a bare metal server it's not as
easy as meteor deploy to command so all
right it's an all deep boy yeah like I
don't number one you can't fault a
framework for giving you a very easy
deployment command um you can actually
host with see name on meteor com I did
it for ya Oh with the meteor club
podcast site and it works okay you know
the only downside is there's no support
right like when when meteor calm hosting
breaks who do you email yeah yeah so I
mean they don't they just don't have a
soul A's and all that kind of thing and
clearly the working on it but you know
digitalocean like I literally set up a
new site the other day for the media
club podcast and it took me about five
minutes and I think it took me another
five minutes to get engine X and ssl
setup because I wanted that stuff on
there as well but okay you know
literally half that was probably
spinning up and waiting for it to start
and then the other half was just issuing
like mups setup and mop boy right I mean
this stuff was a no-brainer to me I
don't know yeah well it it sounds like
this user has definitely done some work
with meteor and maybe just you need like
a platform for venting I wonder if if
they could also uh oh I guess they do
have a good parts not that good oh say
so we would write a strictly positive
article because I'm sure they've worked
with it enough to have seen some of the
benefits as well yeah so I think you
know the thing is he starts getting into
this so meteors only about a dev
workflow yes like so absolutely not I
would completely destroy yeah absolutely
so in the end he says bottom line meters
a very good idea and a good framework
but be sure that you need all the
features provided by meteor which I
don't think is true and I wouldn't
recommend it as a primary choice except
to build a prototype to test your ID and
move forward a learning process ah and
he said leaning process
I sometimes also make typos and blog
posts but I you know to me like this is
terrible like I just because like you
are either not a great developer or you
you didn't really like Google well
enough to find the answers to your
questions doesn't mean that that this is
a terrible framework or platform I see
plenty of businesses like large
businesses starting to grow out of
meteor and I I think it it works
absolutely great yeah and if meteor is
the dark side of the moon and dark side
of the moon was one of the greatest
selling albums of all time then then
bring it on yeah really so you know I do
think maybe there's a there's a few
legitimate complaints in here but
overall I would say this was to me and
on a uninformed post and you know I I
hope people like this reach out and try
to find help somewhere before they they
trash something is saying that it's not
really worth using just my two cents
indeed alright so we've been bringing me
down lately Josh what's that gravity
yeah just lately nice what tell me tell
me about this post cuz I actually
haven't seen it yet you just put it up
on crater like right before we went live
oh yeah I just popped it up on crater
because as I was if I made that package
kitchen and really did like some deep
dives as you have to Josh into you know
packaging and the relationships between
packages and and how to write them and
declare dependencies and so this article
was someone posted in an issue in my
package kitchen that it would it's
always a bad idea to declare your
dependencies when you're writing a
package without a version number now
that might be common sense to some but
when I whipped up package kitchen
the dependencies that I put in there did
not have axon the specific version
number and I didn't really understand
what the @ sign meant and was kind of
curious why a new way of using some ver
was invented I mean I am familiar with
node stuff so I didn't really know the
semantics of what what it meant so this
article is a heck pad where I'll redo
some of the the top of points on here is
that meteor does not always choose the
latest version particularly when you
depend up my package that package
depends on another package they have in
their constraints l for some rules that
they call gravity which kind of pin you
to older versions than you think and
bottom line is there's conflicts between
the documentation and the implementation
and what may be happening let me see if
I can use a specific example in here if
I depend on a package that lists and at
sign 1.2 dependency and that dependency
goes up to 1.3 it will 1.3 will not
automatically be pulled in by my by the
constraint solver because it is assuming
that maybe the author of the package
that you depend on doesn't know about
1.3 and so it's almost like the carrot
symbol in a node that kind of pins you
to patch versions it's very hard to
explain it's a mouthful the bottom line
is even people who have been working
with a package system for a long time
might not be aware of some of the more
subtle behaviors of it
and yeah makes sense yeah yeah yeah it
does um sorry I was muted there um I
think I'm wondering this this says
latest changes three months ago so this
seems a little bit older I'm trying to
think back three months ago would have
put us into April so this would have
been just after probably 1.1 came out
with the constraints all yeah the new
constraints over and all that stuff so
yeah well so this is like a design
behavior of the constraint solver so
here's kind of like the guiding advice
is that if you're offering a package you
must publish a new version of your
package if your dependencies go up in
number so the user of your package
doesn't automatically get those your
dependencies upgraded for free so you'll
have to upgrade them and push them out
which kind of retains a little bit of
control in in the package authors the
department so the flip side of that is
if you're if you've got an app and
you're using a package that has it's
called the transitive dependency the
dependencies of your dependencies if one
of those transitive dependencies has
been upgraded you can tell the
constraints of or pull in the latest
version by doing meteor add of that
higher version of the transitive
dependency that will be okay and
apparently there's also some behavior
that's different whether you're running
meteor test packages or whether you're
running your application it might pull
in different versions of the transitive
dependencies depending on which route
you go so I think this is just as the
constraint solver came out a lot of
people discovered that it didn't do what
they thought it did or what other
packaging systems might do and that you
know they'll say I want the last 24
hours back don't ask me how many hours
we wasted trying to figure
why our tests were failing right so
there's some pain in the community that
it doesn't do what people think it ought
to do yeah Persian gravity version yeah
yeah so you know I think number one like
the biggest thing is this needs to be
somewhere else right not off hidden in a
like back room I don't want to say back
room right like it's publicly available
but like in an out-of-the-way place hack
pad you know like this should be
documented somewhere for package authors
and I don't think it is I don't know
yeah well I could be wrong some of the
documentation is inconsistent with the
implementation and so I don't know where
that documentation lives I assume on
Doc's meteor com that's what I'm looking
at right now yeah yeah I don't know this
this would be interesting to turn to I
you know some of this like I've been
looking at it and um you know we'll talk
about like the lack of documentation on
debugging server side it should live a
meteor docs you know and it came out
right as 10 was coming out and I think
that developers were pushing hard to get
features in and maybe less hard to get
the docks where they needed to be and
like honestly you could probably employ
like two or three people just to work on
docs full time to keep up with the pace
of meteor in my opinion and get them
where they need to be yeah and I don't
know but I you know it's interesting I
often have complaints like space bars
docks they don't exist anywhere in
meteor documentation what whatsoever you
actually have to go into the meteor
github repo and you can find they
actually have some nice read knees but
they're in the github repo not know okay
not a meteor docs yeah and then there's
also this manual meteor calm that is a
deep dive on reactivity but it talks in
terms of depths and depths has been
tracker for quite some time now right
well so here's the thing like if you
look at manual Mediacom
I remember when they hired this person
and the person like it just the writing
process wasn't working very well and so
she ended up leaving and so like you
have this like crossover where I think
but you have to at least be a developer
to be writing docs to some degree
because you have to have a fundamental
understanding of how that's working and
so that I think it makes it harder to
hire for that position because
developers don't like writing docs true
that so any technical writers who want
to knock on mdgs door we're listening
this podcast please do so well in it you
know here's the kicker to write like
documentation is technical debt so any
time you make a change you gotta go
update that that documentation you know
and and so that that's also like an
extra layer of discipline you have to
have in place and that's where a lot of
people tend to fall down and if you look
at like rails for guidance they had the
the rails guides right and that way big
community-led effort there was really no
monetary exchange going on there or you
know people were just giving freely of
their time on a Wikipedia esque fashion
and it helped but you know at the same
time like every time a new version comes
out like I'm sure a lot of that team is
gonna have a heck of a time with rails 5
comes out you know so I don't know it's
tough it is tough so you said that they
can can use a more information on
debugging yes absolutely and you know
that was that was one of those things I
I've actually been emailing back and
forth with sashko after I posted the
post on debugging and he's like this is
this is good stuff and I agree this
should be in the docks well so I just
said like if I send in a PR because I so
I know you've got a PR sitting out there
I've got a PR sitting out there like no
one wants to do work that's never gonna
see the light of day and that that can
be frustrating in and of itself so i
just said to him like you know if I if I
write up some addition to the docks you
know do you think you'd help me get it
reviewed and and pulled in if it's
decent enough and he said absolutely I
try to be on top of documentation pull
requests like one hundred percent of the
time if I can so um he's he's definitely
wanting to see that uh so yeah I'm
losing you ah ah ah ah ok here we go oh
there we go that was terrible oh you
gonna okay about this sorry ok we'll see
how like I heard you for a while I think
I heard everything yeah so uh yeah
debugging um like I said I read that
article and just kind of like oh wow
like there must be a lack of knowledge
about debugging media and so I'll just
all outline all the things and we'll see
what that looks like and so I started
making the outline and I realize there's
actually quite a lot of different ways
to debug a meteor so the gist of it is
right like for me whenever you come into
a language you've got something like
console dot log or print or printf or
something like that you know and that's
that's your first debugging tool and the
one you'll never put down yes very true
very true it's definitely like sometimes
it's the easiest right to get going
right um but then I think they're starts
to be this slowness because your code
has to restored and your everything has
to rerun and for you to get that console
log again and so the the cycle of
tracking down the actual problem starts
to become a little longer oh yeah you
can do better with a real graphical
debugger yes well yeah it doesn't even
have to be graphical right like you can
just be what well like meteor shell
right and most people don't know about
meteor shell and so if you have a
running media application and the same
folder in your same meteor
folder you can type meteor shell and it
will run and connect into the other
running application and allow you to
issue commands you know it's like it's
an IRB or rebel basically for meeting
itself and that is that is quite handy
and they have autocomplete like they did
a really nice job with him mm-hmm um so
you know you can type meteor dot and
then hit tab and it'll give you all the
options that that that object has
underneath it which pretty awesome and
then you can run all kinds of things you
know you can make meteor calls if you
need to you can yeah you know put in
some data and play with that and like
run underscore commands on it if you
need to like you basically do everything
that you could do right and the razor
the regular chrome tools or chrome
devtools console but you get access to
all the meteor server environment as
well and so the next option will be the
chrome devtools you know obviously you
can inspect element open that up and
pull up the console and you start doing
things and interacting and I again you
can do a lot there right I'm again again
you can easily type meteor subscribe or
you can do meteorite user or you can run
underscore there you can play with
jquery for targeting like just all kinds
of different things but i think the
thing and this is what we were talking
about before the show you took my master
and meteor class and i think it
surprises me the number of people that
don't understand the basics of
javascript debugging and so built into
the core of javascript is the fact that
you can actually just type debugger
anyone in your code yeah it puts the
break point right there for you and so
an article I talked a little bit about
what a break point is but it's basically
just a pause right there in the
environment and then you start playing
with the code and I think this is the
most powerful of options in my opinion
because you can start looking variables
you can make your calls and look at the
results or you know anything you need to
do you can do right there in the
environment that the codes running and
you can right kind of
inspect everything you know and so all
right super super helpful so by default
if you have the chrome devtools browser
open then when you put that debugger
command and it's going to pause right
there when it hits that in the execution
and you know you'll see a pop-up and
they'll be like a gray overlay on your
screen with a pause and play button and
all that kind of stuff and then if you
want to on the server side you can use
debugger as well and so early on this
was kind of painful like you'd have to
fire up note inspector and like yeah
tell meteor to run and use that but as
of like 094 they baked in the meteor
debug command which does all the
wrapping for you and so when you type
you just kill your server and type
meteor to bug it'll start it back up and
it'll put all the node inspector stuff
in for you and in the logs the running
meteor logs you'll get you'll get a
little line that says you know connect
here to get to your note inspector and
you just pop that in and you get a
little chrome looking window like the
devtools looking window and you know
wherever your debugger is out once you
hit that line of code it'll pop in that
extra browser window and show you like
oh here's your coat environment you get
console you type things in it works
really really well you know yeah and I
think just most people don't know about
that everyone is always surprised when I
show them that feature and you know it's
been there for since probably October oh
that me or meteor debug has been October
yeah yeah and I mean it's it's always
supported meteor to bug or not meteor
bug but note inspector like you were
always able to use that to so I don't
know right right uh last but not least
is the the mobile browser this one was a
little bit newer to me absolutely
january i figured this out but you can
just open up safari and if you're
running an iOS simulator what are you
running and attached to USB device right
like I take my phone and plug it into my
computer and pull up some kind of web
view based something on there then you
get this like in the an article I've got
a screenshot you can go to develop and
you'll have a list of you know your
computer and the iOS simulator or the
device and you can see all the processes
you can attach to and basically it'll
just fire the sweet the dev tools and
connect to that device and then you can
start issuing commands of breakpoints
and all kinds of things which is super
helpful right right because I mean
that's even if even if nothing else like
let's say someone comes along and says
oh hey crater is not working right on my
iPhone like how do I to plug that
because you don't you don't get devtools
here right no and so like I can totally
just pull a crater up and farting on my
phone and then connect in and start
debugging it so even if you're not doing
Cordova it's super handy but if you are
doing Cordova you can connect to your
Cordova application as well and from my
understanding I link to the Android
process I don't have an android phone
I've never had to do it but what I hear
it works the same you know you just
connected via USB open up chrome and
then there's a little command you issue
in the window and I'll connect in and
you can start debugging that view as
well okay and they've cleaned that up
since the Android is a little is a
little simpler than it used to be ya
doing Android so yeah that's great this
is good to put all the debugging info in
one place I'm sure yeah definitely so
you know and it was funny because it's
one of those like seems like basic
knowledge to me but maybe if nothing
else someone can read this article and
probably pick up at least one new thing
from it you know um if not two three
four or five different message they
didn't know about yeah I put out like my
grumpy old man hat and then say like you
know the before unit tests like the best
you could do was attaching a debugger
that was just the good Oh to thing
and then I think it fell out a favor for
like a whole generation of developers
where you know your tests were how you
could you know isolate a piece of code
in and interrogate it and it's good it's
good to have a test suite but this is
this is this like console.log is never
going to go away as a hard-hitting tool
when you really need to rip open your
code and you don't know you don't need
to know exactly what you're looking for
because all of the variables values will
be listed for you and so it kind of
allows you to discover as you go yeah i
mean that's that's fine i approach yeah
that's when i tend to use it you know
it's like I'm working with an API and
I'm gonna make a call and I don't know
what the data structure looks like
coming back like I'll then maybe throw a
console log just so I can see the data
structure and kind of keep going from
there yeah so that's that's pretty
common for me but you know I think the
biggest thing here is like you know all
right most of this stuff when I googled
the answers were right there like the
number one two and three results all
talked about how to debug meteor server
side so you know Google for things
people well important developer skill i
think number one I think yes and you
know it's funny you bring up test two
because I kind of struggle with that I
actually had a section in there early on
like tests also kind of count as
debugging to some degree but it didn't
feel quite right so um maybe I'll put up
a separate article or something yeah i
think the debugger or the repple the
meteor shell or the chrome inspector is
kind of where you get the raw material
to make your tests from right that's
where you can like see what things are
yeah you're kind of like playing with it
you know and in seeing how you maybe
want some code and then you can take
that and formulate a test go and then
you know the tests they're not there to
help you debug now they're there to help
you debug later right and
they're really not there to help you
debug later they're there to help you
know other people that broke crap that
they didn't realize they broke know that
they needed to bug something yeah yeah
yeah all right so tell us about
astronomy not astronomer astronomy uh
that is you know I'm seeing this trend
we've talked about a couple different
shows towards enhancing your Mongo
objects and turning them into full uh
you know business business logic objects
right and all the advantages the
pitfalls of that it was a collection
helper Steve Boros I believe collection
helpers so astronomy I haven't used it
it but it definitely looks like it is
another step in the iteration towards a
smarter objects that come out of your
collection so of course they're not
stored at a smart object they're stored
as just the data but through some magic
which i haven't seen how he does when
you do you're fine you get an enhanced
object it can use setters and getters
nested fields have typed type checkers I
think it integrates with schemas I hope
that's not too loud in the background
there's an epic ping pong match going on
nice yeah and just you know trying to be
a full encapsulator of your data yeah
yeah yeah so I think under the covers
it's really just using transform so it
works like a lot of those other packages
but it's it's trying to be more
comprehensive than say you know you
putting together collection helpers and
collection hooks and a couple other
packages that might achieve the same
thing like he's trying to house it all
in one spot for you oh yeah with nice
documentation and clean API it looks
interesting to me I'll say that much
like I haven't used it either uh he
emailed me he's like how do I get more
people and I'm like well like I think
it's good dogs
more than anything yeah that's that's
always going to be key and like examples
and blogging about it like that's how
you get people to change their mind or
try your stuff out and I don't know I
think he's he's definitely on the right
path I don't have a project that I'm
green fielding right now if I did I
might actually give it a try and see how
it works um so I don't know I mean yeah
I'm impressed he definitely did his
homework on certain things like if you
if you have found owned a model object
and you have a reference to that object
and you're looking at a particular field
of it in a helper there are certain
contexts where you won't be reactively
notified um so he found some maybe leaks
in the reactivity abstraction that he
claims to have patched here and you know
since I have never observed those I like
I can see how their possible but it's
it's neat that you know someone could
have found a context where reactivity
might not work automatically and say oh
you know here's how you patch it no so
it's pretty neat keep it up who's this
uh someone from Warsaw Poland I forget
his name jakey raggy I don't know how
you said jagi yeah yeah well keep it up
he's got 850 for downloads of the core
uh project right now 54 stars so it
looks like it's getting attention yeah
yeah definitely so and just like you
heard me say astronomy not astronomer
astronomer is the the thing that rye
Walker is working on the start up for
doing user analytics tracking and that
kind of so why write different things
there for sure all right so
what's left this actually this question
came up in my day ma I did so I did a
ama on crater and I yeah I got a lot of
questions I was quite surprised and at
first I thought they were all gonna be
like highly technical so not the first
one that I see I'm there yeah well if
you go all the way down to the bottom
the guy like a lot of download hate ah
but he was like oh you know I've got a
would be asked for I think he's asking
like how do I get a hamburger menu to
work and I was like what and he's like
can you post a working example using
these libraries of getting a hamburger
menu to work and I was like maybe they
say ma was a mistake I mean like you
know I don't have a lot of spare time so
um you know I tried to I tried to at
least answer and say like his lack of
posting any code made it kind of hard to
even respond you know yeah so I don't
know but I told him take it to stack
overflow if he's still having problems
but you know there were a lot of good
questions in here about you know what
someone asked what kind of feature would
you like to see landon and crater and i
said or in telescope and i said i'd love
to see like a shadow banding or a how
banning package if you're not familiar
with that you can get shadow band on
reddit or help in on hacker news and
basically you're able to do huh what
does that mean what does that mean
shadow band yeah so you're able to do
whatever it is you want to do on reddit
but no one ever sees it oh I see that
how banning like you can go up vote and
like you press the button page refreshes
it looks like you're of was there but if
you go over to your buddies machine and
he takes a look your of vote was never
counted right someone posted something
called echo chamber that did the same
hey I thought that was hilarious yeah
yeah but I mean you know here's the
thing like people are now coming on and
creating spam accounts on crater and
like those just reuse that same account
over and over again and it's like you
know what if you want to fill up my
database that's cool as long as it's not
bothering other users or sending out
emails go ahead right like I'll go out
like when it becomes a problem when I
get over a gig of data like maybe I'll
go clean it up but like I'd rather just
have that he'll banning or shadow
banning in place because I'd love to
just instead of deleting an account I'd
rather just say like yeah let's just
like make them disappear off the site
yeah yeah and they think they're still
spamming but you know no one's getting
bothered so huh yeah that would be kind
of nice I think let's see what other
interesting questions here what is your
automated testing process so for me you
know i answered i start with cucumber I
feel like that's in the end you know
your users are gonna use your
application and you should really be
thinking about the UI that they get and
so that that's super important and I
think cucumber forces you into that
mindset and then from there I start to
work my way down into jasmine and so
like lately I've been doing publication
testing with jasmine and that kind of
thing and and that's that's kind of nice
as well so um let's see were there any
other interesting questions in here I
loved uh sashko actually asked me a
question from mdg and he said that he
say what do you make of like the
upcoming support for things like react
and angular like how is that going to
affect people who are building packages
for example like auto form like what's
gonna happen to auto form right do they
have to how do they choose which one is
support or do they have to try to
support both what do you think about
that yeah so
I kind of threw back at him and I'm like
I this would be a question I would ask
you like what's what's the guidance here
but to me like I I'd either love to see
like a web blaze in the package system
you know like right now you can say web
browser web Cordova maybe it makes sense
to say like web blaze or web got react
and then i could write files that
support both environments but only load
them depending on with it God well and
then you know then you've got a you got
the web browser blaze web browser
regular web doc Cordova blaze it sounds
like a nightmare for package authors I
think that would be right and it's you
know it would be nice if you explicitly
declare your dependency on blaze and be
like I am a blaze package I don't see
how a package author has the time to to
span three different front-end toolkits
if you're making something that works
well with blaze you know good job like
the fact that someone else decided that
blaze wasn't in their use case well then
they you know have to live without your
little your blaze enhancer thing I mean
I don't discourage something as standard
as you know simple form which is like
almost a standard right everyone's using
it someone someone like Aldi eid will
probably have to consider you know uh
maintaining these things if he wants to
be the simple form package but you might
just have to collaborate with people who
do things the angular way to kind of
maintain a fork of simple form angular
and react people to do simple form react
I mean they're just they're just not the
same I mean when you build a package
you're choosing a starting point to
enhance and you know the fact that other
starting points exist it just becomes a
22 impossible to keep up with every new
one that may came out yeah that's my
opinion yeah I would kind of agree and
you know listening to you talk I think
maybe the smarter move is to go for
like a a package of packages right let
go for the conglomerate package that
will give you what you need right and so
if you look at user accounts for example
you can get user accounts bootstrap you
can get user accounts ionic but
underneath it's got user accounts core
and that kind of shifts to all the
different types yeah yeah and you know
you've got this like you I specific like
this one CSS you I specific but you know
who knows maybe we'll see like user
accounts react at some point um I don't
know like it's I think it's gonna get
complicated now that we have like
multiple kind of CSS frameworks and
multiple front-end frameworks like it
could get a little hairy for a package
author I think you're right like this
can it's gonna take a lot of discipline
to pull off something like that right
and I don't necessarily want to get the
facebook you know jsx runtime because uh
I depended on a package that tried to be
everything everybody in it and it pulled
it in I want to be able to also avoid
transitive dependencies like that for
the sake of MA I build sighs if I have
no intention of using Facebook and I in
my project yeah that that's that's a
fair point as well yeah so I I don't
know I'm hoping the community can kind
of solve this one somehow on its own but
it was definitely interesting yeah I
guess that was Slava also asked me like
how does the rails community compared to
to the meteor community like the early
days of rails community and I'll say
this like I think you know I said in
here I think it's friendlier a lot
friendlier a lot more open and accepting
for the most part and that is pretty
awesome it's also a lot more
international which is a little
surprising to me and yeah so actually
it's not a little it's actually a lot
very yeah so that's that's actually kind
of interesting to me because most of the
people
you know when you when you're doing
something like a conference like most
the people were coming from the US so
you could almost guarantee that you're
going to see your friends when you go to
like railsconf but I don't I don't know
what I mean we don't have a meteor comp
so this is a moot point but it's
definitely interesting well yeah and
there was a swimming upstream kind of
mentality that you know characterized
the early days of the rails community
because you were you know doing Ruby and
no one else was so every new gem you
need it need to be written written in
Ruby but um you know being able to
leverage things like NPM packages that
have already solved like the postgres
notification a kind of situation just
for example it means that like I don't
know I think we're having a lot of fun
because we get to build on top of a lot
of good existing JavaScript libraries
and integrate those in so I don't know I
feel like it's pretty fun because we
don't necessarily have as much burden on
our shoulders to adopt you know parts of
the JavaScript ecosystem into into our
into our world so yeah cool yeah I would
agree with that and you know my other
point was i think it was easier to work
with rails core than it is to work with
mdg at this point um I think I have more
code amor por request accepted into
rails than I have it yeah meteor um so
yeah 00 at this point but that's pretty
cool for You Josh but I you know I think
the thing is like you should be 01 right
like you yeah admit it's something
that's interesting and and useful and
you know like we need to know how to
better work with mdg and I don't think
that's necessarily on us um you know as
developers like we want to help but we
need to know what's the best way to do
that and so I'm kind of hoping that mdg
we'll talk about that more at some point
because they you know now they'll take
feature requests in github but I know
like if I request a feature and then
give you a pull request and it's just
going to sit there for a long time
like that that that's a frustrating
process yeah yeah anyway it's kind of it
what's your big news man well um oh I'm
Smith's that I wanted to make you still
ready for that oh of course my internet
connection goes out right at this point
I think they know mo all our listen is
uh uh unless there's are gonna be a
total suspense because my internet drops
right when I let's see so two jobs ago I
was hired for Ruby and ended up doing
something else one job ago in other
words the current job I was hired for
Ruby but fell in love with javascript in
meteor um but will be my last day at
opinion lab thanks to pinion lab for
helping get my meteor adventures off the
ground and sponsoring the meetup but I
am joining forces with Paul Dalman and
Ben Strahan and the good peeps of okay
grow nice congrats thank you yeah so
that's like that's super exciting to
hear because I feel at least partly
responsible like you know both you and
Ben took my class and I feel like you
you kind of leveled up your meteor
skills a little bit and you know at the
same time like been working on the media
club slack chat room and everyone's been
kind of getting a little closer there
like Paul's definitely in there and
bends in there you're in there so I
don't know it feels awesome to like see
that like organically grow and you guys
make that connection and things take off
like it's very gratifying I guess so
congratulations to you did I did I lose
you think we've officially lost him
alright so i guess i will wrap up the
show i want to thank everyone for tuning
in if you're interested you can go to
patreon.com/scishow this as well i am
running what will likely be my last
master in meteor class that's the class
i was talking about benin and Dean
taking and that class is going to happen
at the end of this month and so if
you're interested in a spot you can go
to meteor ji-suk a club and / learn and
you can learn more about it and yeah and
then i'm running a class with sam as
well we're going to do a testing class
on August fourth and fifth so you can go
to meteor jest club / testing to find
out more information about that Sam and
I decided to drop the price from 899 2
599 we can take a few more people into
the class as well so that's that's kind
of why the price drop came about and
yeah I don't know it's interesting it's
awesome so if if you're looking for that
stuff just go to meteor Jas club as
always you can find us at meteor podcast
calm and get this show and you can go to
podcast meteor Jas club and get the
other show that I've been doing as well
I've been so thanks for tuning in and
we'll talk to you next week this video
has been a meteor club production you
