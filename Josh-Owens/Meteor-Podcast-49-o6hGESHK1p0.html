2015 i'm your host Josh Owens one with
my special guest co-host Ryan Glover
welcome to the show Ryan Amy I do it
good so at aka the meteor chef right
yeah help me uh interwebs nice so one
rye was a thoroughly exhausted this week
from working on user cycle so he asked
if I could find a co-host so at the last
minute Ryan graciously stepped in but
you got a hard deadline so we'll be
brief right yeah I gotta jump out of
here in about 20-25 minutes okay alright
so let's get to it so the sponsors this
month are you heard them on the pretty
role but for those watching the show a
mongo or no the change of name compose
do and modulus I oh I think it's
everything you need to get production
hosting going so check those guys out
this week we're going to talk about
cluster we're going to talk about
getting started with Cordova nice little
guide I found this week there was an
interesting repo posted about react
versus blaze mongodb three-point Oh was
announced talk about that a little bit
and then a new package called meteor
document methods so first up we'll just
talk about cluster real quick this is a
new package from aaron oda and his goal
was to replace the need for a load
balancer and to also make it easier to
do microservices so if you're not
familiar with it a micro services like a
focused little app that you can publish
that kind of just focuses on one piece
of functionality or a couple pieces of
functionality and then you kind of
stitch together a whole web app using
micro services so for example you know
if you're looking at Twitter the
ap I would probably be like a really big
example microservice um but uh you know
something like that like breaking your
architecture apart and having these
different pieces that are running you
know the stuff you need so like
analytics twitter com that kind of thing
and I'm curious actually uh I have kind
of taken advantage of stuff like modulus
because they have load balancing and
this kind of stuff built in so have used
things like this before do you have
anything that you've used uh so your
other options are to do like go with
modulus and they use stuff like why
should I don't know what they use them
but i'm guessing they've got like a che
proxy or something like that yeah under
the covers but you know that the goal of
this was to have a package that drops in
place and you just give it some
environment variables and it handles the
load balancing on its own so you can set
up a balancer and then you let it know
like each DDP eath got meteor server
registers itself is the DDP endpoint and
it'll like send the traffic
automatically for you so nodes kind of
being your load balancer so that's very
cool yeah yeah pretty awesome so if
you're interested errno to set up a
YouTube video and he talks about it a
lot in there's got some slides great
blog post as well will be in the show
notes but i would highly recommend
looking at it i actually want to play
with it i haven't had a chance yet but
i'm thinking about throwing it on crater
and see how it goes so quickly i should
you a blog post uh huh be curious to see
how it works out yeah yeah I'll have to
do that all right next door yeah so next
up is the meteor mobile cookbook this is
a collection of helpful guides and tips
for building cordova apps and this is
actually put together by a couple of
guys at josh's home amara over it
differential let's nix Spencer David and
from what I can tell it's like the bulk
of commits for by Gerard well but
basically it's just a general overview
of tips and tricks for how to get your
cordoba apps up and running on iOS
Android and there's a little joke about
Windows Phone in there ha just kidding
um but it looks really great it's
actually pretty comprehensive I haven't
gone too far into it and I honest gone
belong experience with Cordova but it
goes over stuff like um what did I find
in there I like comparing your app for
the app store getting ready for iTunes
Connect creating a production bill
configuring Xcode and things like that
you know while it's going to assess
curious Josh because I caught your eye
Riley screencast a few weeks back have
you done a lot of work with Cordova are
you not a lot I'm in the middle of a
project right now and we haven't gotten
to the point where we're submitting to
the app store yet but you know where
we've we've gotta build working with our
Cordova app the biggest thing apparently
and I don't I don't know if this is
documented in here but we're having a
conversation about kind of gotchas at
our local Cincinnati meet up on Tuesday
and that's where I found out about this
and I thought oh this is great thing
like it should be sharing with the world
and um you know it's funny because we
clicked on Android for the gotchas and
it's completely empty and we're like
whoa Android just works which is
probably not the case I just think they
haven't focused a ton on the android
stuff yet but yeah like Ben Strahan from
media club was talking about he he built
an app and he couldn't figure out why it
wasn't working correctly and it turns
out like Cordova doesn't seem to rebuild
the entire thing every time you tell it
to build it just rebuilds parts of the
application and apparently it wasn't
rebuilding like he changed the URL from
HTTP to HTTPS for security purposes and
it wasn't picking up that change and
therefore here to like wipe out his
entire meteor build folder and start
from scratch yanks and I mean that's not
that big of a deal right but um you know
it's just like that meteor local build
or whatever and and that fix the problem
for him so I just thought like I you
know we were talking about that and and
girard ran in the same thing with
Facebook and having to change the URL
and it wasn't rebuilding that part and
he was tearing his hair out trying to
debug it it turned out like he just
nuked the folder and then everything
built right that's it and then he told
me about this and I'm like ah yeah let's
let's get this out there hey I mean that
from what i can tell that got just part
is definitely the most valuable piece of
this just because that's been reading
true that you can tell those are the
things that just hours and hours of
wasted on trying to figure out yeah well
yeah overall definitely something if
you're working with cordova to check out
and play around they also go over just
like a couple of features like push
notification and splash screens and
stuff like that yeah all right um I'm
too much here uh so the next one was uh
react versus blaze kind of performance
there was kind of a two-parter here one
you got to go watch the video that's
linked in the show notes and then go to
actually click on this link here okay
they do they do link to the video in the
github repo so go to the github repo
there's a link that goes to the video
and then a link that goes to the
original source code if you want to see
the react stuff in the comparison like
the video is great he compared yourself
yeah well it's mostly great right he
left meteor out so maybe he's dead to me
I don't know um but he compares react
with amber and angular and maybe that
was it but it was a just the three
screens yeah but he fires up this client
side only application and it's it's just
sorting a list of like database queries
and the database queries are just all
kind of fictional but it's pulled from a
real app and he's like real time sorting
a hundred rose on the screen and he's
just kind of showing you what the
performance looks like when you're
scrolling
anger when you're seeing little tooltip
hovers and that kind of thing and like
it's very clear to me you go to ember
and like it's super super sluggish
angular was a little better but you
could still see like herky-jerky
scrolling whereas react was like super
smooth and react was taking care of
business with that I was impressed by
that uh definitely caught my attention
yeah and the other thing and this is
what I've found probably the most
interesting I may take this code and
package it up but there's a meteor not a
meter a memory stats a little package
that Paul Irish wrote and he's shown
that on the screen as well and you can
see there's actually a memory leak and
ember and it's just like as it's running
the memories just like going right up
like a hockey stick and I think you got
to like 100 Meg's or so and so the
interesting thing is you go to this
github repo you pull this thing down and
it's basically the meteor version of
this same application so there's like
some data that gets inserted and then
pub/sub I think is that true me clicking
here and look at the packages now arta
publish is still there so there's
probably no pops up but you know it
insert some data in the server and then
sinks it over to the client i'm pretty
sure actually I banana chance to play
with this do you have you gotten it up
and running on your machine yeah I got
it running and the cool part was so it's
better at performance then angular ember
were but it's you know you get like the
ever so slightly herky-jerky is when
you're trying to scroll and the you know
the tooltips could be a little faster
and you know it's set to like a zero
timeout for moving the the table rows
around it's a little slower than react
like like it's noticeable right even
though I stopped by side but the most
interesting thing to me was the fact
that like every client side framework
was well above 10 megs and when you load
this thing up like it stayed at a solid
9.5 megabytes for me and like there was
no memory leakage like it was just
sitting there at nine point five
megabytes
hmm so very interesting so I say kudos
to md Chi yeah definitely um so one
thing I'm really curious about though is
um technically react can sit on top of
meteorite mm-hmm mm-hmm and I can I add
I think I asked a question I'm creator I
don't know if I got a response but would
that something like that replace blaze
all together or can it kind of
intermingle with it or do you know how
that works um you know that's a that's a
great question and I'm not sure I know
the answer so my initial thoughts on it
would be like you could put react in
there and then just maybe not use parts
of blaze but i still think blaze is
gonna load its libraries and be sitting
there so i don't know you so i think you
could remove the web component and maybe
beef together the pieces you want
instead and maybe not include blaze and
that would be a way you could accomplish
it okay yeah yeah especially I've never
tried so could be talking on my butt
here oh um I'll move on here yeah cool
so up next we've got MongoDB three-point
oh this caught my attention the other
day but you know full disclosure I'm not
much of a database guy I take full
advantage of a simple meteor mates
interacting with the database layer but
basically what they said is this would
be generally available in March they're
kind of finishing testing and putting
touches I don't know if there's a bait
or anything available but they're kind
of boasting nas's have a massive
improvements performance and scalability
and this one is kind of dorky and our
leaders in enabled by comprehensive
improvements in the storage layer yeah
so if you're not familiar with it like
my sequel you can change out the the
storage engines on my sequel and it
looks like they've
a similar approach here they now have
what they call the wired Tiger nickel
rich engine sounds fierce I don't know
um but I I actually believe there was
like a they they like acquired a company
that was building this technology and
okay and so they've been working to wire
it in but they're claiming like a seven
to 10 x you know better right
performance and you know you can turn on
compression and they're saying like you
can use up to eighty percent less
storage space you know I feel like I'm
maybe reading an apple press release or
something like oh I'm curious like once
somebody puts us through the paces if
it'll live up to those kind of claims
because whenever you see up to I'm
always like a little suspicious like
that up to what's the average and stuff
like that but um if they can actually
you know back that up in in production
that would be awesome yeah I agree and
you know the big question is what what
are the changes to a blog and that kind
of thing because those are probably
things that affect meteor the most you
know um do you know offhand what version
of mongo meteor is running right now I
think it's supposed to be compatible
with 2.4 but you can run it with 2.6 and
there are some comments around that with
if you look on crater Aaron Oda was
talking about it and he's you know he's
probably one of the guys more anxious to
get his hands on Mongo three point 0
because you know they've they've got
Khedira just deals with a huge amount of
data yeah and so you know he he
definitely wants to see this okay hurry
up there's actually a comment by a
Slovak em and says moving slowly to 2.6
thanks to glass or so it seems like
they're kind of slowly upgrading mm-hmm
of course you know it's funny like
they'll get to 2.6 right is through
point O comes out but you know I again
like there's only I'm guessing a lot of
these features under the hood will just
work right like you can use the the wire
tiger stuff on three-point Oh without
bring about anything else so as long as
they haven't like broken any api's or
changed anything major then
theoretically this should just to work
but you know if they've made some
changes in our blog like being able to
subscribe to just what you care about an
OP log like that would be amazing for
meteor actually all right good stuff um
so the last story here is uh I wanted to
highlight this this new package because
I thought it was interesting like they
left a comment on a blog post a mine
like hey you know I wanted to contribute
to the whole ORM discussion and I made a
package and it's kind of based on the
idea of collection helpers in that he's
wiring up some little syntactic sugars
for you right like so rather than
calling my collection down update with
you know this dot underscore ID you just
call this dot dollar sign said and then
handed your data and the it looks like
he's got said he's got save he's got
dollar sign push I had to set like just
everything you could think of and you
just you need like the individual mongo
collection object you know one document
and then you're able to just call this
stuff on it you can even call update and
then pass stuff underneath like dollar
sign set and dollar sign add to set
what's this last one may I have to play
this there's a lot of nice little
helpers in here yeah yeah he's got
dollar sign removed too that's you know
that's the way it should be in my
opinion this is this is brilliant i love
this um so i really really wanted to
highlight this because I you know I
initially I missed having an orm but i
think you know when i look at this these
are the little niceties that I missed
out of my ORM so it is really nice that
you can get this so to me like I always
use lately it's just been collection
hooks and collection helpers and
this is going to become a staple as well
this call so when was the serration
originally released just well he made
noise about it the past couple days on
crater probably four days ago okay but
if we go back see the kid yeah just five
days ago oh okay yeah well I'll
definitely something to play that this
looks a huge time saver yeah definitely
Our client know how you say is his
github name but it's pretty pretty
awesome I'm pretty excited about it so
yeah all right you got a few minutes
left so I would just ask you a question
or two if you don't mind yeah absolutely
so uh what are you working on right now
like what kind of interesting meteor
things are you doing hmm a couple of
things one you actually got tipped off
to the scalar day you were asking me
about it I'm working on a job board for
meteor something that's a little more
dressed up than what's out there now
nobody can I get me with a pitchfork you
know try and turn into a business so
that's coming out in a couple of weeks
here we'll see where I get kind of
slugging my way through Baltimore um and
aside from that wrapping up loose ends
on part two that striped recipe hmm so
hell yeah it's awesome yeah yeah I know
I know how it goes with client work like
I've been doing we've got two clients
right now so it's been kind of crazy
yeah keep you busy yeah yeah I'm
actually hired someone to work with me
too so oh cool you remove it up yeah
trying um yeah and then today like you
the whole reason you're even on this
podcast is because uh you know was it
yesterday maybe someone yesterday
recommended you know you joined into the
the media club chat room and yeah it's
just like last minute I was like oh I'm
so tired can you can you maybe find
someone and then I was like I just asked
on the the meteor club slack chat room
like Hayes anyone want to fill in and
you
yeah I could do it yeah she gave a hat
tip to been straightenin cuz he was the
one who was like hey you should get in
on this I think you'd like it yeah
definitely so if you want to come talk
with all the I was realizing now we've
got 44 book authors are in the chaplain
as well so we've got the Sasha Manuel
Stefan and Sam so good collection there
if you wanna you want to make have
access to these people and have a cool
chat room to hang out in all day long
talk about meteor go to patreon.com feel
free to sign up there for sure and I'm
just pulling it up real quick we had one
new member this week so many clicks
someone should tell them to like make it
easier to get to their pay a chair on
patreon me yeah like seeing my list of
patrons is this is kind of ridiculous to
get to ah sit here gosh well may I can
find it easy figures the one time I need
to get to it ya feel like they've
changed this now since like two days ago
startups yeah crazy starters well we got
a new one I'll make sure we say his name
next week but we are at at a hundred
dollars so we're we're not quite halfway
but we're getting close to the 250 mark
and which will start a new podcast so no
yeah we're getting close feel like
what's the topic for new podcast it'll
be more of a roundtable with multiple
people and it'll probably a longer
format once a week so we'll have some
regulars on in the moon it's special
guests in and that kind of thing similar
to ruby rose or JavaScript jabber or
something like that
very cool which bonus mention if you
want to check it out if you go to dev
chat TV you can get to a JavaScript
jabber and check out Matt he was on the
latest episode met de Burgh Alice yeah
it's not this morning's really good
interview yeah nice alright guys well
thanks for tuning in we'll see you next
week cool take it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
