video series these were a series of
videos recorded in the mountains of
gatlinburg tennessee during the meteor
space camp 2015 event that was held in
october if you're interested in more
information please check out meteor
space camp also big thank you to our
sponsors our gold sponsors were modulus
you can find them at modulus I 0 for all
your hosting needs whether that be
meteor or node or PHP they can handle
all that for you easily modulus I oh and
also okay grow calm if you need to have
an application built okay grow is the
place to get it done give them give them
a shout over it okay grow calm and also
a meteor club you can sign up and join
me to club at meteor jazz club it's a
weekly email you get tips and tricks
about meteor and other relevant news so
if you're interested in that check it
out meteor jazz club and also compose
our Silver Sponsor composed on Io
they're a great place to host your
database and take care of any database
needs you may have whether that's Mongo
or elasticsearch or any number of
platforms that they're supporting now I
use them for all my production stuff so
I highly recommend it composed on Io so
I want to talk to you guys about why you
should always check your your arguments
but before we get to that I should
probably introduce myself my name is
Pete Corey I do a lot of blogging about
meteor and meteor security on vlog fifth
cup I also run a small freelance meteor
to fishing shop called East Fifth so
I've always loved software security my
first job was actually as a security
consultant and hipster in college for a
company called digital we did a lot of
in penetration testing but we would all
go in and man so I would basically get
paid to hack websites just a lot of fun
but I realized that when I talked to the
developers who built those websites I
wasn't able to kind of articulately
explain why the vulnerability existed or
how to fix it and that was kind of
because I wanted to help them improve
their websites and their their
applications so I realized that I needed
to become a more of a web developer to
kind of get that background to help
people make their web applications more
secure bus so I worked I graduated
school worked for a few companies I've
got a couple government contractors
amazon howard is a remote contractor for
a while and now i do freelance web
development with i also offer security
consultation so meteor to me is kind of
interesting from a security standpoint
for a few reasons the main reason is
because of probably DDP DDP lets us pass
pretty much anything that's json encode
able into a method or a publication or a
collection validator that's kind of a
step beyond where we were previously
with rest endpoints right so with normal
rest endpoints you would have your get
endpoints that would really only accept
strings if you want to use like a number
parameter you would have to explicitly
coerce that string into a number with a
parson or something so you always know
what what type it is that you're getting
but with DDP you can pass a number you
can pass a string you can pass an object
you can pass an array you can pass an
object filled with arrays of numbers of
strings you can do all this kind of
stuff and when it comes to dealing with
those arguments in your publications and
your methods you kind of don't know what
you're working with and that can cause
some real security problems as we'll see
pretty soon so check when I say check
your arguments what exactly do I mean
while you literally mean check your
arguments check is a tool in the meteor
framework it's a small little library
that basically asserts that the thing
you're passing into it
is the type you expect it to be so for
example i can call check on a variable
called user ID and i'm expecting it to
be a string so if i pass in a user ID
that's like you know just a string of
characters and it comes to this line
it'll pass right through happily but if
for some reason i pass in a number for
user ID this is going to freak out throw
an exception and give you something like
this it'll say it expected a string but
i got a number and because it throws an
exception it basically prevents all
following server code from running so
you won't get to a bad stick you and
your methods are public so why does this
matter I'm going to show you a few
examples I want you guys to take off
your developer hats for a minute and put
on a cur hats I want you guys to thick
like its users so let's try and break
these examples we're trying to steal
user data cause application downtime
steal you know products do all kinds of
bad stuff so I'll walk you through few
examples first one's pretty
straightforward so let's pretend we have
some kind of imaginary web app that's
like a shopping cart so this shopping
cart has a publish method on the server
that publishes a single card document we
take in the cart ID of the document we
want to publish and we return a card
stock find of that card ID so this is
pretty straightforward right we just
want a carp so we give it the ID and it
returns the card but if you remember
cart ID can really be anything because
we're passing in that value through DDP
in this case we're expecting it to be a
string a Mongo ID in the form of a
string we can just as easily pass in a
number or an array or an object so one
subtle thing you can do is you can
actually pass in an object that is a
mongo DB query operator so you control
on go through objects so basically if
you pass in this object
as your car tidy it would replace car
tidy and the fine with that object so
now your query looks like this you're
basically saying find all karts whose ID
is greater to or equal to empty drink so
that's going to publish every card in
the system regardless of whether you own
it or not and now we'll surely I mean
leak some private data do people who
shouldn't see it this is also an issue
because well this is the fix sorry so
basically to fix that issue you would
check that cart ID is a string so if you
pass in an object or a number or
anything it's going to hit this second
line of the method of the published call
it's going to see that cart ID is not a
string and it will throw an exception
back to the client saying you know I was
expecting a string here what are you
doing that'll prevent all that private
data completely so this also works in
methods like I said anywhere that
accepts a DDP input is vulnerable to
this if you accept arguments so in this
case we're taking in a cart ID again the
whole point of this method is to remove
a card from the system so say you want
to clear your shopping cart in our
application you would call this method
and it would actually the cart object on
the system so it's taking in a card ID
and what we're doing is we're finding
the first cart that matches that ID so
you find part we're checking that that
card belongs to currently logged in user
and then we're deleting it so that seems
pretty secure right we're checking that
the user owns the carpet or they delete
it awesome but what happens if we again
pass in an object you what if we pass in
something like I d is greater to or
equal to a cart ID like my card ID so
let's say that I have a cart and system
and have some ID so what if i substitute
that in for that little string right
there we said that a can see the
original method our fine one becomes
this kind of complicated thing that says
find one cart whose ID is greater to you
or equal to
my car tidy and so depending on I think
whether you have an index or not but
depending on the natural sort order of
mongo if this was just a fine it would
return all carts who's IDs or think i
thinka either created after your cart or
electrically greater than your cart so
either statistically like half the
Carson or a good number of them find one
grabs the first result off of that list
and returns it so that'll always right
you own so this check right here see if
we own that card is always going to pass
because our card will always come first
so we come into this remove statement
but now we're removing all karts his ID
is greater to or equal to my current
card ID so this is going to remove a ton
of carts potentially you know up to half
maybe fewer depending on your Mongo
orders so we've just basically destroyed
a bunch of people's carts which is not
good this kind of thing is also really
relevant well this is the fix for that
sorry again check the card ideas a
string pretty simple if card ID is an
object it's gonna throw an exception
there break out of the method return a
message client saying there should be a
string not an object what are you doing
please stop this is also applicable and
collection validators so your updates
and denies this is kind of less commonly
used here but I I have a pattern that i
like to use for securing allowing the
Daiya message that I think works pretty
well so in this case we have a date
method we have a deny update method on
the user's collection so we're trying to
basically deny users who aren't already
admin users from adding another role to
their goals collection so this would
basically be like how someone makes
themselves an admin they would do like
an ad to set of roles with admin we want
to prevent them from doing that and this
seems fairly straightforward but what
happens if they don't use ad
what if they use something like push if
they push the admin role on to their
user document or if they just set their
roles field equal to an array with admin
in it so both of these things are going
to slip by that original design that was
because we weren't checking for push or
set so my fix for this kind of thing
would be to move away from using deny
and use allow with checks cousin which
is match match test basically I create
what I expect each possible update to be
there for example I always expect change
roles to be an ad to set where we're
adding a string to roll up that first
line and I always expect change username
to be a set where username is a string
and depending on the user's role they
can do either one of these or both of
these or a combination of these things
so for example if the user is an admin
they can do one of change roles or
change username so they can change their
roles or another users roles or they can
change their username or another users
use where the user is not an admin they
can only change their own username and
so match test is a lot like check except
instead of throwing an exception if that
comparison fails it's going to return
false so here we wouldn't throw an
exception when that fails so if like the
normal users trying to update their
roles to include advent it would just
return false which would prevent that
allow from happening or prevent the
update happening
so why should he be checking most of the
examples I showed were no sequel
injection issues but also the last last
example was a kind of a demonstration of
the fact that manga modifiers are very
hard they're hard to get right there are
almost two dozen different mongo
operators most of them some of them do
very similar things just subtly
different so you can easily swap one out
for the other so if you're preventing
push someone might be able to use add to
set if you're preventing set on a number
someone could use ink or bit which would
do like increments or bitwise operators
on that number there's a lot of
different combinations here and it's
always better to only allow the certain
ones that you expect rather than
blacklisting ones you think are bad
because people will always be more
clever they'll come up with ways of
bypassing your block lists so the better
way for sure is to only allow certain
updates that you expect as I said most
of the examples I showed we're no sequel
injection this is kind of like an
evolution of the old sequel injection
back in the day people used to construct
sequel queries with strings and if
someone said their user name was single
tick semicolon drop tables semi colon
dash dash it would run a query that says
find all users whose user name is empty
string and then drop all the tables in
the database this is kind of an example
of an extension of that we're not
concatenated together anymore were kind
of concatenated objects so it's called
no sequel injection and also the biggest
reason is that users lie it's kind of
hard to acknowledge that when a lot of
what we do is built around the fact that
we should serve users and our app should
be user centric but there are malicious
users out there who will lie about their
rights live other privileges try and
steal things from your users
applications and just try and break
things so you always need to be cautious
and defensive
so where should you be checking I kind
of touched on this already you should
check anywhere that accepts arguments so
in a media application this is going to
be your methods your publications and
your collection validators that's kind
of the three Biggie's and the meteor
security landscape if you're exposing
rest endpoints you should probably check
there too but that's kind of a separate
thing so methods publications and
collection validators and there are few
tools that will help you guys check your
arguments the first of which is odd it
argue minh tex and this is a meteor
package you just add it to your appt
with made you add audit arguments
collections this is a runtime check of
all the arguments you're working with
and your methods I think 10 adding
publications as well so if you call a
method that has an argument passed into
it and that argument does not get
checked anywhere in your method it's
going to log an error on the server and
I think throw an exception back to the
client but it's important to note that
this is a runtime check so as you're
building your app you will be notified
that you're lacking check coverage or
that you may be potentially letting
argument to pass through another great
tool that I didn't talk about in this
talk but is awesome nonetheless is
simple schema and you can basically
define what you expect your documents to
look like in the form of a schema and
then you can actually just drop your
simple schema directly into your check
so you can say like if you're accepting
a profile as an argument you can check
that your profile is equal to that
simple schema directly no real added
complexity there and if any field exists
that aren't in the schema or any fields
or different types than are expected in
the schema it will fill that check
what I'm saying is that you can drop a
simple schema into the second argument
of a check so instead of saying like
check user ID string you can check
profile your profile schema and it will
run through all those fields check on
three and then the last tool a little
bit of plug I have a package called East
Fifth check checker and this is a good
complement to audit argument checks it
does pretty much the same thing but it
does it at compile time as a static
analysis of your code it looks for
methods and publications that do not
have proper checking being done and it
reports all of those in your server logs
on startup so for example if you have
like a method it isn't being checked
like it has a argument called foo and
who isn't being checked anywhere I would
say you know warning method blah blah
blah and file blah blah blah is not
checking argument field and so these two
go great together yeah yeah well
so it'll check your package code and if
you use it like a local package it will
check that but it won't dig into your
your local move your install so the
bottom line is that check is your friend
always use check any time you're taking
any input from anyone anywhere and as a
fun little demonstration of what I mean
and to make things real for you guys I'm
go ahead and do a quick demo so this
thing is actually a meteor now console
see there's a meteor app
so I actually forgot what
so I have a publication called cart so
this is the first example we showed the
presentation so right now there's a
carts collection but if I do a cardstock
fine i'm going to have no documents in
but what happens if i do a meteor
subscribe I subscribe to cart and I pass
in an object day or ID greater or equal
to the empty string so when I do this
it's going to make that subscription
wish if we look at the code don't know
if I can make this bigger now so this is
the publication so it's going to take
card ID and substitute it into this find
right here so that's going to find all
car eat its greater to or equal to an
empty string and if you look at our
cards collection we can see that that's
all the cars in system which is
something we probably shouldn't be able
to see so let me refresh this really
quick
i also have a method in here called gift
cart gift card accepts card ID again and
it runs it into a fine one so there's
kind of a fun fun for me not fun for the
application query i can pass into this
that would basically do s the entire
database for the entire server so
mongodb has a query operator called
where that accepts the strength and that
string is interpreted as javascript on
the database and it's supposed to be
used to do complex of your documents so
you can like drop comparators and
comparisons on your database of actual
fields of the document but you can pass
in yeah they're just full v8 engine so
you can actually drop in infinite loops
or do whatever you want let me see if I
do this so we call actually so here's
another cool thing if I don't know what
methods exist in a project I can look at
my meteor connection and I can drill
into method handlers and if it's defined
in a shared location I can see this get
heart or get cart method and I can
actually grab the source of it so I can
see that the cart ID is not being
checked right it's just passed directly
into gear so as a client I can see that
your app isn't secure so I can then go
ahead and call meteor call card
and I can say we're see
I wonder if I can just do a while so it
doesn't like just straight up a while
let me really quickly I don't mess this
up so let's do a lot
oh but basically it would spin my
database at a hundred percent preventing
any more incoming connections from
making any queries against the database
essentially be a blessing should go to
my blog blog that eats fifth Co sure
what but basically the bottom line is
that you need to be very careful about
what you take in from the clients and
need to be very careful things directly
into queries everything is dangerous
find find one remove trip with
everything there are tools out there
help you so feel free to check those
come and these are kind of contrived
examples if you want more examples more
real-life in-depth examples check out my
blog or come talk to me after a while
well this is a lot less impressive that
should be trust me it works I did it
earlier I promise not sure what's going
on but uh any questions yeah that's all
me I'm just trying to step out you know
famous was it getting the list of
galaxies users yeah some media had a
website that was publishing all the
users of galaxies including closed beta
it was publishing that data the client
anyone can find it so don't ever publish
it that's also bad more questions
so like you're talking about in the
database right here in this code yeah
well I offer security assessments but I
don't have like a fully automated way to
do that or of a hands-on process fully
automating it would be very cool I
should I should strive towards that send
a ransom cool alright thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
