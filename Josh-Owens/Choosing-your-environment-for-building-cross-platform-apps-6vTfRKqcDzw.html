crater remote cough mobile edition this
talk focuses on building mobile apps
using javascript you can find out more
information about upcoming critter
remote coughs at conf crater i/o enjoy
the talk alright welcome back for the
84th talk our last talk of the
conference I just wanted to assemble a
panel and start having a discussion
we're gonna take some questions from the
audience uh I really just I was inspired
by actually by Brian and as part of the
native script team he wrote an article
talking about like when in to choose
certain platforms for building for
mobile and so that that kind of made so
excited this panel and so cool today we
have Jen looper with us from native
script or progress I guess welcome
generous oh okay well and we also have
Paul dowman from okay grow welcome Paul
thank you you guys have done some
Cordova stuff in the past and now are
you doing reactive stuff to Paul now yet
we haven't started any react native
project looking at it I would would
definitely like to use it for something
but as I'm sure we'll get into you'll
just depend on what's the right thing
for each project yeah yeah so I guess um
obviously like I I haven't built any
react native app sometimes some Cordova
stuff and so I think I I certainly have
opinions of it but think what are your
what are your thoughts on the strengths
and weaknesses of kind of Cordova right
now Paul yeah I think for for me I think
the strength is that it lets you iterate
really quickly weaknesses are that
you're going to probably spend more time
tweaking certain things if perfection in
the UI is what you're looking for and
it's kind of it's I think it's just
that's why I
started I think it's going to depend on
what your goals are for the project and
and yeah so if you want I think and I'm
going to say that for most projects at
the for almost every project at the
start of it iterating quickly is very
important and I think it just depends
whether you anticipate getting to a
point where that where that is
outweighed by other concerns how soon
you'll get there and what you want to do
when you get there if you're going to
eventually consider rewriting it with
lipper tools or not but and I would also
say that for most 44 I don't know I'd
hesitate to put a number but it for a
large amount of apps you will probably
never get to you'll never get to the
point where it's not good enough for
many you will but anyway I think though
yeah you know that brings up an
interesting point to like I had client
we built a Cordova app and then they
realize like there was a problem with
the app being deployed um like the it
didn't update over the air like it
should have with meteor in Cordova and
they ended up realizing like oh we could
just put up in the browser it all works
correctly and then they realize like oh
we just really needed a shortcut on the
on the you know on the desktop we're not
sure we even needed a mobile app so
we're just gonna rewrite all this as a
web app at this point which is kind of
kind of a funny funny choice to make i
guess down the road but i don't know you
know what I don't know that that is I
think there are actually a lot of apps
where that makes a lot of sense and
that's I think another strength of
Cordova as well is that I mean and this
this also comes down to your opinions
about perfection and UI but there are a
lot of cases where you would want to
share the code it also depends on your
budget and you know how worth it is to
to like really duplicate work but there
are times that you might want to share
things between the web and and and up
without having to
maintain two versions and again it's not
just about budget it's about iterating
quickly and that at the stage of your
project where we're we're iterating
quickly is important it could it's not
even a budgeting at that point it's just
a make-or-break for your and your
project and getting product market fit
at the right time anyway yeah yeah I
think maybe the thing I did like about
Cordova's the fact that you could like
utilize existing CSS frameworks and is
that so I'm going to ask you Jen like is
that something you hear complaint about
or do people feel comfortable like using
something like native script um well
actually how does the design work with
native script I know right yeah well
sorry the audio just cut out right there
yeah so with native script there's first
of all there's two ways to build in it a
scripture app one is what we call
vanilla native script and that's just
using you know JavaScript CSS and XML to
build your your front end we also have
this up-and-coming integration with
angular 2 as we're waiting for angular
to get itself started we're building
rapidly deploying on top of that so that
gives you code story and all the designs
story offers an ever-increasing list of
CSS elements that we do support and it
kind of actually a little miraculous
what what we can do with CSS support we
now have keyframe animation that you can
you know that you can use within your
native scripture app and that gives you
no animation you know native animation
on twice so it's kind of a really
exciting project or watch because it's
kind of a man what what we're building
and in terms of the Cordova story I
think that what's really propped up
Cordova um is the existence of ionic you
know it's so it with a very short time
and with very minimum effort you can get
a beautiful up and running I built a
Christmas app in a week it stores it
literally took more time for for it to
be approved in the apple store then for
you know for me to build the thing so
it's just it's a really um
citing a nice way to go ahead and build
that cordoba app and that being said you
know that the downside of cordova would
be in our opinion is the performance of
it when you have long lists of you know
data that you need to be scrolling
through and you need that native soil
you're going to get that performance
head on that in a Cordova app whereas
with you know Iraq native Renee
descriptor any kind of native sort of
hashing of data you won't have the
performance lag so you know there's
trade-offs but like like you said
there's a for many many people of
Cordoba app is totally appropriate and
totally acceptable so you gotta pick
what you want to use yeah I saw a really
interesting article that was arguing for
like why web apps don't actually make
sense and it actually talked about like
all the different browsers and how CSS
is not the same for every browser and
how you're chasing down a lot like
visual bugs so I mean that's that's kind
of interesting to me to think about like
with iOS and Android I guess we can like
discount Windows Phones i don't know but
like you really just have kind of to you
is that you're targeting you really just
have slightly different screen sizes
you're targeting so um like maybe that's
maybe that's an advantage of building
with a native bridge or building a
native app do you think yeah I mean it's
funny because I'm right in the middle of
my head is still in the middle of it so
excuse me for incoherence what I'm
working on I'm creating this type of
shared app right now I'm using something
that our community member Nathan Walker
built it's called angular advanced
angular seed and it uses angular 2 but
you're you're building the UI and
separating out your UI elements your
HTML elements and that's deployed for
for a native app using native script and
then angular 2 for the web so you have
to be thinking about this UI sharing and
how much you can actually share all the
time so it's true and I'm not I hope I'm
doing it right but it's it's you want to
respect the constraints and the
advantages of each of these platforms
you know I don't
want to look at material design on my on
my phablet you know these sort of
questions you know you want something to
look as native as possible for the for
the platform that you're holding on so
I'm going to say that all times it
depends on what you're trying to do and
not like I'm I'm a fan of design as much
as anybody maybe less than some people
but I'm definitely a fan of design and
but I live in two worlds one is one is
like the the software craftsperson world
that probably everybody here viewing
this is it that's that's what you guys
are and that's where I come from as well
but I also spend a lot of time talking
with our clients so I dokey grow we
build we help clients build apps and I'm
like I'm keenly aware of their business
needs and I think it's something that we
do that we'll be that we really work
hard to do is just try to try to not
just be nerds about it and and like you
know sometimes that what the crafts
person wants to do is not that is not
necessarily the right thing hey for the
business sometimes and so it's it's
sometimes make sense to take to you know
make some sacrifices on what the UI
might look like in order to be able to
iterate quickly and i'll argue that
there's no way you can iterate quickly
with anything else I mean as quickly as
with Cordova with then you with anything
else because and keep in mind i guess
i'm taking cordova and medium at an end
meteor right so you've got hot code you
don't have app store deploys and i think
that's probably the biggest factor
there's already a comment in the chat
from somebody saying that that he can be
he can build them quickly in react
native like great of course like
everybody feels they can build apps
quickly and it's all relative right but
and somebody who who knows react native
really well can probably and doesn't
know HTML and CSS in cordova can
probably you can build everything most
quickly with the tools that you know
but so like I guess that's an argument
for every cross-platform framework to be
able to iterate quickly not have to
build two separate ones but hot cold
push really like I think don't don't
underestimate that not having to go
through the App Store approval process
in order to make tweaks and changes like
and not and also not it's not just the
time you wait waiting for the App Store
approval it's also not having to do the
work of support backward compatibility
in your API for the data and I think
that's actually the biggest thing you
can also you could also choose to not
bother with that with native apps but I
mean you know realistically you have a
two week window where an incompatible
change doesn't hasn't hasn't been
updated by everybody right so with with
a meteor or any other app that supports
hot code bush and you don't have to go
to the App Store you can change the data
format from the server radically and not
care and not have to worry not have to
do and not have to do like it can be a
ton of work to support multiple data
formats and you're going to have to do
that for at least a few weeks so I think
that's I think that's a pretty big deal
yeah hot code pushes a something that on
people ask for constantly it's very very
important although to be fair to the
apple store now there wait wait times
down to two days yeah but that's what
they say happen to me I can reckon swear
that's bull I have a client that we did
something kind of weird where we we have
a client that white basically they white
label the app and release hundreds of
them and so she released his new apps
every week and she figures that it's
still an average like two weeks but who
knows since all anecdotal like not
really yeah yeah yeah but what we've
been looking at with hot push is some
some interesting stuff that firebase is
doing actually so if you integrate your
NATO script champ with firebase we have
a lovely plug-in ready for that and they
have this new thing and the fire are
based console called remote config and
it's basically little
key-value pairs that you can um you know
create yeah right in a Google Play Store
you can insert into your native screen
app or any any sort of app and then you
can push data from firebase into your
app you know live so I think a lot of
services are trying to get at this and
try to do it right yes it's definitely
easier for getting your nice APK slammed
into the Google pledge book are no issue
yes yes we're talking about iOS here
yeah yeah yeah good you know um and I
think you touch on this little bit
before Paul to like I think the
important thing here is to realize like
you have to look at like if you're
working with a client or you're managing
a team like you really have to look at
what the stress star of that team and
maybe you have like a strong job guy on
the team and a strong Swift guy on the
team or so you it might make more sense
to actually build those natively and
separately rather than try to go with
react native or native script or
something like that would you think no
mmm maybe I mean you're still gonna be
it i think it just depends how like you
know whether you really want to iterate
quickly also what's the culture in
company about how you design like how
things go through that's the age of
designing to building and if it's very
waterfall like so if you you know if you
spend a lot of time in like sketch for
photoshop and then you know make it
really really clear what you're going to
build and then it just goes off and gets
implemented by two people that maybe
doesn't matter i'll if you are if you're
more of the style where you where you
just kind of iterate more quickly by the
designer or the UI person doing design
and I mean that's a lot less formal and
so I think it depends okay so in that
case it would be hard for two people to
do that simultaneously they wouldn't
necessarily agree on what they were
doing yeah maybe doesn't know yet either
i'm not sure but what we've found is
done we're dealing with a large on a
suitable client can't mention the name
but they have you know their standard
enterprise team of you
iOS people in your Android people and
they found themselves with a hundred
apps to maintain so what with employee
turnover and that portfolio they're
looking to find some cross-platform tool
that would just standardized across the
board to just simplify their lives and
you know um it's quite interesting what
they're what they're dealing with it's
not something I wish on anybody it's
rough yeah terrible yeah we I mean we
were dealing with a similar problem when
I were to go daddy on the outright
project uh you got renamed to go daddy
bookkeeping but like we had the backbone
team and then like the rails team and
then they had a titanium app which was
pretty terrible like it wasn't super
performant and we were having trouble
updating it and like no one really
wanted to work on it and so they hired
an iOS guy and he decided like redo
everything as I was native and then they
had to go find someone to build to react
and like it ended up being this this
terrible like juggling between the
backbone team could already built like
this semi undocumented API and had
things working the way they want to kind
of like what Paul was talking about and
then we had the iOS guy and he's like no
no I need different data and so like
that became a problem as well so sounds
like we need a good architect just sort
of like calm everybody down just say
here's the deal yeah you know that it
takes a lot of effort and time and like
getting all the players table and
figuring all that out and I think no
maybe maybe it would make a lot more
sense to to try to go cross-platform
there and that kind of segues into
Alan's question here which is like you
know if you're choosing a mobile
development platform uh you know do you
factor in the web platform and you know
maybe go with Cordova or like I mean
there's not going to be a ton of you
looking at native script to react native
like there's not a ton of reuse because
the components aren't it's are different
right like the calls that were making to
say like Spencer mentioned last talked
I'm gonna call text rather than
paragraph tag you know yeah i mean i
think that what is happening with us is
that we're seeing people who have is ron
use case for web plus mobile to share a
certain amount code with the Castello
the understanding that you're never
going to get full co-chair because of
the UI differences if i should stop oh
yeah just so what we're seeing is that
people are looking at angular 2 as kind
of um the Savior I hope that's what it
becomes but we actually did a big
showing at ng-conf recently and
demonstrated how you can share at least
your serviced here setting the angular 2
framework and then you know you're going
to branch your UI a little bit according
to your needs but yeah I mean as much
code sharing as you can get it's it's a
big win even if I totally won it for all
different sized shops yeah yep and I
think like also with Cordova apps you
you can build them into style where you
wouldn't really be able to share much UI
code at all because you've gone with a
framework that that makes it very you
know like maybe you want bootstrap on
the on the desktop web version of it and
you want to have like ionic something
very specific on the court of a mobile
part of it and you know those things are
hard to share i think like I'm not
really a designer but I know we've tried
to do that and it has been perfect so so
I don't know that I would necessarily
recommend that but there are definitely
places where it makes sense to share the
same code also you know another thing
with core I guess I'm staking out a pro
Cordova position here so I'll just keep
going what you know I really am very
open minded and it's not like I dokie
girl we have a policy that we would only
use Cordova like wees whatever makes
sense and we're interested in all kinds
of things but but I guess I'm just sort
of like describing the things we're
Cordova makes sense and another another
nice thing about it is
you can choose whatever framework you
like so you know if you if you if you
end up like I mean I guess in the days
where you're using I think the world is
somewhat converging on two big UI
frameworks right now so maybe it's not
that relevant but given the rate of
change who knows where we'll be in a
year or two as well right so you might
want to ask you might end up wanting to
switch between angular from react to
angular 2 or vice versa who knows right
so you know it's kind of nice to have
that flexibility it's good to know as
many frameworks as you as you can get
your arms around for sure no question
it's like for us we're just you know
we're going all in on angular 2 because
you know the react native folks have
wrapped that seems totally logical to me
so we're just building as best we can to
supply as much support as we can for the
communities yeah I've got to imagine
like angular to lick it there's a lot of
question there about what what's the
adoption rate gonna look like and stuff
in like there's a lot of corporate or
large company entities that that have
adopted angular and my guess is you know
they're gonna be looking at angular 2
moving forward so yeah that's that's the
hope I think if you look at something
like Google Trends or whatever you'll
notice that angular is like an order of
magnitude bigger for what this word I
don't know if this is even
representative of anything and maybe
there's less momentum who knows but but
angular is way way way more popular then
react in the world right now so far
nothing dunno it's kinda interesting
yeah that's kind of yeah it seems like
the bigger shops are kind of a little
more geared towards the angular what's
interesting to me is the difference
between angular 1 and angular 2 and
trying to understand that because it's
not obvious one of our team members Todd
Votto pub up sorry this echo published
something called ng migrate and it helps
angular 1 developers migrate you know
into angular 2 as we understand it as it
is right now
what would really be great is to have
angular 2 released solidly and and we
await that day with the anticipation
nice there's something else that we
haven't touched on which is not I mean
it's not a Cordova but it's still web
and so but there's a there's also
progressive web apps and so Josh you
imagined like a few minutes ago that you
had a client could end up realizing that
they actually will all they needed was
actually a web app that they could
bookmark on the home screen it sounded
really familiar yeah yeah pwn you know
like there's a lot of there's a lot of
apps where it actually like for example
a lot of the draw a lot of the traffic
is driven by sharing of links and you
know like really what like a lot of
times it make sense to have a web app
and the I think you know I'm not looking
at progressive web apps as as an app
killer necessarily i just i'm just going
responding to comments here but but i
think it's just i think it's interesting
that like these these things are kind of
just becoming more integrated either way
so and if you if you do have a web up or
something that it makes sense to receive
traffic through through the sharing of
links and whatever at least that way you
can actually support the the sort of
like add to the home screen and
background or offline processing sorry
um no offline data and that's all
supported by service workers which do
background downloading of your static
assets things like that so I think
that's really definitely something to
keep an eye on I think progressive web
apps make a lot of sense for areas of
the world that are heavy on the Android
and light on the iOS and I think that's
why flipkart went with it in India it's
it's a great technology for them and it
seems to be just working beautifully it
would be interesting someone says that
okay I hear that they're super hard to
build I don't know about that we did a
proof-of-concept internal um but I think
what people are looking to do
also is to dodge the app download
scenario you know so that you could go
somewhere you wouldn't have to download
the mobile app people are addressing
that in different ways like with you
know bot integrations into line or
whatever to avoid the app download but
that seems to be a trend that I'm seeing
it's kind of interesting to watch yeah
there's a lot of things that i use it i
don't want to have isn't i don't want to
bother to go to a separate search the
apps or or even be linked there and
download the app and install it like if
you've just clicked on a link for
something and you are using the mobile
web page like a lot of times it's good
enough and i don't i don't want that to
be permanently on my phone yeah you know
and the interesting thing here is like
what what's iOS like what's what's Apple
gonna do here right because I feel like
potentially the app store well the app
store is there a cash cow and
potentially this could harm their cash
count right like if you're not going
through the App Store to download or do
app in app purchases and that kind of
thing like I I think they're gonna be
hesitant to embrace this at first but as
Apple pay for web is coming out and that
kind of thing like maybe maybe we'll
start to see something there um but yeah
it's yeah they don't support service
workers properly right now apparently so
elegant I'm not loving it so yeah I
guess those other hand I don't know if
like the u.s. is basically the big irish
place you know I feel like I mean in
China definitely there they're popular
but there's some really awesome android
phones out there and certainly in India
China South Korea places like that like
it's heavy on the Android yep android is
actually huge in the world maybe not in
San Francisco but it's just weird not an
apple um although i was i was at a
conference and they have space for the
people to raise their hands if they're
wearing an apple watch and i was the
only person
night ah so Dave asked as a full stack
developer should I be building for scale
from the onset or shall i plan to
rebuild when it becomes a problem
progressing so I guess we're talking
about the back end may be here then what
full stack to me that screams the need
for progressive enhancement I think that
you know the idea that you'd start small
and then you enhance to support all of
the use cases that you need that seems
to be a better architecture in all cases
than you know going back and rewriting
and I'm speaking as someone who was
tasked with either building a mobile app
or getting our sites responsive and I
went with the responsive and O Lord you
know it would have been really helpful
to have done that from the get-go I
think there's there can be a case for
you know not being afraid to eventually
rebuild something down the road if it
allows you to iterate quickly at the
beginning and I think this is like it's
a really business specific thing if you
don't know that you're that your
business or your product is ever going
to find product market fit or succeed
and the most important thing that you
can do is just be able to change it as
fast as you can and and like look at it
as a prototype don't invest too much in
it does that sometimes make sense i mean
there's a lot of times where you know it
what you're going to build is you don't
want to do that and that's fine but
there's there's definitely times where
that makes sense and being a gonna start
up and your made-up ugly might start of
a product yeah and being afraid to
rebuild it might stop you from from
iterating really really quickly at the
start like yeah there is a there is a
case for prototypes anyone that's ever
had to rebuild a nap a significant app
to do it like the big rewrite because
the old code base sucked for whatever
reason you know like that's that's
actually a terrible situation to write
and you realize that you know that the
new one is going to take longer and
probably be buggier and worse for a long
time than in the original one yeah
that's a different thing than what i'm
talking about i'm talking about just you
know basically doing a prototype
getting product market fit and you know
maybe you get VC funding maybe you end
up um no with money for whatever reason
because you got the business right yeah
yeah I would I would echo that I guess
to some degree right like even my you
know I'll bring up Pokemon go because
they definitely had some scaling issues
recently uh and like I don't I don't
know that like this is um for a lot of
people it's going to be a money problem
it's going to be very very hard for you
to get to the point where you actually
have a technology constraint problem and
I know like Paul and I both worked on
the words with friends app and like they
were getting to a point where they were
hitting technology constraint problems
but we're talking like millions of
people playing a video game um and
that's that's something that I think
even as a as a business that's very hard
to achieve they did not have budget
constraint at the same time this is not
mmm yeah exactly exactly guess that's
the point right like they could hire
smart people to do the right there's
lots of personnel constraints like they
just didn't have the right team and the
mix or uh no they were just I think they
were reaching the limits of what you
could reasonably do to support that many
people on my sequel and so they started
cashing and that kind of thing cuz you
just you had like like this oddly enough
like this onslaught of people that
apparently really like to play Scrabble
on their iPad after dinner and so like
730 ish eastern time just huge influx of
people yeah it raises this issue that I
keep thinking about more and more that
like a good architect and good
management can defuse a certain amount
of trouble and I've been in shops where
that we had neither and it's just a
torment and I just wonder I just wonder
if this is something that like we should
be thinking about more carefully like
just thinking more about architecture
and not just slamming things around
breaking moving fast and breaking things
that you know it works for facebook
good theory but no but yeah I'm a big
fan of being able to iterate iterate
quickly so now brief word from our
sponsors before you see the rest of the
talk Raygun spend more time building
great software and less time fighting it
Reagan helps keep a watchful eye on your
web and mobile applications and tells
you when problems arise you can learn
more at Reagan com native script back by
telerik by progress is an open source
framework for building truly native
mobile apps with typescript and angular
to use your web skills to get native UI
and performance on iOS and Android enjoy
the rest of the top but again it's not
for every stage of every project and
doesn't work with every company for
various other reasons so yeah so in Dave
just gave a little more insight in the
comments there uh he said he's thinking
about making a multiplayer game and
unsure what form it will take and so I
think you know again like maybe the game
takes off maybe he is like for instance
will say meteor it's known how to scale
it right like you've got people who have
come before you who are they are dealing
with like 12,000 15,000 concurrent
connections at any given time you can
totally throw money at that problem and
it's not going to be a big deal as long
as you have the cash to do it like you
know class craft was spinning up 60 70
servers to handle their load on the back
end and like for them they had funding
and that was no big deal so things too
crazy it's this game that he's making is
it gonna be done in meteor I don't know
I just I picked that Dave I put it in
the notes i'm curious suppose I'm always
curious what people are using to build
games indeed I I used to be ambassador
for Corona SDK so I have a weakness so
um you know I'm kind of curious to what
what what are people generally using for
a back-end or like what's may be the
consensus or the thoughts on back end
for native script
yeah so of course telecasts that our own
back-end we have our own back-end we
it's telerik platform and the database
we use is based on mago and it's we call
it ever live that's a code name but what
we try to do is support as many
integrations as we can I'm really helped
up right now about firebase I am all in
at firebase it is amazing I'm so happy
the way it just makes my screens just
perform beautifully that the sinking of
datas is terrific I love it but we've
also got people who are heavily invested
in Microsoft's shops so they tend to
look at Azure a lot of azure people we
also have plugins for like local locally
stored data sequel light Loki is another
one I think it's the same sort of thing
it's stored within the apps I'm
couchbase as well but I like to have
something that I can you know control
externally so for me firebase works
beautifully and of course people have
their own standard databases that
they're making connections with ya so
I'm kind of curious to hear your
thoughts on the back end as well Paul
like it doesn't necessarily have to be
related to just Cordova but like if if
you were going to start a new project
for a client today like what what are
some of the options you'd be looking at
yeah i mean i think i would first i
would evaluate whether whether cordova
made sense or whether we were going to
reach limitations in performance and UI
that would be a problem if not it would
be my first choice just because again we
can do hot code push we i would use
media for the back ends so i'd be
looking at I'd be I'd be looking at to
uh using graph ql potentially with with
Apollo for certain things but i think i
would i'm still i'm a fan of going with
the with the default meteor as it is
even right now
but you know again it depends on on
every project but I do like I do like
the hot coal push I gotta say that's my
white one of my biggest biggest thing
that would influence me yet at the
moment yeah that was always made us big
strength right the hot cookers like you
guys you did was like the first to
really make that awesome yeah and I an
easy easy to do like you don't have to
do anything yeah yeah it's great yep all
right ah we're kind of running to the
end here like that was all I had do we
have any more on these questions oh look
up it's what uh okay what hello can I
just do a plug for a local event that
we're hosting in bathtubs man if you go
to UM developer day dot NATO script or
go put it in the notes I we're having a
little one day conference in Boston so
my home base and we're going to be
talking about everything native scripts
so we love to have books come a lot of
fun nice yeah that's awesome something's
here um what's uh what's some of the
cooler things that you've seen built
with I guess we'll start with you Jen
with native script and the mall all you
can answer the same thing in regards to
Cordova or react native um there's a
developer switch so we have some amazing
community we have like 1,900 people on
slack who was just like constantly
helping and asking questions and one of
our most valued community members Nathan
Walker who I talked about earlier he has
built an app I'm trying of the name of
it he's working on it now it's almost
ready as angular 2 and they descript and
it is allowing yo yo shout out play so
you integrate you great grab apps excuse
me you grab tracks from Spotify and then
on top of it you can record a little
shout out so
start playing the track and then you
record you know hey honey this one's for
you and it saves and then you can share
it and have a little like dance party
going on so it's going to look like a
lot of innovative stuff going on with
audio cool apps like that but a lot of
people working on line of business apps
I'm working on a couple projects one is
going to be it done at angular connect
and it's also a spotify audio thing it's
going to be if i can make it work it's
going to be amazing so crossing my
fingers a lot of good stuff coming cool
bike yes and as far as like cool things
with the Cordova I mean I think I've
been pretty clear that that Cordova's
place in the world it's not necessary
for building the cool flashy you aight
aight pops i mean you can make like you
can definitely make them look good but
you know if if I was starting out to
build like a you know some flashy
consumer-oriented app it probably
wouldn't be it would it wouldn't
necessarily be the first choice but you
know there are there are low tylen to
people with CSS and some of them work at
ok grow so I think you can do you can do
some good stuff but but yeah if someone
came to us with looking to build
something really flashy it would
probably not be a Cordova thing I mean
like untapped and work it our all iono
caps so I was just like yeah like like
the comet says it's not about flashy
versus not flashy it's about things that
work beautifully those are some there's
another one on the ionic show showcase
called think it's a chef it's a recipe
app looks really nice it was a there was
a fun yeah I wish they would have
released it as a Cordova abs Oh would
have been interesting to see how it
works but it was called moon I think dot
CEO it was quite a fun game um and it
works super well even just in a mobile
web browser it was like all.svg based um
that would have been don't have been fun
one to see in the app store though I bet
it would have done well thanks right
well if no one else have any questions I
guess we can just wrap it up okay
yeah cool cool thank you yeah thanks
again thanks Paul and thanks for
everyone who attended the conference we
will be I've actually been recording the
video so I'm going to try to splice them
together and get a slightly higher
quality version the one that crowdcast
is putting out is only 640 by 480 and
kind of a little bit rate so it's kind
of hard to read some of the text so I'm
trying to rectify that and get something
out but uh hopefully enjoy the
conference and everyone train go by um
everyone that you saw talk here should
be in the crater cop chattering so feel
free to ask any questions there if you
had any any other questions um and
