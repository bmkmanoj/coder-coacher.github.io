meteor she's kind of my overview of what
makes it attractive and interesting and
why you should give it a try so this is
all just kind of based on my experience
so far that I've had over the almost two
years at this point with meteor so if
you don't know me I'm I've made some big
bets on meteor you know I do the meteor
podcast and run on each side called
cratered I oh I've got a weekly
newsletter that I do for I call a meteor
jazz club and then you can find me on on
twitter and github is blah and so I do
full time work with meteor I do have my
time spinning contracting and the other
time is spent on creating educational
products and what not giving talks that
kind of thing so what is a meteor it is
I guess it started as a framework but I
would say that it's it's become more
than a framework sexually become a
full-on platform you know if it started
as like hey let's build this this client
server framework but then when you start
adding in things like Cordova what we're
really being able to glue together like
node and you know client-side and
getting it all working seamlessly made
it very easy for them to do things like
adding Cordova and getting getting all
that kind of rich support there so you
know I consider it more of a platform
now and this is this is kind of an
overview of what it looks like if you
look here like when you download and
install meteor and you type media run
this is this is kind of what happens
here if you go to the right this is the
normal meteor path your to the left this
is going to be what happens when Cordova
starts as well so we'll walk through the
right and then we'll get over to the
left
but a meteor app is really just it
starts a server and using nodes are no
DJ s it uses fibers which makes node
synchronous so you can it's a little
more approachable for for people who
don't maybe you want to deal with the
asynchronous nature of node there's also
some other libraries they built like
live query which handles the the the
back and forth for wit with Mongo so you
know when you do a query you want it to
be reactive and responsive live queries
kind of the library handling that and
then so everything ok can you guys hear
me ok ok all right um oops yes a lot I'm
Shane you guys not my slides there we go
um so the the communication between the
that the client and the server happens
through this protocol called DDP dynamic
data protocol and it it helps ship the
data back and forth over web sockets and
so you know we've got this data on the
wire a idea where we're not sending just
a huge chunk of HTML over to the browser
like older kind of server-side rendering
frameworks do like rails we're actually
just sending some JavaScript and some
HTML is being met together using data
that's sent over DDP and so they use
JSON is the serialization protocol that
they use it's just JSON that's been
extended to support things like dates
and you can extend it to support other
object types as well if you want but
basically it's just handling the the
translation from the server to the to
the client and so
when your client actually types in a
browser address there they actually
they're actually pulling down some HTML
some CSS some JavaScript and the client
portion of meteor starts and it uses
things like blaze there's a reactive
version of handlebars called space bars
tracker there's an in-memory version of
mongo called mini Mongo it allows you to
run queries against it but everything's
just kept in the memory and so that's
that's all the data that's transferred
over DDP using a JSON that's what many
Mongo is and and so you know DDP is just
this way for these two to kind of talk
back and forth and you have methods so
you can like make a method call from the
the browser client to the server and the
other cool thing that happens is you
know you've got this hot code reload so
if you deploy new code it's constantly
keeping track of which version of the
application you're running and if
there's a new version it's going to
detect that and tell the client to load
the new version so it's kind of nice to
get get code kind of flowing over that
way automatically and so the other great
thing is if you do want Cordova you just
say like meteor ad platform iOS or
meteor app platform android and all of a
sudden it's going to start downloading
some libraries that it needs and it's
going to spin up you know if you do an
iOS will spin out the iOS simulator
compile the app and push that to the
simulator and then it connects back to
this the server here and it just acts
like another browser almost but then you
can get access to you can use Cordova
packages and you can get access to the
the phone api's and that kind of thing
so it starts to become very interesting
when you can easily add in things like
Cordova so um so for me you know I I had
the when I guess the the pleasure or
displeasure of watching someone actually
try to convert
from meteor to the mean stack because
they were they were frustrated with
hiring people in meteor which i think is
a problem that's already fixing itself
but it you know watching them do it i
watch them spend multiple weeks you know
kind of fighting with how to glue
everything together and so to me you
know on the left you've got meteor and
then on the right you've got the mean
stack and in order to equal the the
value of meteor on the left you got to
spend time kind of stacking up all these
pieces on the right and you know there's
at any given time in this framework you
know you could change out note for rails
if you wanted or for Ruby and then
Express would be rails you could use
Mongo if you want you change out that
database if you need to there's crab
gold there's multiple pub/sub library
options in every framework or language
that you're looking at and then you've
got angular on top of that and then
maybe you're gonna start looking at Oh
off libraries you got to figure out how
to glue all that together on your own so
I mean there's just there's a lot of
stuff that I think you're getting for
free and I think there are people that
are interested in and maybe doing the
stuff on the writing building it but for
me when I want to develop a web app I
want to spend time just building that
web app I don't want to spend a lot of
time on the infrastructure so to me that
makes meteor very very interesting uh
the other great thing is you know
because we get all this this this glue
has been done for us it makes it very
easy to get started quickly and rapidly
prototype something I'm sure a lot of
people heard that meteor is good for
prototyping I think it goes a lot deeper
than that but it is really really good
for prototyping and building something
brand new so I I'm finding that you know
what what used to take something like 8
to 12 weeks to kind of get testable MVP
out the door not very polished with
rails is now taking six to eight weeks
to get out the door with meteor
so you know I'm finding I guess a
twenty-five percent reduction in in time
there overall for getting an MVP out the
door so I I do think that is strong and
that was a goal of meteor you know they
wanted to make it easier to build
applications and I think they're they're
accomplishing that every day with every
new new release so this is atmosphere i
think meteors got a great packaging
system and this is this is a big part of
the power of it it's very easy to
package up functionality if you need it
so you can you can push HTML and CSS and
javascript to the client you can package
things up to run on the server like
there's a lot of interesting things you
can do there and you know the great
thing is like this is a great example of
a package that took the stripe NPM
package wrapped it up and made some
pages available so you could go to like
a billing page and you could see you
know you just drop this into your SAS
app and you could see like receipts they
were being synced over using the API and
because we relied on the NPM package we
got all the the web hook kind of calling
for free so stripe you know you would
get you would get some URLs that Shrike
could hit and update your application
and it would do the right thing under
the covers so it would like find the
user account associated with this this
billing ID and it would update it and
say hey we just charge that user and
that kind of thing your app would know
that it was up to date and you know this
this was something that could be built
because there's there's mpm integration
there and you know I didn't I didn't
have the slide but there's also Cordova
integration so you can go to I think
it's plugins Cordova org and you can add
in any Cordova plugin that you want you
know you can add in geo location which
is a core plug in and you get kind of
like this this isomorphic interface that
allows you to make one call so I can ask
the browser for the current location and
if the client allows me to get that
location then you know I'll get some geo
coordinates back which I can do
something with and the awesome thing is
I don't have to worry about what
platform I'm on I doesn't matter if it's
the you know chrome browser Firefox
browser it doesn't matter if it's you
know the iOS phone or android phone like
I make the same call in my code and
under the covers Cordova's in a hand
excuse me handling it and doing the
right thing with it so uh so I think to
me web apps have changed fundamentally
I'm probably the last eight years seven
years something in that range you know
you look at when Facebook and Twitter
came out we started to get into this
range of kind of like dynamically
updating applications maybe it's only
been five years but you know people are
coming to expect that they're going to
see little updates on the page and you
know maybe it's hey there's a couple new
posts and you click a link and something
on the page updates but you know people
want to see kind of these these
reactions are their friends online can
they chat with them you know that
there's even even my parents are using
Facebook and starting to understand what
a rich client interface should be and I
think you know between that and the
ubiquity of kind of phones everywhere
and native applications like people are
are going to demand that you build
something richer than what a server-side
framework necessarily deliver so I think
another reason that meteor is great is
that it's just javascript javascript on
the back end is JavaScript on the front
end and you know we're able to rely on
all kinds of tools like mpm that i
mentioned before Cordova or a bunch of
interesting things but I think
javascript is still like the number one
language
I was looking on a website called get
Hut a cheaty that info i believe and
they have stats for like each quarter of
the last couple years and as of the
fourth quarter of 2014 javascript was
the it had the most active repositories
on github with like three hundred and
twenty three thousand repos and you know
that's a trend that just keeps
continuing like its its growth curve is
just on an upward trend and I don't
think that's going to change so you know
I think it because it's JavaScript it
makes it easier to hire people right
because everyone kind of knows java
script because javascript is it's
everywhere right like you've got desktop
you've got mobile you've got you know
it's on the server now even and we're
able to do interesting things by having
that same language in all these spots
and you know i think it's it's going to
become even more vitally important
because as mobile takes off you know
you've got kind of like two or three
competing platforms in iOS and Android
and Windows and we need a way to build
for all those platforms but not
necessarily have three separate code
bases like that's not something someone
wants to maintain sorry need a drink um
I also think javascript is a gateway
drug I'm gonna mute can you get there
for a second I'm getting like feedback
here
can you meet you thank you awesome all
right um so yeah javascript is a gateway
drug and I think that whenever I look at
working with other people the you know I
I know how to build a a well-functioning
backend and I know how to build kind of
like a real reactive client front end
from the standpoint of the JavaScript
code but I'm not a designer I'm actually
quite quite bad at design and so the
interesting thing to be is when you
bring a designer in a lot of them you
know they'll know HTML and CSS but if
they're if they're pretty good at HTML
and CSS the thing that I've noticed is
they know a little JavaScript they've
come at it through jquery and installing
jQuery plugins and configuring it and
they start to learn as a necessity and I
think you know for me like I started at
the back end with rails and kind of
worked my way to the you know writing
obviously just HTML for the template but
then something interesting started to
happen when the shift had started I
guess it was around 2011 with backbone
for me you know we started building
richer client-side from men's and I I
started to dabble in the JavaScript and
so you know it it's it's definitely kind
of lured me in and then on the flip side
you've got these designers who know
jquery and then they they feel a little
more comfortable in something like
meteor because it can feel familiar to
them or natural to them to have this
kind of client side templating that's
built with javascript and so my
comparison was a recent designer that i
worked with we tried to get some apps
done and rails he was struggling to
understand the concepts and really get
it running on his machine and he always
had asked questions and
you know just generally felt lost but we
made the switch to meteor and you know
he picked it up right away and he
actually started maintaining the the
differential meteor boilerplate he
started he's even now comfortable to the
point where he's writing his own
application with no help from any other
developers and he's been working with
the instagram api and and developing you
know a new application and he's been
doing all of it without any help and to
me that that's an amazing thing like
that's that's a really really strong
thing to see happen so i also think that
the community around meteor is pretty
amazing i mean i'm giving a talk to you
guys in casablanca from my house and in
cincinnati ohio and i think that that's
happening because there's strong ties
that have been put in place by the
meteor community team that has allowed
this communication this information
transfer to happen these connections
that I don't think I've necessarily ever
happened before you know being being the
Ruby world you would fly someone in to
give these talks or you know I didn't I
I might know the major movers and
shakers but as a as a person it wasn't
easy for me to get ahold of someone and
get someone interesting to give a talk
so uh and this this picture in
particular is another great thing that
they do with the community as well which
is this is a dev shop and so they they
host this once a month in San Francisco
and they open their doors at like 2pm
and just let people come in and they've
got a screen up on the board and if you
got questions you can ask those
questions and there are people like
experts that are they're donating their
time and they're willing to help and try
to get you unstuck and that kind of
thing and then they do that for about
four hours and then dinner shows up and
they they cater in delicious food and
you know you can um
you can hang out a chat and talk and eat
and and have a good time and then it's
seven o'clock they start they start
major talks and they do an hour of two
talks and then they do some lightning
talks and they record the whole thing on
YouTube so even sitting in in Casablanca
or Cincinnati we can participate and and
give comments and tweets and all kinds
of stuff and you know this happens the
last thursday of every month generally
and you know i've been out there three
times for this and it's been an amazing
experience in person but i generally
watch this every month because i want to
see what's going on with see what people
are working on and it's really
interesting because now we have this
vast library on youtube as well which i
think is great and you know the the
people that I talk to and I'm there or
the people that I meet at our meetups
there this is very open and welcoming
and accepting and helpful and that's
that's maybe different than other
communities that I've been part of in
the past ah so this this picture here
this is actually how I came to learn
about meteor having done nine years in
rails um you know this is from rails
caspro and Ryan Bates did this
interesting thing where he built the
same application over and over and over
again in different client side
frameworks and it took him two episodes
and it took him um two episodes to ember
two episodes to do backbone two episodes
to do angular but it took in one episode
to do meteor and you can see here like
someone on the page it says the meteor
was 15 minutes but the second episode of
member was 14 minutes so he accomplished
in half the time what it took him to
accomplish in the you know in double the
time an ember angular and backbone and I
think that that that speaks volumes
because there's
go back and set up you know everything's
just there and it just works with this
framework and I think it was easier for
him to accomplish everything that he
wanted to accomplish in the front end
from meteor and I won't say that you
know you're gonna see a 50-percent speed
improvement getting started but I do
think that thirty to forty percent is
realistic if you know JavaScript well
enough and to me that's interesting I
think that that that savings when you're
building an application that savings can
can mean that you have more dollars in
the bank or a more time on your side to
kind of pivot and find that product
market fit and build something that the
community wants and that's uh that's not
something that we've had a lot of before
I mean everyone was excited about rails
because you know it was going to be this
big time saver and you know conventions
over configuration and all that kind of
stuff and I would say meteor is actually
taking that a step further and provided
us with a modern development environment
so any questions
yes so there
I can't hear you at all I'm sorry I
think one of the computers is muted
there
any hey me yes okay my question is is
meteor enterprise friendly framework
such as a Java uh yes I would say yeah I
would definitely say yes some people
would I mean so I know this much there
are enterprises that are starting to
dabble in it and you know the
interesting thing to them is being able
to build a mobile application for two
different platforms using one code base
and so I think that that is going to be
a super interesting thing or I guess
even three platforms right like you've
got the web iOS and Android and so yeah
I think I think it's it's definitely
getting there I think Mongo is a piece
that that maybe scares people and so
they're worried that you know they need
sequel or they've got to have some
relational database and so I think
you'll see a lot more meteor adoption
when they decide to add another database
in the enterprise anyway I think they
will get more media will get more a
closer to the enterprise if it adopts
mysql my sequel as a database i think i
would agree my toes are afraid of new it
no xq ella yeah i would i would say it's
either going to be my sequel or it's
going to be postgres sequel I think
maybe postgres seems more likely just
because it's got the tools that that
people may want to use for kind of
enterprise e-type sequel stuff yep
let me hand over to Mike someone else
it's got a question well hi Josh I have
several questions but I'll begin with
one secularly even if even if media or
is a full stack you know framework or
more than that of course Madonna
framework but it is a full stack tool
can it can it integrate with other
stacks especially server-side you know
like like standard node.js application
then yeah yeah so I think yes DDP is
likely going to be that that gateway
integration point but if you actually
like drawl out you know the pieces of
major communicating from the database
all the way to the client you can kind
of draw some some cut points there and
there's a there's some interesting ideas
where you could do it with DDP or you
could implement something on the client
or you know you could do it through just
working with the Mongo database and
filling that up there's there's a number
of ways that you can kind of create this
interoperability but I definitely think
that DDP is going to be the most
interesting way going forward I've
actually seen I haven't seen it
personally but there's a there's a dev
shop video out there about some guys who
are working with an electron microscope
and they've created this legacy DDP
client that allows them to communicate
with the electron microscope and so
they're like they're slicing little thin
slices of rack brains and they're using
the electron microscope to inspect those
and they're using a meteor app to kind
of control the microscope and get the
images back and that's very interesting
to me and I think that we'll see more of
that in the future like Ruby DDP or
Erlang DDP or you know something along
those lines
hey Josh how you doing good how are you
hey my name is Emma Drake I'm uh I'm
from Morocco obviously I spent a lot of
still a lot of time in stateside yeah so
my question is maturity wise I mean how
mature is is is a meteor uh sure so I
mean it's been around since uh 2012 I
guess is when it got started I would say
maturity wise it's actually very mature
I said something on the podcast the
other day like instead of necessarily
like test-driven development or like
behavior driven development I believe
that the media development group is like
a meticulous detail driven development
organization they're very very
particular about putting out a high
quality product and strong api's that
makes sense and you know they take their
time when they find a problem even like
if you look at the last dev shop with
with one point o coming out they came
out with the new packaging system and
that introduced some walkie pneus and it
was little i feel like it should have
maybe been fixed before one point oh but
you know here they are in March and it
was released in december i guess
november we're coming out with one point
oh four and one point one soon and you
know they've they've rewritten the
constraint solver and they've realized
that what they had originally wrote
wasn't good enough and so they've
they've gone back and made a commitment
to write something that's you know an
industrial-grade kind of constraint
solver and david greenspan gave a great
talk on it about mini sack and how it
works and what it does and very
interesting technology to see and i'm
super glad that he's putting
place so basically when i install a
package i can and you know the the the
version versions file that I I share
with you and if we're both developing
like I can be ensured that you're going
to install the same package versions
that I have and that's important so okay
all right so so as a as a startup that
is mainly based on not GS and the
angular I mean how how would you like do
you have any recommendations if we
decide to do to move the limit your way
yeah yeah yeah I would have number one I
would highly recommend taking a look at
again the dev shop video from this past
month had a guy named Marie talking
about uh building angular and meteor
together and you know he's got all kinds
of like services that he's built up that
exposed some of the meteor stuff into
angular like he's got a dollar sign
meteor service and that kind of thing so
um you know he's done a lot of work to
make that good and you know he likes
angular and he's got a number of angular
developers available and it and as part
of his team and so as a dev shop they
want to be able to use both together and
i would highly recommend you know
looking up the the peppy wary 2015 dev
java do and watch Ariz talk and just try
to understand like what he's doing and
that's probably a good way to start to
get into meteor in my opinion so you
really you're just kind of changing out
a little bit of the client and then
mostly just kind of like the back end
node piece but that might be a good way
to kind of segue and right thank you
thank you for thank ya
Megan I have caution about swanton
performance front end performance I
Peyton fulfilled in with with meteor and
I I tried both sample apps you know
maybe they're not perfect but I also
checked the telescope this image or its
majority developed with meteor well all
the JavaScript of course and the CSS and
the views are packet and sent to the
client at connection so it's not maybe
for a hybrid app well packaged with
Cordova is perfect in my opinion but for
a web app technically accessed through
the browser it's not very efficient
performance wise what do you think about
it maybe maybe and I understood it wrong
but what your opponent opinion about
this um I think you know someone
actually put together a good ah gosh I
wish I could remember where it was that
he put together a great little repo but
basically at the react conference this
year someone gave a talk and kind of
showed off angular and react and I want
to say one other framework maybe was
ember that's what it was and he was like
updating basically it was just like
generated database queries but it was
like a database dashboard kind of
showing all the activity going on in
your database and um he faked all that
out and just was updating like the
client side of it using tools for each
each of those frameworks and you know
react was super snappy but amber Lake
had some memory leaks and angular was
was pretty good but it was nowhere near
what react was in regards performance
and the interesting thing is that you
know someone went and basically
recreated that with with
meteor and you know the the performance
I think it was a little better than
angular but not not where react was at
from the video I saw but the probably
the most interesting thing to me was the
fact that once she started meteor it
used nine mags a memory which was the
smallest of all the foot memory
footprints and it stayed at at nine
major memory so there was never a change
like it was just this flat line like
they had this little memory bar down at
the bottom that's how we knew amber had
a memory leak in it but you know it just
it stayed flat and that was interesting
to me as well and so I think there
hasn't been a lot of conscious effort to
optimize blaze necessarily or or even as
you suggested like optimize the package
delivery size of a meteor application
like by default I think when you put
together meteor app with Cordova I think
you're looking at something like 500k
that's going to be shipped down to the
to the client in JavaScript HTML and CSS
and that's that's without adding a bunch
of your own code or packages so um yeah
I think there's maybe some stuff that
can be done in regards to performance to
make it even better but I haven't found
that to be a major stopping point up
till now okay Joe hey I'd like to know
how do you see angularjs a cooperation
kind of thing with the meteor has
angularjs lost some territory or is it
still a good framework to adopt with the
meteor uh yeah I think I think it's
still a good framework to adopt with
meteor personally like I mentioned
already gave that great talk at dev shop
that I would highly recommend watching I
also think you know like for me I'm a
meteor guy like I started to dabble into
angular and then I found meteor and just
decided like that was enough for me on
the front end
um but I definitely know like there's
there's a strong community and kind of a
head start on packages and support in
angular you know they are like they're
one of the top started repositories on
github and it if you look at stack
overflow on a 30 day cycle like they get
probably the largest amount of questions
for any particular framework so there's
definitely a big community there and I
think it's worth you know I meteor is
committed to figuring out what's the
best way to make angular or react work
in the browser with meteor and you know
they want you to have that choice
available so I would not be surprised to
see stuff coming out and you know 1.2
later this year that that makes it even
easier they get get meteor working or
get angular working with me here I think
anger jesse's likes consuming a rest web
services a while uh meteor doesn't
provide red web services if i'm not
wrong so I I don't see how they can
collaborate um so I mean consuming rest
web services again like you're just
trying to eat out of my mind territory
here but um again i would suggest taking
a look at that talk uri gave because you
know really starts to dive a little bit
deeper on how you can get media and
angular to work together but the other
interesting thing is there's actually a
number of packages out there to expose
your your meteor back end as a rest
service if you need to there used to be
rest stop and then there's another one
called actually now i gotta look um
messed up
I'm just find it here real quick
rest of this that's the name of the
package so there's a package called rest
of this it's rtst I V us and yeah I
would give that a look and so you're
able to basically just configure it to
mount up and expose a lot of your your
data as as as rest endpoints if you need
to and the other interesting thing is to
you can consume if you want to you can
easily consume rest endpoints using the
HTTP package that the the meteor group
has built so I'm again I wouldn't let
that be a stopper I think that's easy
enough to figure out okay thanks sure
any other hi Josh hey I have a question
for you sure firstly what is more
efficient to let a or for back end or
for example you the angular and PHP for
backing what was the more efficient in
terms of security um well I'm obviously
biased so I'm gonna say meteor um I
would say in terms of like efficiency
wall coating for security I would say
that that's probably not that has
nothing to do with PHP or nothing to do
with meteor that has to do with how you
think as a programmer and how you kind
of feel about the platform i would say
like anything that's brand new to you
it's going to be harder for you to
understand the security implications of
so um you know there's going to be some
amount of research that you're going to
need to do to understand that you know
I've seen I've seen a number of highly
trained talented programmers who have
made some stupid security mistakes and
that has nothing to do with the the
framework necessarily that has to do
with them either not paying attention or
maybe not understanding that part of the
framework or you know there's a number
of things that can lead to that so
does that help yes okay okay thanks Josh
I I think that's it there's no more
questions we really thank you deeply for
this inspiring talk and hope to have you
next time okay help us grow in this
community yeah yeah alright thanks guys
okay can we can we just take a selfie
together hahaha I don't know how to do
that but okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
