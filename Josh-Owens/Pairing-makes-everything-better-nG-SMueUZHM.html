talked about pair programming so i just
spent the day pair programming for a
couple hours with someone and it just
got me thinking like everything in life
is better when you have a pair of all
right and so she saw picked up a dog
back at Christmastime to as a running
partner which by the way when you get a
running dog make sure she can't get out
of the house but you know I just wanted
to talk a minute about pair programming
and I just think you know we're
inherently social creatures
today as a day felt infinitely better
than most days I spend coding alone on
my computer in my office and you know
working from home that's an even tougher
thing and it's not that you know I think
we don't get thirty percent better code
because we repair programming I think
that you know as a developer who's been
writing code for a long time working
with a developer who's been writing code
for you know an immediate a medium
amount of time it makes a difference the
amount of knowledge that I can give to
them or even they can give to me as
someone who's been doing this a long
time you know I think that we we do tend
to produce somewhat better code but at
the same time I think it makes the job
more enjoyable as well and I think
that's true of most things in life can
you play that by yourself no just one of
you know how is it a yeah you know you
can usually hack your way through
something and like I I value running and
exercise and doing things like that and
so getting a running dog was my way to
make it okay like I have to get out and
run and get this dog exercise otherwise
she's gonna be crazy in the house and no
one wants a 40 or 50 pound terror like
running around a tiny area because she
hasn't gotten enough exercise so I kind
of life hacked my way into going out and
running with her and I think that you
know if you if you haven't yet you
should try pair programming and if you
have tried it you should try to find a
way to do it you know at least once a
week I think it makes your life more
enjoyable
oh ha that was rough so I got a running
dog I try to do this every day later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
