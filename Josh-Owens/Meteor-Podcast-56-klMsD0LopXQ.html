welcome meteor fans i'm your host your
bearded host with the mostest beard i
guess josh owens along with my co-host
the unburied ride Walker nice back from
vacation land yeah you too right yeah
yeah this is a interesting vacation it's
nice to get away yeah my too well you
were you were just a little bit further
north i think than me yeah yeah you guys
went to uh where'd you go you went to
Hilton Head hilt me that's it yeah yeah
I think it's like so it's nice it was
kind of cool in the beginning of the
week and got a little bit warmer by the
end so it was a it was nice I liked it
nice yeah that place probably pretty
nice in the spring i know for me like
the one time I've been to hilton head
was in the summer like middle of july
hot as heck there man yeah i could
imagine yakka kind of steamy by the end
and it's only March or I guess was just
turning April but yeah yeah yeah I don't
know mine was weird like I had a client
demo that happened Monday and it was
supposed to be thursday while we're on
vacation and it worked out cuz i was in
charlotte the clients in charlotte and
then like I don't know like just just
wasn't enough done to be impressive so
we push it back and I was like furiously
working every night after the kids went
to bed so you know that's next but it
happen yep the life of freelancers I
guess that's right life is so feeding
yourself right indeed alright so this
week we are talking about meteor 11
tectonics shifting Facebook acquiring
meteor meteor polymer and no sequel
alright so yeah I don't know like it was
interesting because we went on we went
on vacation like right when all the big
me like this week's been kind of a slow
news week for a meteor but last week was
big yea though I pulled a couple stories
from last week too and the biggest one
being 1.1 came out you know like what a
day before
it was like march 30th or march 31st
they released it so I felt like they
were almost TNS up for april fools jokes
or something hmm yeah have you uh have
you used meteor 11 yet um I think I
think I think we are let me see I'm
pretty sure we're using it right now
yeah I mean what I mean we just hop
great whenever they come out now and we
haven't had no problems doing that
lately yeah like I feel like maybe
that's the the real story of this update
right like it for people that have been
using meteor like it's almost like
nothing happened you don't meet an
update and everything still works I
don't even I don't even notice mini SAT
right like that's probably a really good
thing yep yeah so cat release 1102 yeah
i'm using 11 hi yeah it's not even
thought yeah so I mean there's some big
things in here so if you haven't seen it
yet i'd highly recommend going and
watching the the mini SAT talk that
David ah David Greenspan gave yes
Greenspan I always get the David's mixed
up um and yeah that that's that's a
great talk and that got shipped in here
right so I think maybe if you were
running into weird edge case problems
with packages getting installed like
that should be completely resolved now
because they have an industrial-strength
constraint solver in place and that was
kind of cool too because the open source
solver was written in C++ but he used
like some kind of cross compiler to get
it to work with JavaScript hmm so I love
that was kind of cool in there
supporting 30 and 26 officially with
Mongo now so that's awesome I don't know
if they've gone in and done anything
specific that dogs are barking well if
they've done anything specific to wire
anything
430 I didn't look too closely there but
I know it works right and that's
interesting yeah and the people were
saying they were using meteor with 30
before that so maybe just officially
then flip that switch you know yeah
definitely well I think it was just more
like they tried it and it worked and
they probably spent a little more time
making sure nothing looked broken yeah
uh yeah so and then um I guess the
biggest thing was really something that
we don't care about which is Windows
support right these windows are forever
so yep yep I mean I think the two main
things were manga 3 and windows and i
don't know like it'll be interesting to
see how that affects the community uh
well so i don't know if you saw i think
it was either on the forum or tweet or
something but matt de Burgh Alice posted
something about the stats for like
developers connecting to i'm assuming
mediacom or something somehow they know
the machine that you're on when you
connect to atmosphere the package
manager somewhere and you know I it
looked like it you know as a it was like
a tripe I they're split into three
pieces and i don't know if i had to
guess i'd say like windows is like 25
percent of that pie ok yeah which is
that was pretty impressive that's what
was it before the released it was a
lower or they didn't say they didn't say
they didn't show like a growth or
anything yeah I mean I figure a lot of
Windows developers are probably using
all the windows developers are using
meteor through like a vm you know now
they don't have to do that so you know i
think it partially is just making it
more convenient for the year
people using meteor in windows already
yeah but should bring some more people
in that were let me be pissed off that
it was so so damn hard to use it before
you know for them yeah you know what's
interesting is I don't know that I had
someone emailed me today and he wanted
to know like you know have I deployed to
windows yet and like no actually I'm try
to build for windows like that's kind of
weird so he's like working on a Mac but
then he wants to deploy to a Windows
environment I got no idea man I'm sorry
good luck with that let me know if you
find a solution you say go to forum that
meteor ask it there yeah all right let's
do the next story alright next story we
are talking about tectonics or tectonic
to be more specific yeah so the tectonic
platform is a offering from core OS so
again this is pretty technical like that
I barely understand it the word Cooper
Nettie's is in this that makes the the
new story pretty fun that's a fun word
to say Cooper Nettie's is a oh god I
don't know what the hell how to describe
Cooper minis it's basically a way to
deal with lines Linux containers kind of
related docker I don't know if it
actually is daugher doctors inside of it
one of those I think docker docker can
run inside Cooper nice yeah yeah I got a
good Cooper nice tie if you want to find
out more about it but it's funny like I
keep hearing Cooper discriminate a screw
brat he's like all over the place and
it's but but basically core OS which is
they're launching a hosting platform
called tectonic that obviously leverages
Cooper Nettie's and is a kind of a
next-generation hosting platform so it's
a beta signup you didn't have you signed
up for the beta yet Josh I have not I'll
be honest like I have not played with
docker or honestly I'm and play with
core OS either or
today so yeah behind the times there
when I take a weekend and learn it but
yeah man oh I think that um modulus uses
core OS now and they actually hosted the
Cooper Nettie's talk here in Cincinnati
and so like they're doing some of this
stuff I don't know that they're using
cousin eddie's but they're released by
another using docker all over the place
now yeah so just like you know like
basically it's another way to do
deployment this platform you know a
could be a good option to host meteor I
don't know if anyone is yet considering
this is beta at this point but if you're
into that kind of stuff and hadn't heard
of this yet another option emerges and
actually Josh you have this big blog
post on how to host on meteor so I guess
you have to watch this and maybe add
this yeah yeah definitely so i just got
my-- my drip campaign set back up so
when you sign up for the mailing list
you know the uh i think the second or
third email that you get references the
blog post and so I've been getting a lot
of people replying and some of them are
like oh hey you know you should check
out docker you know play with this or
play with that you know check out
scaling go so I think I'm definitely
gonna have to like make that post bigger
and yeah definitely gonna learn some
there you got to add windows too that
right thumb day clearly not there yet I
mean the interesting part about this
this post to is like so core OS is a
company they just got a quietly Scott
invested the dave base is simultaneously
announced that they're doing this
hosting platform and they raised 12
million dollars from google ventures
together like that just that
announcement just happened as ironically
close to the amount of money that meteor
raised you know so I'm so every guy in
the first round yeah yeah so like so
there's um I don't know it's it's tricky
like actually during the talk I was
thinking about like how high the bar is
meteor for what they have to do with
galaxy because you have you don't have
to if they like catch up to lots of
stuff but you know like if it's not
better than tectonic would you use it
you know like so and I don't even know
what tectonic is but I know that he's
just pretty smart people buildings
probably some pretty sweet well I
think I think with galaxy you'll get a
little more hand-holding right like
everyone like the other thing I hear a
lot of is when people type meteor deploy
you know they're they're amazed at how
easy that is to deploy something and I
think they want to you know encapsulate
that into galaxies and they're using
doctrine and Cooper Netta's as well
under the hoods from what I've heard but
you know I definitely think they're
gonna try to bring that ease of
deployment and apply what they know
about hosting meteor itself to you know
kind of an automated environment that
people can use so yeah that's tricky i
mean like it has to be simple on the
surface yet um you know underneath the
surface yeah it's got it's got to be you
know auto scaling you know like like it
doesn't do auto scaling for example that
would be a mess in my boat you know like
um like if it's simple just like
automatically deal with my load you know
magically right yeah that's what i would
love to see from them so like the
simplest possible thing which you know
it's not it's not it's not that's
totally simple so anyways yeah meteor
hosting is a thing and we have another
entrant potentially in it someone should
try this out love to see a blog post
from somebody this upcoming week on how
they tested it oh yeah nice nice i bet a
bit airnet a turnout is the one that
posted this she's like is gonna be like
a galaxy killer he said something like
that i don't know yeah it's fine i don't
yeah and I don't even know if like you
can get into this yet it might be a big
waiting list so yeah yeah alright so
moving on Facebook acquiring meteor
that happened right yeah that totally
happened you know I I need to go back so
I wrote this post and it was like I was
on vacation and I was like man
tomorrow's April first I really I want
to do something funny related to meteor
cuz I've got a big community I think
they could pick out of it right and so I
started kicking around ideas and it was
like oh you should say something about
Microsoft buying meteor and then I'm
like well it's like obviously a joke if
I if I do that right and but I I think I
can scare a lot more people if I do like
Facebook acquiring media and so I
actually I didn't like deeply think it
out but then I started writing down all
the connections I knew happening between
media and Facebook and I was like oh
crap this is actually like a thing that
could happen this is weird yeah yeah i
don't know like so Marc Andreessen is on
the board of Facebook and he's also I
know if he's on the board it at meteor
but he's definitely like deleting Buster
and he sits down when they come in hey
it talks to them you know so that's kind
of weird and then they've hired ben
newman from facebook to work at meteor
and he's into the pushing forward the
the new ECMO es6 standards and trying to
get all that working with meteor as well
and so yeah they were just there were a
lot of connections and you know I I try
to at least be funny with some of the
quotes and whatnot and I emailed um Matt
ahead of time and I'm like well I just
want to give you a heads up i think the
way to do this would it make you guys
really mad he's like well it might be
awkward because we might have to like
say something to people like we're not
really being acquired yeah buddy what
happen did it anyway I did I did it you
know I wrote the thing and it was funny
and I kept just trying to make it
funnier and I don't know it was it was a
lot of fun so did you did you fool some
people oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah you
should totally check out the the
comments on this thing
good one guy posted a comment and it's
just a picture of a bunny going now
everyone's like oh my god I was so
scared then I sell it was joke yeah yeah
um but then I kid you not I was in a
meeting this week and someone's like
they're telling me like I thought I saw
my feet like Facebook just a choir media
yeah yeah people don't see it on the
first day yeah so now I gotta let go put
like a joke in the title and oh that's
funny yeah that's like so speaking of
april fools day and all right every at
you are you in on reddit much gosh yeah
another launch any more like people got
annoyed that i was like posting crater
stuff to read it so like after I stopped
doing that I stopped hanging out there
as much see you excommunicate yourself
yeah I guess so so on in april fools day
they had this they have this thing
called the button have you seen that
like if you're not paying attention to
read it you might not see that but like
there's this there was a button it was
just a do you know what i'm talking
about it all no I have no idea alright
alright so then there's the button and
it's just basically a button that's like
if you press it the timer reset to 60
seconds and it's just counting down
right anyone knows what the button does
600,000 people have pressed the button
you get like you get flare like
different color like if you're in 50 to
60 seconds you know you're a purple and
then you know your blue if you're in the
next tenth and this has been going on
since april fools day and like people
are like what's that you know like what
is this the button it I thought I was
just like an April Fool's Day joke but
now it's like I don't know what how many
days are we 10 days later it still
hasn't hit 60 seconds like so somebody
press that button and that's my other
big April Fool's Day thing and now it's
like still an obsession like so I go
there all the time and watch watch the
countdown and nice nice check that out
if you guys haven't seen that it's a
pretty crazy internet phenom yeah you
know and there were some funny ones I
heard about
like BMW put an ad in the paper that
said like bring in your car and your
keys and your you know we'll we'll take
it as trade in and give you a brand new
in a fifty-thousand-dollar BMW and so
like you know everyone probably reads it
goes ahaha April first whatever yeah
really took it in and you know gave him
gave them her old beater and they gave
her what wasn't a joke yeah jokes on
everyone else oh man and then did you
see the the dash button from amazon no
that came out april fools as well April
first and like it's this button that you
can put somewhere like you put it next
to your laundry machine and it's just a
tide button and when you hit it it uses
your local internet to order more tied
straight off Amazon bout yo ya valio Ted
is it actually work yeah yeah it's a
legit thing apparently just they
released it on April first yeah that's
funny yeah that it there's somebody else
released a product on April first in the
past I was reading about this Jessica
was in that anyway yeah that's pretty
good stuff all right let's go the next
story we're so far off topic now if we
are able Fool's Day facebook acquires
media video polymer let's talk about
meteor polymer so this is kind of cool
this is um you know as you know i'm
using polymer day today with user cycle
and yeah this this product list um else
it's a package yeah i consider the
package at this package lets you use
pure polymer on the front end instead of
blaze in space bars which you know we
thought about this like that would be
kind of an interesting world versus like
mixing it together you know it's it
always feels to me wrong but mix blaze
and some other big front end you know
and so blazed plus polymer equals lots
of overlap right place plus reacties
lots of overlap place plus angular is
overlap so this strips out blaze and
space bars and use these pure polymer on
the front end which would be similar
like using pure reacts with a meteor
back end the problem with that is
like there's they're probably some
components that eat one of some polymer
components that you'd want to use
because the polymer way of getting to
data is through a component you know
like that's the way that that's the way
it works so that's kind of the data
pattern so I don't know who this is dan
John Johann I don't know Johann cormoran
Oh Maron I'm Sweden he actually is using
our differential woken eyes package
which does some of the work but he's
he's actually gone ahead and implemented
a system where you can just use pure
polymer front-end meteor back end and
I'm gonna test this out i mean we're
pretty far down the road on user cycle
so I wouldn't like do this but it's kind
of interesting to see how so the cool
thing about like using pure polymer
front end is it's literally a static
website so you can host it like on a CDN
you know well you know that's an
interesting point though because when
you think about meteor it is technically
a static website as well right yeah
because the law it is is HTML j/s and
CSS and then it makes a DDP connection
back to start pulling data yep and
that's basically what this does but
obviously without any of the blaze the
thing is like polymer has loop you know
it has a lot of the same stuff that
blaze has it has the same admit they're
pretty slim to be there kind of similar
they're just different you know one's a
HTML standard one's kind of JavaScript
framework but well so i guess the weird
part right and this is this is a weird
thing for me to with react it looks like
down here he's got like meteor status
media collection meteor subscribe these
look like HTML tags that you put in and
you use those and i don't know that that
seems weird to me that's something you
have to understand the polymer way to
understand how this stuff works you know
well i remember the days of you know
putting my database queries in my PHP
templates i don't remember liking that I
don't
well this is more of like a component
that creates the functionality like like
you don't you don't just include
JavaScript tags they're JavaScript files
in polymer you include a component that
would include the JavaScript for you you
know I mean yeah so the idea is like I
guess the theory would be in an office
if it'll work but the theory would be
with polymer is that like there are
people who design components and then
there are the the commoners who use
components you know and then just can
compose an app from all these things you
know that's the whole compromise of
components well I mean you can use
component the modular as your code to
but if you're kind of a lower level
developer with a few polymer tags you
can turn a otherwise completely static
site into a into site with some
functionality like I always like to use
the idea of like a mailchimp form like
you could have a mailchimp tag that does
a little bit of JavaScript that
MailChimp gives you you know we're
Google Analytics like most websites have
like Staten like static websites have
just a little bit of interactivity like
a forum or a Google form or something
like that that just requires a little
bit of programming but so so I don't
know I think that um it is definitely
weird the polymer is a different
different thing than all the other
things because everything's done with
HTML tags all functionality is added and
configured with that so unless you're
building a component which case you have
straight-up javascript inside that yeah
so anyway that's it's something worth
checking out of your your mess around
with polymer and it's still very early
and year maybe I mean I just probably
there aren't too many like pure polymer
developers I wouldn't think in the world
yet but if you happen to be one of those
and you stumble across meteor this would
be very cool for you yeah yeah but yeah
all right um and one other note I I I
think next week we'll talk about it but
there was a there was a release called
blaze components so it's a package
can dive into that next week man these
trains like training got there yeah
we've hit an all-time high during the
show I think um all right so the last
story here is uh no sequel injection and
why you should stop allowing that to
happen so you know I think everybody
knows about the maybe they don't the
audit argument package which has audit
argument checks as what is called and
it's got this little method that you can
use on the server side called check and
so this is from Peter or peep Corey
sorry um wrote this and he's been
putting out little blog posts are pretty
good i like this one and he just he
talks through the fact that usually you
know we think about the meteor methods
and we put the audit argument checks
there but you know you need to do it on
your publish functions as well and you
need to make sure that what's getting
passed in is what it's what you think it
is right so for instance if you want
someone to send along a string to do a
search you know they're going to say
they want to search for you know green
beans in your local marketplace app and
you want to return all the green beans
let's say you take that as part of your
publication as an argument there well uh
someone can send along an object instead
right just a little json looking object
javascript object that has you know
dollar sign greater than equal with an
empty string and all of a sudden it's
just going to send everything back from
your database so you thought you were
being secure in reality uh Joe script
kiddie there just got your entire
database and pulled a linkedin on you or
something and exposing everyone's
passwords who knows well um so yeah I
mean just you just install this package
and then in the publication function you
just run a check and you check that that
variable is a string rather than an
object and that should keep you
relatively safe
yeah I'm trying to think are you explode
or any of your apps exposed for this I
need the programming you would have done
me no not at all like I'm always secure
right yeah like I took a second there
like what like our is this something
that affects everybody like is this
something I should be reading and like
changing some issues i'm adding this if
you're if you're in production you
should definitely have audit argument
check in pais yeah that's is that the
only ok so the audit autoart I salute
you think argument to say use that
package yeah and I I'm pretty sure such
a great read me on this guy um this
package is empty its presence is
detected by live data oh that's
interesting they just look for the
package in live data but the code all
lives in live data so I'm pretty sure
like it'll throw you an error or warning
or something if you're not using check
calls and you have this package
installed I'd say cause everywhere it
should warn you at least about that and
then you know this to me he goes hand in
hand with the last podcast we did we
talked about the the browser policy as
well um I think we had someone yeah
Richie filled in for you last time but
that's another good one too you know
like you should install that and
configure it because superfish was
trying to insert things onto that idina
page when viewed when viewers went there
and so if you didn't listen to that
episode you should go back and listen
and understand like what that package
will do for you as well but that's good
so there's a check package in meteor
than the audit arguments check just
checks to make sure you're using the
check package to check your stuff sure
it makes sure that you have check calls
wherever you have methods taking
arguments on the server yeah has a bad
read me yeah this is a literal meteor
package yeah and glasser is gonna take
the credit for the bad read because
he's the last guy that touched it it
looks like i'm adding that I mean we are
you doing checks on our methods but am i
doing it everywhere I'm not sure I just
added the audit argument tracks right
here live on the broadcast yeah I mean
it'll it'll yell at you if you're not
using them so yeah yeah that's good it's
awesome all right all right guys uh so
this week we haven't had a lot of patron
activity um plan it up now see if I can
get there fast it's only 80 clicks to
get in here yeah actually am at em and
Wade and Peter and I think Devon I think
Devin's new um all those guys have
joined in the last week or so so that's
been awesome that slack chat room is
going like gangbusters now what are you
up to now ah there are like let's see 33
patrons total and there are some other
people in the slack chat room as well
and yeah i don't know like it's it's
been awesome to watch because a guy
literally josh came in there last week
two weeks ago and he was just starting
to learn meteor was a PHP dev and within
a week he like built a full functional
app that was like outputting PDFs and
invoicing people and all kinds of stuff
in yeah just he was asking a lot of
questions in there and a lot of people
were helping so it was kind of awesome
lunch yeah yeah so I just real quick I
got to tell you the story I think we
made mention this lopaka for Bruno dove
of the visa tea that we show the office
with yeah yeah he released he released
an atmosphere package what that happened
avicii released an atmosphere package
yes yes he so if you don't seal its
atmosphere attempt it flora he parted
listen to the podcast but maybe does
atmosphere Jess dev Rosenberg / ad hoc
reporter so he's built building like a
reporter package that you do some
configuration and
lets you like get reports from the manga
database similar like how sales force
has an ad hoc reporter this could
actually be useful to people um Wow and
if you go look check us read me it's
it's legit it's better read me present
I've ever made so so's it's just
outputting the data it looks like it's
outputting actual HTML here right yeah
yeah i think so i don't know if it does
if it does any yeah i guess that we
should have put this song as an official
topic i just thought of it as you
mentioned newbies cooking assam meteor
yeah check check out maybe we'll talk
about next week a week and uh yeah i
want to install it he asked me to
install and i haven't done it yet yeah
installing get a screenshot like let's
get a screenshot in this really mean
that'd be awesome I told him are you
ready to co-host the podcast because I
think you are nice yeah anyway alright
man alright I'll talk to you yeah thanks
for tuning in guys we'll see you next
week all right yeah this video has been
