crater remote cough mobile edition this
talk focuses on building mobile apps
using javascript you can find out more
information about upcoming crater remote
coughs at conf crater i/o enjoy the talk
so our first finger is Bonnie eisenmann
and she has actually written a book on
learning react native and so we've had
her on the space dojo show before and
I'm pretty excited she's gonna tell us
about the impact of react native so
welcome Bonnie hey good morning all
right well I'll let you get into the
talk ok sounds good thanks so much for
having me here um so hi everyone I'm
going to turn on screen sharing so you
can see my slides um ok so let's get
started so before we begin um I just
wanted to tell you a little bit more
about myself so you know where I'm
coming from I'm a software engineer at
Twitter New York and I've been doing
stuff with react and with react native
for a little while now and it's stuff
that I am really excited about really
interested in and so as you've already
heard i'm the author of learning react
native which is a book published by
o'reilly that came out in early 2016 so
i've been sending a lot of time thinking
about how react native can be great for
mobile availment if you have more
questions you can follow up with me on
twitter i'm at fern dell and that's
probably the best place to reach me so
let's let's hard today i said i was
going to talk to you all about the
impact of react native and I know that
this conference is focused on mobile and
there's a strong focus on react native
but I want to talk about sort of how
react native can fit into the bigger
mobile ecosystem right in what context
did it emerge and how does it change the
way we think about mobile development
why does it matter so in order to talk
about that we have to start by talking
about mobile in general and so I'm going
to rewind a little bit if we skip back a
couple years this is a graph
and I want showing different amounts of
time spent on the screens right by
device type so I want to draw your
attention first and foremost to 9014
because 2014 is when we reach this
really interesting tipping point if
you've been doing mobile dev you're
probably pretty convinced that mobile
matters that mobile is important but
this is where we sort of start getting
data to really back that up so this is
these are just numbers for the u.s.
obviously that's a small segment of the
global market but it's fairly
representative in terms of smartphone
usage and starring in 2014 we see that
mobile is now taking up the majority of
people's screen time not counting the
television right so more than desktop
and what this means that mobile is
really the primary screen where your
users are at it's not like this weird
little stepchild of a platform but you
know you might worry about you really
need to be mobile first not in the
cliched form of that term but like
seriously if you want your business to
succeed so Mobile is now the primary
screen for our users this is super
important and yet mobile development is
really hard mobile development is a much
younger field than traditional desktop
based software development there's a lot
of stuff going on that is not quite
ideal um so if we think about how mobile
development traditionally works
traditionally with air quotes right this
is a pretty new stuff there's a lot of
platform specific arcana so if you're
working on iOS you need to be learning
objective-c or Swift which came out in
june 2014 if you're on android you need
to be learning Java but even beyond just
the language you need to be spending a
ton of time focusing on the intricacies
of how these platforms work what they're
api's are all this stuff and you're
going to build up a lot of deep
expertise and yet that knowledge is
really siloed so if you're a senior iOS
developer you probably don't really
collaborate with senior android
developers you probably don't share that
knowledge you probably don't have a lot
of crosstalk and for businesses
especially or for anyone who wants to
have their app available on iOS Android
and mobile web this means that you do a
ton of extra work you basically have to
build your app three times and I don't
know about you but I find programming
interesting when I'm building new things
not when I am just
copy pasting essentially functionality
and that duplicated effort can really
really feel like you're just burning
cash um it's not ideal nobody really
likes the setup but and again taking the
lens if if we look at the state of
mobile development 2014 there's not a
ton of great alternatives so you know
there are some there's some prior work
in this field of people trying to make a
global development better we heard for a
while people talking about html5 as the
great thing right because we already
know how to make awesome web apps with
HTML and JavaScript and all this so why
don't we just bring the web to phone
which leads to one of my favorite quotes
this is from 2012 from Zuckerberg saying
that the biggest mistake we've made as a
company is betting on html5 / native so
this is at a point where mobile web is
like this great idea in theory but what
we see is that there's like it's just
not there right it doesn't deliver the
same experience to our consumers and
mobiles the primary screens we have to
have a top-of-the-line experience for
them and so html5 doesn't work and there
are some attempts across platform
development we get into that suck but
now if we skip ahead to react off so
this is the first react conference it
takes place in January 2015 at Facebook
HQ in California when Facebook announces
this thing called react native so
remember we're stepping from their first
attempts at trying to bring the web to
mobile and failing by their own execs
account to this new thing called react
native and wrote what react and promises
us is that it's going to try and solve
these problems with mobile development
so it claims that you're going to be
able to learn months and write anywhere
once you learn how to use react native
you'll be able to write on iOS and
Android and you'll be able to do that in
JavaScript using the react framework and
which is the real kicker it says that
you're going to get native level
performance this is the Holy Grail right
people would love to be able to write
the same code have it run on iOS and
Android to be able to work as one
instead of three separate developer
silos this would be great and this is
what react native is promising again
we're sitting in the beginning of 2015
hear the audience reacts the audience
gets really really excited this is a big
big claim and I was talking to one of
the team members at that currents and I
don't remember who but someone said to
me you know it's not interesting that
we're trying this what'll matter is if
we get it right and this is very true um
there's a lot of prior work here but all
the prior work has sort of been plagued
by a couple of problems um so type train
kicks off but we've tried this before
and cross-platform mobile development
whether we're talking about like Cordova
or titanium or xamarin or there's a
bunch of other existing frameworks that
I've tried to do these things there's
sort of some persistent problems so
keeping up with API changes is hard what
happens when the underlying OS updates
and suddenly things are a bit different
how quickly can you respond to breaking
changes can you keep up with mobile
level performance what about your
animations your look and feel do you
have to mimic those or can you leverage
the real ones what about your developer
experience right like is it actually
going to take me 10 times as long as a
compile my app because now I have this
really complicated tool chain can I use
existing third-party libraries how does
all of that work and I think in practice
it's a slow accumulation of things being
just not quite good enough that keeps a
large number of people from adopting
existing cross-platform mobile
development solutions so these are the
things that we should always be keeping
an eye on when someone promises us
cross-platform mobile development right
these are some of the things that are
the easiest to screw up the harder
problems to solve so what's different
this time right why do people actually
think that react native scans gems so
react happens reacts the JavaScript
framework for writing you eyes happens
to have this really nice feature which
is called the virtual Dom so when
something changes what you do is you
tell react that something has changed in
your application Rex is okay cool it
computes how your app should render
differently based on it and it builds
that representation up in memory and
then it rear enders it to the browser
doll so there's this very clean
separation in react between how you tell
react your application should look and
then the actual work of rendering it so
you have this super clean abstraction
layer which means of course that you
don't need to render to the Dom at all
and react native it literally just works
by taking reacts internal representation
of how your application should look and
then interacting with the actual native
AP is on iOS or Android or whatever
other platform you're on um and you know
this might sound like a little bit vague
and like why do you really care about
the plumbing underneath of it but this
is actually the key to why react native
has been able to tackle those really big
problems right because we're no longer
doing what a lot of other solutions do
which is take a webview maybe add some
custom hooks on top of it but
fundamentally expect you to write a
website and package it as a nap we're
also not forcing you to use some totally
different tool chain react native just
uses the mobile platforms actual
JavaScript engine to do the react bit if
your code and then it's got this bridge
and the bridge has to have as much SD
kick coverage as possible to try and
communicate between say iOS and Android
late layout api's and reacts internal
representation alright and what we get
from this is that react native is
actually native and the abstractions we
used to talk about the different layers
of your app should actually be
understandable by any developer working
with react native even if you've never
touched objective-c before even if he's
never touched Java before you shouldn't
have to go into those languages but you
can read them when you need to you don't
get boxed in by the limitations of the
framework you can actually dip down and
write native code if you have to so this
is a huge promise right it's a big idea
and Facebook releases react native on
github early as an alpha release to
everyone who attended that conference
and again it's not interesting that
they're claiming that they'll be able to
do this what matters is really how does
it actually work and this is sort of an
era in which
the hype train is building so people
pass around flash drives with the react
native source code and invite each other
to try it cuz originally they only give
access see you know a few hundred people
when that does not last very um and so I
was actually at a time and software
engineer at Codecademy and we had had
our designer is sort of spec out what a
quiz app might look like if we decide to
say build flashcards to go along with
the course um and so what you can see on
here is on the left is the design walk
provided and on the right is an iOS app
running in a simulator so I decided to
take two days at codecademy and see how
far I could get as an engineer with
plenty of experience with react um and
having done you know some professional
iOS and Android development but not a
lot and not actually making use of that
knowledge at all how far could I get in
two days and the answer was surprisingly
far in two days I made a mock flashcard
app that actually you know worked and
rendered in this super new super janky
library and I've been released and at
the time I wrote about it and I said you
know this feels just like web
development but it's targeting a
different platform and this I think was
for me really key because when I had
done other kinds of app development
before it always felt very frustrating
right you want to change one pixel so
you have to rebuild your entire
application so you wait a full 20
minutes then you have to go talk to the
person who's working on the other
platform and try and get an update it
when you're working with react native
you save your code you hit refresh and
you watch in this emulator as the
updates populate that is huge and
especially if you've already done web
development you're going to find that
react native feels very very comfortable
it's really similar um and so Facebook
releases this thing they give it to us
it gets fully open source and what we
see is that people slowly start to poke
at it and try to assess whether or not
it actually meets their needs is this
thing for real and so you know people
basically spend a few months tinkering
with it attempting to do things with it
trying to figure out if it's a good fit
and then September we start to see
lot of talking about it as people slowly
start to post publicly about these
things so few of my favorites this is
screenshot of a meme article by clay
Alsop called react native in production
and react native helped us ship crucial
features in less time and immediately
increase the percentage of our team that
contributes iOS code that's his
assessment of it and I believe that he's
talking about the team at palantir so
this is pretty awesome right like that
right there that is indeed the entire
sales pitch in one sentence keep in mind
at this point recognize just for iOS
they haven't released android yet um we
also get iOS developers who initially go
why why on earth would I want javascript
in my code base do we still get a lot of
iOS developers who are very curious
about this new thing we want to know
people are talking about who try it out
um and surprisingly we get some pretty
good feedback right so in this article
the quote is fast forward a couple of
months and I'm confident enough to say I
may never write an iOS app an objective
C or Swift again so react native is
really winning people over it's doing
this mostly because it's really fast to
work in and because react is really nice
to work in right for the same reasons
that reacts is sort of won over a lot of
people with JavaScript people like the
way that you structure could with it
people like the way it solves problems
um we also finally get to the Android
release and so this is sort of the big
turning point right if you really
believe that react native is going to
help you write cross-platform
applications it needs to be
cross-platform not just a theory but in
practice um so Android release drops at
the time I was working on the book um
when I had built a application as sort
of the capstone project for the book and
had built it with the iOS version of
react native um and I tweeted out at the
time that I had built to react native
app for iOS before the Android release
and then I updated react native and the
Android build worked on the first try r
ag- is probably the only time I've used
a framework where you can accidentally
right across flat for application that's
a pretty magical moment and
I think it's hard to overstate how
important that is when you use react
native you don't really have to think
about your platform you can and if you
want to really get into the detailed
interactions you probably should um but
there's something awesome about being
able to say hey I'm going to write a
mobile app and it's going to behave like
a mobile app and expect it to work so
that was a really exciting moment and so
if we look back at what react native is
promising it's claiming that we're going
to be able to learn months and write
anywhere that we'll be able to write
JavaScript that runs on both iOS and
Android and that will get native level
performance um and so again September
2015 after Android comes out it looks
like we're arrived right you can use the
same knowledge base you have with react
native for iOS and apply it directly to
react native for Android you can use the
same code base you get native level
performance react native is actually
invoking native API is instead of
mimicking them so what you get is
actually almost equivalent to developing
on you know mobile in the traditional
way sure there are occasional
complications but in general it's pretty
great um and so it starts look with
correct native has actually met this
promise and if we skip ahead to the
present day now I want to talk about
where we stand so first of all react
native is on far far far more platforms
so we see from the last conference we
heard that Microsoft was announcing
windows support on react native and also
that Samsung was going to support it on
there ther platform so you can now write
rec- for your Smart TVs for your Windows
laptops and windows phones for your xbox
all the stuff is coming um and this is
really really cool we also get
over-the-air updates so you know react
native is a JavaScript thing your
application can be represented largely
or entirely in JavaScript and so what we
start to see is that you can actually
just ship a new job
javascript bundle and update your app
without going through the App Store
review process um if you've done iOS
development before this is huge the iOS
review process typically on a good day
if the fortunes are right if you
sacrificed the right God's takes two
weeks or less um but that's still a
pretty long turnaround time especially
if you have like you know major
deadlines that you're pushing up against
um over-the-air updates with react
native meaning that you can just ship
your code updates whenever you want um
and it's still people are trying to
figure out the best and safest ways to
do this in production but there's been a
proliferation of it comes to do so if
you need assistance with like building a
framework to do this easily exponent and
code push are both popular options um
stuff like this starts to crop up all
around react native basically what we
see is that because we've got all of
these nice clean ways of separating out
different pieces of your apps
functionality we're no longer just
thinking in terms of like how the iOS
platform or how the Android platform
encourages you to write apps starts to
become okay so what happens if I can
actually write my app however i watch um
and that's really cool again from clay
Alsop we have another medium article um
react native really really starts to
take off um and so this chart is I think
super interesting it's a google trends
chart looking at interest in react
native versus iOS development and you
know iOS development surges up after you
know you can start right here on iOS
apps around 2010 but doesn't stay is
pretty steady but react native has
actually surpassed it which is
fascinating to me because I know that
mobile development is a place that lots
of people come to you as their first
introduction to programming because they
have an idea and they want to make it
into reality enough people are hearing
about react native that it's actually
surpassing that um and this is huge this
means that people are more interested in
react native than they are in
traditional development like what do we
do with that right what are we supposed
to make up up and
looking back at the chart I showed you
in the beginning of this talk on you can
see that time spent on screens we're
talking about mobile we're talking about
desktops and laptops for talking about
other devices whether that's your apple
SmartWatch or whatever and also TVs and
now react native is actually on all of
these platforms you can write react
native for iOS or Android or Windows
Phone you can write it for xbox you can
write it for smart TVs you can even use
react native web to write it for you
know desktop web which is sort of an
astonishing ouroboros moment of wow like
we've come full circle um but this is
really great and it's also worth noting
that you know just because you can use
react name for all these things doesn't
mean you have to have total qadri's um
you can if you want you're probably not
going to want to but because react
native is flexible enough you know you
can have you know typically eighty to
ninety five percent code reefs and then
tailor the rest of it um so now we have
a common sort of lingua franca for
talking about how we want to build user
interfaces and user interactions how we
want to build out our business logic
around these applications we don't have
to just think about these as separate
silos where you know we have to hire
dedicated developers to address the
needs of every one of these platforms um
so that is pretty pretty large and so if
we look at where things are now people
have written bridges that take react
natives representation of things and
port them to other platforms iOS and
Android are the ones that are officially
supported by the core react native team
but you know now we have Microsoft to
supporting windows and Samsung with kids
on we also have from the open source
community react native web which is at
this point very robust my colleague
Nicholas calibre works on that one we
also have react native for OSX desktop
for writing desktop applications which
to me is really really cool right
there's no reason why we shouldn't be
able to write desktop applications um
and again a lot of ways with the
popularity of rich web apps desktop is
sort of falling to the side but what if
you could take that same skill set
and really easily spin up like native
apps for OSX or for windows this is huge
and so at this point working with react
native is mostly just like working with
react for web you write very similar
code you write views instead of dudes
and you write images instead IMG tags
but mostly it's the same thing if you
don't already know free apps for web
you're going to want to know it to learn
it before you do react native work
because you're still going to be using
react um it also gives us a standardized
styling API which is awesome if you've
done work with iOS or Android before and
their layout api's you probably are not
the biggest fan um grande native
implements a subset of CSS which you
know has its pros and cons but it tries
to implement just the amount that you
need keeps you from creating any really
terrible foot guns um it uses flexbox
for positioning from everything you can
use absolute positioning if you want um
but in general it gives you a very sane
simple styling API and it means that you
only have to learn that one styling API
in order to work across all these
platforms it also gives you a native
performance up and feel because it's
actually invoking the underlying API
calls depending on which platform you're
on so you get the same like icon bounces
and drawer opening animations and all
this stuff that you expect to see on iOS
or Android or whatever platform which is
so nice you don't have to mimic things
in JavaScript you can choose to mimic
animations in JavaScript if you really
want to um but for the most part you're
going to want to take advantage of that
need fluffle stuff as much as you can
you also get full API access so that's
stuff like the camera roll or local
storage and even better you're not
limited to what the framework provides
you so if you decide that there's an API
that you really need that's not part of
react native core yet you can write your
own little piece of the bridge and it
doesn't it's not actually hugely dodging
to do so incorporating it into your app
is actually a very common thing that
we'll end up doing um if you've never
done native mobile development for that
might sound a little bit scary but you
know what if you really want that neat
new Bluetooth API or something like that
um I include a chapter in my book
explaining the basics of how to go about
doing that and taking a look at some
real code samples that handle this um I
think that this is really important
because yes react native is a
cross-platform mobile framework but you
should be able to understand your tools
and you should be able to extend them um
cool and then the other thing which is
awesome is that you get this faster
development process so like I said
earlier it's very iterative you save
your code you look at the simulator if
you have real I've live reload turned on
ah that's all you have to do you just
save your code and the app instantly
refreshes and then you can check out all
of your new stuff um and again we are
now on a ton of different platforms
which means that you're not limited to
just your one development silo so all of
us is to say that react native is a
shiny new toy basically right and at
this point is definitely ready for
production use which is one of the top
questions I get it offers a really
compelling business case over the
current status quo you're going to save
way more than 3x the development cost of
just eliminating the triplicated effort
between Android iOS and web um you can
actually move a lot faster and react
native even if your developers are
fairly new to it then you traditionally
would on a mobile platform um we're also
starting to see some interesting stuff
and this in particular I wanted to dwell
on for you folks set at creative comp
because I think it speaks to some
broader trends so the angular folks
actually ported angular 2 to work with
react native this feels a little bit
like in everything in the kitchen sink
approach and some people are like why
did you make this awful chimera but I
actually think this is kind of excellent
so what they did is I took react native
right which includes the bridge and this
this little blue bit here the bridge
jsapi is the react native portion
that translates JavaScript to native
code and they use the react native
renderer but then they also stuck in the
angular 2 cor there and wrote an angular
app um and this is people ask them like
why on earth would you like put angular
and react like that just seems like
twice the overhead um actually
fantastically I think it's not so react
native doesn't have to be about react
and that's sort of this like little
kernel of insight that I think we're
going to see a lot more people poke at
you can totally use the react native
JavaScript renderer and then go off and
write your JavaScript application
however you want um so I think we're
going to see more things like this um so
that's sort of what's been going on in
the world of react native it's been a
year and a half since the framework was
released and so now we've got a couple
questions the first one I want to ask is
so what is react native even at this
point and there's a couple stories that
Patel here um so the first story is one
that we used to hear para did an awful
lot um and I think is probably the
dominant way that a lot of people look
at react native which is that react
native is a framework it lets you build
native quality iOS and Android
applications with JavaScript and react
this is true this this statement is
definitely true I will stand by the
native quality bit I know a ton of
companies that are using react native in
production shipping it to actual
consumers so this is definitely like
this is the pitch this is the promise
and I think that it has totally been met
but then we've also got a slightly more
complicated story and which is why I
brought the angular thing where react
native sits on top of iOS and Android
yes but also all of these other
platforms including platforms that don't
look anything like mobile like say your
television um and then normally we would
put react as the layer on top of react
native but actually you can really put
whatever JavaScript framework you want
as long as
someone does a little bit of work to
port it there and then you build your
application on top of that so if we look
back at you know iOS and Android apps
with react how does that fit into this
model right and the answer is that it
doesn't have to you can use react native
basically just as a lingua franca this
doesn't have to be about mobile
development this doesn't have to be
about react specifically this is a more
general design pattern so the second
story that we could tell is that Rick
native is about neither mobile noir
react um and you know both of these
stories are actually true it's
simultaneously react native is about
mobile and reacts as the core use case
the whole reason why it exists the its
entire purpose but it's also about
something bigger so if you look at the
react native website these days it's
very interesting they've changed their
marketing speak um now they'll tell you
that react native is about developer
efficiency across all the platforms you
care about learn once right anywhere um
if you handed me a framework that had
this tagline I would look at you and say
that I had no idea what it did nothing
about this tells me that i could use
react native to write excellent ios and
android apps nothing about this tells me
that react native uses javascript um and
yet i think that this is a pretty clear
vision um and i think it's a very
admirable vision rag native is focusing
on developer efficiency across platforms
so in other words it's all the things
right which is simultaneously really
exciting and also really useless um it's
great that we can use your acne tip
everywhere but why do we care um so a
year and a half out I think that the
awesome thing is that react native has
proven the cord use case right um we've
definitely seen that you can use it to
write excellent mobile apps it has sort
of one in the sense that interest in it
is definitely starting to rival interest
in traditional iOS and Android
development and now we're starting to
think bigger so we should have great
mobile developer experiences as mobile
dubs this is a thing that we should
expect to have
but what I think the broader vision of
react native speaks to is that we should
be thinking about this in terms of great
developer experiences just because we're
mobile developers doesn't mean that we
shouldn't be looking at the broader
programming ecosystem I'm a huge fan of
looking at what other people are doing
taking the awesome parts and stealing it
I you know imitation is a great
compliment um and so I think what a lot
of us is about is looking outside of
your own garden right we talked about
walled gardens in mobile fairly often um
I think that react native is a good
example of saying hey hey what if we
weren't all just playing in our own
plots of land what can we do how much
faster can we move if we all actually
step outside of that a little bit and
get going um so what do we actually need
for good mobile developer experiences
there's some stuff that we need and then
there's some stuff that I think is just
gravy it's stuff that might attracts to
something but i think it's ultimately a
little bit of a distraction so when it
comes to cross platform application
development i think that you know goals
like a hundred percent code reuse or
getting to use a specific javascript
framework or specific way of writing
code things like over-the-air updates
all of these are nice all of these are
wonderful and delicious and stuff that i
would love to have you know i like using
reckon aided because i like using react
um but i think that they ultimately are
distractions from sort of what the core
appeal of a framework like react native
could be so like what do we actually
need when it comes to how we write our
code native level performance that's one
that we can't compromise on remember
that mobile is our primary screen that
means it's our primary driver for our
customers and our users so look and feel
and animations are actually like very
very core business concerns right your
users should be delighted by the things
that you give them we need faster
development cycles so there is a clear
payoff to being able to track ideas more
quickly to being able to experiment and
new features we're
move features test things out this is
all stuff that we actually I think
should consider like a very core concern
and then the one that reckoning of males
is cross-platform knowledge and
principles so instead of focusing on
total code reuse instead focusing
instead I think that we should focus on
building tools that let us take our
skills and migrate across platforms um
we don't need Toto code views maybe
ninety percent is actually enough um and
yes you can get a hundred percent with
react native but really it's not the
point so I guess a couple takeaways I
think that it's been awesome to watch
react native grow and develop and see it
become a tool that solves some serious
problems for a lot of people it is i
think a hugely useful useful thing to
have but also we're not done yet um one
thing that i'm hoping to see in the rest
of this conference is how people step
forward from here because there's no
actual reason why an approach like react
native needs to be coupled to react for
example you can substitute in your own
JavaScript framework whatever um there's
also no reason why we need to think
about this is purely the domain of
mobile dev now we're talking about more
what if we lifted mobile dev into a
world where we had to share the graph
ronca um so yeah there's a lot of work
left to be done I do not think that
react native is going to be the be-all
end-all and I think that that is
excellent I do not think that react is
the final form of the JavaScript
framework and I think that that is
excellent we're going to get to a lot
more stuff than we're going to get to do
a lot more so on that note I hope that
the rest of the conference is going to
go awesomely I am really looking forward
to hearing what the rest of people have
to say omn thanks so I'm going to pop
over now and answer whatever questions
you have in the Q&amp;amp;A section but also if
you want to follow up with me i'm on
twitter at up window and you can find my
book at bit ly / learning react native
thank you and now brief word from our
sponsors before you see the rest of the
talk ray gun spend more time building
great software and
time fighting it Regan helps keep a
watchful eye on your web and mobile
applications and tells you when problems
arise you can learn more at Reagan com
native script back by telerik by
progress is an open source framework for
building truly native mobile apps with
typescript and angular to use your web
skills to get native UI and performance
on iOS and Android enjoy the rest of the
talk alright thanks Bonnie that was
awesome yeah thank you for having me
yeah alright let's shall we see what
questions are yet yeah definitely so uh
I'll read them off and ask you and then
you can answer as we're going through
them I'm actually gonna I'll take my
question first so I'm kind of curious I
didn't mention but you actually work as
an engineer at Twitter correct mmhmm
yeah it's great so you mentioned that
you had a colleague there that was
working on react native web I believe
are you working with him are you guys
using react and react native and like
can you talk about that at all sure so
my colleague actually wrote react native
web I think he's the Box possibly the
sole contributor that project or this
main one um so I actually don't do
javascript stuff at all or mobile stuff
at Twitter i'm a back-end software
engineer doing distributed systems which
is always a little bit funny um but
Twitter does news react and pretty
seriously so the mobile web client you
might have noticed got a total rewrite a
few months ago and is now entirely done
and react so that's really great and
then I know there's a couple of teams
internally that are assessing whether or
not they want to use react native the
way Twitter approaches new technologies
is often that individual teams get a lot
of leeway in to assessing things and
figuring out what they want to use so
nice all right so Ryan asked what is the
status of react native for Android how
close is it to iOS in terms of
functionality and plugins yes that's a
great question um react native Android
came out later than iOS
about six months so for a while there
was a lag there's a lot of people
noticed at this point I think that
they're pretty much on even footing
there are definitely a few more bugs in
the Android version to build process for
your apps is a little bit rougher but I
think react native Android is now at a
point where it's absolutely ready for
prod um it's you know there are
definitely a couple of rough spots left
but they are rapidly vanishing and if
you look at the release notes for any of
the react native versions you'll see
that a ton of it is like just knocking
out feature for feature and bug after
bug for Android awesome alright so i
hada asked how burst and react property
you need to be in order to make the most
out of react native and i think you
answered this a little bit and there was
an addendum in the in the comments do
you cover like react proper at all in
your book if someone picked that up so i
don't cover react proper in the book you
don't need to be an expert at react in
order to use react native but you should
be familiar with the basic ideas of what
is our component you should be
comfortable with the component lifecycle
you don't need to know stuff like flux
or redux and you don't need to be uh
yeah you don't need a ton of experience
with it but honestly if you just spend
like a week going through the basics of
what a component is the component life
cycle that should be enough to equip you
to get started yeah and if i would i
would say like if someone's interested
in learning react native and they don't
know react i would suggest like I i took
west bosses course to kind of get up to
snuff with react and he did he did a
stellar job with that and it's not too
expensive so would highly recommend
that's great there's a ton of excellent
educational content whether it's online
or in book form or in you know tutorials
or blogs or videos egghead has a good
video series there's a ton of stuff out
there um when you're working in react
native keep in mind that you're going to
have to be writing a react app and then
seeing how it works on mobile um and I
think people often underestimate how
weird it is to jump to mobile if you've
never done it before so just
about things like oh wait I have to like
try out all of my touch targets and make
sure that they're at a right size and
all of this stuff so if you're trying to
do it all at once it's just going to be
a little bit overwhelming yeah yeah I
remember it can be fun though I remember
working on the words with friends
projects and I was on the back end any
time we'd have like new code going out
we'd have to test it right and so like
we'd all have to get on our phones and
play words thanks for like an hour did
you still like the game by the end of it
yeah yeah yeahs still a fun game um yeah
next question have you ever tried
titanium or any of the other across
platform options to build mobile or was
react native kind of your first so
before react native first of all I had
done some like traditional iOS and
Android development at Google and fog
creek respectively um and I've tried
titanium and I've tried Cordova but
honestly only in terms of like a very
small tutorial project so not enough to
go like I could really speak to them
with a ton of authority I've talked to a
lot of people who have done more
extensive work with them and trying to
have tried to like sort of assess what
the general temperature is in terms of
how people will think about them and
talk about them but yeah in terms of my
hands on experience it's mostly just
native traditional mobile apps and then
react native nice alright so I hope I
say this right Harsha asked for remote
updates let's say I don't have camera
support or any other kind of like native
feature in the initial version of the
build on the App Store and later they
add camera support does that require a
new update or a build submitted to the
app store so if you are just using the
standard API that react native provides
for you which if you're talking about
camera API that should be totally fine
you should not need another app store
review I think it depends on which
permissions your app requested um
versions of iOS I believe that you need
to specifically request camera
permissions and if you need to update
those permissions then no I think you'd
still be fine um yeah there's honestly
the hardest part about dealing with
over-the-air updates is not whether or
not Apple will allow you to get it
through but thinking about maintaining
every single version you release forever
right because you if your app is usable
offline you don't necessarily guarantee
that's a little always build the most
recent so you have to store beside how
long you want support for so you can
kind of box yourself into some odd bugs
if you're not used to doing continuous
deploys and if you don't already have
the were closed it up for that um but in
general yeah I think as long as you
don't have to add any changes to the
objective c or java code you're always
good nice all right brent asks can you
use javascript libraries like green sock
with react native apps to create
animations yeah so absolutely um I don't
have any experience with green sock
specifically but you can use any
JavaScript library as long as it doesn't
assume certain things about your
environment right so I've seen some
third-party jobs with libraries blow up
when they try to like access an
attribute on the window that doesn't
exist because you're not in an actual
web browser so it depends on the
implementation details of how that
JavaScript animation libraries written
um there are a bunch of different react
native focused ones so things like
animated or layout animation in the core
framework if you look at I think Chang
Liu's a twitter feed he usually has a
lot of stuff about animation react
native going on so that's a good place
to start nice thanks hey Lance had a
question do you think apple will
continue allowing over there updates in
the foreseeable future um yeah it's a
great question and a lot of people ask
me this one so I don't have any special
insider insight into apples apples
internal workings and they are sort of
famously inscrutable um
that being said I really believe that
they're going to leave over their
updates intact in large part because
we're going to see very large and
important customers start to use them as
it becomes sort of a necessary thing
that people expect to be able to use in
their apps Apple's just not going to
break most iphone apps they're just not
going to do that um I think that they
have sort of a complicated relationship
with react native but on the whole I
think it's very good and positive for
the iOS ecosystem and I don't really see
them having an incentive to stop
over-the-air updates if you're worried
about your app i will say that it's
always best to sort of you know proceed
with caution make it so that your app
will continue to function if
over-the-air updates don't work and
maybe most importantly just be a good
citizen if you upload a javascript code
that changes all of your apps
functionality they're not going to be
particularly pleased with that but
otherwise I think it's a very it's as
far as these things go as a fÃªte du
Ryan's question first so he said
regarding your day job do you work with
Scala Twitter back in yeah exactly um so
I work on the core services team at
Twitter specifically the user service we
handle all read and write traffic to
user data so it's basically all Scala
all the time nice and maybe that leads
me to question i have like most of the
time if you're building an app using
react native like what do you see is
like the common back-end people are
using to kind of like store and push and
pull data out of any thoughts hmm i
think one of the nice parts about
wrecked native is that's pretty agnostic
in terms of that so a lot of people when
it comes to their backend for their
mobile app they already have a lip
service up and running somewhere um so
it's literally whatever service you
already have right so people will use it
with their rails app for people we use
it with your people will use it with you
know firebase or literally anything I've
seen in terms of on the action
mobile client like there's still we need
a lot more effort put into stuff like
databases we've got realm and there's
some sequel light support but people are
still figuring out how to handle that oh
yeah I've seen a huge range of things
there's no common patterns it's really
often based on what people were already
working with ya have you um have you
played with graph ql at all in terms of
like using that for back end perhaps
yeah i had so graph ql is sort of it's
not really a back end in and of itself
it's a way of communicating with your
back end and the way of structuring your
API as a client developer whether that's
for front-end web or mobile I think that
graph ql is amazing it really creates
this super super flexible you know set
of communication guidelines as a
back-end developer graph ql is a very
interesting challenge and partially an
unsolved problem unless you're Facebook
most people don't already have a server
up and running that kids speak graph ql
and that can speak graph ql safely um
because you're dealing with sort of
queries which you don't totally know
their structures or depending what your
backing store is that may or may not be
safe um you might make it easy for
someone to overload you with that data
or bad queries um so I would love to see
more people doing working for a few um
it's something that I expect to see a
lot of experiments with um very few
people have it back end in gradual was
just ready to go so it'll be a little
well indeed alright and then the last
question i actually had is like what are
your thoughts on building progressive
web apps versus react native have you
looked at that at all hmm yeah so I
think progressive web apps are really
hard and in general building great web
apps for mobile web or desktop web and
just dividing them cleanly between the
two like there's no easy way to do it
well because you're handling so many
different cases personally I think that
usually it's better to have a separate
desktop and mobile
erience and designed very cleanly for
both instead of trying to have an
experience that transitions well between
them um but I think it depends so much
on what your app is so for something
like say medium calm where you can see
that it's very much like a progressive
experience as you like shrink down as
you change sizes that makes more sense
is just text versus an application like
say I don't know slides which becomes
unusable very quickly when you drop
below say in a letter um so I think it
depends yeah boring answer yeah no it's
good um all right I think that's it that
was all the questions we had I want to
say thank you bonnie that was pretty
awesome appreciate you coming on and
given the talk great thanks so much
thanks for having me it's good talk to
you yeah all right and if you do want to
talk to Bonnie she'll be in the slack
chat room and you can hang her there or
you can find her on Twitter as well
