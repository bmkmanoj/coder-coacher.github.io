second 2016 welcome crater fans i'm your
host josh owens long with my co-host I'd
be tired welcome back Abby we've been on
a little break yeah yeah sorry about
that man Margate New York yeah yeah yeah
I was like two weeks off so like I
looked up last week was just crazy um I
was doing craigor cough and yeah was
good was good but it was crazy okay
Billy and went well when well I feel
like I i love it up quite a bit like
Scott toll in ski from level up
tutorials he gave a great talk that
outline like building like doing the
design piece of react native there's
generally like some pretty good react
native talks I enjoyed can we learn made
like a a duck hunt clone using he found
the actual duck hunt sprites and made a
clone using react native so that was
probable yeah was fun yeah so a lot of
good talk so um when they go up I UGI
yeah yeah I yeah I there was a weird
problem with crowdcast it like recorded
this like really low res version so
sickly third day ended up recording my
own copy and I got a sink the video and
the audio together now so it'll be a bit
of a chore but I think we'll get
slightly better results like the text is
unreadable and some of those talks so
yeah but a lot of knowledge Willstrop so
I'm super happy with that wait yeah
can't wait for the next car I'll be cool
yeah go figure i'm doing next
it will be a little round up of our new
york adventure sure yeah well I guess so
this this week we're going to talk about
I guess transmission just dropped a new
episode I don't watch the entire thing
but I've gotten a good way through it
and they actually referenced some of the
new york trip there so we talked a
little bit about that I'm going to talk
about the new react corner yeah client
that dropped just today minimal viable
DevOps and meteors nested import
controversy controversy started
controversies so I'll say that well
we'll talk about it what you did talk
about so yeah we went to meteor camp New
York City which was cool like I've never
like I've been in New York City but I've
never been to the UN that was different
yeah that was awesome never been to
whatever yeah borneo stuff and honestly
like that's an amazing place to have a
conference because like every attendee
he had like desk space and plugs and
there's like a little if you follow me
on instagram i had a picture of the
earpiece all right you know like you can
tune in to like obviously we didn't have
any translators but if you were doing
that kind of thing you could like listen
the translator or we were able to just
hear like direct Mike output straight
into the ear speaker which is kind of
helpful sometimes because the room with
the greatest overhead town but everyone
had a mic in front of them and so they
could like speak into that Mike and then
it it piped you know so you could have
bring up people in there with Mike's
awesome so cool yeah October day to ye I
only saw the first day um but I caught
quite a few talks on the first day um
yeah I enjoyed what I saw we had to get
on the road to get back um yeah
but the funniest the funniest part of
the first day was just very progressive
views on meteor you know like not what
would people expecting to hear right
we're not painting a very pretty picture
yeah not because it wasn't in pretty
just because they were being realistic
about the future of that right on second
day was a little bit more meteor
oriented I gave it the top and Apollo
which had nothing to do with meteor at
all at that point but then the talks
following we're definitely I just meet
here based and then there were several
panels about meteor there's a meteor 1.3
chat which I contributed quite a bit too
and they're just like it was interesting
to see so my takeaway though from the
people I've met and the toxic we have
like the people that I I see using media
right now are someone very happy with
with what's going on so the people we
met but the people are annoyed i do
myself you know like we are kind of
seeing the bigger picture where we can
going next yeah the people at the
conference we're happy with what things
are today but the several one of several
of us that were thinking like how can we
think about the future right so that's
what nation I found with people there
everyone was super stoked on meteor so
maybe we're just the negative nancies
but they also we're not thinking about
scale or growing their business or
growing their product there's thing
about how easy it is right now yeah ya
like like I'll say this like Aaron oda
gave a talk when he talked about like
the future of meteor and said that it
probably won't exist in 2018 or it'll
just be like a little build tool that
hooks things together in an interesting
way and I I I probably tend to agree
with that and I think you're right like
it's not to me it's not even about like
the bigger picture I think part of my
talk is about the hidden pictures right
like you don't you don't realize but
like it's it's ben newman
and he's like the old guy working on
media right now as far as MDGs concern
and so we went from back in February
having this large team working on it to
lake now you've got one guy at MDG
working on meteor and like they're
working hard I think to actively replace
a good portion of meat hearing inside of
galaxies as far as like the back-end
infrastructure for running their app
yeah like I to me that signals a
dangerous shift that we need to pay
attention to and either this is going to
become purely a community-led effort or
it's gonna go off in my opinion because
there's like we went from having a team
of Lake eight or nine smart people
working on the core two to one like been
super smart but it's just like we're not
going to be able to get the same kind of
output out of one person no but exactly
the other people before so that's a huge
concern to me IRA put it really
elegantly on the second day during the
panel he was like he was like well in
the last four years we've built a really
good community people in his community
are people that he considers friends
people that he considers like people he
can mentor and he said is whether it's
meteor also he didn't say like this
because you know i speak english and so
um so i am just paraphrasing um he said
the people he said meteor can come and
go as long as the community moves
together so if meteor does leave or
whatever there has to be there can be
another technology that this community
can still stay a part of you know and to
leverage the same connections that's
what he's hoping yeah I agree and to
screw that you know there's like this
all makes makes makes you got make
certain things happen for the community
to stay together yeah I I think I mean
it's just not I know I don't think
that's super practical like it's an
interesting idea but at
at the end of the day like people are
gonna leave media and maybe leave
JavaScript right like you have I think a
common exit point on seeing is like
Phoenix and elixir or you know seeing
people jump out like to react and then
slowly eking out into the the node
ecosystem that way and like I agree and
I think maybe sticking with node makes
the most sense to me and that's what my
talk was about is like embracing the
node ecosystem and you know I think
you've already started to build some
working knowledge around that over the
last three years and like I don't I
think it's gonna be many years before if
at all before web assembly is a reality
and you can do something there like
maybe web components becomes interesting
but I still think JavaScript plays part
of that yeah you know and that that was
kind of my my spin on it you know and
the other thing that I wanted to address
like if you listen or watch transmission
13 is that they talked about Saturn and
like Aaron Oda brought that up during
his talk and that that was maybe a
viable alternative and again like most
of this information that we're cleaning
comes out of like us looking at the
github repos and paying attention to
what's going on and like Saturn popped
up in the Apollo organization and you
know I think I don't know if errno to
even talk to anyone but he he kind of
made this assumption that it was going
to be a thing and then like I got back
home and tried to use it it was broken
said something to sashko he's like yeah
don't use that we're not gonna really
build that oh yeah it's just an
experiment so you know I don't I don't
think that's the next big thing so I
don't know I don't know what what the
next big thing will be yeah I'm kind of
at this point where I think I'm kind of
pro library and maybe anti framework at
this point hey dude yeah I really build
stuff myself
yeah I love it I don't know that I would
rather build stuff myself it's just that
I think you look at the popularity of
react and realize like it's a library
and not a framework and like it's caught
on to the degree that it has because
it's a library that you can add on to
anything right like having skills and
react is going to be way more valuable
to my future than me having skills in
just meteor as a framework right because
I can like I can get hired by a shop
down the street that's building Phoenix
and elixir app and you know they've got
react on the front end and like I can
absolutely work on that exactly yeah
yeah it's huge distinction right now
between frameworks and libraries that
yeah I think edge life skills you want
more libraries you want to have a good
foundation to plug libraries in and out
of your application yeah I think that's
the thing like if we look now leaving
meteor maybe six months ago meant that
you had to replace a lot of parts right
like you had to replace tracker you had
to replace blaze you had to replace like
all these pieces yeah but now there's
like individual libraries like Oh pick
your poison right like you can do react
and you can use redox where you could
use mop or our xjs like just lots of
options out there now yeah and I think
like if you make the choice to go with
mob X and then find out all that was
terrible choice like we're having these
performance issues having this those
libraries and be able to make that
individual choice to switch out like one
little piece or dependency of your
framework of your application I guess it
makes more sense to me now than it used
to um I think having that flexibility
control is something that you should
care about in the long term and again
like I think going out and getting that
job somewhere you know where they're
using react if you can learn a new
little library and like probably not
even worried about what kind of back in
there consider building or you have to
like that's that's absolutely a super
valuable skill I think then when the
Apollo gets into the picture
not even Apollo but just fusing gravel
in general yes another skill set that
kind of obfuscates you from the back end
as well so you don't really need to
worry about funding works for such yeah
yes so I think the biggest takeaway for
me and what sparked a lot of the
conversation it's just the fact that
like people should be aware that meteor
is gonna slow down just no to it and I
think the other thing that they
highlighted on and transmission that we
just heard last week was the fact that
1.5 is now changed its focus so rather
than being like move all of meteor to
NPM instead 1.5 is going to be tighter
Apollo integration which is sort of
interesting like I wouldn't agree with
everything like sashko made a point
about Apollo works with the account
system now like hey I don't know like I
don't really have to run Mongo purely to
have account login stuff if I'm gonna
use my cool so I don't ya I don't want
to use the meteor account system yeah
like I'm one more I want an Apollo
account system yeah about I give you if
meteor is on its way out and you know
DDPs on its way out and what what does
that serve what does a tighter
integration serve me as a day as a
business owner Oh see like 1.5 if it was
a 10pm focus thing that would have been
made so much sense for my product but
then I have more options where I can
start I'm gonna actually start scaling
my product really like I'm not I don't I
could potentially not have nine megs of
JavaScript hitting my clients my users
who trying to pay money for my product
right so I could always make an express
server that that uses graphic UL or
Apollo even without 1.5 I can make it
work I don't need me to your account
system I could figure it out you know
like things like that it's just now I'm
just valid for us at work up we're is
more confined to the wave
you are today for a little bit longer
and we were really hoping with one point
for the new mondale updates grenade
that's cool Black River struggling today
with the pill tool having it so are our
app is so big it's completely slow
developer productivity spine down to we
don't know what's going on when things
break in the build system or in this
crazy framework that they've built right
so those two things not good for
professional developers that are trying
to actually like make serious moves on
their product at that one point Bob is
going to be that hope of like what we're
gonna get but we're not getting that so
that's it you know yeah I mean it's
interesting right because they they
wanna they want to sell it as you get
you getting more database support now
and then that's probably good for some
people but I don't know that it's like
as a developer you're right like I'm
more interested in getting better web
pack integration or like replacing their
build tool or you know any number of
things like swapping out pieces I no
longer need like I could rely on as if i
care about one place the ones i don't
and the other deter big ? that's still
left is like what is the future of gdp
especially for like 1.5 we moved up the
Apollo integration like what does that
mean for gdp in a long term like oh no i
don't really know no i don't i don't
know that if I that I actually care
right now because I'm just unhappy good
huh yeah I feel like I mean having been
through this cycle a few times it's just
I don't I don't think MDGs gonna fix the
problems there now personally like I'm
just I'm at the point where I believe
they're always just going to make
decisions that make sense for them
financially and it doesn't necessarily
line up with decisions that make my life
easier better less of a headache
anything like that or good for my
business
long-term so yeah that's that's the
struggle that I have every day when I
look at what they're doing and and what
I should be working on and that's why
you know I started to focus my time
elsewhere Lee react native or react or
redox or pain I felt hope for the
viewers like I just want to put this
into perspective like mediator for for
the where the stage of your company is
and where your product is meteor may
make a lot of sense right and it's going
to be great for you but coming from
experience now where we have scaled to a
lot of users a lot of people and we're
not even mentioned in when everyone
mentions the scaling stories the meteor
no one mentions work by those to mention
class crafts and stuff but they're
scaling by throwing money at it right
like we're a scaling story or now it's
because we have actually turned off most
of the features that makes meteor unique
right now I want to get that in there
when are you scaling to a lot of users
which in New York no one really cared
about scaling I do like you're getting
that big and that much load on your app
these features do not do well so maybe
we should have made the decision when we
hit that that that uptick to our silicon
valley uptick um maybe we should moved
off then but you know we didn't have the
sense of the future nor also we were
promised a different future than we have
today so just want to clear the air
there I'm not negative towards meteor
it's just not for what I'm trying to
accomplish right now yeah yeah I think
so like my look back to my time at
godaddy one of the things that they were
always concerned about when they were
working on that godaddy bookkeeping
product was cost per user hosting costs
range and I think you look a mediator
the hosting costs per user is higher
than with other languages or platforms
or frameworks or the library's whenever
you're using like I think generally you
have to be concerned with the scaling
story it's doable certainly is but you
know if you're spending 50 bucks to
handle for
under concurrent users like that's
that's Nicolas what's before expensive
like it's just that simple but then we
get into it another store too like let's
not I still I think I have a
conversation wants to Sam corcos and he
summed it up best when he said you know
me here is a great line of business tool
and like if you were just gonna build an
app that's gonna have like a hundred
users on it and you need to get
something about like great tool for that
I think if you're trying to build like
the next Facebook or Twitter like meteor
probably not making sense for you and
there's a little scale in between right
and you gotta do what makes sense for
your business definitely okay so that
was that he'll tell us about all the
other options out there for creating
apps from the command line okay so Dan
abramoff has been working on this
project of Facebook called react CLI is
inspired by Hamburg COI after he went to
ember con and met Tom day hello there on
they had a bunch of chats about where
react was really lacking in terms of
like straight to development getting
going go and there's a bunch of memes
and stuff about react and how it's like
I just finished my weapon wetback config
took me like three days or something or
like Oh started started a new project
finished my web pack and fig project is
not going to be finished like things
like that because the the the stuff the
steps it takes to set up a project
outside of you know we're all used to
this meteor scope of things where it's
just handled for you there's a lot of
work right you need to have a dev server
which would probably be run on express
need to be able to use babbles so you'll
have to have some type of build system
that uses babble and transpires your
JavaScript into es5 that's either web
pack or browser five those are probably
the two biggest tools right there I like
to go to them and then you need to
figure out how to organize reacts you
need to set up wrinting you need to send
all these small things
that you know over time and turns up
like starting a new project if I had it
if I had a look at that list at laundry
list I probably wouldn't even start the
project i'm just too lazy you know and
most developers are you know most
developers don't want to put up that
work because it's really not valuable
work it's like yak shave work um just
like this big pearl to do things so then
Dan felt the belt that burn too when he
was before we were to facebook in the
whole communities likes complain about
this crap so we have react CLI and that
came out today actually i believe on
facebook's blog and what allows you to
do is it allows you to create a critter
react application with everything i just
said in it there's not they don't make
it up in about CSS when I thought that
that's up to you but like we're talking
about before we act is just a library
and CSS also has libraries to use to so
all these things worked together um I'm
really really I'm excited about this
unfortunately it doesn't really apply to
a nap that has already started but if
you're going to make a like a play out
of a toy app or something you want to
just do for a proof of concept prototype
this is awesome you know and I think I
think it'll be expanded as it goes
there's also a guy named next max
steamer and he helped with that like the
thing like the react sea lion what it's
outputting it's coming from the
knowledge of a lot of people a lot of
boilerplate from the community this
isn't just one person just in like
enforcing what they think this is really
learned from the community everybody
involved all the boiler plates that
people are already making for people
today right there's a ton in and github
I'm just consolidating that information
and giving it to you so you have a great
time uh-huh so that's that's pretty much
it i would start using it if you want
amen really as it says once it's done
running it's just happy hacking and
that's seriously what it is copy hi so
yeah
I'm also you always been keeping that
stuff for you we wanted like do web back
and face and bright but it uses wetback
so yeah I'm going to give this a spin
this weekend curious to see you know how
it turns out the day you know that I was
actually most interested in is the fact
that they have this eject script mm-hmm
or just it'll push like all the config
stuff down into your repo and then
you're no longer really using the react
CLI you're you're back to just like a
straight-up know that way so connect
like and that is like I love react
always does this stuff like it's just
such if they know from experience
they've been doing this before they
probably been in the past when they've
been using tools they get deprecated and
they they want control of that thing
that they've been using the whole time
like I think escape hatches are always
if you're writing libraries and stuff
you need an escape hatch when you wait
for your user to do what they want and
now what you want them to do so yeah I
just splendid splendid sup oh wait this
game always gives good quality code well
thought out and you know voiced with
reason from a lot of people that are
outside of the react team itself you
know there's only a couple people
working on react full time but most of
this knowledge comes from people who
work on it every day like you and me so
the issues like the github issues are
the best place to voice your concerns
for this and they will actually hear you
out if you have a good idea so do it we
talked before about worrying about
scaling a meteor app and Wonder New York
we got to meet Michael Shuman actually
often of the next post cool guy he runs
a product called hello money they made a
fun little product as well called good
luck gun stocks and so they were doing
like timing through your portfolio and
that kind of thing and then they realize
like hey they've got an updating here
they can figure out like are you
investing in so
that's investing in like gun companies
yep and that was fun and so um I don't
know if he saw recently sidebar I'll got
relaunched did you see that yep so
Sasha's been working hard on nova which
is reactor in a telescope and one of the
things that he wanted to do was be more
prepared than the last time he launched
a new telescope at which was the the
video one and he had some scaling
trouble one some people gave me some
grief over it um but I think you know we
started having a better conversation
this time ahead of time and like I
helped him set up digitalocean he tried
to try galaxy and had memory problems um
and like it just kept killing his
container and so we moved digitalocean
he had a couple servers there um but the
the big thing is like he's doing
server-side rendering and delivering
HTML to the client and then it picks up
and does the pub sub and we'll grab any
new data after that and so because good
for initial delivery like if that can be
done quickly then you know you're going
to deliver a full HTML and it's going to
be a fully render page out of box which
is a slightly better experience for the
for the end user um and the big thing is
like you can actually take it further
and so like I had worked with Michael he
had shown me Yetta it's a pre-render and
I figured out how to cash the pre-render
response so when box were coming in and
get shipped over to pre-render server
and then I would store that for like 30
45 minutes and just serve that up with
more bots for coming through and like
Michael and function and I started
talking and trying to figure out like
how Kuwait like he's rendering server
side rendering things like how can we
get caching into that mix because that's
the if you think about it like there's
different places you can make things
faster and like yeah initial
server level that's the place you can
probably make it two facets you can
either park something in front of it
like garnish or you can do caching with
engine X itself and try to be like
faster and so I renisha Michael a little
bit of my code and he figured out i read
cookie until immediate login system
actually cents a cookie and like I can
go read this article by the way if you
happen yeah um trying to give you the
highlights here but like it sets that
cookie and then if you detect that
cookie you just serve on the regular app
if that cookie isn't there then you send
them the cash version because they're
not logged in and that's that's the
thing like whenever you're doing some
caching on a summer you have to make
sure that there's a way to have the
unique user data not be part of that
cash and so there's different ways to do
that but this was the easiest is just if
you're not logged in which to be the
majority to sidebar users send them a
cache page yeah read that and that's
like stupid fast you know like if you
right now listen to this type inside
barn on Io and then wait five minutes
and go back and type it in again you're
going to get this super fast response
the second time for sure hello it is
your CPU cpu load and ran during like
you do have a cache you know so you pay
the cost once and you can always have a
cache time out where you discard it and
then they come again yeah yeah the
easiest way is just setting set a time
limit on a dip of like 20-30 minutes or
something just a pet like it's going to
depend on your app but yeah yeah we did
this we did this with the no not nothing
very elegant but we were just rendering
ecstatic pages for some users just for
an experiment to see page load times and
we did we did a similar thing for logged
out of users for you which render really
quick page cache the data that the page
needed and call it a day only problem is
converting a static page into a meteor
page right so it's completely sad
and then the next the next interaction
like this wasn't even bootstrapping meet
here just a static page anyway then you
click the button to actually go to the
media for a poor you know the media
version and the page load cost is still
high for the next page so josh is I what
the what sidebar did and what Michael is
talking about is a lot better just cuz
you have by native server-side rendering
can be a pit stop in the cash problems
yeah and so I think in this is cheap
right like if you can get away with this
you can you can absolutely like running
an engine excerpt where you can run five
dollar digitalocean slice all day long
you can yeah replicate those out low
balance amongst them if you want you can
if you want even more speed I think you
can you can use something like memcache
and pull the cash from memory instead of
from disk like there's a lot of options
here to really really make things to be
in engine X is like I don't know it's
it's like when I was comparing like
frameworks the libraries like it's like
Apaches like the Swiss Army knife and
engine X is like the beautiful chef's
knife that you're going to carve a
wonderful meal with so I think that's
the stuff lean definitely something to
consider and you know this is I've been
doing some research roundness this week
too because we've got a client who's
doing some ecommerce work and I'm sort
of working on that application and one
of the things I want to do for
performance is you know taking a look at
what can we cash and there's actually
quite a bit waking actually you don't
have anything in a shopping cart we can
catch everything if you're not logged in
and don't have anything in the shopping
cart it should be student fast so and
with galaxy there's no way to do that
right now so that's a little with the
galaxy you don't you only have access to
anything to do many things up but there
the client definitely doesn't want to
get into the DevOps business so they're
there
leery of figuring out like deployment
that kind of thing even if I set it up
they don't want to own that piece of it
so I think we're going to try to figure
out a different approach I'm hoping we
can use like a middleware connect
Handler and detectives coffin server
cache page so no should be interesting
but this is like a great rate and I
think the important thing to take away
from this is there are a lot of
different tools that you can leverage to
get good performance out of your
application and you should be looking
around feeding them because this isn't
meteor specific this isn't even like I
dealt with this for years and rails land
like we were doing service objection so
this is outside of the boundary of a
framework this is just web you straight
up you know yep which a lot of people
don't know so they should get into that
yeah definitely definitely who's been
around forever yeah picking up not
around forever like tell us about
imports and when is a controversy around
me so this this uh to me this title is
good bait but whatever um just kidding
but no so in immediate 1.33 a ben ben
newman changed the underlying module
will transpiler to use we divide and if
reify is actually a npm module that been
built themselves so you can use yes 2015
modules in pure node today and you know
it's very complicated on how he actually
does that which you can look at he
actually has a really good documentation
on how it actually you know converts the
syntax into you know actual you know
commonjs module divided exports massage
but introduced to me here a way to
actually have conditional enforcing so i
can do is meteor or sorry his clients
import this or is server in court that
right on which pool for the meteor
context because I you
you know you do want to have the power
to isomorphic module loading which is
great I personally don't do that but if
it's something that you do need go ahead
it's great the only problem is a p corey
who wrote this post was trying to test
those modules and he is testing outside
of a media context which is awesome for
the speed but in the case of what he was
doing that much that wasn't defined so
and that's because the Moga even if
you're running mocha tests from these
you know test directory that has no
context to meteor it's not like velocity
so he was running pure just pure moga
for a pure unit tests and he rented some
trouble which brings up the controversy
part so reify itself is not any standard
it's not part of any official node
standard or anything from so what
actually is the opposite right because
they have a standard for imports and it
chooses a Druze Adrian yes it goes
against the current standard right in in
node community right um but the thing is
and that is true it's true and that is a
controversy because you could
potentially reduce things today that
that just aren't going to be kosher
tomorrow right which in the case of
media here so this is where I can to
defend then in this case but in the case
of meteor they office keep that from you
so you don't even need to worry about
that really you know something's changed
you will fix it but let's think about
the Figgis step back for a second Ben is
on tc39 he's on we um his vision for how
no no digo systems going to work in the
future is es2015 modules and that's why
he built this is my uh this module reify
because he truly believes in enhancing
language features this one we talked
about New York but he truly believes in
enhancing language features so that's
why she built reified because he wants
people in the node committee to start
embracing
these new language features as well so
from that standpoint I understand where
he's coming from and understand why he
did that but from a mediator user
standpoint it doesn't really affect you
it's still controversy but I don't think
it's that big of a deal all right first
or so look you see reason I put this in
like it's it's interesting and all right
thank you I'm I'm may be at odds with
you on the fact that maybe it doesn't
belong in meteor because I would say
like you said metal fix it but like how
long will then be around like working on
the air weapon huh um which which is a
consistent worry of mine um oh my gos
been still at MDG um but no like I if
nothing else go repeats article click on
some of the links right in particular to
link where a proposal which was yeah
proposal the proposal is where I started
support for why he wants to do this you
know around and I yeah and it's not yet
good would Ben he's always been really
good about communicating like his
decisions like you know when we're gonna
do meteor NPM install you know back
before I even built that he had a huge
doc he's like this is why I'm gonna do
this this is why we're not using webpack
toises now and like I I get where he's
coming from but if the thing I webpack
can meet here why Ben didn't want to
pick what I packet meet here it's in the
same kind of reason is what I packet is
first class support for common Jas
that's how it's going to be there's no
plans for es2015 support it's going to
be common J as a web has enough problems
to worry about the language syntax no
but but then he wants the meteor bill
told if it still exists you know he
wants it to be completely but you want
to do you want to do a module code
splitting module reloading hot module
regarding all that other box he wants it
to be a hundred percent es2015 modules
to
that not having to use you know comma J
is so it's just if it's different
strokes for different folks but I'm glad
he has all this documentation backing up
his proposal and all his pain he just
like that wouldn't be surprised if they
accept it well I think so I found I
found a link um it was uh what does it
say compelling document outlining the
benefits of nested import so if you're
reading Pete's post find that link and
it takes you to his wine nest imports
argument which is a really interesting
read and then inside of there there is a
link called live bindings and when you
click on that I ended up at duality
website which is dr. axel braun fire and
like that is actually a super
interesting read to like I just ended up
I probably lost at least a half hour
trying to read all this stuff and like
following links too late like it was
good to Lake yeah that deep dive inside
there you know they just I read the
proposal or nested import yeah it's
super long but there's things that just
pop out to you what do you get from that
right because well I think Ben's
position is like if you can have like
string literals determine where your
modules are so much things are so many
things are possible like you can lazy
evaluate on your coat which is great you
know you can optimistic with the import
stuff so you can try to import some if
it doesn't exist maybe you can throw an
error right you can turn my cash and
import say that is cool you can totally
do dead code elimination like tree
shaking all that stuff because that
dependency tree is already there you
don't necessarily have to do like what
web pack does and you can do it cooks
living mmm you do code splitting because
if you can if you if imports are not
mandatory at the top of your file I can
go on a button click and I can do import
I can import something right that you
know instead of having to
constrained to use top-level imports I
can start doing code splitting really
neither using the system API just like
saying oh yeah hey my function can I say
import in the function you use that
right there so I don't know it's really
interesting it's not really a meteor
esque it's just interesting in general
but i would take a look at the proposal
and you can just follow leads pizza blog
and you'll end up there for sure yeah
all right well it's good to get back at
this man yeah I don't like to say about
the last one but yeah yes it's good to
be back uh we're definitely um we didn't
have to pay how many Apollo news today
but that's cool maybe next week all
right guys once again thank you for
listening as always big thanks to
modulus and dissolution for sponsoring
this thing if you haven't yet and you
need to sign up for I don't have a code
for modulus but if you're looking for a
digital ocean use the code crater 10
they use that stuff to track if the ads
effective so if you're thinking about
signing up make sure you that that look
better then yeah I believe you do get a
discount so and we'll be back next week
talking about more JavaScript news
