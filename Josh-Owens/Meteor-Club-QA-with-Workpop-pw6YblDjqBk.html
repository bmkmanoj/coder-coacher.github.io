got to think about what month it is
februari a meteor club question and
answer this month we have some people
from work pop on particularly right now
we've got obvi welcome thanks so why
don't we just take a quick minute number
one a little bit of housekeeping if
you're watching the live stream you want
to make sure to tune into the crowd cast
link that I put on the Google+ page also
tweet it out real quick but you'll want
to make sure you're there so that you
can ask the questions and we can kind of
have a back-and-forth with the audience
so that's where that stuff happens and
then why don't you just tell us real
quick what work pop is and sure maybe
how you guys decided to use meteor for
it yeah yeah okay so hello all i'm abby
i er I work at work pop obviously
software developer I'm not I'm just
software developer my CTO Ben is
actually on the way to this Q&amp;amp;A so when
he gets here we'll introduce him but I
can give you guys a background work pop
is a web application that wants to
reimagine the hiring process for hourly
and part-time workers we saw this
problem in the industries where a lot of
employers of the Mon pas restaurants the
small businesses are seeing like high
turnover and their employees whether
that's just the nature of that industry
or people like to bounce around from
jobs to jobs it's a big problem right so
on the employer side you know they're
losing candidates every day you know in
la especially we're in LA based in LA
Hollywood's right down the block all
these actors right they have a they
could get a screening an audition the
next day and boom the employer has no
one to fill their position on the other
side the candidates I'd like I I when I
was in high school trying to apply for
jobs
I was just you know doing paper
application after paper application and
what we found out is a lot of employers
still use paper applications they're
still using the help wanted signs and we
thought what if we could just I disrupt
this what if we made it easy for
employers to post jobs similar to
craigslist posting great jobs and
candidates could apply to these jobs
with a universal application so Ben's
here let's bring them on it hey hey
there how's it going sorry about the
delay oh that's all right with this well
and so I was just talking about work pop
and what we do and then what we wanted
what we're striving for a work pop is
that all of our candidates get a message
back we want everybody to hear back
whether they got the job or not and
we're trying to want to encourage them
to keep upon so that's work popping us
like a very small nutshell then we'll
talk about why we chose meteor and why
media is amazing okay yeah go ahead hey
guys uh glad to join you all I think
meteor is been the best platform for
rapidly building out work pop it is
definitely the best web platform I
better use I I would want to talk a
little bit about a year ago when we were
thinking about how would we build this
website when you look at a team of just
two people at the time was me and my
co-founder Ju whose talents are all over
the place but primarily in design and
very much making great web experiences
we needed a platform that could help us
take advantage of our talents as much as
possible and with anything that was more
technically oriented or more worried
about performance or were more worried
about scaling or more worried about
saving money we would not have been able
to take advantage of Jays ability to
deliver fantastic web experiences
and a lot of my skills around building
very robust business logic and making
something work in a multi-user
environment so we largely chose meteor
around early on taking advantage of our
talents and later on delivering this
sort of multi-hundred million dollar
website experience that's built with a
very small team how big is your team
right now we're currently 12 we have a
few developers joining us shortly this
March we have will have then at that
point seven developers a couple folks in
sales growth guy and our two co-ceos
read and Chris nice so I mean um I
remember kind of talking with ah be back
and forth over Twitter you guys have
ways of dealing with like meteor and a
larger team I think the biggest team
I've been in so far has been 33
developers maybe can you talk about that
a little bit one of the most important
aspects of meteor is that every person
who works on the web app gets to see the
entire product it's very difficult to UM
not be aware of how something that is a
more of a traditional server or
traditional client piece of code works
in terms of just team work around
knowledge about knowing how the web app
works we have been very lucky and that
everybody sees the same code base so
everybody is certainly capable of the
same level of awareness on the other
hand that also means that onboarding
would appear to need a lot of people a
lot of people to get very very well
educated before they can all work
together and we've also been very
fortunate that that that has not
indicates what we've learned is that
it's very important to give everyone the
tools to reverse engineer to take apart
the system rather than
a more structured or complete piece of
documentation and a lot of what we plan
to release a community to help people
work on teams together is different
packages and different techniques for
understanding how meteor site works yeah
a lot of the things when you're working
with multiple developers on a meteor
project it's really important that
everyone has the same code standard and
lucky for us when we first built the
site we created you know pretty much
like the foundation of like you know all
our foundational methods everything how
everything works in the beginning so as
we probably moved forward we relied on
that good foundation that we built it
beginning so it's great it's good the
front end the front end always is always
like you know here and there front ends
is running but those basic foundations
of our meteor methods or publications
for solid from the beginning and it's
been a great way just to build on top of
it yeah yeah I would definitely agree so
other things that I've seen some teams
do particularly like they'll have a
style guide like meteor has a style
guide and so the bigger project that
I've worked on you know we adopted that
style guide and then actually using jazz
hint to enforce that style guide like
it's part of the the testing process so
when you commit to github the CI server
runs Jason and tells you if you're you
know in in style with with the style
guide kind of thing do you guys do
something like that or just more of a
loose structure and you know try to
follow it and enforce it yourself our
style guide right now is the web storm
auto formatter we actually uh and to
your point about using a for instance a
Travis plug-in like the runs jazz hint
to tell you what's wrong with github um
our version of a linter automated linter
is actually me going over and reviewing
and when i noticed that there's white
space missing i right into a comment hit
command alt Elvis the hotkey for auto
formatted webstorm
nice I mean that's not to say that we
shouldn't do those things it's like I
guess one thing for the developers
watching when you're moving super fast
and media allows you to move at light
speed you know you forget about these
things and we're gonna have to revisit
you know some of those basic like
writing everything down style kind of
like right now at work pop it's kind of
an oral tradition you know Ben has
taught me I was teaching the next guy
like so yeah to your point that's a
great idea Josh and I think I'm gonna
start doing that nice nice yeah i would
highly recommend it and like i said
there's actually some work already done
for you so there's a guy there's a it
i'll try to find it and send it to you
guys but um actually Jesus and meteor
someone made a here it is a jay attend
our sea ray X so if you go to github.com
/ ray x / meteor dash JSN RC I'll put
that in the in the chat as well as few
guys can click on it but they did a
great job of taking like this is up to
date as of January seventh was the last
commit but it basically just runs all
the meteor style guide well I guess
rules in jazz ham for you so you know
maybe you guys could fork that and get
it going and there's there's other
options too i'm trying to think like
excuse me thoughtbot hound oh it's
called how
see I calm and it you know they they
complained about the same thing that
you're kind of doing Ben they said they
got tired of saying like you know white
space like I can get it right and so
they they wrote something that hooks in
and runs style guides against your code
as well oh which I find interesting and
it works with coffeescript in JavaScript
and looks like SAS and Ruby so pretty
awesome as well you used to be a ruby
developer right Josh yeah yeah young
ship yeah I did about nine years of Ruby
development myself mostly rails um a
little bit of like pure Ruby work like
JRuby work actually for godaddy they had
a an app that was doing transactional
like sending bank information back and
forth and it was all based on a Java
library so when he's in JRuby for that
but yeah yeah nine years and I started
dabbling with JavaScript myself three
years ago came to it actually through
CoffeeScript really enjoyed that and
then started getting deeper into the
JavaScript that I was compiling and
played around a backbone and then
started a tinker with angular because I
wasn't a huge fan of Ember like I tried
using it once and it just didn't fit
didn't feel right to me um and then
found meteor in the rest is history yeah
are you were working at differential
before and now you're doing the training
stuff now it's really awesome I'm sure
your fans already know this but did you
tell I guess you ain't me and been like
why did you decide to leave
differentially they seem like they're
doing a lot of big things uh yeah they
are um you know I I think it was just
maybe some philosophical differences on
how to approach business and that kind
of thing and you know to me training and
open source was was very very
interesting I mean if you if you look I
built six out of the 10 packages that
that differential had at the time I left
so
that was a big thing for me just
blogging and teaching and open source
work like that's I want that to be the
foundation of my business and you know
they still do some of that stuff but it
wasn't a huge focus for them and so I
wanted to to take time to really focus
and try to build something out of that
awesome cool thanks all right looking
for a players in all sorts of different
ways whether they be a player's in
angular whether they be a players in
running big web apps uh we are
definitely looking for uh training
materials to help on board a players in
one thing nice you haven't do with the
media why I think meteor is kind of
missing right now is um I remember when
I was dabbling it to scala just follow
guide was like oh you're coming from
Java ok this is Scala you came from Java
oh yeah in Ruby this is what it is yeah
like meteor could do that I came from
angular before meteor and when I aim to
meteor it was kind of like a culture
shock like what am i doing what is the
heads like I don't get this database
everywhere i was using firebase to do my
reactivity I was like tried to watch my
my database and stuff and if I had that
guy that was made for people who think
like this like angular way of the very
opinionated angular way would have been
a lot easier transition probably cut the
onboarding in half yeah but I do feel
like people from the backbone um
lifestyle or whatever Sam a lot they
have an easier time transitioning yeah
and they want to transition so yeah I
think the like the event maps they're
very backbone ish to me and the the
helpers those definitely seem like back
boenish concepts and I definitely think
that if you look at the early meteor
they actually I think at some point they
had backbone available to the client and
it was installable and I think that's
kind of the evolution for this so far
but
you know there's there's some
interesting things happening there as
well with blaze now so uh yeah I don't
know um I don't want to turn this into a
big advertisement for my stuff but i do
have late I've got like the eight days
of meteor that I've been working on it's
like an email course that you can take
and ideas you know for me I think people
should learn how to use the docs
appropriately and rely on that as a
learning tool and also learn to read
code you know and a big part of my my
eight days of meteors that I tell people
like go you know go read these docs
these particular docs are going to be
pertinent to the lesson and then at the
end you know I'll give them three goals
to accomplish like writing code wise for
the day but then at the end like i'll
give them links to open source examples
of the code that they can look at and
kind of see how other people are
approaching things in structuring things
so like go look at the pub sub and
triplet or telescope or something like
that you know because it's open source
it's out there and these people are
building legitimate apps off of this
this code so you know go go learn to
read source code because I think that's
a huge important thing for developers
yeah I mean I've been getting a lot of
questions lately like how do I learn
meteor like what do I go and lucky for
them you have that blog post now which
is getting started yeah one thing I had
one thing out the advice that I've given
to people is you know any tool that you
know right now just forget about it like
pretend that you don't know it and you
only have meteor that's the only thing
you can use the best way to learn
something is up that's the only resort
and it's worked well for some people you
know a lot of people I've been
programming a long time i'm at the
meteor meetups that in la there's always
the old school dotnet programmers that
come they want to like find out what's
up and to them it's just like a whole
new world because they've been learning
something for a long time it's hard to
unlearn or relearn something new yeah
when I told them that given that advice
they were like I don't
about that I don't know if I could do
that like I so reliant on my tools and
we are all developers we have this tool
set that we need to use to make money to
get the job done so it's really hard
when you're like kind of like you know
experienced to like jump into something
brand new and you don't really know much
but for those guys are and the guys who
are watching the guys we're gonna watch
this like if you're a new developer and
you want to learn meteor or if you're a
front-end developer and you want to
learn like the full stack life you know
like pretend that this is the only tool
you have and you have to do it you have
to get into it you know and you'll get
really good really quickly yeah and
there's there's good ways to write like
I mean you can use something like like
you guys mentioned webstorm right like
there there are tools out there that'll
make it like if you're transitioning
from something like you know dotnet and
you've got their developer tools that
are kind of like helping you write your
code faster like there are options for
that available like I'm ave M&amp;amp;T mux guy
so I don't know I like to type things um
but you know if if you're not a typer go
use webstorm I guess awesome yeah all
right so we do have some questions here
so i'm going to start answering them
this one is maybe it's about meteor but
so Mitchell Wolfman asked what is the
most recent meteor related problem
you've faced and how did you solve it so
I'm assuming maybe he's asking about a
problem that's popping up because of you
know the choice to use meteor yeah maybe
scaling or something I don't know um we
have a variety of issues that were lucky
that usually when they become a big
problem the media development group
catches up and fixes it I can give you a
handful one that I think is particularly
important to people who are using
meteors a ability to be used as a mobile
web app there are severe a
restrictions to how quickly something
like an iPhone can load a giant blob of
JSON of Jay of JavaScript so the work
pop app I think clocks in fully
compressed at about 600 or five hundred
80 kilobytes of JavaScript and in the
worst case that can take as much as 10
seconds to load over an LTE connection
than impressing just in time compiling
and executing to render the first page
there are definitely packages that take
a little bit of nuance to understand and
use IRA know this fast render the app
cache package to help address that but
it's something that definitely affects
every single person's experience and
it's something that we're running into
as we're preparing out new features
otherwise there are other details
certain problems with internet explorer
9 that really invite us that that we
wish we could get vixen that we have to
fork and we'll write our own pull
request or and give it all back to the
community but in terms of large-scale
intellectual problems we haven't had any
a lot of it is just the nitty-gritty of
delivering the app that we have I say so
yeah and then from my point of view
that's all correct damn you
concatenation on ie9 but I think one of
the one of the business or at business
problems but one of the problems we face
too is with performance I'm not in a big
way it's just like early on we didn't
see the value of fields right and now
we're seeing those values or maybe I
didn't see the value of fields and those
watching like put fields on your queries
like and the data that you want not
everything and you as you grow users as
you get bigger like that stuff's going
to hurt you a lot so in the beginning is
you should worry for what you want and
you know make moves on that
that's interesting so you're really
talking about the data on the wire and
minimizing it to just what you need
versus sending the entire object over
the wire right yeah well there are
definitely situations where there's no
issue with meteors back end but you have
to be careful about how you render on
the front end and definitely uh you know
I've been using me years since I think
um October of 2012 so very for so for a
while now and there has been significant
improvements in the rendering engine
many might remember the isolate yes
unfortunately and that stuff has all
gone away but definitely using the
profiler very very carefully finding
where you might be thinking that
something is not recomputed a lot but
really is I'll give you an example on
the work pop site you can see your
distance from a job and the equation
that is used to calculate the distance
between your lap latitude and longitude
another latitude longitude involves a
arctangent and our tangent in javascript
is very slow and if you have 500 rose
but you rerender on the as the rose in a
streaming way you're rendering row 1
then you're rendering Row 1 and Row 2
then you're rendering Row 1 Row 2 and 0
3 and you have this arithmetic some of
renderings that are running the slow
computation we discovered that because
of this calculation there was something
like a 500 millisecond six hundred
millisecond delay where the page is just
completely frozen because it's rendering
job because it's executing pure
JavaScript um we just change the
algorithm and it goes way faster we get
rid of that pesky arctangent but it's
those little things that you could only
discover if you were
using the profiler and it really comes
from both a nuanced understanding of the
rendering engine and also how to use
your tools to see those sorts of
problems so basically for from Matthew I
would say though those are the big
obstacles we've experienced with using
me nice okay yeah I mean that makes
sense like if you if some of the the
fans watching have seen like the hacking
telescope with Sasha and I we we
actually found out that because of the
way he's handling the search query even
though it's blank when you first load
the page it actually causes the query to
rerender or like recompute and it calls
the same subscription like five or six
times so I mean even even with the the
merge box like it's still a little
expensive on the back end for that to be
happening so definitely little little
gotchas you gotta watch out for like
that alright so the next question is
from Ben Strahan he says what is your
deployment process do you work with or
around hot code push and so I think
maybe he's referring to the fact that
like when you send out or when you do a
new deploy it actually will like
calculate that you your code changed and
it will force all your clients to reload
and the problem with that is really the
fact that all of a sudden you're putting
a large burden on you know your
connection to Mongo and your queries can
be quite slow you know depending on how
many people you have connected so if you
have you know hundred people connected
at once there's going to be a hundred
queries like plus some spinning up all
at once so far in our deployment we we
use modulus as our host we run a
clustered environment and we do hot
cocoa pushes we use all of those
features we do online
operations that means whenever we want
to make large-scale database changes we
do it live we don't take down the server
to do it we engineered in a way where
migrations can occur at the same time
our deployment we try to do we try to do
as little unusual things as possible
what ruins deployments is when you don't
do something exactly the same way as
you've done it before because that's
what surprises happen nice so how many I
don't know if you guys can share this
but how many kind of concurrent users do
you deal with on a daily basis and kind
of how many clustered or how many become
Dinah servos do you have good long-term
we're completely oversubscribed with
servos so it's a kind of a non-issue
because they're so cheap but so we can
kind of have unlimited performance we're
also unsubscribed with our database
oversubscribed with our database so
we're not terribly we've never seen a
single slow query um if we're going to
make a mistake it's usually in our own
codes where we might send too much data
in a subscription and no matter what the
users internet connection it's just not
fast enough their browsers not fast
enough to process and deserialize those
messages so we found that in general
infrastructure can be basically dirt
cheap without having to worry about you
know whether there's one concurrent user
whether there's a thousand we're seeing
that pretty much everything in that
range works fairly durably as long as
your code is well written get on compose
composes the is that what you guys
used yeah nice compose modulus I think
that's like the best and a lot of
support uh yeah yeah they well you know
I'm biased I guess because they spent
you buy it yeah sponsor the podcast but
I would definitely agree with that like
I actually reached out to them about
sponsoring the podcast just because I do
think they are the best and you know if
you want
not worry about scaling and performance
like that's probably the easiest way to
get all that stuff off your plate and
both of them do a great job of support
in my opinion so yeah we'll add their
gotta do it yeah I mean is it an ad if
it's the truth I don't know no it's the
truth yeah nice alright um I lost my
here it is okay so done answering that
one um got another one here from Carl
and an anchor I hope I said that right
Carl I'm sorry okay grow what's up Carl
whoops yeah so he asked what are your
thoughts on using react or polymer with
meteor are you guys using any other kind
of front-end libraries with with blaze
and media right now I can touch on this
so when we first built our site you know
the obvious choice is bootstrap 3 you
know everyone knows that you know just
just you know to make it to make the
site look beautiful really quickly we're
actually trying to iterate on all our
features again as we continue to grow
we're going to reiterate on everything
and what we wanted to do and want to
accomplish is make a really good user
experience so our designer jay is a
great designer and he fell in love with
material design so our site is going to
be moving toward that direction of the
material pattern now we're at this
crossroads right now maybe Josh you can
give us some advice where does
crossroads and we're thinking are we
going to build everything on blaze am I
going to create paper components in
blades just to style them make them look
like material design and do everything
business as usual or we have another
path where we could actually do the
meteor polymeric stuff from differential
I think they posted a lot about it yeah
go that route and actually do that
here's the thing that it's hard it's a
hard choice because one polymer is in
some production ready right it has
at one point 0 yet and that's a we've
already made this technical bed on
meteor I don't know if we're we may not
be comfortable making another technical
bit on polymer right I don't want to be
three months down the road and we have
to change our front-end code again
because whatever library we picked while
support or is not being used anymore so
to carls a question I'm thinking polymer
right now I think that is the wise
choice it's backed by a huge company you
guys know it's called google and that
might be the best choice but there's
those intricacies that I don't think
Ryan is team and faced yet I you know
whatever they build in polymer like it
looks really good and i have seen I've
seen it it looks really awesome um but I
don't know we don't maybe they've had
faced all the things that they need a
face but maybe I should talk to them
dude yeah yeah I would uh I would love
to uh yeah maybe I should get Ryan to
talk talk a little more about polymer
but um I don't know like to me when
evaluating technology you know I I look
at at ruby and rails right and there was
no specific company behind it but it
definitely took off I don't know like so
I'm with you like maybe I'm leery of
famous and but I'm less leery of react
or polymer just because of the companies
behind them so I think they're going to
be around I mean to your point you're
absolutely right like we're here on a
google hangout and this is streaming
live over youtube so i don't know maybe
i've bought it hook line and sinker to
cuckoo but um yeah I don't know like
like I've seen user cycle it looks
really good it seems to be smooth I've
had some conversations with wry about
that kind of stuff and I don't know that
he uh he doesn't regret the choice to go
to polymer um and you know that's like
user cycle is his day-to-day work like
that's his baby right now so I mean I I
think I think it will come out a lot
more if he were upset or not happy with
with you know the way things are going
but they've used it on a couple apps now
and you know they're they're also just
dabbling with ionic as well you know
usually when I ask people about
frameworks I don't ask them what they
like about it because I'll figure that
in myself what do you hate about is like
what don't you like and those are the
things that I think about when we're
going to make a choice I know like our
anoda had the flow component that looks
interesting a lot of people are trying
to do these components maybe we could
give a stab at it too but if it fits our
business and it's our trajectory for our
business will probably make a decision
um a lot of developers out there I'm
talking to you front end is super
important you probably already know that
but I've heard developer just scope off
the front end like I'm a back-end
developer whatever you guys can write
CSS there's a lot there's a lot to it
and you have to think about all the
different outcomes and it's the thing
that user facing right it's the thing
that really mad Carl dan injure is
actually working when work pop right now
through ok grow absolutely phenomenal
developer and designer I think um you
know he can speak for himself but a lot
of the way that he's managed to really
over deliver on on our expectations for
a what he's capable of literally he's
one of the best people at what he does I
have ever met uh and uh I think for
anyone who wants to really care about
the user experience the reason these
sorts of components matter is because
they help you do design without needing
a design document this something that
Karl happens to be really really
fantastically good at but is something
that we definitely could support better
if we had used a more mature or
well-known component framework here at
work pop we actually wrote our own
component framework that made a lot of
sense I for the particular way that you
edit job postings that you fill out a
job application we have had very good
luck with it but we also understand it
it's idiosyncratic it's very work
II and it's something that if we had
been smarter we would have ported them
an existing a component framework more
faithfully to meteor and that's the sort
of thing that really gives the corrals
of the world the ability to do what they
do best which is look at a page
understand how to make it look good
without needing um you know an enormous
amount of process behind it yeah nice
nice so I I took your advice and I just
asked for I like what do you hate about
polymer and he's he's texting me back he
said browser support is the number one
thing for him he said it might not like
a lot of the browser features might not
ever be adopted by non Chrome browsers
so he hasn't polyfill though right they
do um and I you know I said so like the
lack of polyfills or is it that the
polyfills aren't good enough for all the
browsers like he didn't he didn't
respond to that but one of the other
things he mentioned is that it's slower
on iOS versus Android and he said the
biggest problem is it's google's baby
right now and that that's kind of bad
for because they're they're relying a
lot a lot of browser specific stuff
right now yeah yeah for us you never
know if an employer wants to post a job
they might be using a computer that's
almost five years old you know running
IE 9 and like giving somebody the
ability to post a job that's somebody's
income so it's really important that we
support a large variety of browsers of
the experience that we need to support
them and it's really tough for us to
sacrifice that so so I think his point
is very important yeah and as you know
as a developer you always want to be
working on leading-edge technology the
best stuff and us but when it comes to
running a business you have to draw the
line and say like is what I'm developing
going to you know move the needle is it
going to is it going to help build great
software and you know thanks Ryan thank
you that's a really good point we'll
definitely have to look into everything
yeah you know the other interesting
thing is you know to Carl's point he
mentioned react as well and I don't know
if you guys saw this but avital released
a react web components package on
atmosphere and so it looks like from
what I can tell him and David Greenspan
are playing around with react and trying
to get components working from react in
to blaze so I got any interesting as
well I mean I still think blaze is
amazing you know like I still think that
you could just use blaze and you'll be
fine we try something have a component
framework built on top of blaze yeah
that has been working well but maybe a
little too yo Socratic to just release
the community yeah resembles auto form
it's a slightly different philosophy
than the auto form package but it has a
lot of the same functionality nice yeah
so you know that that's the other
interesting thing like I worked on a
project where you know someone pointed
out to me uh the template system itself
is kind of like a component like a web
component right so you can actually
drill down and have you know form field
be a component if you wanted to just by
putting it in its own template and you
can have helpers and whatnot and events
kind of triggering on that and you know
he pointed out that anytime you're
you're working with something like if
you have to say this dot then you know
maybe maybe you can take it down to like
even further to being its own template
so that's exactly how you that's exactly
how our parent component framework works
is built out of templates ya hecho make
sense love it what all right next
question another one from Ben Strahan he
he wants to know what are some of the
helpful packages you guys would
recommend or that you guys rely on every
day
so let me just pull up the listing so
that we don't say anything kind of
incorrect we want material where we're
telling you exactly what it is um I
think uh there's stuff that we wrote
ourselves one of those one of those pack
packages that we wrote ourselves is the
dr. Pangloss admin dr. Pangloss is my
name it's a way to run a code against
your server I from web inspector instead
of from meteor shower your shell is
great but if you use a hosting provider
like modulus where you don't have meteor
shell and if you want to use the
niceties of rendering um something like
an object using web inspector which is
far more pleasant to use and text
interface uh the admin package is far in
a way what you want to use on it's it's
something that we use every single day
all of our developers use it it makes a
huge difference in the experience of
interacting with your server doing
moderation tasks anything where you need
this sort of access of course on our
platform it is secured only to a handful
of users but it lets you control exactly
how this works a little so it's possible
to have this sort of functionality in a
live environment um in terms of the
packages that we use in our project
right now we get a lot out of Khedira
kadir as a service is really great it
instruments your puff subs really well
it tells you about errors it has great
tracing it's really a very mature way to
instrument your sign on in terms of
small kinds of features on the front end
that we definitely use okay grows
iron-router autoscroll you might notice
that there's problems with your
experience with scrolling when you
switch between pages when you use
iron-router they fix that multiply
iron-router progress gives you a little
loading bar at the top these little
things make feel like they're very small
but it's the difference between a
ten-thousand-dollar website and a
multi-hundred million dollar website so
it's worth it to use all the packages
that give you ux details for so cheaply
because their impact makes you feel like
you're using a much bigger website and
then on the back end right the packages
that we really love is a percolates to
do you guys are the best migrations
that's we're running all our migrations
to that and I know there are a lot of
background job packages coming out I
know our nodeb makes 11 in his blue
proof class and all that but we've stuck
with Synchron Synchron by percolate
that's really been like with us for a
while now it's doing everything that we
wanted it to which is always the best
the problem with some packages is like
they lose support or people that lose
like passion in their package but with
these things like they built it in such
a way that you know it's going to work
for a while so that's great um and then
in terms of like packages that we've
built I think it's only been a couple
but then if you want to talk about the
method hooks there's also the method
hooks package this is dr. Pangloss
method hooks I know a lot of people may
need to extend meteor packages for
example you might want to you might want
to do something after user has reset a
password and the best place to do that
is after the reset password method is
called this lets us deal with a lot of
the accounts methods and then when we
import other packages and they define
methods we often don't want to
necessarily change the source code or go
through that over tomorrow a lot of what
we can achieve our with method hooks we
plan to also move all of our migration
all of our M
politics to inspect method arguments and
method results can figure out what
analytic events a call so as a kind of
intellectual problem we think method
books are as useful as uh all the
different hooking projects are we've
seen yeah yeah that's so true because I
mean so to your point like the the
account creation there's like a there's
one method hook in there but you can
only define it once and then like if you
define it again you're overriding it so
like you can't chain that that guy
together so that's definitely a good
point and I mean it's totally useful to
be able to run something when a user's
being created and I think you're
absolutely right being able to put in a
you know your own method hooks like that
that's pretty awesome nice um any
packages that you want to select
spotlight uh yeah for me um I don't know
I uh I used to use my own sweet but as
you guys pointed out like sometimes
people lose passion or they just don't
have the time to work on it anymore and
so like not being at differential like I
haven't had the time you know like most
of my clients are existing apps rather
than greenfield apps so I find myself
relying more on you know Otto form and
user accounts so you know that kind of
superseded accounts entry for me so yeah
I mean that's kind of where I'm at I
guess a one that I love is a moment
which I mean isn't meteor specific but I
love having like the moment libraries is
really awesome to me and I love being
able to rely on that yeah every time uh
yeah all right let's see if we got any
more questions
oh this is an interesting one again from
Ben Strahan he's going to ask all the
questions what is the your vc investors
like what is their opinion of building a
company around mediator and was there a
struggle there like getting funding to
you know for the company because you had
chosen to work with me here or was it
easier I don't know um I think Dan
shaunak was our lead investor Trinity
who led our series a UH he has said very
publicly that he has never seen a
startup uh build something the velocity
as we have and he understands that a lot
of that has to do with our choice of
meteor this is the guy who is also a his
portfolio of companies include work up
compose a new relic and docker uh we are
kind of the odd man out in a highly
technical portfolio and I think a lot of
that comes from understanding how
innovative meteor is and how essential
it is to UM the general way of building
startups in order to find market fit you
have to work very very quickly and we
think that the kinds of investors you
want to work with we really loved an
hour the kind who are technically savvy
enough to really understand the economic
advantages of having a fast platform and
will understand what the real obstacles
scaling are in our particular case there
are only so many jobs and there are only
so much odd seekers in the United States
when you reach that scale there is a
possibility that we will change
platforms but it looks more likely than
not but that by the time that we do will
be prepared with meteor as a platform to
become the basis of a wholly scaled very
poor
insight are tens of millions of people
every day and that's our objective and
we think we've made the right back ace
ultram see one of the questions do you
have ah another one from Ben but equally
good what do you find the challenge is
to be when hiring for media itself i
know we we talked a little bit about it
early on but i'd love to hear like what
are you guys finding specifically
challenging about hiring meteor people
um i think in general are our goals to
hire a players and one of the tricky
things with building web apps is that
there's a difference between somebody
who's a real a player and somebody moves
a market a player in other words I
you've already figured out the market so
to speak has already figured out who the
very very best developers on and it's
it's very challenging to attract all of
the very best talent you want to find
people who are not always market a's but
our real eggs you want to find all of
the diamonds in the rough so to speak
and one of the great things about meteor
is that the kind of person whom the
market hasn't figured out yet but it's
also extremely talented is attracted to
meteor by virtue of how new it is its
concepts and it's a lack of major
commercial adoption so what we get from
using meteors of platform with respect
to recruiting is that people who are
good at meteor tend to be really really
good because if you're using meteor and
you're forgoing commercial opportunities
to be a full-time angular developer or a
full-time background developer or maybe
you're just a back-end developer a giant
companies using javascript if you've
made the decision to use me hear you're
really good
edit you've taken a big risk so in one
sense recruiting definitely becomes
easier because it identifies a players
for you in a way that the market cannot
on the other hand as the site starts to
mature we definitely need people who are
really really experienced with meteor in
the same way the name give our site we
need people really really experience for
the angular we can't find those people
because platform has not been around for
very long they're just very rare and
that definitely means our approaches
around training and about onboarding we
have a phenomenal guy who joined us from
who joined us on our iOS team Alex Cora
who has never been a full-time back-end
developer but because he is an
all-around phenomenally good developer
he can really quickly start contributing
to our code base building out features
working independently we think that
we're meteor shines is taking people or
very strong in a strictly programming
sense besides just a design
architectural sense and give them a way
to be engaged with back-end development
with business development in a way that
you otherwise couldn't with other
technologies it's works with our
philosophy that everybody ought to be
able to do everything if they're
talented enough to do so we really
believe that every person who joins work
off ought to be able to start their own
startup know how to build it not just
from a sense of technology but also from
a business development sense that you
can make the right decisions about what
is economically valuable or not to do
and we like the meteor because of its
flexibility and simplicity really
supports economic thinking it helps you
iterate and that is the basis of all of
our success nice yeah so you know that
interesting you bring that up like you
you guys hired an iOS guy and he's
contributing to the backend and I I've
given a talk like you know what I've
learned from my year with meteor and one
of the key points in that talk is the
fact that it's just JavaScript
and you know I always joke that
javascript is like a gateway drug right
and if you look like you've got you know
when you talk to a designer who's who
can do HTML and CSS right like they're
they're a front end guy and they can do
that chances are they've started to
dabble into jquery and they know a
little JavaScript and you know in my
experience the the two designers that
I've worked with because they had some
JavaScript knowledge some jQuery
knowledge from trying to build more
interactive front ends they feel
comfortable actually starting to dabble
into the back end of the code and I know
right now like the the one designer I've
worked with is actually building an
entire analytical you know Instagram
analytical application on his own and
none of the developers are really
helping him there like giving him little
hints here and there but you know it's
all him it's all JavaScript and you know
he's just able to to do that I mean
which is amazing to me yeah that's
awesome that's watching yeah so good
points all right ah we might have time
for one more let's see if there is any
more it's like there aren't looks like
we answered them all uh yeah so I mean
if I know I get a lot of questions like
I'm always looking for meteor work do
you guys hire remotely or is it an
on-site thing for you guys or we have
been working with okay grow to do some
work and we've had a phenomenally good
experience with them we definitely are
always open to anybody who is super
talented and who can't move to LA la is
a fantastic place so contrary to what
your expectations would be of the second
largest city in the United States that
is the cultural center of the world I
you know you're you if you come visit us
you'll want to live here and often Utley
want to bring more full-time people on
board
we're always hiring we're we're as
sincere for the people that we serve as
we are for ourselves so I really want
uh-uh anyone who feels like they want to
work at the fastest-growing meteor
startup fastest-growing la startup come
to Los Angeles come join us we were
always open to talk to anybody we have a
great coding challenge to that I love to
love to give out and and we love to talk
on the phone and do interviews nice and
so if people are interested where would
they go to kind of get in touch with you
guys so all our our jobs are posted on
Angel list we use that predominantly and
then you can always email careers at
work pop com send it to your resume a
little bit about yourself and will
respond to you with the challenge and
then that's where the recruiting process
starts nice la is awesome and we're not
like if for us to build like a really
great team I do believe that we all need
to be you know centralized and together
but you know when you get really great
people they could be in like Nicaragua
or whatever you're not gonna you're not
going to put that you no restriction on
that if they're amazing so like to the
people out there or anybody who would
like to apply to us if you're a really
talented guy don't worry about anything
about la just worry about getting
through the challenge getting through
anything talking to us whatever we're
always available to talk I always go on
the meteor IRC channel go and talk to me
there you want to email me I'll be at
work pop abhi at work huh I answer any
questions when I go to the IRC channel I
give out my email like every time so ask
anybody ask me questions it's all good
and then Ethan you can to careers I read
you know you'll you'll know you'll
respond to everybody its own leg off
don't stress about it nothing is a black
hole with us alright well thanks for uh
