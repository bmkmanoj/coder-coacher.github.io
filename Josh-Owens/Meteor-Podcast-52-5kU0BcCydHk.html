everybody 26 2015 doing it a day early
welcome me to your fans i'm your host
josh owens along with my special guest
host sashko hello sup welcome so I'm
here in San Francisco and I thought I'd
grab some people and sasha cohen we
could talk about meteor 1.1 which should
be coming out at some point in the next
month or two i would think yeah
hopefully pretty soon and we're working
on nice so um like what's the what's the
big focus for 141 yeah so i think the
two big focuses for 1.1 the biggest one
will be windows support which is really
really exciting I think for new users
and for us so we can get more users
using meteor but probably not super
exciting who are using on their math for
those people we have the constraint
solver coming out properly which is
going to make running your app a lot
faster if you have a lot of different
package dependencies now so we'll be
able to more reliably cut fit those
faster and uh yeah David means fans give
me big talk about that today during a
dive shop yeah I love the name too many
sad right minisite yeah so many set i
think is the name of the library we're
using which is like a generic common
solver so basically it's like we take
all the constraints you have from all
packages you installed and we pipe them
into like industrial grade like c++
library like people use for like really
hardcore things nice cuz ya cuz before
we're trying to do like different your
mistakes like just some some code that
we wrote but it turns out that you need
like a real solution to get things right
and I think we're we're pretty much
ahead of the curve on that as far as I
can tell and in terms of like JavaScript
package managers because all the other
ones do multiple loading instead wooden
is they just load both versions of the
package right but we're trying to keep
it just in golden crown yeah yeah
resultant
so on the windows support that's
something that you and Tom I've been
working on pretty much exclusively yeah
so that's been a main project for for me
and saw for a while and that obvious
journey just recently as well okay so
there's been definitely a lot of
challenges there like I think we didn't
think it would take as long as it does
but the there's a lot of unforeseen
things were just like no we did the
right thing and calm enough on the nose
yes you have to like hack around those
things yeah like if you google around
and you're like oh how do I run nodejs
on Windows like a lot of boys like you
don't just do it oh yeah so there's
definitely been some some hurdles to
overcome mmm yeah yeah sama was telling
me apparently like there's a character
limit on Windows like you can only have
250 characters and a file path and then
it just like silently says that i copied
a file or something and then like it
just doesn't work and yeah so the song
with some combination of like different
AP is that we use we're like sometimes
you just end up with a file a missing
and like you find out when it tries to
require something is just not there so
that's actually a big problem for NPM as
well so we at least 4 i'm not sure of
this is just for core packages or if
we're going to do this for every package
but we have to do some things around
trying to flatten them p.m. file
structure a lot because it tends to
create like super nested trees or like
every package has dependencies and all
those dependencies have their own
dependencies and that doesn't go well
when you have a hard limit on your file
path sighs I think what other kinds of
challenges have you guys like run into
but come slow down um there's I mean
there's all the like classic windows
things where like all the other elder
slashes are pointing the wrong direction
they're all in Milan a snooze backslash
instead of forward slashes there's
there's like some really like intense
things like for example Windows doesn't
have signals for communicating between
processes yeah so we use that for
reliably like shutting down MongoDB we
use that we used to use that for like
only refreshing the client when you only
change like CSS or something yeah so we
had to rewrite that to use like a
different mechanism on windows because
what it just doesn't have that feature
among other things like that so one of
the I know there's been some people that
have been trying i like the developer
and all that stuff and one of the
complaints i heard was that the this was
probably like a month ago that Windows
support was kind of slow is that this is
something that's faster now or yeah so
we I mean we've been working on like
incrementally like we have like
different sub-projects of the project
basically so before then we didn't work
on prom so we're just working on
anything to run um now yeah we spend a
little time like optimizing performance
and it's about like ten times faster
based on people's reports on the Godot
issues so it's now like in the same
realm of speed as the normal
distribution on Linux Mac um yeah the
biggest problem was that there's another
thing that Windows doesn't have the
capability to make siblings between
files mm so you kind of can but you have
to be an administrator on a computer and
like we can't require people have that
so yeah so before we were just copying a
bunch of files instead of sim linking
but then we like it some other happy
things so now my copy all those files to
this last bastard or a lot faster nice
okay yeah it's just been like a wild
relative like think about all of the
ways that an operating system can be
different and like they're all true yeah
i mean like going you know linux unix
magmic they're just all kind of the same
under the hood windows is so different
yeah it's weird like I think you don't
really see it as a consumer like I
really like using Windows personally
like
before I started working or actually is
when it was primarily but when you want
to develop any kind of software for you
really feel that allure like like
they've had to maintain backwards
compatibility across like you know
however many 20 years at this point or
something and so like everything is just
like super super super old or has like a
million special cases like the file path
limit like they could just decided some
point just make like files infinitely
long and like that's what linux did as
far as i know but they didn't because
like then we'll really old programs with
break that life depended on that limits
so hopefully no meteor won't run into
the same problem like we need to be able
to change things about being shackled
like something 20 years old so like in
all honesty you spend like probably a
month getting into working on like four
months on edge cases because of wipeouts
weirdness yeah something like that um
yeah i mean we there's a big thing which
is for a lot of people is going to be
their first impression of meteor and we
don't want people to try running it and
then have it be just like broken some
stupid way and then just I've never
looked at it again yeah that's why we
want to be really careful yeah
everything best I mean that's definitely
the meteor way like I was talking to
someone earlier today and you know we
were talking about some people need me
to yellow frustrated that may be updates
they'll come out fast enough but you
know I think I said the meteor way that
is like the meticulous way you know like
you guys really put out a quality
release every time something new comes
out and like it shows and it's it's
worth taking the time yeah I think
that's the goal like a lot of times we
really look to the community to pick up
the slack on like because I think
there's there's a lot of packages in
community that like they really work for
things but they might like they work for
like eighty percent of people or
something like maybe there's some
feature that they don't have but like
it's okay because you know like when you
look at a package that you're about to
use like check like what things that
does all things that doesn't do um I
think it's a little different like when
we release something
official because then people expect like
a whole new level of like there's like
some small thing that's broken about
ain't no we're gonna have like a bunch
of github issues about it yeah and if to
maintain it basically forever um so we
want to like get it right the first time
so people can trust things they're
really nice so uh the kiddo issues hey
oh really the github issues I heard
something in trusting you guys have a
tool that you built right to lay on the
edge issues now that's true um yeah I
think at some point we're probably going
to make it may be public so that people
can see what we're doing on there
awesome but yeah the point is like get
up is a great place to keep information
because everyone can see it but it's not
always the best place to like manage
that information hmm like yeah you guys
are you do anything like like you've got
a dashboard and says like you know this
ticket is the oldest ticket and the last
response was not from mdg or something
editor knee yeah so we want to make sure
we can always fix all the issues
immediately we want to make sure that we
start doing a better job with replying
to things um so it's been a big concern
for David Glasser yeah like he's always
like a front of his mind is always like
how we can can you give over the
community mm-hm um yes we want at least
like you aware of all the issues and
respond to them and we went to be able
to fix everything at once but least were
like trying yeah no it's awesome i'm
glad to see which i had an issue from
may 2013 and it was my my first meteor
app and i dropped in like a four gig
file and it broke meteor because if I
get up I it's not using streaming and it
was too big load in the memory all at
once and uh like I for the longest time
that thing was just out there i forgot
about it's dead and then like all of a
sudden probably a month ago like blessed
respondent it categorized it and I was
like oh that's weird yeah yeah but
that's awesome i'm glad you guys are
like really making that effort yeah i
really wish there were more tools out
there for like open source
look especially when you least at our
scale and we're like not even that big
maybe some other ones that are out there
oh I totally agree like that I'm
honestly I I'm in awe of like Sasha and
chris mader because the amount of like
volume of email that they get just from
like issues yeah flooding into their
open source projects it's just
staggering to me like i was doing
accounts entry for a long time and even
then like you know i would have enough
power to to spend a week on it and you
know I felt like I spent a lot of that
time just kind of managing issues not
really running code yeah it's like it's
a lot harder if it's not a full time job
to do it that definitely helps a little
bit but like yeah I think I think it's
not worth to get out of time really
because probably like ninety-nine
percent of losing and I'm not doing
something like that mm you know then for
that like one percent or ten percent
whatever like there's fuels popping up
like I've start using this thing called
Zen hub a little bit hmm which is like
basically lets you categorize your
issues and kind of cottrell Oh type one
format so that's been cool but even that
doesn't work very well when you have
like 3,000 issues are like better see
you guys I mwah yeah definitely no this
is awesome i'm glad you guys are are
making that effort so uh the other
interesting thing that's going to drop
in 11 is some of the template
subscription stuff right thank you press
yeah uh yeah that actually might even be
sooner might be like one point no point
for oh ok yeah I really want to get that
up as soon as possible because i have a
blog post waiting on that can I everyone
like a couple weeks ago yeah and it
mentions that stuff but I can't really
host it unless it's released so yeah
yeah well yeah I love the the medium
post you did just kind of saying like
this is coming like that's pretty
awesome to see yeah I really want to do
more of that kind of stuff because um
yeah I think we could we could
definitely have more like communication
in both directions yes yeah for sure and
come on that was awesome yeah yeah I'm
also really really
about the new forum thing how just
launched yesterday yeah because i guess
i guess that is like the one piece of
good news right forum stop Mediacom yeah
so you know it remains to be seen like
exactly how that will interact with
things like creator Idaho like I guess
there's like a gator have room and chat
about stuff there's also a stack
overflow for questions so we'll see like
where it settles like what stuff people
post their yeah but any case it's a lot
better than the mailing list that's for
sure this panelist yes yeah I was pretty
bad like I switch to the daily digest on
that thing like probably one of six
eight months ago and even then like I
sometimes only Rita just because I know
half of its gonna be spam yeah I just
have like a deep distrust of mailing
list because like I graduated from MIT
party recently and they use mailing list
for everything every club has like ten
mailing lists you know like for every
topic like people just make me in Lisp
like their friend group so you get like
that was an emails like an hour so I
just don't want him a life is good Joey
which media yeah no I totally really
like I had a six-hour layover and it's
like was crazy because I had 750 ml my
inbox and I got it down to like 48 oh my
god but now I'm like putting the crap
out of all my subscriptions it's like
I'm agreed this so it's like go on at my
legs now yeah so the more the more I can
put in places that aren't my email box
better yeah and also like a government
so something interesting already happen
today like with the forums someone and
said hey like I want to be more like
quality video for stuff but I love your
recommendations and they actually like
they tagged Chris and I and it chrisman
and I an oval I like I haven't actually
paid attention to the forums today but
because he tagged me it didn't come in a
pine box and I I wouldn't respond to do
that so that's cool yeah you definitely
can't really I guess you could like see
see someone an email but it's not really
same yeah no that'll be great I that one
I think you know that with the mailing
list they might not know like I publish
my email address
I can so people can reach me but that
doesn't mean they're unifying to be
there so yeah me curry I think this
course has some sort of functionality
around like listing like really active
users of people community life discover
someone people where I could in
communities cool they have just like a
boatload of features like everything
every time I gone there just never liked
some new button not just some stuff yeah
I mean I need to figure out like I want
to see the while the commenting is a
threaded thing figured out if you can do
that yet yeah it's all it's interesting
like you reply to an individual comment
and it also goes the bottom of the
screen yeah which is weird to me yeah
the other the other thing that I'm
exactly sure about is the there's no
really like uploading mechanism mm-hmm
like it's all just like a chronological
list yeah which is like no worse than
the mailing list used to be but it's
also like I'm a big fan of reddit uh-huh
I'm like my ideal world reviewers like
we delete everything you just use the
gears I read it but yeah that's not
happening but let's do pull my family
over trade or something well yeah i
don't know i think it's just like keep
cool or like employees of ngmg don't use
that reddit that much I'm slopping I
like it away at but there wasn't that
much activity yeah yeah I think like
probably different you were social
networks we have the better just weak in
like I don't have to go to like 10 from
websites to see what's going on yeah
that'll be really great that's a lot of
work yeah i've already i have to like
you know go to like my two different
email address it it is like one get out
of notifications like all that stuff
very true that true yeah all right um I
think that's it like that current most
of what's coming up cool how do you
tease but that's like once a week yeah
once a week usually it's ryan i'm like
someone suggest sir just read over to
the crater podcast because we talked
about like top stories I'm crater oh it
wasn't that kind of thing no but uh he
Kate and I'm at all did a guest episode
they sent us a clip and we put that out
as long oh wait yeah I was a lot of fun
um that was the last time you know yeah
i've been i just posted a thing on
forum like an hour ago asking people
like what kinds of things are interested
in having screencasts or blog post about
so yeah I guess in response there and
I'll maybe do some stuff with that
that's awesome alright well thank you
for coming over man yeah thanks for
having me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
