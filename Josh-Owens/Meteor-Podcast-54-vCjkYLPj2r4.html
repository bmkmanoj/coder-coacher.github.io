twentieth 2015 local meteor fans i'm
your host Josh Owens along with my
co-host rye Walker welcome to the show
rye thank you sir all right ah so this
week we're going to talk about a meteor
update Hacker News crater materialized
and how data flows alrighty so yeah I
don't know we've got we've got the one
sponsor modulus you guys know who they
are come on if you're not use a modulus
some wrong with you I'm just gonna say
it hey uh yeah so have you done anything
he's signing this rule this week right
uh yeah I have actually never blog post
right yeah I wrote I wrote a blog post
on air pear got on hacker news Ellen
hacker was like yeah the funny thing
about that one is I gave up on it
yesterday I was like a 35 and then it
dropped a 45 and like 47 and I was like
all right it games over I you know I
shut it down and I left today and then
it like whatever 530 yeah so I guess I
left early we had a the guys were
playing um um this is the CEO of air
pear you know you fight interact with
him on their slack he he's like a check
out hacker news are like what you know
so be awesome I don't know how that what
it is it was me I'm went up voted in
like ten boats you know it i get i get
like zero votes because i've been
blacklisted or something you know my
theory on that is i think that they have
like points per user like some people
are 10x and some people are one-tenth
you know oh yeah yeah that was when I
bet you like a big guy I went in and
voted it up like nose point I'm thinking
you know if I uploaded it and boom bitch
yes that was fun but hey Ronen besides
that yeah all kinds of stuff going on
but how about you would you do this week
oh gosh I just wrapped up a training
session
oh that reminds me when are we having a
new podcast soon listener nation uh we
are just it too we broke 250 on the
patreon so if you go to
patreon.com/scishow club you can join
the slack chat room is gangbusters it's
actually kind of crazy in there it's
awesome a lot a lot of discussions going
on will actually touch on some of that
this week with some of these these
topics but yeah so now I'm like trying
to play in that and like I said just
finished the first part of the training
class today for a bunch of guys and then
did the will give a shout out to Paul
downman he he did a meteor interviews
calm and he interviewed me and I think
it was pretty good um talked a lot about
why I'm teaching and that kind of thing
so i don't know maybe it was boring yeah
but something big happened to meteor
this week right yeah yeah so 104 came
out and then 1041 came out and then
today 1042 came out and maybe at the
rate we're going we'll see one of four
three tomorrow yeah yeah so I think the
the first breakage was it had something
to do with the deploying maybe or
building i don't know i didn't read that
one and then the one today there was
there was problems with cordova so they
did it part of the upgrade was you know
they went from cordova I've got it up
here my notes Cordova 351 till 420 so
it's a big Cordova upgrade they've made
some changes based on you know I think
we've talked about it before but they've
made some changes based on like you have
to specify domains and an access rule
now because there was a bug there's like
a huge security hole and Android
apparently with Cordova I think the
interesting thing and the big thing and
the thing I want to know like you know
what what's mdg really doing here is
with the template level subscriptions
that was added as well
and you know it's it's starting to get
interesting because you can have your
templates do the subscribing to data
itself and you know you don't have to
worry about the router necessarily doing
it anymore and so it feels like they're
starting to cannibalize little pieces of
iron router and so we were actually in
the chat room with sashko and slava in
the telescope chat room and we were
talking about the release and you know
where they kind of see it going and how
should mdg handle iron-router versus you
know now flow routers out I didn't put
that in the notes this week but flow
routers out to so you know like how do
we how do we reason about this how do we
figure out how to go forward how do we
do something there you know because
you've got something like user accounts
or Houston and they rely on iron-router
and you know now we've got flow router
and now you know subscriptions are
happening in a different way depending
on if you use it or not like you know
what is this all gonna go that's what I
wanna know yeah I mean it's hard to
predict that of course yeah it is it is
so are you planning on changing where
you do subscriptions then based on the
new release you know it was interesting
I think Aaron Oda kind of hit it on the
head when he talked about like I think
there are times where you need to make
the subscriptions on in your router and
there are times where you need to make
this subscription and you know at the
template level and like even today
thinking about the class like could I
refactor in like we're grabbing tweets
but the tweets are different based on
which route you're on so when you're on
like you know we build a Twitter clone
and so when you're on the Twitter page
you want to see all the tweets that are
people that you followed what is when
you're on the profile page you only want
to see the tweets for the person that
you're looking at and so those are two
very different kind of subscription
calls and I don't think I could make
those at the template hobo well okay so
it's not a not a panacea it's not an end
all but it's definitely really really
interesting to think about it um you
know I I think there are good use cases
for it I just haven't seen too many like
right off the top of my head right now
that I would refactor yeah yeah that's
an interesting thing um yeah and then I
guess the other kind of awesome thing is
they're claiming they saw a 10x speed up
they 10x all your Mongo queries for you
apparently well yeah I mean it's we can
all be 10x developers as soon as soon as
it came out I like I have problems with
the blogs being behind problem yeah yeah
my precious yeah and on a couple of our
apps and I haven't tested it yet but I
like immediately is like I deployed
hoping that I'll never have to see that
problem again you know one of those
things that you only see those problems
when you see them you know so well so
you'll notice when it happens though
because your cpu usage will spike when
the up log backlog pressure or whatever
they call it kicks in then basically
you'll see a bunch of people switch to
like poland diff alright i guess you'll
just see the server switch to pull and
it but um you know you'll see a big
spike in cpu usage because it's reef
etching data and getting the updates
that way you're saying with an update at
with the update where we're going to see
cpu chumps when it's getting slow what
are you saying it used to okay yeah yeah
yeah because the whole idea behind ah
blog was to limit like lower your cpu
usage and make it a little more a little
more real-time than the you know five or
ten second op poland if was before so
yeah yeah okay got it all right oh the
next topic after news so our first topic
I know it's also a second third topic
yeah so on yesterday it was yesterday on
hacker news someone said is meteor
chance but sure enough to use is the big
applications do you know like like lob
that up in the air right and of course
the first guy I don't was the first guy
with a
was a guy who who came in with kind of a
negative view point on it and then the
meteor mafia showed up and is funny just
like seeing these user names among okay
yeah i think we gained tackle these
people didn't we yeah yeah definitely
it's funny to watch the flow of it to
lake yeah in the telescope slack chat
room and Sasha posted it there and there
was like a little bit of discussion and
and then I went over and commented on it
and then like Sasha posted on crater and
then like a bunch of other people
started flowing in the thing I love
about this is number one it's evidence
that there's a community now around
meteor that's passionate about it
obviously in it and then we kind of like
won the battle you know like the pro
meteor people won the battle past like
take a year ago I post on some made
front page on hacker news about meteor
it was gonna be pretty damn negative you
know like on average yeah so I love the
fact that I mean it wasn't a big battle
I think there's only how many comments
on this like 56 comments 50 points it
wasn't a big post but it's nice to see
that we at least one this little battle
the pro meteor sediment kind of won out
over the negative meteor sediments yeah
definitely and I mean you know here's
the thing like I I made a comment on
this this guy oh it looks like Ben Ben
Strahan made a comment as well and he
got voted up a lot more um yeah it's
just like you could tell this guy this
Alexander is just someone who maybe use
meteor once or twice or you know maybe
even tried it for a project and then
left you know I'm probably left a while
ago and I just don't like he says bad
routing support like I would not call
iron-router bad routing support and
there are alternatives out there now
right like flow routers out just just
like the day before this came out like
who shut up and then um you know there's
plenty of packages and so like
everything he pointed at like no i 18 n
support like I was like there's already
packages to take care of that and his
point was well they're not official and
you know to me like why do we keep
talking about official things there
few things that I think meteor as an
official maintainer should create or do
one of them I do think is a router and
the other one is like database drivers
you know and outside of that I don't
really care if it's official or not like
do so are you saying because it's
official you just trust the code and you
don't audit it or because it's
unofficial like they take us into
auditing time quite like a Microsoft
developer you know that's that's what
Ben said down in his comment like yeah
are you a do not net dev because it
sounds like you're not an open source
dude yeah because I mean seriously like
you know he says something in the
comments about how you know a project
manager will be raffling hearing these
words about the external Package system
like no no not at all i think if you're
going to use a package you should
absolutely learn how to read that code
and understand what's going on but at
the same time there are plenty of people
right now relying on like simple schemin
auto for more user accounts or any of
this stuff you know like this is pretty
good the thing to like again they
actually believe that meteor should have
less packages on a scientist this
package isn't that artificial it
shouldn't be like bootstrap ish type
stuff you know yeah they're loose my
shower okay good alright so um yeah but
there's things that they had to do
initially just to make the stack fool
enough to be useful and there's no
there's no way to know like you note so
they did take the five packages that he
said they should do then there's another
new top five that should be incorporated
into core right and so core gets bloated
under his worldview and I don't think
any of us would really want that no
because I mean we need to have this
choice down the road so no outing is not
yes okay we we know that I mean all you
meteor people out here understand why
having a single router wouldn't be the
right thing for us you know it's just
it's just that's not a I guess there was
a time where maybe I was like this is
weird like rails has a router like chose
to do but I see now why it makes sense
to not have that I mean you know I go
either way on that
I think you know server-side rendering
and routing should be something that
fall under meteor in my opinion like
just looking at how react works I think
it makes sense you know but yeah yeah
again and then and then what what else
yeah good so my initial response to just
this thread in general not that not the
hater um was that yeah there are plenty
of big people out there doing it right
like I've talked to I've interviewed
class craft on the QA I've talked to mix
not mix max but uh work pop trying to
get mixed max on the QA to talk about
like scaling and that kind of thing like
these people are building when they're
building big teams and to their building
big apps that need to scale right so
you're talking about is it good enough
for building big applications absolutely
I think so there are teams that are
learning how to work together in a media
environment in a scalable way in my
opinion and then you're also you have
teams that are working together to build
a scalable app that will you know handle
the concurrent you know the thousand two
thousand concurrent connections that you
might be dealing with so I don't know
yeah right one jump to talk about this
massive crater thread yeah redesign yeah
this is like the biggest crater topic
ever so really if I put up a topic that
said what do you think of the new
telescope remove it against all right
nice feature is you say what you guys
think this is I like everybody's got an
opinion on that especially especially
because it was a it's kind of a risky
design right it is it is it was a huge
departure yeah and I love it by the way
I don't think I even commented on this
thing but I like the designs nice yeah
so I mean there were there were two big
goals here um I guess there were three
goals Nick this one but um one was to
kind of read his on it make it feel less
like telescope and more like its own
thing to bringing in line with my meteor
club branding so that's why why purple
you know oh and you know but we didn't
want it to feel the same so we ditched
the original kind of fireball logo and
didn't use the meteor club land Nick
made his own rendition of a kind of a
meteor coming down to earth
and you know the other one was maybe
have a spot for ads so we still have to
figure that one out got to decide if
that's interesting and if thats painted
this uh and interesting at all to the
community right I don't know how much
hate I'd get for that if I did it but
you know I just I was talking to someone
the other day and they pointed out like
carbon ads approached me and they're
like oh I'd love to put ads on your site
it's like do i do i do that do not do
that like so right now i'm probably
paying on the order of like going back
to scaling talks hang on the order of a
28 bucks to run crater a month and
that's 110 dollar digitalocean slice and
then one $18 composed i oh slice and you
know we're doing something around
400,000 page views a month and yeah i
don't know like we're easily like it's
not even breaking a sweat handling like
150 concurrent users so quite scalable
um but yeah i know i love the new design
like Nick used he didn't ask me this but
he used two fonts that I actually love
railway and Roboto and we didn't even
talk about ahead of time but like I've
got three favorite fonts and that's two
of them he's like he's a mind reader
stuff yes he is yeah um but it has been
you know a little it was a little choppy
it still there's still little bugs that
we're trying to work out and honestly
like we've learned a lot about creator
or telescope designs like it's probably
a bad idea for you to make your own
forum designs because you know those
things change a lot whereas the there's
not a ton of changes that happen to the
main pages so when you make your own
design you've kind of got to keep in
step with what Sasha's doing with
telescope
so just something to consider when
you're doing that kind of thing oh yeah
interesting all right let's go let's go
the next topic which is materialized
this is a blog post that before you
shared it with me today are you saying
and seeing this no I hadn't wow this
should be interesting oh yeah now this
is a cool post by name Thank that's in
the design Creator works here at
differential talking about material
design and the easiest way to get to
that and you know mentions polymer which
of course i'm using polymer it's kind of
a touchy subject around here somewhere
house divided on on that we're a house
to buy it on con coffeescript versus
JavaScript to you know but um it's a I
think it's great it's like basically
yeah the interesting thing I would throw
out as I i just recently I don't know if
you start new apps lately Josh like
Greenfield like let's do a new media rap
for me that decision I was going to try
to do that I actually started it earlier
this week okay I'm gonna make this new
app and I'm like ah that's why when he's
homered do I want to use materialized so
I want to use user accounts because I'm
i was an account entry person right yeah
yeah i should i use that i should use
the differential boilerplate in a poor
search javascript in there so that's a
negative for me and then it didn't have
polymer so I'm like okay don't learn all
those other stuff oh my god man this is
gonna be starting to be a tough time to
jump in the media it's not as simple as
it was two years ago when we started you
know truth i'm trekking with bootstrap
era but are you using materialize i have
not used it worse we're still like the
designer that i work with is mostly
centered around materialized i've been
using for the client project i'm on i'm
using ionic but I I am I don't know like
I'm divided on material design like I
like the Google Maps app on my phone but
at the same time I'm not sure I'm
entirely sold on inbox by Google and I
think some of that is
material design right like I I i prefer
the maybe the completely flat look that
inbox or mailbox gives me so I mean we
tried the calendar up the google
calendar app i have i have not yet i
should i should ask tell that because i
use google calendar yeah just don't just
on iOS I mean it's another like perfect
example of material design if again not
saying the material design is perfect
but they implemented it perfectly within
this app so if you're looking for more
information to make a decision one way
or another I you know it's in his price
plate definitely flavor the month sort
of thing like bootstrap was huge a
couple years ago and this is to me like
kind of like the next bootstrap in a
sense yeah but I wonder if it's gonna
get his biggest bootstrap right like you
you're gonna have fragmentation in the
market like you already have foundation
of bootstrap and clearly bootstrap in my
mind was the winner but well you know I
how many like how many people are just
gonna stay with bootstrap or stay with
foundation rather than move to
materialize you know I think it's really
just you know kind of high-end high-end
developers to get bored of doing same
 you know for multiple years and
they look for something new to do and I
think that's one of the reasons why
we're i'm over on that I like the new
shiny things yeah and a lot of you know
again a lot of smart developers that you
know there's gonna be on the edge of
things this is more edgy than the
bootstrap for sure yeah I definitely see
like the interesting thing is with
polymer right like I could see like
making that switch personally because
there's a lot of UI stuff that comes
with that there's not just just some
design stuff there's a lot of reactivity
that kind of happens in there as well
yeah so yeah yeah so if you're if you're
looking to test that material design go
to this blog post and and it's just get
kind of gives you the quick overview of
the things you can do there the main
parts of materialize what do you have
that's the last topic here yeah data
flow from the database to the UI so
first off you should go look at this
article because that looks like a
delicious cake at the top and guys it's
got little butterflies on it
and I mean who doesn't like butterflies
the prod candy know so it's a lot of
this is talking about the new the stuff
we kind of talked about before the new
subscription stuff you know and and yeah
I like this number one I love when tosh
go write stuff like keep writing stuff /
go um I assume he listens to this but he
definitely talks about like you need to
think about in your publication on the
server right not not in your client
you're doing it wrong if you think about
security in the client and so you should
only be looking up a returning data that
the user has access to from the
publication and make sure that it's
granular that's what you should be most
concerned about performance is in your
publication and then you know he kind of
walks you through how you can subscribe
to a task list and he she seen current
data ID where is that coming from so he
makes the SUBSCRIBE call and its tasks
in list and um I don't know what that
current data is coming from yeah I don't
know is that it must be a method on
template that I'm not aware of yeah I'm
assuming that's like the data context
that's being said but I don't see what
he's setting that anywhere but anyway I
you know I'm assuming that somehow
that's getting set to like a task ID a
to-do list ID that kind of thing and he
just walks you through how you don't
have to worry about having a global
loading template anymore you know like
your to-do list can have an individual
loading template Oh or a loading kind of
block and and so you you know it's kind
of weird because if you wait on all the
data and iron-router you just end up
with this blank page do all this data
synchronizing over where is in reality
we don't have to do that with meteor you
only need to wait on the key data and
you could have one little loading
section and you know the rest of the
page could be filling in with stuff and
mobile so we don't we don't need to make
these monolithic pages you can make
these tiny little components that make
the subscriptions themselves and care
about like what does the loading data
look like there and you know yeah we do
you think I think a big part of this is
this is like I'm you know making the
subscriptions happening from the
template us move towards components
right i mean itÃ­s definitely a part of
this i think why these experiments and
are happening what you know why it's
part of 10 for now why he did this post
yeah yeah i don't know you know it's
weird because I don't I don't I know
that Sasha wrote a post about this and
kind of showed how you could do this and
Sasha co that it was a good idea and
hacked it in so that it would be
supported here but you know it's kind of
an interesting idea to me uh-huh and and
I think you know something's gonna
change this what are you gonna see blaze
too we're gonna see react fully
supported or something is going to
happen and you know this stuff is going
to be it'll be very different I think
iron-router I don't think it'll go away
but it'll take a big refactor to get it
to what it needs to be for me your apps
um but you know the thing that's weird
to me is that there's still no kind of
notion of URLs in meteor at this point
outside of iron rod or flow router and I
you know we're building web apps here
people like the core component of the
web is the URL as a building block like
we need to support your else here yeah I
don't know yeah yeah so I think I mean
this is pretty cool side just this post
a little bit more I hadn't seen it
really you linked it today so yeah good
stuff a lot of I mean this it's fun to
have a new release of meteor is an
actual yeah yeah yeah well and I mean
we'll have another one in two weeks
right because wins deb shop not even two
weeks next week next thursday i think
we'll see 11 come out cool yeah all
right well um have anything else for us
to talk about I think we've covered off
our topics for the day no no I think the
biggest thing
is uh you know i'm going to start that
new round table podcast shortly i think
it's going to be called media club
podcast and probably like three or four
people and we'll just we'll be talking
about little topics in meteor will just
pick pick a show topic and just kind of
riff on it for 30-40 minutes and I don't
know it'll be exciting I'd love to see
it hit like new and noteworthy and
technology so let's see if we can make
that work all you fans out there be
ready for it when I say it's available
yeah yeah look you know I wish there
were more meteor podcast I would I would
have him queued up in my in my overpass
yeah yeah meteor interviews like he's
submitted it to the iTunes Store so
we'll have a sec always soon cool but
that's just more listening to me at this
point I think it'll be more interesting
when there's someone else on it the
damage I've decided my marketing
approach is just like visa like I'm
everywhere you are gonna be that's a
good strategy yeah alright ma mom talk
to you next week yeah sounds good that's
alright thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
