fifth 2016 welcome crater fans i'm your
host Josh owns and I'm the sidekick been
Strahan what's so sidekick what's up
Batman I'm gonna be doing today talking
about asteroids right on i'm wearing the
sit on the sand King nice nice yeah
Sophia if you're not watching Youtube
version of the podcast then that sucks
for you you have no idea what we're
talking about yeah we go if you if you
do watch the YouTube make sure to hit
the subscribe button below if you if you
listen to the podcast or even if you
don't listen to it you watched on
YouTube she's gonna leave a sort of you
like we like reviews I don't know about
youtube reviews no not youtube on itunes
sorry yeah seriously like if you're part
of YouTube we don't want your review
that's not true I want to hear what you
think I welcome all comments on YouTube
I just ignore most of them I love you
too man I like Paul from okay girl my
the founder of okay Greg I worked for he
put up a react tutorial yeah uh at a
meetup that he was talking at uh-huh and
some dude was like hey yo uh you know
and talking to Pollock at senior
developer you say hey you know you
shouldn't have a white background for
your text editor you should make it
black like that's just that's just
common sense as I man youtube com
endures have some big like you know what
bike bike shutters we'll just call them
bike shutters anywho nice video bro
change your background color Yeah Yeah
right okay there is a random youtube go
alright so this way quick hit talk about
but does meteor scale hmm no just
kidding introducing a better better
mantra
uh meteor data with 1.3 and react and
why react doesn't have templates or why
doesn't react our templates or mm-hmm
we're gonna dive into that totally
should be interesting it should be
interesting so I tried I tried an
experiment this week actually rather
than me just cherry picking the
interesting topics I just took the top
voted topics and we're only doing four
um you know and I put them in the order
that they were most interesting most
voted for on the site really so your
article yeah I had 20 votes this week at
the top yeah mmm yeah no no it was a
great actually I really liked it I
really enjoyed yeah well you know it's a
bit of a I don't know it was interesting
it's perfect it's perfect like how know
before we dive into this one thing yo
congratulations this is show number 90
indeed I noticed sighs we started in
January of 2014 so Jenny way 10th so
january 10 2016 was our two year mark
like a fool Bonnette this holler you
know your legitly Batman because Batman
had multiple robins and I think I'm the
third Robin are you yeah Lillard Robin I
guess Dean was kind of in there I don't
know in Rye yeah right yeah mm-hmm I was
the original Robin that's right so
that's why I wore red today nice so does
meteor scale answers yes the answer no
the answer is no it wasn't scale at all
know the you know what the answer is and
this is you know I wrote this because I
get this question like every time and we
do like a QA or something and ever and
someone's like well what can I get it to
scale to the million users I'm gonna
need yes how do i get meteor to scale to
a million users in all this month we're
projecting a million concurrent users
like fifteen dollars a month to budget
for
server like we gotta keep the costs down
yeah on our offshore developer I'm just
kidding late this terrible um but that's
literally like you could almost judge
the people who asked the question
because you're like you like your
article said like hey it depends and
someone was experienced would understand
that immediately yeah i'm just showing
your inexperience when you say when you
ask a question like that and it's the
same thing like when you have like new
front end or new graphic designers that
are our old graphic designers getting in
the front end for the first time they
usually google what's better angular or
react you know or they go like something
generic like that again something in it
my one of my blog articles is a meteor
verse angular is like the most kind of
thing monocle i have waited it's a
garbage compared yeah anyway that's my
rant okay let's talk about your article
so I you know the problem I have is that
scaling means different things right
like a lot of people can mean a slightly
different thing when they say a lot of
people I think the question is like how
many concurrent users can I handle and
the answer is you know we don't we don't
get automatic publications like auto
publish ain't a thing that you do in a
in an actual app because like you need
to be able to optimize for the
individual thing you need to do right
like there's no there's no good way to
handle like another good question I get
is offline data like how do I handle
offline data and like the conflict when
this thinking happens and it's like
that's that's individual to your app
right it's gonna be different like the
way you implement that is probably going
to be slightly different than say uber
is going to implement that kind of
feature so you know I don't know I think
um you know we can all go Oh elixir you
know they can they can scale out and
they can well you know I saw Phoenix can
do two million connections and it's like
yeah like I can probably go write some
mindless pointless a thing that says we
can handle you know thousands upon
thousands of connections coming into
like a hello world publication that just
says literally just return tell the
world right like it doesn't even hit the
database it doesn't do anything like
yeah not interesting like we're just
testing that web socket with note scales
to a certain point like oh yeah I don't
know not not interesting so um real
interesting things that you said what in
the article was it really depends on
your idea like like the whole thing is
like do you have an idea that scales
that grows you know can you get to users
that's the thing that you need to have a
good business model you need to iterate
and provide the users what they want
really great that's the only thing for
scaling I think for me like a lot of
these questions are coming from
technical people and like their or
slightly technical people that are
building apps and you know they want to
know like am I gonna run into trouble
scaling well at the end of the day like
your number one concern shouldn't be
scaling like if you're doing a good job
and you get a huge influx of people and
they're willing to pay you money like
you're just gonna go the route of like
throwing money at the problem right and
reference you know you and I talked to a
class craft on that the media club
podcast yeah and and then they did a
great job at meteor night oh yeah
talking about scaling I have a watch
that but I mean okay I'm sure it covers
a lot of what we already talked to them
about it it did yeah you know the thing
is at the end of the day like they did
the most ridiculous thing that I think
any DevOps person would hear and they
went to like a 60 core machine and they
were running two processes per core and
they're like we're scaling right yeah
and that's so her money oh yeah
absolutely so you gonna do yeah I know a
couple other startups and that that got
some momentum behind them and that's
just what you do you just throw money at
it because it's really you might like
test your code you know virtually to see
if it can scale and all stuff but when
it really happens there's always going
to be something that crops up so you
just like
throw money at it and that's just what
you do and then you work work around it
yeah because you're trying to convince
people that your product is valuable
enough to spend their hard-earned
dollars on something and you know like
you're only gonna do that through
creating features and you know creating
that that interest and engagement with a
with a user not not by like you know
having the fastest server ever like I
can tell you I did some work with a
company that was purchased by godaddy
and they were you know when I got hired
on they were paying like well over a
dollar per user for their hosting setup
and like they had nightly jobs that were
running and they wouldn't even finish
like they were sinking a hundred
thousand bank accounts and it wouldn't
finish in the 24-hour period and I got
put on a team and our job was to make it
faster and we got it to the point where
we were running through the job queue in
less than 12 hours so we were running
the sink twice a day and you know we got
that cost down to like 45 cents a user
or something but you know that that's
something that happened after go daddy
bought the startup I for ya well if
you're a smart developer like you're
going to you're gonna have all the
features validated before you really put
a lot of effort into coding something
that's very robust maybe but i mean
that's like that's saying that your may
be good at figuring out the feature set
or i don't know like validations a very
hard thing to do as well and chances are
you're going to pick the wrong things
and you're going to start talking to
people and they're gonna that's what I'm
saying like if you choose the wrong
things like this prevents you from
dumping a bunch of time into choosing
the wrong thing what you're going to so
like off the bat the question is oh I
really think I'm gonna have like I'm
guessing this miss many users in 12
months should I go should I start using
cluster right off the bat should I break
everything oh stop like away don't ditch
scope Oh setup modulus go set up Heroku
go set up galaxy you know obviously like
I'm I'm somewhat biased I won't pull a
Hillary Clinton here and say that
because modulus gives me money you
it doesn't affect me it does only to
some degree right Oh Josh and his super
PAC my modulus super PAC yeah totally I
mean you know but don't don't spend time
on you know pink tinkering with your
setup like Lucy that's a passion project
of mine and so like when the next post
comes out and i talked about how i've
got craters set up like that's to me
like i find that stuff super interesting
i did a podcast for almost two years of
video podcast called web pulp TV you
know I I loved exploring how people were
scaling out the back end of their
systems that you know I talked to the
guy that was like working at Netflix it
was amazing so I don't know like that
that's interesting to me yeah but if
you're building a business you should
probably shut it doesn't make sense yeah
yeah cuz you're gonna be spending too
much engineering time troubleshooting
that stuff and you gone you have you
invalidate the idea yet exactly exactly
that's your number one job is like
getting people to like your crap and
yeah the next thing that I thought was
amazing that you pointed out was
optimization is not so much going to
come from meteor per se how your how you
as a developer is handling data you know
and you touched on it recently just now
in this talk about publications and
optimizing your publications and your
subscriptions get back published but
also how you store data you know chrome
jobs that you have to do and having a
finishing time you're a lot of stuff is
going to be around optimizing the use of
data and that's not so much connect to
directly per se to concurrent users you
know depending on what you're doing so
that that's the next step so it's like
meteors almost like you get in the
meteor scale like after you're already
tackling two two major things before
that yeah which is that you got the
right uh you got the right idea of what
you're even trying to build it's the
first one and the second one is your
database is set up how it should be your
crown jobs are running good and and
you're storing stuff correctly you know
yeah yeah then you get into their other
stuff so it's like I don't know I hear
this and I'm like ah do I have to answer
this again luckily I just send them to
you so that's why you get a thousand
emails every week that's that guy he
knows uh yeah anyway great article is a
quick read i recommend everyone who is
listening to show that didn't read this
article like go jump on joshs unicorn
blog and areata thinking to changing the
name I don't know I haven't found a
clever name yet though uh YouTube
commenters can you please tell us what
josh is blocked wow wow thanks man
they're good at they are the most
creative Commodores I know so that's
what well so some people have asked well
I'd I've I've had some questions about
like you know visit more business
related stuff like freelancing and
particularly people always wonder about
contracts and stuff so I thought I'd
start talking more about like how to run
a business where you write software
that's a good point and then you got the
space dojo blog it's up on medium yeah
there's like more like an opportunity
for in more technical blogs yeah yeah so
I was thinking like I don't know the art
of is this software business or
something like that mmhmm yeah and you
could create tutorials and you have
unique insight into like how to manage
communities and stuff oh that's all that
stuff is not really technical but no it
is valuable none yes cat wrangling
kettering all right
what we got next on the list intro to
better mantra better mantra yeah it's
good hmm whenever my daughter talks
about like yoga she's six and like show
it should be like look I'm doing yoga
and she like gets into like indian-style
sitting and like she does next time she
does that right here mantra I think of
that yeah like wow you're floating do
you know that don't open up your eyes
whatever you do don't open your eyes
you're floating I love being a dad like
me and my kids are so callable my kid no
like they just know now they don't even
believe me it's good it's coming for me
it's coming from my oldest daughters
like that like like dad you've I've
trusted you too long and you've made a
joke of my trust of you so I don't
believe you anymore yeah that's what I
yeah I feel like you're you're doing the
dad thing right if that's true like once
they hit like seven or eight or nine
like they don't believe you anymore your
parenting right yeah yeah okay so a
better mantra gosh I'd even have a
chance to really dive into the first
mantra right or that too man i read it
on it yeah 0.2 cheese Louise okay so the
big thing is uh it supports one point
three modules now mm-hmm I'm guessing
that that's the big improvement uh and
then they know you know i don't i don't
think so or is it just like a documented
structure around yeah i think it's just
a little more documented structure like
how they lay out the the server and the
client side Wow was some of it and then
like showing off their testing as well
was a pic yeah further down yeah that
was pretty impressive yeah but I it's
already built on 1.3 like the whole idea
of mantras because of 1.3 now that's
what I thought and so I wanted to have
more time to dive into this but I've
just been a loser today are this whole
week like if those following a
transmission know that like I've
promised them shows and I'm like like
two shows behind really seen them and
everything it's tough right I just I
everything got bumped one day earlier in
the week and that just like that screws
me up yeah I didn't know so much of a
product of pattern but I guess I am so
anywho um I'm like a horrible person to
present mantra 0.2 savage what I see in
this article I love it's awesome have
you added at a moment to play with her
at all honestly I haven't I've just been
playing with 1.3 cut it directly uh yeah
I think that's like more important yeah
I like understand that first yeah yeah
I've got a client project that I've put
directly on 1.3 um but awesome yeah uh
expect a lot of half a day yesterday
just trying to get foundation you you
found out why it wasn't awesome huh yeah
it's terrible oh this is why I don't do
production stuff with beta software oh
yeah well you know it's not not going
into production this month so I'm not
too worried about it that's kind of made
the decision but I think you made the
right decision like and and also this is
the way that you learn like like this is
how we're also going to test 1.3 to make
sure that it's ready it's ready for
production yeah like I feel like I
already have like probably twenty-five
percent more knowledge than most people
using meteor because i'm using 1.3 i get
the well-founded percentage i think it's
it's maybe gonna be a little painful
when it comes out I in all honesty one
point Jay but right well way off topic
it's not it's not off topic like that
well mantra yeah we're talking about it
is off topic a little bit it's all your
fault uh what since we're on that I was
going to say you know the pain that you
went through and a couple other people
have been saying like 1.3 has been a
little painful upgrade and so sashko and
I are recording transmission a couple
hours after this one today and that's
be one of the topics be like yo people
like what to expect and also talking to
the package managers and being like yeah
yeah I think that's a big problem right
because certain things are changing and
like the foundation problem I have is
that they're not pulling in files from
node modules and handing those off
through the build tool so like you can't
you can't ask for SAS files so they
never get past 24 7 s CSS or whatever to
do the compilation for ZURB found yeah
well and that was a really interesting a
github issue that you brought up to yeah
you attention to a couple people yeah
yeah because I you know got it got
pushed to like if you look at tangled in
my court if you look at Benjamin's
response it's like well we'll get to
this after 1.3 yeah I mean it'd probably
be a lot better for the community if we
get to four yeah so i don't know i die i
need to go actually contribute an actual
idea in there too though I don't know
how I'm feeling about CSS preprocessors
anyway anymore feel like there's gonna
be a change coming and people are gonna
crucify me for saying that hey you know
I could care less right like I don't
handle that I leave that to other people
I think it's your your actual title at
okay grows designer right no I'm a
developer oh are you why Carl and I are
are the developer designers okay over
there so yeah yeah you're like your
little hobby is like back end stuff me
I'm like modulus galaxy I don't care
about back inside um but microservices
interests me so I know as much as I need
to about that but anyway other than that
it's like design like I'm all about like
animation CSS and indesign kind of stuff
so it does matter to me I just try to
keep my designer happy like she's she's
working on the project she wants
foundation so like I just leave it there
for her yeah your is amazing by the way
I'm not saying your name because I don't
know if you want to give it
out cuz then I'll send she won't be your
designer anymore yeah I don't know oh
she's on her own oh he actually uh quit
and she's freelancing now so she what
here's the thing i'll say she's in this
face dojo slack room so if you're
looking for a quality designer she's in
there yes her initials Ras yeah ok he
still I could give her name ok no props
to the mystery designer initials AS Ben
loves you you're awesome maybe maybe
after she finishes my wife's new website
I'll say her name okay now you're just
getting mean because you know she's
listening to this podcast guessing
subliminal messages we'll see ok uh yeah
so I don't know way off topic much you
should check it out like I don't know
what else to say other than that like I
I should probably dive in a little bit
deeper here myself like he's putting out
really interesting ideas and it looks
like react composer if you're not
following may end up being kind of like
an official solution now that mix-ins
are going away and react so and that's
that's that's part of mantra so I think
he's you know if nothing else he's
driving the meteor community forward and
getting the latest and greatest react
standards kind of working because at
this point I hate to say it like the
react support came out for meteor and
you know it used to mix in and now
mix-ins are dead so it's like they're
gonna be gone cutting meteors uh react
support was at a date when it when it
came out I don't know ah JavaScript hate
what he react yeah exactly I would have
to say this is this is reacting okay
totally totally yeah yeah like I
wouldn't throw it on md but actually
it's worse than that right this is Annie
s6 thing like mix-ins didn't make it
into es6 so you know gone yeah yeah
anywho what I'm interested about with
mantra is and maybe people can correct
me comment on
this or let me know but working with it
what do you guys think is it speeding up
and offering the opinionated framework
that you really want on top of media or
is it adding complexity I want to get
your feedback I think Aaron Oda wants to
hear that too and start and start
getting some major feedback beyond just
issues on the github i actually have
community write ups and stuff like that
so yeah if you guys are using mantra
like like get it out there get to that
news out there and i know that once i
start using it i'm going to definitely
use it for a project coming up sooner or
later I'm going to be documenting my
usage over to ya really interesting you
know I don't know there's some things I
want to say here but I think I don't
turn it into a bigger discussion so we
should probably move on you're you're a
troublesome man all right i'll just say
the sentence if you agree we can just
move on after i say yeah all right so i
think mantra exists because getting pull
requests accepted into meteor so hard
and I think that there's gonna be some
double work going on here right like
mantra is interested in react native and
now we have Martin working on react
native so I don't know seems that cool
but just my two cents thanks thanks baby
all right I have a different opinion but
we can't end it yeah but I'm close to
that I just I think you're right on i
just have I think it's a positive thing
though not not so much that it may be
growing of a negative situation so yeah
I you know I think I think this is
basically a fork of meteor guide and a
fork of meteor itself with some other
libraries sprinkled in and that's what
we're looking at here that is that is
what I'm curious about I was shocked
when i was talking to sashko and he said
that they want to support more
opinionated frameworks like mantra on
top of meteor
and if you guys listen to transmission
my next question was well what is guide
going to support this guide something
separate or is guide going to support
one of these these frameworks I remember
asking that question I forgot what the
answer was so ya can answer for them
again but anywho whatever is happening
is good the thing is whenever we have
the status quo right now we want
something else to come out to like make
it status quo obsolete you know and I'm
happy like Aaron Oda is always pushing
the envelope forward and everything I
hear from em DG is that you know they
really really appreciate Aaron Otis
input and guidance in the community in
what they're putting out there and I
think it's because he helped test and
justify different iterations and changes
well you know to me that the key
difference here right is that the idea
of mantra is coming from building
Khedira versus the idea of meteor is
coming from building meteor you know and
so I think there's real earnings there
and that I you know it's it's hard for
people at meteor to to have this kind of
view of meteor because they're not
really building like there's there's
some guys now that are building an
application right called gamma and well
and they're there in the weeds they're
working with these large companies that
are on galaxy you know and they're in
there they're now yeah absolutely yeah
it's starting to happen but they do more
experience at you and I do now i would
say MTG oh they are on huge projects
with huge issues yeah maybe maybe ah i
know the yeah okay we'll put it there uh
one thing is is meteor whoa that was
loud sorry it's not like my opinion yeah
you fade it out what you say meteor is
not super opinionated and some people
like that other people have said no it
needs to be more opinionated much yeah
and as an opportunity to be super
opinionated exactly and that's right
distinguishing factor is there I don't
think that they're competing say but
there are
fuzzy areas and you are correct there
are some areas of grey the answer for
yet but fundamentally I think they're
two different things yeah sort of boom
uh so but here's the thing right like
this ODOT to coming out and like him
talking about directory structures and
that kind of thing like those are just
opinions they actually aren't even fully
baked into you know you can make your
directory structure however you want
they're just kind of guiding you with
their little their docks and that kind
of thing so anyway all right move on I
thought I don't want Josh to you know
the problem is we're not passionate
enough I thought these topics would get
easier because they got less votes as we
went on but that doesn't seem to be the
case no all right uh meteor data wait
wait I want to get the title right using
meteor data and react with meteor 1.3
and this is also from air nota on the
kid here blog yeah but this is aaron
odin number 58 ok that's it totally the
other one was 73 yes wholly different
people come on is that what those
numbers at the bottom mean that's which
air nota actually really that's right
like 58 is kind of known for being funny
okay 73 is the innovative one nice yeah
yeah I think 10 age it's like that the
asshole Guido's gotta beat out going we
got like lyrics listed in itunes and now
Chris you got ahead of that yeah I don't
we're not mark clean on youtube I don't
think YouTube itself is clean so we'll
just leave them for YouTube okay uh so
yeah I think I gave away the punch line
already right like mix-ins are dead so
um you know the meteor react mix in data
mixin is kind of like you know gonna be
deprecated with the new version ah just
because react will likely do with make
sense at some point and
yeah so he kind of talks about the
container pattern and I've started to
dive into this myself right so like how
do you if you if you can't do a mix in
right and so like I've personally been
trying to think about how to do how do i
do flow router authentication and kind
of redirecting you to the login page
that kind of stuff like with react with
flow router in media 1.3 and the mixin
seemed like the obvious answer and then
you kind of go down that rabbit hole and
you're like oh wait BIC sins are going
away so then you like start to realize
like you can build these higher-order
components which looks interesting and I
think that's what he's kind of talking
about here is like you know building
react containers which I think we've
discussed before as well but he's got a
library now called react composer which
will handle it's like a little way for
you to be able to do your meteor dot
subscribe call and then compose with
tracker and like basically i don't i
don't know maybe it's less boilerplate
then component will mount or something i
don't know I'm kind of interested to
play with it but this is the thing
they're having a discussion in the
github comments in meteor and kind of
discussing so there's another one called
Auto VAR from q42 and they're kind of
looking at the different options there
and you know I think I don't know it's
really interesting so yeah I wish I knew
are you what we did i do i'm totally
with you i totally want to know this
stuff yeah but uh yeah I don't know gosh
I you know what I need to do hey this is
what we need to do we need to interview
Aaron Oda I need to know how to get how
to scale myself horizontally Sydney I
think you think you got cast like the
business of doing more crap in a day yes
seriously uh this is a problem arunodaya
has all the time to create this stuff
right about this stuff publish this
stuff and then modify the stuff I don't
have enough time to fire his life up
enjoy yeah well you know you gotta like
just bite the bullet and like he's he's
pushing the envelope right he's trying
meteor 13 and you know you start to
realize some of the limitations and
problems like you know if i cruise by a
thread and I look at it like I've been
looking at one point three forum threads
and stuff for a while but Oh a couple
days ago when I actually started writing
an app I didn't even realize what half
this crap meant now Benjamin released
some awesome stuff yeah nada about
modules and so I really enjoyed that
understanding the difference between
like mcrib modules and common jas that
was like something i really appreciate
it anyway i could talk about that
because i read into that but ya know
reacting pip composer I'm sorry yeah are
you working on it am i fired now yeah
you're fired no are you working on any
react projects right now I'm not really
I am NOT okay I personally am not so
there are some side projects I got a
person I got to personal projects i'm
working on and then we rewrote okay grow
calm and react before but you weren't
really on that Nixon no but uh right now
I got bumped on to another big project
and and we're using
blaze we're still using place mmm-hmm
introducing cluster so i get to dive
into that more so that's nice yeah
that's fun so speaking of aren't you
guys like hiring one you need some temp
help right or did you find someone oh I
think we're good there shout out to the
community so like Paul and I put out a
shout out for some freelancers the issue
was um we have very passionate clients
and they don't like it when we have to
move on to other projects because
they're like hey we want you all to
ourselves yeah so okay grow is growing
like we're doing the right thing man we
found our niche and things are growing
anyway we're not sure yet though we're
pretty conservative if we want to add
another team member or not we've had a
record January yeah but you guys were
looking for like a temp yeah so we're
looking for a temp so it's the first
thing so anyway pops to the community
like I think like within three hours we
had a handful of people would you post
it just as fais dodo stock room or
somewhere else to space dojo Twitter and
then my boy West boss as a slack room as
well and I don't know where Paul posted
it that was what he did it in a space to
adjouris like them yeah yeah so good
stuff okay crows Rocket Man nice we got
we got too much work all right so why
doesn't react have templates bend no no
no no but seriously so so Dan who made
redux and uh sashko gosh ahsha ahsha nor
meteor they kind of went back and forth
on Twitter about like react templates
and all that stuff and and brought up
some good points I wish I knew off top
my head but Dan's big thing was like
testing and iterating over them easier
mm-hmm I I was just like yeah whatever
you know that's something to figure out
anyway so Sasha really took it further
and like wrote a blog post off of off of
that and
pretty amazing he actually took it
further than that he created a react
templating repo of some sort and did he
really yeah let's my own functional
stateless component-based reactant
solution yeah this is 12 times yeah um
it's awesome it was interesting right
and so he kind of wrote it and then went
back and forth but you know the thing to
me and let's talk about yes templates
for so I wonder I wonder uh because you
know that the argument I hear is that
designers you know Jas exes is harder
for designers to get mmm but I just
don't I don't know that I why that I
think if you're a really good designer
you're in JavaScript every day exactly I
feel like if you're even just a decent
designer you likely play around with
jquery or something right like you've
come from somewhere you've likely added
animations or something isotopes or
something masonry yeah I could see where
that's different because like jQuery you
know you're modifying the damn directly
and then you just refer to some plugins
documentation and you're up to go you're
going really fast but but you're you're
like this like this side learning that
happens like you're you're picking up a
little bit of JavaScript knowledge like
you're starting to understand what the
syntax looks like like I you know up
until a couple weeks ago I hadn't
written any react code but like I've
looked at enough code that I start to
understand what a component looks like
and how it works even before I wrote any
and I never even sat down and look at
the docks like I just think that that
that starts to happen yeah and so I
don't know like it if if a designer like
I don't know very many designers that
just stick to straight HTML I guess be
my point and like if they're able to go
into blaze like the javascript file side
ablaze and right
over why can't they use jsx yeah so yeah
and j sx isn't the only thing that you'd
a date you can use like there's other
things out there yeah and so a lot of
what the the back and forth with dan and
Sasha ended up with is that it's not
really helpful because one of the great
things about having your code right in
there with your HTML is that like you
get like code completion from your
editor linting becomes better you know
all kinds of different benefits that you
get by kind of writing all that together
in one file and separating that out you
lose a lot of that benefit mm-hmm so
yeah interesting experiment it is
interesting and I think it's something
that needs to be done because like we we
talked about how react Muse moves HTML
into JavaScript and that is intimidating
like you're kind of getting rid of HTML
and that are just like in your lizard
brain it's like anchored in like things
like class like reserved words in
JavaScript it also is duplicated in HTML
you know or simple things like like
looping through data uh you know all of
a sudden you're like whoa wait a minute
here I need to know JavaScript to do
this because like before like my
templating language like just did it for
me you know I just thrown in it and each
or something like that or I mean it is a
map call all that different from each
well that's the thing so I think that is
just intimidating from it as I
understand point but again I'm with you
I'm with you I'm just trying to like
yeah be apathetic um like what do you do
you just spent 30 minutes you learn what
map is great now you got it yeah so I
didn't I didn't watch um I didn't watch
the video but I did read the post and I
think like I love the TLD w like wait a
minute what's that Oh too long didn't
didn't write um but that he gives a link
to a bunch of resources that kind of
outlines the way that react is moving
and actually some of this I hadn't even
read till they posted this so just want
to say thank
to Sasha because certainly expanded my
understanding of where react is headed
and I'm feeling a lot better about it
myself mm-hmm despite my JavaScript
fatigue now that I'm writing react
components yes anyway it's a meaningful
discussion yeah I think arm I think the
takeaway from this is that there's not a
happy path for designers to move into
react where where is that article you
know where where is everything outlined
we're like okay this is where I need to
go to learn and now I'm going to be a
productive designer using react yeah so
I will say the docs maybe feel a little
dense like just starting with the react
docs I could see where that might be a
little intimidating um you know I'm
curious not I've got their dogs up
they've got tips made click here really
Sasha wants to just make an abstraction
to of jsx to make it simpler for people
beyond boarded and I think that's gonna
make that option of react even more
powerful yeah um that's it like I don't
I don't really think there should be any
opinions in there like I think it's just
a necessary path with evolution of react
hmm that's Ben's knowledge still keen
for you anywho I really like Sasha I'm
glad he's part of our community and he's
like relevant a speedier so that that's
pretty awesome yeah yeah I love that
he's extending into the react community
I'm also trying to do as Aaron Oda is
doing and you know after i saw a blog
post to we'll talk about it next week um
hopefully I'm gonna put it up on crater
later so you couldn't get it a photo to
lunch we'll keep trying this experiment
let us know what you think like we'll
just pick the top avoided topics from
crater mmm no cherry picking yeah so
hopefully we get to talk about it next
week if a spam post gets top rated we'll
talk about it we'll talk about it we'll
discuss I mean you know now I've killed
off the spam so that's less of an issue
now but I know that Josh wants wants a
breast augmentation well I know I've it
was your swearing in the spam so just
have a smaller fill it up about Star
Wars much to Ben's chagrin I haven't
seen it still didn't like 10 other
people on the planet that's how busy
I've been hmm haven't BLC Star Wars I'm
kind of thing I you know it's not a
matter of busyness it's just a matter of
priorities been well now I now it has to
rank up against Deadpool like what what
do I see oh well see I took care of it
early so now I can just go see Deadpool
I know that's what happens with
procrastinators you know life sucks I
haven't um I haven't had a beer since
like before Christmas and so this is
like it's getting interesting right like
I really really enjoy beer and the funny
thing I can't drink beer but um also in
my it's really interesting my driving
has gotten better stop slurring I
stucked I stop hitting people on the
side of the road I don't sleep as well
as good anymore I don't know it's happen
before maybe passing out
but uh next week at the conclusion of
Crater conf I'm going to this inside
beer festival i'm pretty excited about
that's awesome yeah jealous yeah you
should be a bit about you you doing
anything interesting then over the
weekend yeah whatever working on
anything interesting doing anything
catching up on work yeah no nothing
interesting actually actually some super
interesting my wife and I are going to
be planning on doing the John Muir Trail
mmm up on the rocky mountains hmm yeah
what is it like 500 miles or something
like that it's like a two three week
trip really you're gonna like hike 500
miles is that what you're talk about
yeah it's an awesome trail and so we're
not gonna do it this year but we're
gonna be doing it next year but it takes
a while to get trainee to train up for
this and then get to equipment that you
need and everything so good yeah what
are you just like camp along the way
then mm-hmm you do yeah yeah like 10 to
20 miles sometimes 15 miles a day and
then up camp and then mmm the next to
you that's courageous Surtur it is
gorgeous I mean the documentaries got us
hooked so hmm which documentary uh
there's a handful of let me just get to
look up John Muir troll mmm all right
it's not Netflix there is there's
there's I think there's two on netflix
yeah i'll check it out yeah yeah it's
cool hmm any goes so we're get we're
planning for that so that means like a
lot of like running and any trips by
anacs carrying crap on your back yeah
he's seen all of a sudden were giving
our kids more piggyback rides all of a
sudden that's all I'm saying hey kids
hop on we're gonna do some training
store back nice all right all right man
cool well thanks for tuning in guys as
always you can support crater the crater
podcast space dojo space dojo show
go to it's still at patreon I don't know
we'll see maybe someday I'll get around
to changing about PA tra un calm / media
club should at least change the name to
space dojo in them i'll see if i can do
that and 10 bucks a month i'll get you
into the slack chat ken yet and i think
it's awesome place it is um i'm also
thinking about including it as part of
my training package now too so we'll see
how that works you should everyone who
takes your training you know they're
passionate man they love what you do so
and it's what you want to fill the
selection room i poison yeah so uh and
then as always modulus is a sponsor of
modulus io check them out I still think
maybe the best hosting clamp or my
domain to go to for me we need we need
like we need like a side-by-side
comparison with all the updated options
maybe I'll get around to that who knows
yeah I am I have a due account but I
haven't set up a droplet just yet
because you know why modulus makes it so
easy for me mmm so yeah you know I'll be
lame and just say like craters on
digital ocean just because like I moved
it there and I have some credit there so
like I haven't moved it off yet yeah but
anywho yep I'll be so Josh will get the
sponsorship and I'll be the one that's
promoting it but that it's a partnership
right there there you go ya know without
much less alright thanks for tuning in
