alright welcome back to our third
session for today we're gonna be talking
about building native iOS and Android
apps with angular 2 and native scripts
so you heard us reference it a little
bit over the past couple days and now
we're gonna hear a little bit more about
native scripts so we have TJ van tol
from telluric which is now progress and
I'm gonna let him take it from here
excellent thank you I'm gonna go ahead
and share my screen can you see it there
yep excellent all right yeah I'm TJ I am
coming to you from Lansing Michigan
place you probably haven't been but it's
it's actually quite nice here and I'll
be talking about native script today and
how to use it to build iOS and Android
apps basically what I'll be talking
about is I have a few slides here just
to sort of give you an introduction to
what native script is and why you should
care at all just get straight to the
point and then we'll build up a little
app I think the best way to sort of
learn a framework see how it works see
see what the process is like is to
actually build something with it and
then we'll look at the front a few fun
things that are built with native script
but I do want to get straight to the
point today we've heard the term react
native several times today and I wanted
to give you a few reasons just right off
the bat about why you should give a damn
about native script at all so first of
all just to sort of define what native
script is what what we've built is
native script is first of all up and
source so you can go to github.com slash
native script and everything's there
everything's Apache 2 license so open
and available for you to use native
script is for building truly native
mobile apps so meaning we're most
similar to react native in that sense so
we are Nats like Cordova using a webview
Dom HTML anything like that we we're
building truly native iOS and Android
use
interface user interface controls you
are building with JavaScript you can
also optionally use typescript and
angular on top abet we use CSS a subset
of CSS that you can use to style those
UI components and because we're using
these native user interface controls you
also get the native UI and also the
performance that you would expect from
using this sort of approach so in my
slides here I'm just going to give five
quick points which I figure sort of the
differentiating features for native
script and why you should consider using
it at all the first is all about
performance one of the things that we
did win or one of the important I guess
tenants that we had when we built native
script is that we wanted to give you a
sort of no compromise
interface we didn't want native script
itself to limit what you could build we
wanted you to basically be able to build
anything you could build with native ios
and android within the native script
ecosystem and since i think this is one
of those things that's i guess more more
feeble or you can see it better when
you're actually holding this in your
hand if you want a multitask if you're
already getting bored of what i'm
talking about here
get out your device and do a search for
examples native script in either the ios
app store or google play you'll download
this little app you see here which is
just a little sample we put together
with a few of the sort of common
scenarios that you need to build up an
app and you can check that out while I'm
talking the second in addition to sort
of giving you the best that you can get
from a performance aspect we also want
to do while we're doing that give you
the most there the maximum amount of
code and skill reuse so that means
things like coding in JavaScript
optionally coding in typescript and
angular we've let you use CSS to
actually style these elements we
leverage NPM quite heavily all of native
scripts code we publish everything we do
out on NPM our plug-in ecosystem is
built on top of NPM we let you use NPM
modules like lodash underscore moment
these sort of utility modules is part of
your native app so again and I guess the
other thing too is that we also let you
use and is sort of important to us that
you can use native
iOS and Android SDKs and sort of
libraries as well so we have really good
support for using iOS cocoapods in your
native script app and jars from android
arsenal and some of these things that
are really common and things that really
help you build really high quality
native applications third on my list is
angular and typescript support and the
typescript one is interesting so native
script from day one has been written in
typescript and native script started a
couple years ago as an internal
prototype so we've been using typescript
for a long time and just personally I
can say that as someone that's been
doing JavaScript development for I want
to say like a decade now I don't really
want to count the years but for quite a
long time I basically a couple years ago
would have swore that I would have never
used a transpiler of any sort it's just
not sort of me but over the last few
years typescript has grown on me I'm not
totally sold quite yet but I will say
that it comes in quite handy when you
are in the context of building a native
mobile app and I say that because if you
think about what you're doing if you
were building a native iOS or a native
Android app then you're going to do that
in places like Xcode or Android studio
where it's sort of a given that you'll
have things like autocomplete and syntax
highlighting and such and for really big
apps and and these these native mobile
apps type scripts sort of gives you that
same sort of environment but in your
comfort zone
typescript at this point is basically
like a yes es6 transpiler that has
optional types and so you can even
exclude the types if you don't want to
use them but because native script is
written in typescript our support for
typescript if you want to use it is is
excellent and we have it fully
integrated into our CLI and really
everything we do now the angular stuff
sort of builds upon this story first of
all angular 2 was a really nice fit for
us because we shared typescript as a
language in what we're doing but also
we've been working with Google good
meeting with them for let's see since
last May so a little over a year now
really in a way we are a way of proving
that angular can
in multiple environments so beyond just
the web because we are rendering angular
2 components as actual native iOS and
Android components what angular gives us
angular is both type script and angular
are optional in native scripts you don't
have to use them if you don't want to
but literally what they give us is some
common conventions for doing just common
things you need to do in an app so
things like data binding things like
routing all of these things that you
just need to do and it may be a script
we have api's for these sorts of things
as I said angular is optional but we we
had a ton of demand from people that
wanted sort of a standardized way of
doing these sort of things so that they
didn't have to learn native script
specific things they wanted to use a
framework that was familiar was
well-documented and out there and so
angular fit in quite well the other
thing annular gives us is by coding to
these api's you have the ability to
share the framework across both native
your native apps and your angular 2
written web apps and in some cases you
can even share some code as well things
like your your back-end objects here
your business logic your model objects
things like that so that's number three
I said I've got five reasons total and
then we're going to dive into some code
so you can actually see this number four
is sort of native scripts characterizing
feature it's the reason we call it
native script in the first place is that
we give you complete access 100% access
to all of Android and iOS --is api's in
your JavaScript or typescript code now
this can be a little bit tricky to wrap
your head around but the code you see
there on the top right of the screen is
valid JavaScript and and typescript for
that matter syntax but you can see that
it's calling an iOS API uialertview and
this is valid this is something that you
can do in your native script app you can
just invoke iOS and Android API s where
they make sense and I have one more
example here that shows we also have
this available on Android now really
this is sort of the the crux of the
architecture of native script
but it's here because this goes back to
us wanting to provide and no compromise
or a solution that doesn't limit you we
really think that if you're building a
real world like a production scale
application it's sort of inevitable that
you're going to need to do something
iOS or Android specific and you're going
to need to do something that goes off
the rails of what the framework offers
out of the box and we wanted to make
that as easy as possible to do because
there's always going to be these
advanced advanced scenarios and if you
think about what you have to do in say a
framework like react native most of the
time this involves writing native code
actually having to go into Xcode and
writing some objective-c or Android
studio and writing some Java you'd have
to do that in Cordova as well try to
plug in and we wanted to give that
access directly to JavaScript and
typescript developers so that they could
stay in an environment that they're
comfortable with where their tooling is
going to continue to work but still have
the access the ability to do these
native things but at the same time we
also realize that your average person
does not want to write code like this
and in fact the reason that people
choose frameworks like native script
choose frameworks like react native
specifically because they're trying to
avoid things like this they they want to
be able to write native apps using
easier cross-platform api's and we
provide a whole lot of those in native
script to allow you to do that
so just to give you an example of how
this all comes together in native script
if you wanted to allocate a file for
instance you could write the code that
appears on the bottom of the screen here
you could write new Java dot IO dot file
and Android and you could write that
objective-c abomination there that
appears on the the bottom of the screen
for iOS but we provide a file system
JavaScript slash typescript module that
you can use that abstracts that away so
under the hood we are doing that we are
writing the platform specific native
code in order to make this happen but we
give you really easy user interfaces
around those just to make your life a
little bit easier this also works at the
user interface level as well it's the
same basic approach we give you
components and if you're using angular
they are fully angular components that
you can use to build up your user
interface but under the hood we are
actually implementing these and
rendering these as native iOS and
Android user interface components and we
provide a whole lot of them so there's
several dozen if you're interested the
main native script repo so github.com
slash native script slash native script
it has these modules you can look
through those the UI folder has all of
the user interface components that are
available to use and we'll look at them
when I start coding here in just a
minute and look at how sort of the
pieces come together with this there's
also I should mention our native script
plug-in ecosystem which sort of greatly
expands upon the number of options you
have there as well so I said there were
five reasons the fifth reason I have on
my list you may be wondering you know
who is behind native script what is
native script where did it come from
so I thought I should give you a little
bit of a background of that nature
script actually started I think it's
about I think it's been three years ago
now as an internal prototype if you've
heard of a company called telluric it's
a company I've worked for for about
three years now
and it's we're a company that's been
around for a little over a decade got
started in the.net space and for the
last several years have been heavily
invested in the Cordova and PhoneGap
world so you may know us from we run the
second-biggest Cordova plug-in
marketplace the outside of the gist the
main Cordova listing on their own site
and it's because for the longest time we
were really trying to push the
boundaries of what Cordova could do and
we thought plugins were the best route
in that so we maintained for instance
the Native transitions plugin for
Cordova and a bunch of these other
things that are really pushing the
boundary of Cordova and what we found is
that you can only push that boundary so
far before you need a clean
architectural break a native script was
really built or sir I should say born
outs out of that research and out of
that experience for building for mobile
with Cordova now telluric a few years
later about two years ago was acquired
by progress software so we are now under
the software umbrella but
cool thing about that is we are now a
sort of a major entity in the software
world and I think that's worth
mentioning here because I guess I'm a
day and age where we have these
JavaScript frameworks are being created
and abandoned every day to know that
this is native script is not a
fly-by-night creation it is it is a
major engineering effort put forth by a
major software company progress software
is almost 2,000 people obviously not all
those work on native script but the
native script core team is over 20
people we have a number of other people
work working on native script and some
sort of a supplementary role as well if
you're wondering how if this is all open
source and free which it is how how we
make money off of this we do have some
offerings that we offer for premium
offerings as well so we have what's
called UI for native script which are
some charts and graphs that you can add
into your application if you are
familiar with telluric you might know
that this is basically the company's
business model telluric we we basically
build user interface components for just
about everything we have kendo UI for
the web we have UI components for iOS
and Android and oh my H we have PHP I
don't know what we have Silverlight UI
components as well so if you have a
software architecture we've probably
built an interface for it so we have UI
for native script which there's some
components you can buy if you have some
sort of like high-end graphs and charts
that you need to add to your application
we also offer enterprise support which
is something that a lot of companies
especially bigger companies look for
before they choose to adopt some
technology so if that's you if you are
if you know of a company you think that
it's needs support that we offer that
sort of thing as well and the last thing
I'll mention before I get into the demos
I toss this slide in pretty quickly so
the last speaker mentioned that we don't
have as many stars is react native which
is true we've got about I think we have
just under 8,000 stars on github but I
will say we are growing you can look at
do the research for this yourself this
is Tina's core modules this is the
domain github repo github.com slash
native script slash native script it's
it's on NPM is TNS
cordesh modules and if you look at the
stats for this I mean the trends sort of
speaks for itself
but over 60,000 downloads in June so
we're no niche technology for something
that's been growing for the last year or
so and we intend to continue to grow
into the future so with that in mind I
think it's actually a lot cooler a lot
more fun if I actually just show you an
app and get out of PowerPoint so I'm
going to do that now and bring up my
editor here I guess the first thing I
should note before I actually show an
app is much like react native data
script is built on top of NPM as a
command-line utility so you'd install
native script if I could type here it's
native script install that she made us
could actually get our CLI and all
things you do in native script you do
with the TNS command TNS is just short
for Tina's native script or just because
we were too lazy to continuously type
out native script so I have a little
demo app that I sort of wireframe
together and it's a super impressive app
I think you will all agree if I'm going
to bring it over here it's an amazing
hello world app that we're going to add
a little bit of functionality to
hopefully make this a little more
awesome quite basic right now but I have
this as a starting point just so I can
give you an idea of what a native script
app actually looks like you can see a
few folders here the first thing I'll
call your attention to is you may
remember from earlier I mentioned that
with native skipper really really
embracing NPM and note in building on
top of that and so you can see I have a
package of JSON and a node modules
folder if I look in here all your
configuration for your native script app
is happening in your package JSON so
version numbers things like that I'm
using angular for this app so this demo
will use all of angular you can see that
we're just bringing it in from NPM
without any changes we don't actually
alter angular in any way I've got a few
native script plugins here that I'll
show at the end of this and here's that
TNS core modules which is sort of the
core of native script that I'm bringing
in through NPM as well so you utilize
NPM quite heavily the other folders you
see there there's a couple hooks this is
these are the things that use the
transpile I'm going to be using
typescript as part of this
examples you'll see the the code that
actually transpires my type scripts code
into JavaScript here but the two folders
to focus on at the moment are the app
and the platforms folder now platforms
if I cover this first this is where your
actual native applications will live so
your actual Android app so your apk is
that do they they get built will be put
in here and you have things like your
Gradle files jars all your various
configuration you need to build a native
Android app and for iOS you'll find
things like your Xcode project and all
the things associated with iOS in order
to build that thing up but the cool
thing about native script did at least
to me is that for the most part we treat
this treat these native apps really is
generated code and you can see that if I
look at my git ignore here I'm actually
completely ignoring the platform's
folder from source control what the
native script CLI does is it actually
takes files from your app folder so this
is where you'll spend all of your time
developing and just injects them into
the native app so somewhere in here I
can't I can never remember where I put
them but somewhere in here actually the
the app folder is replicated so that you
can see these files and what the CLI is
actually doing is transferring them
directly into the platform's folder
itself we really do want to keep you
developing an environment you're
comfortable with so although you can
open your native script app up in Xcode
or an Android studio you can do any
native thing that you want to do there
we really do want to keep you in the
editor that you like the environment
that you are comfortable with within the
app folder you see some files here and
most of this really we try to stick to
angular 2's conventions as much as
possible so other than this app
resources folder which has things like
icons and assets that need to get
injected into the native app really this
is basically indistinguishable from an
Android air and angular 2 web app other
than the lack of an index.html file
sitting here which is on purpose we're
trying to stick is close to the angular
2 core as we can in order to and while
building up these actual applications
and I'm not going to try to teach you
and get rid to today I feel like
I'm not qualified that I even learned
Harry that I even know angular2 myself
so don't focus on that just know that
really we're trying to stick as close to
the angular 2 core as we possibly can
and with that in mind the core file that
builds up this hello world is I have a
component here angular 2 is really kind
of like react a series of components or
a tree of components is what you're
building and then this app really I've
just given control to this file here
this logging component which builds up
what you see here now if you saw this
file and if you had done angular 2 web
as before really this is code I mean
this code would run on the web the one
problem is you could see the difference
in this user interface component on the
web this would be a label with a
lowercase L and the text would appear
sort of within the label and not as an
attribute the reason we're doing this is
if I actually dive into the
implementation here so I'm going to go
into TNS core modules into the user
interface and into the label here you
can actually see how we're implementing
this thing so when we parts this we're
actually going to change it into in
Android that widget that textview
remember as I said earlier we just make
these native api's directly available to
JavaScript code as you see here which is
what this actually is so there's there's
again there's no webview here there's no
there's no Dom there's no HTML this is
in Android which is a textview that's
actually being used to render this and I
could also look at the iOS
implementation if I wanted to and I
believe if I remember how we're doing
this this is actually UI label that we
use an iOS template these controls so
with that in mind a label is not all
that interesting just to give you a
little bit start to build this up into
something a little bit more robust so
you can see something that at least
approaches something more real-world
that you might build I'll pasting some
more code here and one thing I have to
do is in order to tell sort of the hell
native script actually deploy this coder
to change it to run this lives in
command so I'm going to live run live
sync I'm going to run it for Android and
I'm also going to set this up as a
wotcher so I get the same behavior you'd
expect say if you're running Mangala to
webapp where every time that this file
changes it actually gets pushed out by
the CLI to the actual emulator and
remember this is possible again because
this app folder is just transferred into
the platforms folder that's really all
the COI is doing there is a little bit
more time just because this is
typescript code and it has to get
compiled into JavaScript before being
placed in there if I were doing this
without typescript this would run a
little bit faster and also the initial
time just set up the first time I run
live sync it has to do some processing
to set up the watcher and stuff to get
things out let me make sure I ran this
again and we should see when this runs a
few more to text fields and two buttons
stacked up on the screen and I think
it's coming up now there goes the one
thing I'll point out in this example
though that might strike you is a little
bit odd especially if you've done some
react native stuff is the stack layout
here now in native script we chose to
handle our layout through user interface
components like this so we don't offer
flexbox for instance to handle layout
now the reason we do this is basically
for performance reasons we found through
our benchmarking that these layout
mechanisms sort of this implementation
bets matched what native Android
provided out-of-the-box
and as such it was the best way to get
performance out of Android which is and
what we found is the environment where
it's harder it's a lot harder to get
really good performance out of native
Android that it is native iOS with our
approach so what we do is we provide a
series of layouts that you can use to
actually arrange your UI components on
the screen now it might sound a little
bit odd but it's it's actually quite
straightforward because for the most
part you're going to be using two
different layouts as part of your native
apps you'll be using a stack layout and
a grid layout now stack layout you'll
see pretty easy to use because it just
says two stack things up so you stack
things up either vertically which is the
default that you see here you could also
give this thing an orientation attribute
if you wanted things to appear
vertically or I should say horizontal
across the screen but for now this is
quite simple vertical layout that stacks
stacks up these user interface
components you can see that they're
pretty easy to use text fields buttons
keeps your code fairly readable to
actually style these things I'm going to
bust into my CSS file and if you have
run react native before you might now
want to reiax big things is that they
they believe in embedding your Styles
directly in within your JavaScript code
what a native script we we sort of give
you the ability to do both so you can
see I'm using a dedicated CSS file I
have an app CSS file we're using valid
CSS syntax so we're we're actually using
web CSS parsers to actually parse these
things but much like react native what
we're doing is each of these the the
keys you see each of the properties you
see here we're interpreting this and
applying the appropriate iOS and Android
API is to actually make this sort of
thing happen so we see that oh the page
component which contains everything you
see here we need to change the
background color to white well we have
code that matches that up to the Android
API that's needed to make that change
and apply that when we see this so you
can apply CSS rules here you can also do
it at the component level as well and
some of this is they are things that
angular 2 has API is for so angular 2
has properties there's one called styles
where if you wanted to just embed your
CSS sort of right in line with your
component decorator here you could do it
so you can see your CSS rules right here
you could also use this style URLs that
you see here that just point at some
external CSS files which is what I'm
doing here to make this possible and I
think my life sink yep sorry I kicked
that off wrong so there should go and
load up there so you can see what the
Styles actually look like so these
things are starting to look a little bit
nicer we got a little bit nicer looking
login screen still pretty basic I'm
going to ramp things up one more and
actually add some code that hits a
little bit of a back end what I did is I
change the login function here and now
I'll go into the template which is an
angular 2 templates and show you where
this actually gets done the PAP binding
is just how angular 2 does event binding
I'm binding tomato scripts tap event and
when I call that I'll call this login
function and I'm calling in angular 2
service here and at the moment all this
is going to do is is show in a little
work when I show this thing on the
screen but the reason I show this and
I'll go ahead and hit that so you can
see very exciting stuff but the reason I
show this is that this user service
which is in angular 2 service and really
all it's doing for login you can see
it's it's using angular HTTP service to
actually post some data back to a little
back end I have driving this thing but
what's cool is if you skim this file
you'll notice that I'm not doing
anything specific to native script in
here to actually log in a user all I
need is in this case a user object and
just to make an HTTP call and because of
that I have the ability to share this
code not only in this native app that
I'm writing here but also in a web app
as well and I actually have a web
implementation of this so go over here
this app is actually driven by the exact
same service just verbatim copied into
this application to actually log users
in and this is the next bit of
functionality we'll have here to
actually manage a list as well the
reason this is possible if we actually
look at this code a little bit different
a little bit more deeply this HTTP
service if we were to look at this code
this is actually coming from this
angular HTTP module from NPM now angular
implements this HTTP module with XML
HTTP request API s so the reason this
works within your native app is because
we actually re-implemented that API so
if I go into let's see I don't need user
interface this is within a TNS core
modules folder you'll find that we have
a complete implementation of XML HTTP
request but we
implementing it with iOS and Android API
so we essentially shim the exact same
API so that you as a user could use code
like this you could work at this
abstracted layer and get functionality
that works both in your native app here
and also in web apps as well if you
wanted to share code and I should
mention I actually can show it here
there are some people in our community
so let's see and Nathan Walker yeah I
googled this a lot but actually if
played with ideas of ways that you can
actually share code between web innate
of and actually build them from a single
codebase so this is Nathan Walker one of
our community members he has a little
advanced seed for angular 2 and this is
where I actually got the gift that I
used early on my slides from him and he
has some sort of tooling here that helps
you build out these apps so that you can
use a single code base to build things
up I personally have sort of the opinion
that I guess web and native apps are
different enough that I don't usually
like to do that I think usually these
apps or to diverge enough that it's not
necessarily a good idea for this app
I've adapted the convention of I just
have a folder that I can share so I just
call it shared and put in the files that
aren't specific to the view layer at all
so that they are more reusable across
these different development environments
so that is how that works let's see I've
got a couple more examples here I'm
going to paste in we're going to do a
few more things to this app I need to
get out of the user service here and
what I'm going to do is paste in the
next version of this that's gonna add a
switch up the login function so remember
before I was just doing an alert let me
get this out of the way I was just doing
and alert from the user service came
back this time I'm going to use the
router to actually navigate the user so
this this app does something a little
bit more interesting than just this and
the reason this should work I should
mention is if you think about routing
just sort of more generically especially
when you think in terms of code sharing
routing is just different between web
apps and native apps and it's not
something I mean the web has things like
URLs for instance hashes refresh buttons
back buttons things that your native app
doesn't necessarily have so the approach
we took here had to be a little bit
different especially when we built with
angular 2 as well and what we did is if
you've done any angular 2 before you may
know that they provide this what they
call a router outlet directive and
basically all router outlet does is say
render the component that the router
points at here AB so what we did is we
we essentially built on top of it so we
built this is coming from native script
angular so our angular implementation
router and we built a lightweight layer
on top of it that basically overrides
the the api's that we need so that you
could Co do the same api's when you're
defining your routes so there's some
file in here ya apps that route actually
should have yeah app that routes that PS
so this this file we're actually
defining your route you can see that
this code is something that's going to
be the same basically between your
native app and your web app but then you
need to use our API is here just that
when you actually do the routing which
I'll do here in a second things like the
Android hardware back button is going to
work as you expect on iOS you get the
the sort of swipe back behavior that you
expect that's natively built into iOS
and all these little things that you'd
expect out of a native router we handle
for you but we still give you a familiar
API at the very least for defining the
routes that actually live within your
application so let's see I got a couple
more things left here I think the the
last point I want to make is you know
even though I've talked a little bit
about co-chairing here and and really
some of these co-chairing appoints that
they're not really specific to native
script I mean the same discussion really
applies for react native and react
really almost equally but I you know I'm
sort of the person that says although it
makes sense to share some code back-end
sort of things that if you're going
through the hassle of building a native
iOS and Android app which is not a
trivial thing I don't care what
framework you
use it's going to be a hard process to
actually do that you actually should
take advantage of the device or you
should have some compelling reason to be
building that native app other otherwise
it's probably not going to be worth your
time and effort to be building for
native at all and so with that in mind I
thought I'd show a few things in here
that at least I think push push what's
possible in native script or some of the
the cooler things that give us a more
performant a more robust application and
the first thing I'm going to show is I'm
going to go in and add a little heater
we just recently added in our last
release of native script which CSS
animations that very similarly to
actually I don't know if I need to
change the internet very similarly to
how we parse these rules up here simple
rules like colors and such we also parse
now CSS animations as well and again
under the hood we're actually we're not
using some sort of web animations or
anything like that we are actually using
native iOS and Android animation code to
actually perform these things so this
example is fairly simple I'm just making
a background image move you can see I'm
just scaling it down on the screen but
this sort of thing is sort of you can
build on top of it to build some really
robust things and some really complex
animations and I'll show some examples
of that in a minute one of the other
things that you can do actually did I
delete there we go
and you can use our plugins so I think I
showed packaged at JSON earlier I've got
a few native script plugins in here
things like pull the Refresh so for
instance I could pulled a refresh here
if I went over here and said I needed
some I needed to pick up some flowers
and add it to my list I can go like this
up here but these things are fairly easy
to use these plugins so to give you an
example native script social share which
is this code that actually runs when I
click this loops when I click this
button up here to run this thing all I
need to do
is not type 2 bats list that component
that yes this native script social chair
actually comes in from here so you can
see that there are zero say Xcode or in
this case Android studio steps in order
to use or to leverage some of this
native functionality so social share I
can just install it from NPM bring it in
here and somewhere at the bottom here
actually just call a share text message
that is going to let me lock into this
native API it's sort of the same thing
for the folder refresh that I showed
there too
if I go in with that a XHTML really all
I have to do is bring the plug-in in
from NPM and then I can just use it in
my user interface as well I do have one
line of code in the typescript code here
angular two makes me register this thing
so that I can actually use it in my
template but that's all I need to do to
actually use this and to show you one
more perhaps my favorite just because
it's it's kind of cool is there's
someone in our community wrote the
native script explosion plugin which is
my absolute favorite it's also quite
easy to use so all I have to do is I've
already installed it from NPM you saw
out of my package that JSON file I'm
going to bring it in I'm going to
actually require it and then I'm going
to switch up my login function this
login function is kind of boring anyways
all it does is log person in and instead
of logging someone in I'm just going to
call this explode method that this
plug-in provides to make this
functionality possible now while this is
loading I did want to show one thing
cool about this is if I actually go to
this plugin so I need a script
explosions field there it is and go into
the Android implementation of this you
can see how simple native script
development is because all of these
native API s are available this plug-in
is what like ten twelve lines of actual
code here and really all it's doing is
it's taking a jar or a library from
Android Arsenal that someone wrote and
essentially wrapping it it's wrapping it
with the native script api's that takes
a view or a UI can
opponent and what it's going to let us
do is when I sign in you see the fruit
explodes and then this explodes and in a
minute the whole screen will explode so
I have this ability to tie into this
sort of incredibly rich ecosystem that's
out there of iOS and Android plugins
that are available and I can do so
trivially and I can also do so without
stepping into some native development
environment I don't have to go into
iterate studio I don't have to go in
Xcode I get to stay in an environment
I'm comfortable with and really that's
the power of native script being able to
write in familiar api's but at the same
time get the very best that the native
ecosystems have to offer so with that
I'm gonna show let me get up I think I
have if I my simulator here I have a few
other examples that I was going to show
you so I'm going to drag my device over
here some things people have built get
out my device do to to show you a couple
apps that are built with native script
this one here shout out play which is
pretty cool it's not actually out on the
iOS App Store yet I have it installed
from test flight because it's coming
soon the home screen you see here is
built with the natives or slides plug-in
that you could look up on NPM that just
lets you define a few things as slides
in your user interface you can easily
build one of this little intro slide
type things that are pretty common in
apps nowadays this app has you log in
with Spotify it sort of revolves around
music and what the author this is Nathan
Walker wrote this app primarily and what
this app that lets you do is this is
actually using the Spotify SDK the iOS
SDK that Nathan wrapped up native script
as Spotify and NPM you can hook this up
if you want to log in with Spotify as
part of your application I already have
my credentials in here so it's pretty
simple for me this is the core of the
app you can see there's a little drawer
here that's being used for navigation
this app is lets you search Spotify so
I'll search for some music here you can
see UI tableview so you get the
performance you'd expect from a native
app here I don't
satis song and as I play around here too
you can sort of see the the performance
that you get from using a native
technology
if you've used react native you'd
probably expect something similar the
core of this app is around building
what's called shout outs so thank you
Lise Roberto Perez shout outs are little
audio clips that you can record on top
of songs so there's actually a sound
plugin so I can record with this this is
the native script I think audio-video
visualization plug-in that's being used
here it's used to record this audio I
can play this thing back using the
native audio plug-in I can add this
thing to a track you can see the
animations are really quite nice I could
also just play one of these songs if I
wanted to hear some music here and if my
Wi-Fi will cooperate with me I don't
know if you can hear it but I think my
phone is absorbing that sound
so that's shout-out play which will be
on the iOS App Store relatively soon
if if you are a soccer fan from I don't
remember what country is from I don't
know I'm reading here but you could
download this app I'll show you where to
find a list of these apps if you want to
play with these yourself but just to
give you an idea of the sort of thing
that you can built with build with
native script see this app here we have
fancy weather it's an a descriptive map
if your modulus fan the modulus app is
built with native script just drag this
over I'll show you where you can
actually find some of these things in
the best places to go from here so if
you go to native script org this is our
home page if you want to see some of
these apps that I was playing with you
can go to our showcases page here and
sort of install these apps and play with
them yourself if you wanted to try that
native script examples app we have a
link to it up here some of the other
things I'll mention is if you want to
get involved with native scripts sort of
the best place to get started and the
thing I recommend for people is to join
our slack Channel
we have a pretty lively slack
environment we've got well over a
thousand people in our group and it's a
great place to add ask questions as
you're getting started up and running
with native script if you want to learn
the framework what I always tell people
is click this get started button the big
one on the web
here and we have two different tutorials
that we offer for helping you get up and
running with native script so we have a
type script in angular tutorial that's
gonna you're going to see a lot of the
code like what you saw here today we
also have a tutorial for getting started
with JavaScript remember typescript and
angular are optional in native scripts
so if you prefer more of a JavaScript
approach we have a tutorial for that
that helps you get up and running with
that as well and really that's the best
place to get started head to slack from
there and since I don't want to take
everybody's time I know I my attention
span is no more than about 45 minutes
myself guess I'll wrap up I guess I'll
ask if there are any questions at this
point
and now brief word from our sponsors
before you see the rest of the talk
Raygun spend more time building great
software and less time fighting it regen
helps keep a watchful eye on your web
and mobile applications and tells you
when problems arise you can learn more
at reagan comm native script back by
telluric by progress is an open source
framework for building truly native
mobile apps with typescript and angular
to use your web skills to get native UI
and performance on ios and android enjoy
the rest of the talk hopefully I didn't
hopefully I didn't rain to my go offline
in the middle to know you were good here
again it went well um so thank you first
off for the talk it was good um and yeah
there are a few questions here so Ryan
just asked how is state handled in
native script traditionally angular apps
for full of stateful components with
lots of imperative code is it better
today yes a you have a lot of different
options that you can use when building
with native script so you can leverage
anything that native script has out of
the box I mean for my app it was pretty
simple so I had some just very simple
apps that I was I was using and I was
just storing things out to what we call
application storage which is just a
lightweight wrapper around the iOS and
Android API is that provide that sort of
but I will mention I didn't get into
this today but we have plugins for
Couchbase we have a really good one for
firebase including the new I think it's
very 3.0 that just came out for
real-time stuff that's quite good
we have Azure plugins if you're storing
your data there if you just have a full
REST API it's easy to rap so you have a
lot of options with native to SQLite we
have a plug-in for that as well so it
really just comes down to your personal
preference so we try to be just a
runtime for this and to give you a just
just actions that best fit your
individual use case alright good answer
ah here's one is native script ready to
build production apps
yep so if you go to that native script
I think it's native script that org
slash showcases you can see we've got a
couple a two or three dozen app that are
out on the App Store today that are
built with native script native script
1.0 was released last May so we've had a
1.0 release for well over a year now our
angular stuff is kind of new the angular
we had our beta release of our angular
plugin let's see
gotta get my timelines right in my head
about two months ago now so the angular
stuff we do have apps in the App Store
built with angular that shout-out Play
app that I showed for instance is built
with angular but we're not quite saying
that we are like 1.0 I get I guess we're
sort of waiting for angular's queue on
that I guess we're only as stable as
angular 2 is because we're building on
top of them there
are you on mute Josh I think I lost your
audio I wasn't you the train went by uh
so Sebastian s why use native script
instead of react native I know you went
over that maybe like use of wha
it was more like why use native script
okay yes yeah I can give you the the
sort of succinct version I think the the
like quick and dirty is that if you're a
fan of angular 2 I think that's one
compelling reason to look at native
script I think we or typescript I should
say for that matter I think that we've
really built with those two things in
mind from the ground up and I think we
provide a better experience than what
you get and react native there I mean if
you're a big fan of react you've already
decided on you know your entire stack is
built with react here quite honestly
probably going to have a better
experience with react native because
it's just something you're familiar with
I mean a lot of reasons we built these
technologies is to let you work in an
unfamiliar environment so iOS and
Android with tools that you're already
familiar with so typescript and angular
2 is probably a better fit with native
script I should say the other reason too
is that we do I at least I feel
personally and this is just sort of my
own feeling is that we abstract you away
from ios and android a little more than
react native does make react native does
a little better job that if you you or a
team or a company you work for has some
ios and android experience that you're
going to have a better time with react
native really customizing that because
if you think about even the motivations
behind the companies building these
things like facebook is a massive out of
us an android company they know how to
really tweak and get the best out of
their apps in a native script we are
trying to extract you away from that
more i mean you saw that i retreat the
native app so really is generated code
that we're trying to keep you out of
those environments so that's my I guess
my short answer to that no that's good
oh we already internet um let's see
so Ryan asked from how you describe
native script it feels like ice thing to
use if you're going to invest in
telluric components but what about
people who don't want to use telluric
are there many community plug-ins for
expanding native functionalities with
react native I have countless plugins so
I don't have to go dig into native code
but I worry the using native script
would not allow me to go so far yep
yeah and I mean quite honestly react
native does have a bigger community and
it does have more plugins out there but
I think you'll find that our community
is quite large and growing if you just
go to NPM and search for native scripts
right though you don't have to take my
word for it there's there's about 300
things out there right now and that list
is growing every day I mean you saw some
of the things that I showed today by
demoed of some of the things that are
available I think you'll find that the
most common things that you need to do
are things that we either provide core
out-of-the-box or that are plugins
available we do have some catching up to
do for AK native to sort of expand that
list to really get some of the more
niche scenarios but our community is
growing and we're getting there so cool
all right
and I'm assuming this is your office so
behind you I see some Pokemon oh yeah
what what level are you in poke him go
I'm only level seven and that sort of
disappoints me so I I've been in
fullness l.joe mode by the way so I've
been meaning to have more time but I
have twin five-year-olds and somehow
that takes away from my Pokemon go time
although I have to say I've rigged up
yesterday I've got some of my old phones
and so I set up a hotspot on my phone so
my kids could like go outside too and
was teaching them Pokemon which was
excellent by the way so highly recommend
if you have children Pokemon go
Adventures a lot of fun yeah Diamond
foot I'm in full nostalgia mode right
here cuz my I was I was back Pokemon red
player back got my gameboy back in the
day so nice yeah I totally never played
Pokemon but I'm enjoying Pokemon go we
uh like two days ago I think it was my
daughter started playing on her phone
and we saw like oh there's a learner on
a stop down the street and so like we
just down there and they're like 12
people down there just sitting like okay
it's it's hilarious yeah it's fun all
right well I I think we're we're out of
questions there um I just I want to say
thank you TJ that was really awesome to
hear and if anyone has more questions I
know you mentioned it before but what
can they find out more information about
native script so native script at org
that the two places I would say is join
the slack channel which is a good place
for questions and you can also some
questions to the native script twitter
handle we monitor that pretty closely
awesome well thank you again and we're
gonna move on to the next topic and
seven minutes or so guys so we'll see in
a few more thanks for watching this
crater cough talk from the Mobile
Edition 2016 for more information about
upcoming conferences such as the one in
February 2017 go to camp crater IO to
learn more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
