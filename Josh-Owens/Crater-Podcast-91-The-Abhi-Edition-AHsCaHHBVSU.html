nineteen twenty sixteen welcome crater
fans i'm your host Josh owns one of my
special guest co-host and I'm hobby i er
welcome hobby it's the first time I've
ever like hosted the show with you yeah
I watched it i watch this show every
week like I like religiously i watch the
show and no really it's really cool that
I'm on the show now as like the house
that is pretty yeah i mean i'm a fan so
it's great like kind of fanboys i'm just
sitting in this chair here like let's
talk on crater podcast nice that's
awesome so do you watch the youtube
version then or how much did literally i
watched everything space Jojo puts out
like religiously like when it comes on
the podcast on my podcast app I like get
up from my desk I go for like an hour
walk just so I can hear been like Mia
make fun of himself and some good things
going on yeah yeah i watch the youtube
too nice so people are gonna see us on
YouTube right now right yeah they'll see
your that's I was just saying before we
started I like your Hawaiian shirt yeah
guys got a rep the Hawaiian shirts
that's Hawaiian shirt Friday yeah I
don't I feel like I probably can pull
that I got digital ocean today you
always have the cool texture it's like
the only textured I have is this work
pop sure time we're actually might
wearing work pop shirt I usually wear
one on friday too i forgot nice yeah you
do that routine in my schedule to listen
i was looking through my closet the
other day and realize like I'm totally
lacking like a react logo t-shirt I need
to phone totally that's my new jam I
guess nice that's good yeah we just did
a a space dojo show with West boss so
that was also nice yeah yeah he covers a
lot of react for you know beginners and
stuff like his contents really good too
yeah yes yes it should be an awesome
show alright so this week we'll get into
it we're gonna be talking about Apollo
to the moon alice a deep stream dekho
dekho dekho
oh and JavaScript fatigue fatigue haha
what I getting creative these days with
their the post titles thankfully this
this author is really good so yeah yeah
yeah so again I I'm continuing this
experiment of picking the the top oded
kind of topics crater I took it off the
last two weeks since we didn't have we
were doing crater comp last week which
was also awesome I got a house fun but
like I really had some knowledge dropped
on me which was crazy cool and those
those will be coming out on youtube too
so keep keep an eye out for those but
yeah so the big topic of maybe the last
two weeks says we had multiple stories
that would have made it into the top I
just come here merged them together is
Apollo yeah Apollo which you know like
had we been talking about this last week
we'd have been talking about reactive
graph ql but this week it's called
apollo so i thought that was that was
kind of a fun play oh yeah you know this
is like in early foray into reactive
graph ql fun name uh and you know that
the interesting thing to me is like the
data later was a repo under meteor but
this is actually a whole there's an
apollo stack yeah organization now and
Apollo's like the one of the things
coming out of it the other thing there
is like re a relay staying alone and
relay runtime query so I think there's
you know they're starting to get some
repose up and they're starting to play
around with things um and you know if
you haven't looked at it yet I would say
go take a look the link in the show
notes on they've got like a high-level
reactivity kind of markdown got him
looking over here my second screen um
and you know they just talk about what
what all is going to be involved and
this thing looks pretty
pretty crazy you know you're gonna have
to have like an invalidation server and
a caching server most likely and then
you've got that half server which is
going to serve stuff up so I mean it
looks it looks crazy complicated have
you taken a look at this yeah yeah so
when a reactive grab qo first came out
on just the design doc mm-hmm when I
actually I screw up through it and I put
a bunch of comments asking sashko you
know what about this what about that
like certain edge cases i was thinking
in man that guy is very thoughtful he
knows he knows the right answer to the
customer and like I'm approached in this
as I was gonna buy the reactive grab
queue up so he's a he did it very well
like address my concerns and told me
like why I was wrong in a really good
way so like I really appreciated that
the cool thing is at first it looks like
a DevOps nightmare right are you coming
here in to manage all this stuff but
like whether that's true or not like as
a client developer or as a web developer
like you're going to be so much more
flexible in anything you do yeah you
know what you know I I was talking to
someone uh and I said you know looking
at this this is something I would expect
to see a hosting company would come out
with right yeah because they're totally
gonna be like oh it's so hard just come
pay us some money we'll make it super
easy and it's like that's pretty smart I
got it's really smart I mean meteor
right is going to be our galaxy's like
this hosting is hosting a you know
behemoth and it with the free render
service they just did now a people who
have galaxy memberships can get the
pre-render io integration and I wouldn't
be surprised if they say oh yeah we'll
manage all this reactive oh this all
this of all those stuff if you pay us a
little bit more money you know it's a
good offering it's just like if you're
an independent developer or a contract
developer like like it's hard to take
advantage of these things when you have
to manage it all yourself yeah that's
the tough part it but it can be right
like I i gave a talk at a crater conf
about building my own
galaxy set up which you know includes
things like I run my own pre-render
server for crater yeah but you know I
gotta say like between the the spam and
dealing with that and just setting all
this stuff up i bet i spent a good you
know two weeks of time on that thing
which isn't trivial and like I'm shared
during the talk a lot of my configs and
set up some plan to do it in a blog post
as well but you know I mean it's not a
small thing to manage all this and it's
not a small thing but also you're very
passionate about that at the stuff so
like I am right so it's like two weeks
of hard work plus passion that's that
but like someone like me who doesn't
care you know I do care but like I don't
have the same like like passion for
going to figure that stuff out like for
me if I don't have the funds then I
probably won't have Apollo you know yeah
I'm hoping I'm hoping that's not the
case yeah because if it's a commercial
offering and I'm a Joe Schmo with the
one one-man team it's gonna be tough
I'll be things the old way well you know
I think I as long as they use some
off-the-shelf components right like ever
the invalidation server is if they're
able to do something that's not too hard
to run I don't think that's going to be
that bad yeah I think they mentioned in
the meteor and I presentation Matt had a
meteor night presentation about meteors
goal to support any database and this is
like getting us in the right direction
because I know a lot of people don't
like Mongo which is funny because they
think it's bleeding edge but you know
ebay and stripe use you know MongoDB but
like if people get more comfortable with
other DBS then maybe meteor gets a
little bit bigger in terms of like
patrons and stuff so yeah which which
could be interesting as well and um yeah
oh yeah I i wanna i want to watch the
video i didn't catch it last night so
maybe we'll talk about it next week but
yeah um yeah I don't know like this this
whole thing is super interesting to me
and I I got to watch era notas talk on
graph ql and i don't i don't know how i
feel about it like i think in the end
it's gonna be a good change but at the
same time
um I it's I think it's going to be
harder to write you know the kind of the
publications that we have now there's
gonna be a little more boilerplate to it
and it'll be a little more work which
you know is maybe we get more power down
the road and yeah you know that's it's
definitely something that I don't think
it'll be as easy to use out of the gate
and I don't did Matt talk about that at
all like what what's happening to DD as
a result of this net it's very like you
know so you know kissing was it kissing
babies and like shaking hands type thing
where like just giving you like the
surface level stuff you know that's okay
that gets people inspired yeah one thing
that I like to point out is like when so
when work pop started we had all this
legacy like publications and stuff and
now that we've like a bigger team and
we're a lot smarter and we know meteor
more like we sought to fight this like
legacy schema that is like propagated
throughout the whole app for the last
year so grab ql is really interesting to
us because on the client we want we
don't want to deal with this like really
gross schema we don't have time to deal
with its let's just transform it into
something the client can can use and can
use efficiently so we're in the meantime
is you know simple schema like what we
do is we have a client schema and a
server schema and we have like these
transformation functions that handle
this type of thing so client is like has
the easiest data possible to manage I
think but you know you lose a lot of
stuff by doing you lose like the mini
mondo reactivity and we didn't really
care about that but having a reactive
graph girl there to do that translation
for you man that would help us out a lot
so yeah yeah and maybe that's maybe
you're highlighting the point of like my
problems are different than your
problems because yeah that's that I work
on or like an order of magnitude
different I suppose most of the time if
I'm working with meteor it's like me or
me and one other person yeah and not
really like a huge team of five six
developers which I have been there
before you know working at at out right
which got bought by godaddy and they had
a team of like 30 people and you know i
was on the API team and
I had like front end team and you know
it was it was a pain and I can I can
totally understand that for sure so i
don't know i think it's interesting I
they moved the repo so I'm actually
already watching it so i started
watching the reactive graph ql when they
first put it up or the data data repo
and that was quite a bit of noise out of
the gate and then it's it's kind of
calmed down when they made the name
announcement someone was being funny and
put some pictures in there to do who's
on a team for the data team uh I know
it's sashko so I just I just did all
this like two weeks ago maybe I wrote i
modified the contributor I haga and they
changed it up a little more uh just I
think it's sashko and it's justin is on
okay cool yeah oh yeah those guys are
smart though they'll definitely bigger
some cool stuff oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I
would agree I I have some trust there
yeah and totally i'll be watching and
you should be watching as well yeah and
all the listeners start watching yes yes
definitely so good the next one yeah
what should we be using instead of
meteor hahaha that's funny um I don't
have the good segues like n des but
let's get into the next one um so
there's cool service called deep stream
I oh and what it is is it's pretty much
an open source framework for real-time
web development everyone's heard that
story before but it's a interesting
thing about this is it's built by a dev
shop called hoxton one and hoxton wanna
they don't like find a real-time
financial apps so like like they're most
of the deep streaming examples are like
you have like a mobile app and a web app
and you're like touching graphs at the
same time and you can see on both
devices that you know the data is is
doing everything in real
and then so what I did is before the
show I built a small little app with
deep stream and literally it took like
20 minutes 30 minutes to get it going
wow it's really quick and i'll say this
like deep stream what it does is it
pretty much you pretty much can make a
little node server with the hazard deep
string back bitch so that's the little
node server and what it does is it
listens to messages like kind of a pub
sub we all heard this before and update
like it updates all the clients that are
listening to these these messages it has
a message layer it also has a caching
layer for like just like data that
you're going to be fetching like you
know constantly so it's very trivial and
then the last thing is like this like
the actual data layer so you have to
plug and play your own data layer so for
the one that I did I did we think DB
because they have a rethink to be
connector so like um it's like just
another NPM package called like deep
stream rethink PB and all you got to do
is you just there's just these nice API
methods where we just create a new
connector and all your data is a stream
to a little rethink DB instance so no
that's the server in so all you gotta do
is pretty much do like an empty em
install a couple little like
configurations and then it's like just
like a regular no doubt on the front end
however it's a little different you
there's like a deep stream client
there's a client interface on a deep
stream where you actually get it from
Bauer hopefully it's going to be on NPM
just who uses Baur anymore and it has
some really nice like a really basic
method so for what I did I didn't have
any off but they do have authentication
you can like you can just log in to your
deep stream server via this method is
called dot log in it login logs you into
your your server like with you know with
no authentication and pretty much you
have access to like the deep stream
server you can just get records from
them like pretty much just like record
gets you know username or record set
some object and it'll actually like
update those those like those pieces of
data
reactively and you can actually
subscribe to these certain records so it
has this really deep API that just
allows you to have like these
subscriptions on the client and the ad
in like a DIN update methods that we all
know and pretty much when those things
happen in like these uh these reactive
updates happen instantly so I feel like
the small to view app and you can use
any front-end framework he's a few or
react i used reacting man is dope
there's yeah I'm gonna skin I'm looking
at the docs now for the react part it it
looks pretty easy so you just make a
subscribe call huh yeah you just do a
subscribe call and any sets that you do
on whatever you're subscribed to will
automatically update any like any like
you I that's bound to that to that that
item you know so it was really cool and
you can actually like get like like you
can do like in rethink baby there's like
these club these are I think it's called
Rico its kind of weird re cool queries
and like since rethink DB is kind of
like a table structure you can like get
the table from the deep stream DB please
grab the to do stable which I had and
you know manipulate data like that so it
was a very interesting learning
experience i'm glad i got assigned this
topic because it really took like 20 25
minutes to get going and if i wanted to
build an app further i probably would
the only thing is meteor handles a lot
of this for you like and then it handles
it a lot a lot of this for you in a more
broad sense where like you're not
confined to this pub sub type model like
in meteor we have meteor methods and we
have all these other types of
client-side data management with
reactive bars and such like you know
tracker is a little little evil
sometimes but i think like it does its
job pretty well yeah look if you're
looking to do like some small like toy
app like this is super perfect we want
to make some type of instagram fechar or
something or a youtube streamer
something like that or something that
you would want to do real time in like
maybe Bluebird Bluebird cars going
hey it's perfect super simple and I
recommend anyone just try it and have
fun it's really fun to just play with it
yeah yeah it's like it it looks it looks
interesting just looking at these stocks
yeah like I totally didn't go this deep
so I'm glad you did that's awesome yeah
dude i think this wheel time stuff is
getting a little crazy like everybody
wants real time web but I constantly
always wonder like how many things like
need to be real time yeah yeah how many
things actually need to be real time i
don't know i think you know it's
interesting you bring this up right
because we we talked we had to talk from
tom about kind of like building a real
time you I and it kind of forces you to
rethink how you are gonna update the UI
and use like animations and that kind of
thing and yeah you don't necessarily
always need things to to move around the
screen once they update right so if you
look at they like crater changing what
stories are we're on the page will
happen reactively but when you add a new
story you actually have to like click a
button to get it updated yeah and you
know that's I don't know like is that
sometimes like i'll be on product and be
like man I wish I would have just did it
and then you hit the refresh button and
you move on in life right is that the
end it's probably not you know yeah snot
I don't know yes there's something
something should be real time some
things shouldn't but half the time you
can just fake it on the client you can
literally just fake it and no one would
know yeah yeah I would agree with that I
think it's just more work to fake it but
at the same time like it takes more
server resources or more client
resources to make it real time so yeah
thank you you're strapped for servers
resources then you know baking it by
your best friend yeah yeah I you know I
I think that's the first thing you want
to ditch when you start having scale
problem with meteor is like do I really
need all this data to be reactive yeah
I'll need to go through live query and
there's been some interesting talk about
that as well mm-hmm speaking of uber
little cars moving around on from uber
uh we had this awesome five minute
spring cast on YouTube did you watch
this thing dude I watched it it's really
cool I mean I'm sitting there I'm
skeptical that there's so much magic
going on but I you know that's the thing
I don't think it's that much magic I
think they're just really number one I
think they're better versed and react
native then maybe your IR and so like
they know ecosystem better and you know
sometimes it makes for a good demo to
just pull in a couple packages and be
like look shiny you know but yeah at the
same time like they're firing up
simulators and like reloading the page
and building out an uber UI and like the
thing is when I got done watching it
started thinking like what did they
actually do in that five minutes and
they created a UI mmm for an application
that they could go on and build but my
guess is like you know it would take
them at least a day to get a lot of that
infrastructure in place to actually
start to approach anything close to what
ever has um what the the thing is like
it's still pretty amazing that they were
able to get that mock down in five
minutes with this ya little IDE so super
interesting to me yeah I wonder like I
wonder how like so like that that five
minute demo is like a very happy path
like demo you know I wonder what a real
the real developer experiences with
building like non trivial things it
looked like you know you can just drop a
map view you can just drop like that in
there and that's cool because someone
that's not you spent the time to
actually build out the view and like
build in a composable way so you can
just drop map views everywhere but if
you're building something like outside
the realm of what they offer like
I wonder what the community is like
where are you contributing back to these
little modules you know that yeah yeah
that's a good point um but they are they
are so they are also starting to do some
kind of module discovery from the looks
of it so again this is react native and
so I think like if you look at it the
lot of that map you stuff I think comes
from react native itself yeah I'm not
sure that they're relying on any
third-party modules for that um you know
it's super interesting to me because
they talk about how they're trying to
like filter out these react native
packages that you can then call into
your app and kind of rely on which is
super awesome we were talking about
something similar like there's not
there's a couple websites like react
components calm but there's there's not
like a lot of great ways to necessarily
go discover Rio yeah so and here's my I
have a little bit of qualms with react
components or react out parts like these
websites ya like like it's hard to find
quality components on those websites
because a lot of people when you're
writing components you have like these
personal assumptions about the component
like whether you know whether it's blue
or green or you know all these little
things that when someone who wants to
consume that package has to like go
through all these hoops like oh like
this has its own style sheet well I
didn't want a style sheet you know like
or it does something that's against my
style guide well you know that sucks you
know anyway like things like this I
think I after I've seen a lot of react
native code and I don't see this problem
and react native like shared react
native things you know I think it's a
lot of the reactive components I've seen
I've been really high quality so if you
haven't seen any bad ones yet that's
really cool the react arts that I've
seen for the web I've seen some bad
quality ones for sure yeah well and you
know maybe the the interesting
difference there is is the lack of
direct CSS support or you know there's
it i can't i can write some style sheets
for react native but I can't really like
say like oh this is the bootstrap map
component right it's just flex box and
it's there and you're kind of just
laying out your your UI that way so um
yeah I don't know I've you may be right
just in the fact that like if someone's
building a mobile app they're taking the
time to do it right yeah maybe
interesting mobile so important like
don't use Cordova use react native so
you know that's interesting i'd love to
get your opinion on this to like being
part of a bigger team you guys like
hired some iOS guys and went native but
now that you're if you had it to do over
again would you look at react native
like now that you guys start to use
react if we were to do it over today
mm-hmm we would probably use react
native or full web but the dream would
be to still go native um but for us we
just had the talent at the time like we
got lucky we had the challenge so we did
it one thing that sucks about you know
meteor and native iOS development and
android development is it breaks the
cycle of these what these developers are
used to know like the meteor iOS is
awesome because marked martine or margin
or whatever he he's like he's keeping up
with the you know his given a project
for that and he's also part of mediate
your core but the android seen for DDP
is really really crappy like we had you
had to wrestle a lot of nasty connection
bugs and IH three mirrors and all this
stuff you know you know i mean it's
interesting but I think maybe is that is
that a symptom of the fact that like the
developer community tends to use more or
less whereas i think android is more of
an every man's kind of device I don't
know ya know yeah and that's that's true
but I think what I'm trying to get at is
like this whole web sockets thing versus
you know rest that's the thing that
people get like caught up about ya think
about react native and let's say we
didn't have any iOS or Android
developers like if you're a meteor
developer you understand pub/sub you
understand meteor methods let's say you
also just a regular web developer you
can create rest api is like so when you
go into your like the mobile space and
you're doing this react native or
cordova stuff and got all the back end
or front end components down the you may
lack is just the experience to know like
how how a mobile app should feel if
you're working with mobile apps you just
have like this like it's like a designer
who can look at a page that's not to
spec you know that there's padding off
you know you look at it you know same
with same with like iOS developers they
just feel the feel it and they're like
whoa this feels a little weird so that's
something that you lack there is that
worth like the business risk of you know
investing all that money to get people
like that no but you know it's not worth
it but if you have the talent and you
can do it oh yeah interesting take
alright so i'm curious now is this kind
of bring it back around the deco is this
available now can people like get this
you know to go sign up yeah yeah it
looks like em you have to request it
okay so no it's not like fully open yet
yes in beta i believe ya but you gotta
like it's not like download our beta
it's like give us your email uh oh it
might be in the welcome email so give it
a try yeah super fresh you know yeah I I
plan at some point this year probably
like around may I plan to do a react
native training oh yeah that'll be great
hey yeah i think i may just use this
because this is it looked it looked
amazing i looked at me yeah i think
there's so there's some value in
teaching people tools you know like get
this yeah speaking of tooling i'm tired
of the javascript fatigue i'm getting
fatigued tell me more getting fatigued
about JavaScript fatigue yeah so there's
this so the last topic is javascript
fatigue fatigue and I know what you guys
are thinking you're listening you like
another article about JavaScript booty
well
thankfully this author is axel Rosh
Meyer and he's written a book called
learning es6 he has a great website
called to holiday calm all is like
musings about javascript and he gives
some great advice like really great
advice that he says he understands that
web development is overwhelming and I
think everybody does that's what that's
what the fatigue is but he gives a
couple tips to get over the petite so
like one of them is like don't try to
know everything I think that's a lot of
the problems with the people that are
our developers is like we have this
thirst for knowledge like we love
learning we love doing new things but
the minute that you know that 20 new
things just came out yesterday you get
kind of like stress that you don't know
it and like you know some some type of
job security relies on your ability to
know certain things so I understand that
also people get on the bleeding edge and
he advises that you should wait for a
critical mass like react two years ago
was probably bleeding edge and now it's
grating getting mass so maybe right now
is probably the perfect time to jump in
because it's going to approach critical
mass very soon and you can wait for
people's just you know flesh out their
ideas like i know ben newman is into
this thing called roll up jas to handle
like this whole module system but a
secret leading edge and even he says
it's something that he's gonna watch
it gets better oh the classic train um
the classic train just came by yeah
always listen I always listen to that on
the podcast so anyway back to the thing
so like yeah so then Newman he's waiting
on roll up and he's gonna wait till it
hits critical mass and then maybe we'll
consider it for meteor and some other
things is like when you learn these
things like like I did for the deep
stream just do like a small pet project
mmm you don't spend a lot of time on it
you just create a small project learn
what it's about and then dump it in the
trash like who cares no as long as you
like learn something from doing it and
sorry to go in through all these points
with the last point I think is the most
important point is like five years find
yourself outside of your work and do
other things than just programming or
like solving problems like you know
anything that's not related to your work
is going to help ease your fatigue so if
like you like to go hiking or if you
like to like if you like you know indie
movies or like all these little things
that people like you should go to do
those things more when you're like
fatigue because that'll help you
alleviate the stress of like all this
JavaScript sweet yeah yeah that's
actually a great point for life in
general um yeah totally yeah you know I
think I think Axl uh rights he helps to
JavaScript weekly maybe I say oh yeah
one of those ah I'll to confirm then you
said he's a really smart smart guy
talented author I leaned on his
publications to learn things like and
he's coming out with saying that he's
coming out with this piece that is a
focus on non technical things be more
well-rounded because the mini the mini
of you like lock yourself in to this is
lifestyle like a good engineer like
you're like constantly doing everything
all you think about it it's like doesn't
let's say no way to live personally yeah
sometimes like you know sometimes when
we even you probably like when we're
working and we're like super focused on
solving something and like our minds are
so like concentrated on doing this we
sometimes you forget to eat right
sometimes forget to go outside like all
this stuff that just clouds your mind
because you're so focused like if like
you know one of my friends said like oh
I want to be a software engineer I was
like yo you should not be a software
engineer because like if you have an
addictive personality to like always
learn and like just like work and stuff
like it's gonna be killer for you
because it's gonna be unhealthy actually
yeah yeah I wouldn't wish I wouldn't
wish this on anybody else you know yeah
yeah you know it's interesting like I
think um I think people that are open to
react or open to like developing
everything in JavaScript or probably
closer to the bleeding edge and that
that's probably why a lot of us kind of
feel like we have JavaScript fatigue
like I I even tweeted a couple weeks ago
like I just I wish I had more time to go
learn all the interesting and exciting
stuff that's coming out in the
JavaScript ecosystem because you know
like I haven't even had a chance to
really play with react native like I've
just been relying on Cordova and using
that to build mobile apps but I think
react native would be super interesting
or like I've just in the last month and
a half really started playing with react
myself so I mean it definitely can feel
like you should know more but I I I
think he's right like it's it's okay if
you don't you know it's not the end of
the world and he had another point in
here to like every piece of technology
you bolt onto the app your building just
makes it that much harder for someone
else to come in and kind of contribute
to your project and yeah like that's
that's the biggest thing that always
true me to meteor is like I don't I
don't have to worry about bolting in too
many other technologies to get in that
built you know I just rely a meteor and
like it sets the stage for how an app
should be built and you know I I've
certainly seen in my time like a lot of
different rails apps um
and they're all built slightly different
of course depending on the developer but
nothing uh was worse than when I was in
the kind of the backbone community like
every backbone application I saw was
like a hundred percent different like it
was so bizarre I hate backbone for that
reason I'll say it i hate backbone i
think it's like this is a really strong
opinion but I think it sucks so what was
it I don't think it was enough of an
opinionated kind of exactly to install
and so everybody kind of like filled in
the gaps themselves and that led to pain
like the worst project I was on we came
in and like it was written in backbone
and I had never seen anyone even write
an application in this style before but
then like the guy that wrote it all was
quitting the day we started on the
project man yeah it was awesome
translation there yeah we yeah yeah i
mean honestly they scrapped off it's
terrible but yeah you know i don't know
i don't i don't think you have that with
meteor definitely not like you don't
have to manage all this overhead that
other things have to put on you and
honestly like the people that meteor
like they're passionate about solving
the stuff that you don't want to solve
because i don't want to work on a bill
to be honest I think it's a most boring
thing you're doing a front or gulp setup
like shoot me please just do it your gun
should be done but with meteor I don't
have to manage any of this stuff I don't
have to minify my CSS that would suck
you know all this great stuff that now I
can focus on things that do get excited
exactly and actually that actually
reduces our fatigue like we in the media
community we're fatigued by other things
we're not really fatigued by the same
things that most JavaScript developers
are fatigued about yes we're fatigued
over pull requests getting in yeah yeah
we're busy there's worse things in life
I think seriously there are worse things
but now that we're going to be
integrated with the JavaScript community
there there are some you know fears of
you guys getting fatigued especially the
meteor listeners read this article and
you'll probably be fine
yeah yeah just just know like it's not
the end of the world I had a boss so I i
worked at avon as in like Avon lady
calling and I was an IT department here
in in Cincinnati they had a call center
and um you know like people would just
get so stressed out about their job and
our boss was just like I'm out of his
office and he'd be like everybody calm
down we're not curing world hunger we're
not sending people to the moon we make
lipstick will live it was like yeah you
know you're right like I there's no app
that I'm building that's gonna probably
change the world at least if I'm
building it for a client like maybe a
small change but all right if I get it
done today or I get it done tomorrow or
whatever it is like it's not that ya
know app is worth your sanity or your
your well-being so agree that's another
thing to think so agreed it's a great
lineup of posts yeah yeah I'm finding an
interesting to like let let the
community kind of dictate what we talked
about these are not like I probably
would have chose some of those posts but
not all of them so it's interesting ya
know that yeah usually there's like
mostly it's like meteor biased or you
know things like that mm-hmm but this
was really good it was like fresh and
then we could bring our meteor
influences into it which I really liked
yeah yeah definitely yeah so I gotta say
like deco i think was like the number
one top buddha story it was tied for
number one so nice you know people are
interested in this stuff yeah least in
meteor lands alright well thank you
bobby for filling in hey thanks for
having me i love to do this anytime you
need me yeah definitely i think that may
happen more than not i don't know we'll
see been certainly busy now with
transmission as well and i kind of took
his time today for space dojo show as
well so
yeah if the audience loves me I'll be
back twit yeah if you love obby tweet it
yeah there you go but what is your
twitter handle it's Abby iron and abhi
aiy er it's really hard to spell but I
usually tweet Josh I tweet been like I'm
in the Twitterverse for meteor probably
if you don't know me you will so yeah
all right well thank you everybody for
tuning in and listening I really
appreciate it and we'll be back next
week for sure we'll see who's on maybe
if you have enough people tweet maybe
we'll have aa beyond I don't know yeah
maybe I'll be back um and as always
we've got the space dojo slack chat room
which is pretty awesome place to hang
out who can I give a can I give like a
customer success story on the space dojo
slack yeah because I am part of the
catch slack channel yeah hey if you want
to learn if you want to talk to other
media developers and I have good
conversations arguments like things that
really like push the boundary of like
what you know and yeah all that type of
stuff like I was considered like
consider joining the slack chat room I'm
there there are a lot of smart people
there and if you need help like
everybody's down to help everybody's
down to helping you solve your issues
like I met a bunch of online friends
from it I've met Ben and Josh to that I
met David Sakura like all ok grow like
everybody's in that chat room so if
you're part of the community we should
be there yes that's awesome thank you I
I think I think people don't believe me
but it's like I feel like if you took
Stack Overflow as a concept and like
made it real time and made it like five
times better like the answers you likely
get will be right like that's more what
the space dojo like general chat room is
or or the sub chat rooms right like
react or any of those places yeah
there's a ton of good content yeah
definitely and and you can come in and
uh make fun of been with the rest of us
yeah oh I know the great thing with Ben
being in there he lets us know what's
going on on transmission before it
happens like all that great insider
stuff so indeed get on it get outside
baseball and then as always modulus is
our sponsor so if you're looking for
hosting you could go somewhere else or
you could go to modulus I think modulus
is a great place to most applications I
know that you know there's there's a ton
of options out there now but very few
our turnkey and that is definitely one
of them so all right thanks Abby will
thank us next week
this video has been a space dojo
production you can click the learn more
button to find out more about us at
space dojo com or you can click the
subscribe button to get notified about
new videos we put out each week thanks
