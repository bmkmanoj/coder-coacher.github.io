2015 welcome crater fans I gotta get use
crater fans Raider i'm your host Josh
Owens and I'm your co-host been Strahan
I trim my beard I didn't trim my beard
it's like what would do the poop in the
beard thing so it's like probably twenty
percent less Putin that messes me up
every time I go to trim my beard or
every morning like a minute really ratty
I have to calm it I'm like I wonder how
much I'm probably combing out like maybe
twenty percent of the Pooh so I feel
good about it you know like close the
lid when you flush the toilet all right
ah it's kind of funny because like we
were a little segue I was teaching my
kids who are all in grade school about
like molecules and like the world is
made up of molecules and all stuff right
yes your beard example no i didn't but
this like this like our connecting
factor the stories poo ha listen listen
everyone who doesn't have kids if you
want to get your kids engaged and teach
them something always use poo as an
example then they'll listen or daddy
said boo anyway molecules like when you
smell stuff it's like little molecules
breaking off from the big piece of
matter right and so I told them I'm like
every time you smell a stinker it's
actually someone's who that you're
that's going up in your nose haha and
then my wife yells across the room she's
like and that's also why you got poo and
your beard oh and it comes full circle
then there we go that's we say that this
trahan house but now now my kids are
fascinated with biology and fun all for
the right reasons oh my goodness okay so
let's talk about different molecules
your kind uh oh my gosh I totally am on
the wrong screen here we go so we're
going to talk about meteor guides
slimming down some fat models uh mdgs
doing an ama yeah yeah meteor and engine
X that was it that's that was all the
news this week nothing else and I i
interject with galaxy what no no there
was nothing nothing nothing to even talk
about no no just kidding we'll talk
about this galaxy thing like ice
actually we'll start here we'll see i
was gonna heart stopped so this'll
probably the biggest topic oh boy was it
ever a topic at jalics dropped did it
did and um I don't know I I definitely
felt like it was gonna be expensive and
I think I said that on this show a
couple times I was actually a little
surprised it was a little cheaper than I
thought if you pay annually mm-hmm um
and Jeff Schmidt did point out that they
are cheaper than Heroku and modulus and
they offer a better you know SLA um but
you know I think I think a lot of people
were really expecting galaxy to just
like when it dropped it would be like
everything they ever wanted in a hosting
platform you know and yeah kind of serve
serve all different levels yeah but I
you know I mean so it's interesting they
drop Cooper Nettie's that it went full
AWS so you know this there's really no
other platform there that you're going
to be able to install it on and I think
like behind the firewall installs now
get a little bit awkward to like I don't
know if they're going to do VPC or any
of that kind of stuff that amazon offers
but they're using elastic load balancer
and cloud formation to kind of launch
your containers for you and you get what
is it like 10 1 gigabyte containers 45 a
month of you pretty pay for the year
right so or or I think 650 a month if
you do monthly yeah and then we've got a
plan up above that where you get double
ye like 20 the containers I found it odd
that they were segmenting on number of
users that you're gonna attach like yeah
I don't understand that too much team
members I think the first level you get
5 second level you get 10 it's like I
honestly like I don't know like you you
probably just going to denote one guy to
deploy or honestly like if you're gonna
scrip the thing you just stop one script
use that's right yeah yeah so I I don't
understand spent like on the projects
that we work on like I'm just using that
as a base point so that's what I'm
comparing it to maybe getting someone
from mdg and hopefully like I'm looking
forward to the ma ma ma ma and uh that
would come up so yeah you know something
since we're the crater podcast now not
the meteor podcast XO people might be
like gala let's see what uh you know
yeah yes and what I mean it's the new I
guess we didn't say that like which is
yeah like I don't think we've broken out
of our our meteor kind of audience yet
really yeah come on people send this two
year to the node nerds that you know
we'd it more guys come on it um but yeah
yeah definitely like it's it's a
self-service hosting platform
self-service is it um
platform-as-a-service I guess and yeah
you know you can but it's only confirmed
deploying a meteor app like I guess you
could probably figure out how to deploy
a note out there no well they kind of
said it they're like hey this is only
for meteor and you don't have control
over the containers we do what we're
going to do the scaling for you and that
tells me that they are purposely using
hosting meteor and breaking out certain
parts of it yeah automatically that
they're expecting to be there because
it's a meteor app but you know here's
the interesting thing to me and I don't
know maybe maybe the enterprise market
isn't dealing with as many users as we
thought because I know like I've been on
this Cordova app building it and they're
a fortune 500 company that that
Commission the app and
you know they they're putting something
like 2,000 people in the app which is
something that scaling wise isn't that
hard to handle right um but you know I
would think like for the enterprise you
probably want to even target bigger than
that you're looking at like 20 30
thousand people connected to your app at
any given time and I don't know like I
just don't get that there's that many
meteor apps out there that are that
large and I also don't think that
scaling your app containers is the hard
part of scaling at twenty to thirty
thousand people i think Mongo starts to
become your problem and they didn't
touch Mongo so that was another thing
that I think a lot of people were
disappointed it's a good point yeah yeah
you're just you're you have to get Mongo
services from elsewhere yeah yeah and
they recommend compose compose get like
early access and put together some
videos that show you how to to get it
all running together which is pretty
easy I gotta say um I guess now compose
is part of IBM which you know I find
interestingly funny to me like IBM kind
of competes you know on the enterprise
front with niggas base MTG mana wouldn't
that have been awesome if mdg was able
to raise around to buy compose oh that
would have been crazy yeah what did the
Epis know that would be because I mean
that that would have felt felt like an
interesting fit too because they've been
yeah rethink DB stuff and you know in
that job so we give me to your support
for that that could be really
interesting yeah so I don't know I feel
like at least from the commoners point
of view like many people were very
disappoint I am really curious too I
mean MTG is smart so this is what I
there's a lot of talk in our forums man
it was a lot of talk in our star I'm
sorry in our slack yeah in the forums
yeah and so like I don't know I just
reminded everyone to like shut up and
like just feels like like mdg is smart
and on top of that they have they have
venture capitalist money who like they
want to get a return on their money
their smart to they have a bunch of
analysts as well like they they already
have the endgame in my
yeah also don't judge them based off a
version one yeah I think this is a
really really good looking virgin one
well I think it's I've just been giving
like like the consensus that I got out
of the forum and other people post yeah
absolutely and I agree with everything
you said yeah and my thoughts on the
actual launch our that one it's actually
pretty smart the way they're doing it if
you think about it you're most people
don't realize this but hosting you
really like you're selling an
oversubscribed model right and I'm
trying to have more people than you have
resources and that's where you make your
money and so with hosting like the one
thing that you have to pay for that is
much harder is support and I feel like
you know if you look at come to me I
compared this to apple and Dell right if
you go look at dell you can go get your
laptop from them and it's not really
like an experience you don't really feel
like you know you're getting this great
thing you're just kind of like I need a
laptop give me a laptop I'm gonna work
on a laptop cuz when you go to apple
you're like I want the best I'm a great
support you know I want the applecare
like you know it's is more like an
experience and I think that's the market
that they're going after here you know
you get the one our SLA which I don't
think you can you're gonna pay over a
thousand dollars a month to get that
from Heroku and even then like gonna be
like meteor wha and um you know I
modulus I don't think they give you an
SLA and you'll pay a little bit more
than what you're paying galaxy well they
do have an enter bruh enterprise-class
they do they do and he'll work with you
and I think you know if that's something
you're interested in you should contact
them because they still are a good
hosting service but they don't you know
it's just not the SLA stuffs not like
upfront with them so you're not sure
what you're getting whereas meteors like
yes we want this to be an amazing
support experience for deploying your
meteor application you know and I think
that's what gone after here and the
hardest part of that is going to be
building
that support team and at 500 bucks a
month you know people deploying one or
two apps they're gonna have a lot less
questions and people deploying you know
for twenty bucks deploying a nap or
thirty bucks deploying and a half lake
yeah that person's gonna have a lot of
questions I think yeah yeah absolutely
i'm also curious to see as time goes on
heroku is expensive right and how do how
do people get hooked on Heroku they
build your produce a video and then they
launch their startup with 190 on Heroku
and then they grow with Heroku and
before you before you know it your bills
huge on Heroku but they were there for
you from the beginning I'm curious what
the versions are going to come out of
galaxies later on if they're gonna like
get people at an early stage yeah well I
mean the parties and yeah right in the
fact they said that they are planning on
moving their free service is over and
that they'll be coming out with a much
more affordable like almost like a
single container option for developers
oh yeah I missed that I didn't see that
it was in the faq I hmm well no you're
lying to me you're trolling me dude cuz
no listed that in the chat room like we
keep it became a joke the other day
because they were posting it like every
10 minutes I I didn't read i just read
the beginning oh I summit I I was so fed
up I was like I am NOT gonna read the
full post of these people that's funny
um but yeah so so they're totally gonna
offer like free that you know they're
free services will be on galaxy yeah I
did read that part yeah and I didn't
read that one container a more
affordable option well I I don't know if
it's gonna be a one container option but
they're gonna come out with like a more
affordable like single developer type
option mom and you know I I was kind of
arguing back and forth with Sam hatoum
in the in the forums on the on some of
the posts there as well and you know
there's um there's costs associated
right like for me running a business
doing freelancing and podcasting and all
this other stuff like every minute I
spent on
Peter I don't really make any money with
greater bright it's really just a cost
Center for me yeah and I've never even
figured out a good way to work it into
my business I just enjoy it I enjoyed
evah so like I've moved it to digital
ocean I've been playing with talker but
that comes with some pretty big expense
in my opinion because like I'm always
there trying to figure out like how to
make it a little bit faster or more
stable or something and you know when
you lose five billable hours to that
thing like that that's a cost yeah and
you like bill out at six hundred dollars
an hour right I do yeah galaxies like
cheap to me ya know I don't 45 minutes
in my work boom got my galaxy bill paid
yeah I wish maybe or no no but not me he
doesn't mean yeah his rate was higher
than mine but he doesn't do consulting
work anymore so yeah alright that's
anyway yes you know it okay here's your
parting thought right think about this
galaxy means that they're now hosting
applications here's the things that
meteor development group didn't really
do very well before then we're building
apps and they weren't fixing apps that
much they would get bug reports and then
it asks you for a minimal reproduction
now they put themselves on the hook to
like look at things fix things that's
gonna be awesome for everybody I think
we're gonna major improvements come into
meteor cool yes as a result a galaxy
launching positive that is a positive
and so like it may have been a bummer
for you to read that but in the end
we're gonna all benefit because we're
living here in this open source world so
yeah like that's the same thing with a
wordpress they worked on the open source
saying a word press forever they came
out with premium hosting which was only
available to like the top blogs ever and
it was like thousands of dollars a month
right mm-hmm all of a sudden you start
seeing that the open-source WordPress
was starting to like be be like
bulletproof and it was like in prepared
and it was like production grade open
source product and then all of a sudden
everyone was trusting it to build their
stuff on it and now it took over the
world in
is that in the future for meteor mmm
anyway I'm so so yeah okay next story uh
uh next story meteor guides talking
about making movements to production and
making things more efficient and open so
sashko I think this is a move a
calculated move by Sasha co and mdg to
kind of come back to community and be
like hey we're here right hold out this
thing that said New Year guide sashko in
the forum said hey like I want to start
giving back and in documenting best
practices mdg style and and he opened up
the conversation has become a wildly
popular form page to uh to go through
and then he as usual sashko has amazing
uh um like github read Mees yeah Oh sick
he's got good writing skills he's oh my
gosh he does yeah so talented yeah
anyway it's a start and and there has
been I don't know gosh we can like bring
this we don't have a lot of time but we
could we could bring this all over the
place because there was an of speaking
points that we could touch up here's
what I would say like the forum post is
is pretty good but really where the bulk
of this is happening now is in the in
the github repos and the issues and it's
like crazy mad inside there with a bunch
of issues being open and talking about
governance and just all kinds of things
around this project and even just like
some of the articles like Sasha goes
down some some original content that he
has and abigail is kind of you know
thinking about like how can the cookbook
fit in all this so right it's just
really interesting stuff and if you want
to help documentation like you should
get on board with this thing I'm kind of
interested there's a number of things
that I feel are um you know I think
aren't documented well and I
hope that they can can kind of clean
that up and this this will be a good
effort my only thought is you know from
the community standpoint I still worry
you know with 86 pull request sitting
out there for mvg for meteor right now
like what's it gonna look like uh when
you know we only have one person kind of
shepherding this project on the mdg side
and the only way we get things kind of
in is through sashko or through maybe
they'll designate someone else to but I
just I feel like that's gonna be a
potential bottleneck and I'd really like
to see maybe a little more governance
kind of coalesce around this and and say
like yeah actually here's here's some
other people that we trust to approve
content in this regard yeah like maybe
some community leadership yes absolutely
because I just I don't want to take some
time like to me like I've got a blog
where I can publish a lot of this stuff
anyway and it's still at this point like
my trust levels a little bit lower
because the way poll requests have been
handled in the past so it's just gonna
be easier for me to just take it over
there and write it on my blog whereas
you know maybe it's it's more beneficial
to have more eyes on it have a
discussion make it a little bit better
and publish it you know with meteor guys
yeah and ultimately your motivation
saying all that is to recognize hey
there's a like a lot of momentum behind
this right now you don't want to keep
that momentum going yeah I don't want it
to be like like space talk was really
interesting to watch because it was like
mad activity you know everyone's like
working on things pull request pull
request and then like just you know it
kind of like everyone lost interest and
wasn't it the people around it lost
interest and then like the core team was
kind of left there and it ended up like
the rocket chat made some smart moves
and it kind of pulled ahead and it's it
was the winner there and like we don't
have a competing thing but at the same
time like there's a lot of people in
here talking and they're interested in
contributing and I want to make sure
that they they do because I think if
they get something into media guide like
I think they'll feel like that's kind of
accomplishment and that's really we want
all this good material out there yeah
yeah absolutely yeah it's exciting
you're some potential I agree mom and I
think it's going to bring more awareness
to some of the major pain points you
know I'm thinking testing well you know
it's interesting because probably the
craziest issue to go watch right now is
blaze components and I feel like all of
a sudden we're actually talking about
the next version of blaze that's another
thing you getting things folded in and
like progress like more progress than
I've ever seen being made with blaze is
like happening in the guides issue I
don't know that's this really
interesting to me as well so yeah
opening again like probably the single
base problem we're gonna have is the
fact that it feels like so I see tom
coleman in there and I see sashko in
there well my worry is like you know
we're not words we're still not getting
enough mdg people in there and you know
that's good actually be the bottleneck
you know what my worry is my worry is is
if those guys won't open it up more toss
not so much like get more mdg guys in
there but like get some more community
guys in there you know who who's the
owner they should put a team together
github team and like get some community
guys on there on that repo that's what i
want to see instead more mdg i want to
be a community-driven mdg sponsored
project yeah not mdg sponsored and mdg
driven right I agree so I Korea but
sashka huge thumbs up indeed I'm super
excited about it I hope we can carry
this energy forward in a positive way
mm-hmm and I you know I also gotta say
like I haven't looked at cookbooks in a
while and i gotta say props to abigail
and all the people that have contributed
to that as well that's seriously like
meteor pedia and cookbooks uh that was
huge for me early on yeah so thank you
so much in my blog right
and your blog your blog was huge to me
that's why I did a guest post there yeah
it was weird at your post was huge to me
yeah all right uh so slimming down Josh
Sitton is the tree what huh sorry i was
singing my praises of you Josh uh we're
talking about fat models oh yeah
speaking of love for Jensen I've had a
little bit weird lately you know it's
sad when you have a five-gallon keg and
it taps out and you're the only guy
drinking at you like oh that was a lot
of beer I've had oh I'm just kidding we
got up for a party but anyway uh a party
of 14 haha me in myself all right so all
right I wrote an article about fat model
skinny tablets and it was kind of
inspired by Jameis bucks original post
from rails where he was talking about
like the idea of keeping business logic
in with your actual data and keep that
close there and so I think you know
clearly i inspired a few people to think
about this pattern and use it play with
it and um are you trying to take some of
the credit I'm not well at all I what
you know I'll say this is to introduce
this well yeah well I know what is our
next story to it so people worried wrote
this article and it's called slimming
down fat models and I'm like and what's
this and I open it up and I see like you
know he's he's talking about how he's
talking about keeping things like email
sending and that kind of business logic
like was all in those collection helpers
um like what I had talked about but then
he just he decided to like use the event
emitter pattern that's art it already
comes with node right it's already built
in on the server side you don't really
have to do anything else
and instead of firing like all these
different email sends he's using the
event emitter and he could just say like
when X is emitted as an event we need to
do some stuff and so you're able to
break away that email sending into its
own file and you can just pick that up
and so he's showing where like you know
when a when a job gets filled he's
sending to the owner you know congrats
on filling the position and then to the
person that got the job congrats on
landing it and then um that'll fire a
job closed and that'll tell all the
other people like hey sorry you didn't
make it you know and um I don't know I
like this I think it's a lot cleaner and
it's it's really really interesting I
think this is a better way to replace
that the collection hook stuff
personally interesting okay yeah at
first I was skeptical and then I read it
and kind of thought on it and i gotta
say like kudos to Pete I think this is
an awesome pattern I do too I concur
everything you said yeah yeah and a
quick shout out like pizza Pete's blogs
awesome um give him a couple times on
this podcast yeah totally I think I
think he he's got a good head about
security and he's got a good head about
like sustainable like development
patterns mm-hmm and so you know really
like when you read his post like you can
tell that he's good at this stuff and
yeah absolutely so like pizza freelancer
out of San Fran San Diego he's booked so
good luck fitzalan so he's not only
sending lots of money but send him like
a bribe like maybe yeah maybe I don't
know sausage flight I don't know I
didn't have a good lunch I'm starvin
give me some food anyway Mon sausage
get a check out Pete at East Fifth that
Co yes yeah all right what's this thing
next what is this yo meteor development
group ask me anything I'm crater
tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow at 12pm
saturday Saturday said it doesn't work
as well as sunday yeah but this is
awesome how did you close this man wait
honestly I wish I could take credit
right like people who give me credit
left and right on the on the forums or
in the slack chat room like I say this
like it was a post where someone was
asking about the future meteor and like
webpack and that kind of stuff and
another chimed in and I chimed in and we
were talking about like you know how mdg
could do better with the community and
and then Sasha the state sashka Sasha
posted just last week about like how mdg
needs to support the community more and
that I think sparked a lot of stuff like
I i had i think maybe we spark stuff
with the original post and then like
they've been talking about it and you
know someone contacted me and said hey
you know we've been we've been thinking
about this from the original post like
it really got us internally talking
about how we can do better and and so I
think Sasha's post just kind of lit a
fire under them to really just kind of
go out at full bore and that's why you
know Sasha sashko I think got the green
light to really focus on meteor guides
which is awesome and um Nick co
contacted me and said hey like we want
to do an ama we've got four guys that
are willing to do it I think it's gonna
be a little bit of longer ama they might
commit to an hour and a half to two
hours of time maybe jumping in and out
different guys but we get you know
Martin I think that's how you say it
who's doing Cordova stuff he's gonna be
there Yuri's gonna be there he's
obviously doing a lot of stuff sashko
who's done a lot of just really
everything everything
and Nick will also be there so yeah I
would say like bring bring all your
questions with you and ask them you know
the chances of them answering them all
are probably slimmer even with four
people but I think they're they're
wanting to to talk they want to know
what's on everyone's mind they want to
answer your question so yeah and it's
going on during the hackathon yes yeah
another shout-out for Nick Nick co is is
heading that up and he's doing a great
job I got my box my box a swag yeah I
got mine today too nice well I don't
know when I got it I think my front desk
route to email me anyway I went up there
today and it was there you know I was I
was kind of surprised like I've seen the
bottle cap openers and I've got like two
t-shirts Freddie um so that that stuff
was all in there but then they had a
screen cleaning cloths and like glasses
cleaning cloth since oh yeah but it's
white it's it's white but it's got the
meteor logo which is you know it's kind
of neat and cool so it's white it's
gonna turn gray really soon if you
happen to catch this on youtube tonight
the day before the hackathon I will say
you can show up and register on on-site
tomorrow and still participate you
didn't have to pre-register so yeah and
if you if you go to meetup com and find
a local meetup by you if you show up at
that the kickoff meeting on Saturday or
if you got a meetup that's going to be
doing a 24-hour host like Chicago is
then you can show up there and the
person that's heading that up will help
you register and possibly hook you up
with a team right there as well yeah
yeah definitely I think we're gonna
we're gonna kick off with like a little
like people talking about ideas they
brought we only have seven people so
it's not like huge um try like get some
teams formed right there on the spot
should be interesting yeah it's a big
commitment they were asking people whole
weekend in october it's a busy month it
is it is
I told my kids i told my kids would you
know we can't get pumpkins this year
because daddy has a hackathon they all
cried and then I said and also I got a
Space Camp to go to so this is like
daddy's month forget Halloween Halloween
Halloween today all right last story
we're gonna we're gonna breeze this one
quick cuz I got a woman so this is a
great post I got it up here yes maybe uh
at East layman I hope I said that right
sorry if I did um it's just a simple
post but it talks about engine X and how
to use it to do sub domains for multiple
media which i think is a pretty good
thing to learn I think engine X is
actually an underutilized tool in the
meteor space I've been playing a lot
with it I agree crater I agree and
actually I was talking to Michael Shuman
and I've been playing with proved
renderer bio and hosting it myself on
digital ocean and you know I didn't even
realize like you can do you can cash
responses from upstream proxies with
engine X and so like if you hit with the
escape frame is if you hit crater you'll
get a response and then if you hit it
again like from another browser it'll be
like lightning fast and that's we can
sort unions for 30 minutes now so in
genetics is a pretty amazing oh pretty
amazing make it work and someone find
like documentation on how to like like
walk through the stuff to optimize in
hexham meteor so it's all in Russian I
don't know just kidding no I'm generally
just Google about it I've got one post
about using SSL with engine X that
there's this one that kind of shows you
you know how to do the upstream proxies
and that kind of stuff and then i'll
probably be doing a post soon that goes
over CDN and then another post that goes
over like the pre-rendered caching and
that kind of stuff mm-hmm so
that's awesome this is a nice oh man I
love post like this yeah first time I'm
looking at it you know it's direct it's
it's not too long it's got good code
examples it's just posted a long time
ago was it well I just made it onto
crater so yeah where have you been my
whole life it is awesome alright guys
thank you for tuning in this week as
always which sponsored by modulus
modulus 2 I 00 check them there are I
think the best affordable hosting plan
available right now I love my yeah
absolutely they do a good job and their
support is actually really good too so
mm-hmm someone was just talking about
having a problem and it looks like
Giants data centers having issues and
you know modulus responded within I
don't know 10 minutes telling them hey
you know just try spinning up in digital
ocean instead so you know what stood out
to me on that response to they posted
the whole response and whoever responded
to them didn't only answer that question
but they're like oh by the way we
noticed you you upgraded your RAM you
need to restart your instance to for
that to take effect talk about the extra
step like they stepped into his account
and just like ditto you could tell they
did all once over really quick yeah
awesome support if you're wondering
where we read about this support
instance it was on the media club slack
chat and you can find that at the ever
hackable patreon PA tra un calm / your
club i I'm gonna be ditching them really
soon I'm even thinking about doing it
this weekend we'll see um you've given
him plenty of chances on this podcast
like listen to it and like step their
game up yeah yeah and it's so bad like
the hacking and say anyway we'll get it
at some other time who all right all
right see you next week oh yeah see you
