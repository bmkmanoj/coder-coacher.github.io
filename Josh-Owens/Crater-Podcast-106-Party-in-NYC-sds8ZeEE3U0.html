welcome crater fans i'm your host Josh
along with my co-host Bobbi I her man
you know it just occurred to me like we
gotta get you on the on the website I
think it's still like Ben's name and
picture oh yeah the co-host Oh finally
getting rid of Ben kick him to the curb
now we look man I wish he'd come back
like I want him to come on more episodes
of space dojo show we think really
tinkering with the with IOT yeah the
other staying in a completely different
world need indeed yeah I may have him on
the show I mean we may just to get him
back on we'll talk about his his new job
oh cool I think the specials like that
too they probably are sticking me so he
needs to bend again alright so this week
we are talking about building a game
with rethink TV meteor generators meteor
133 and soon 1331 yeah and meteor cam
2016 yeah Oh what it what was gonna be
very exciting yeah I'm very excited like
the last time it's gonna be fun okay
yeah so the first one today is it's just
it's all about honestly I think it's
more about rethink DB than it is about
building the game yeah which left me a
little sad think I wanna their code did
he linked to coat he didn't link to any
code he links to a website dots and
boxes but it was built with meteor and
with rethink DB and he just talked about
uh why r you think DB felt like a good
fit for this I don't know like uh like
I'm trying to look here
yeah I feel like this wouldn't really be
like this particular app probably would
not suffer from live query scaling
problems so yes it's quite a little
Ernie in the post that he's talking
about life's good life live query not
scaling like I look at something like a
real user monitoring or application
performance monitoring like absolutely
those needs some pretty hefty databases
to deal with that kind of right load and
yes my life Korea doesn't deal well with
a heavy Ryland and all honesty um
everything DB does look interesting and
he was able to get it all working um
just kind of running over everything and
building his own queries and returning
some stuff and yeah it it's a decent
read if you're interested in using
rethink TV um I yeah I don't know like
to me I actually think it might be make
more sense to do something like Apollo
or graph ql here yeah trying to lunge
into DDP partially yeah i mean this post
this post is kind of like you know the
use case for everything TBH i don't
really see it here but i might be like
with with meteor all the reactivity that
we get is is you know via MongoDB and
live query right but he's making some
claims that we think to be calling his
can scale better and maybe has less cpu
usage and all that stuff but i don't
know how many products that are out
there at scale using rethinking TP to
manage their whole application yeah once
i get some evidence on that i can see
there's cpu usage then I'll maybe
believes to rethink hype but if you're
making it to do app you're talking about
scale right come on man like you can I
don't know like viewers you're gonna
realize what you're trying to measure
right you need to you need to test and
measure what you actually need to
understand what you're measuring right
now you cannot you cannot compare
contrast live query and reading DB
trivial app that has no complaint no
concurrent connections or even like the
data a data model that it can scale
right like the data structure for these
games I don't know what they are but I
issue is not a mass like several
collections or several tables of data
you know and I don't know how much
rights I don't know how frequently
they're DDP messages are constantly
changing or not only was using DDP in
this case but that whole
publish-subscribe change invalidations
stuff up like what is what are those
characteristics right so it's hard to
it's hard to it's hard to read this post
and say I'm going to start using we
think vb tomorrow and forget live query
like it's yeah that does not make the
case here yeah I would agree like I we
had an interesting talk with um a CEO
Reagan and like to me xk lling a service
is completely different than like just
building a little app right and like
this is a little app and even if you put
in like I'm connecting to another player
like it's still not a hard scaling
problem to deal with um you know we I
worked on words with friends which is a
similar type of system and like we were
able to just add a ton of Ruby servers
to kind of handle the look yeah and it
really wasn't that bad um now granted
there were times where like we were
under the crush of millions of people
like playing after dinner and like that
was tough to deal with but when it comes
to scaling like a lot of times it's just
deciding what makes the most sense and
like if live queries your problem you
move on to something else you know yeah
much like in this particular use case I
don't see live could it be the problem
and you're right like Chet corcos made a
comment that said with MongoDB all the
reactivities handled inside of node
especially when it comes to meteor but
with every QB all the reactivities
handled in the database so it's possible
to think that rethink uses more CPU but
you're not measuring it I'd also just
google that rethink db's reactivity
scales very well I think any generic
solution is going to have perform
mens issues so yeah oh also in the
example here even though usually we
think you're still piping it through a
media publication using the lower level
publish API to add whatever documents
you get from rethink DB so I don't
understand the overall k gain here but
that's only watch out right you you
could theoretically still just use like
it would be weird right because you're
making recoil queries on the server and
then Mongo queries on the client with
mini Mongo yeah I mean in reality like
we were talking about this the other day
for a client project i'm doing like mini
mongos really just a client's on cache
data right no it's just an in-memory
data store that you can use and so it's
similar to things like redox or any
other store that you could find out
there um so I mean I i don't know i
guess i guess you build it one way on
the back end and another way on the
front end yeah Caroline get to the way
the meteor approach it does it does I
think um and so that that's why I would
say like something like Apollo a graph
ql starts to make more sense because you
can write a resolvers on the back end
and then you know you're not really like
you're just you're just getting some
date on the front end doing what you
want with it yeah and the api's a lot
cleaner than having to manage to do it
yes right but anyway that's cool yeah
the next article today is from ben and
i'm just screw up his last name because
he's really hard do good do good like
doing good but good do good yeah and be
good who's apparently a university
student and university of florida and
the he's on medium she's been writing
these several posts which are very well
but very well done which is like
adventures in asynchronous programming
and you know he had one explaining the
event loop he had one talking about
asynchronous functions and then this
post is about es6 generators and before
we get into
the Pope because he goes into the like
how generators work what are the methods
like a little like some examples which
are really cool like I wanted to talk
about like what generators solve right
like when we write functions today in
JavaScript we are assuming that a
function is going to run it and then
it's going to end right and we don't
have any assumptions of like you know
maybe pausing execution of functions
because we don't have to worry about
like we don't really have to worry about
you know multi-threaded problems where
you're running several functions on
several threads and they can conflict or
you pause want and you didn't start it
like all these little management issues
because we're in a single-threaded
environment which is JavaScript but you
still want to have this ability to Oz
execution it's you know you want to be
able to pause the institutions of
something process whenever the hell you
want because that's the kind of power
you want as the developer or if you're
building some kind of complex system you
want those ability to do that so es6
generator is a new type of function yeah
it's denoted with the star and it allows
you to essentially pause and restart and
pause and resume functions or return
values or do anything special that you
want to do and how it works is you
create this function of this you know
pretty yet pretty soon tax you know like
the star syntax and then you put these
things called yield statements and you
can yield values and then he goes into
all of that on yeah how generators
control flow works and he goes into
there's like two three methods that you
really want to pay attention to do
there's the generator next and that what
that does is it it essentially will
cause it'll run this function it'll
pause and then it'll wait for a resume
message and like essentially that next
function is a resume the function type
vehicle and then there's return and
return to simply
returns a value and terminates the whole
function which is pretty useful and the
great thing about this post is he has
code examples because a lot of this
except is pretty hard to understand and
like I guess real-world application the
real world application of generators can
be found if people are interested in
seeing lydic attached to a library but
with it did you guys go look at Redux
saga and it uses generated core
functions to do its action creators you
all the asynchronous action creators and
Rita you can go look at redux saga it's
all build with generators and it builds
upon this exact like you know I'm sorry
this exact you know function yeah so
great job Ben duded I was a really he
really did get out of that one yeah and
uh Benson the space so just like channel
two so it is is and his company or that
his company but his projects I think are
a lot like he's really diving into like
the redox the functional programming I
think that's what inspired these you
know lineup posts here yeah I'm really
appreciate some tools dinner generator
functions in general or hard to
understand because you never really had
the opportunity to use them before you
know until recently and even then you
don't really understand where it fits in
and you could probably go your whole
life without writing a generator
function and you'll be fine because I
don't think there's that many use cases
that you really need to use a generator
um yeah there's definitely use cases
right like it so ruby has similar
concepts in it and like I'm glad to see
this and have this type of function back
in the arsenal so I mean I mean you're
absolutely right like I haven't had a
chance to really find a huge case where
I could use one but yeah the best way to
learn them is just to start using them
and luckily because I do a lot of redox
work I got to get familiar with it but
you guys if you're wanting to use
generator functions like try looking at
a library that's using it for its
implementation so you can kind of
understand how it works in context
because as great great as Benton's
examples are they're not really useful
context for you to say like oh yeah this
is a cool function let me go like e to
my big ol app and like put it back yeah
it's really hard but I took great place
to start yep cool right so meteor 133
came out this week I don't know how to
feel of this one 133 are you on 133 m no
I am on 1324 okay I refuse to refuse to
upgrade for a bit just just to be sure
I'm not trying to get bad again yeah
finally finally got through all that 1.3
PS and our app is now running on 1.3
nice in production what in production
it's going to be we're gonna launch it
in production on Tuesday so we're just
testing it making sure everything's cool
the funny thing is people I like when I
announced that we finally merged I told
people like all right like you're not in
the matrix anymore yeah get up I can see
the world now and a lot of people who
JavaScript wasn't their first language
coming into our company they assumed
that like the meteor way of old meteor
with doing things was actually like how
you do things you know so now that now
we have people actually having to learn
how NPM works and stuff like that so
these are back end developers they don't
believe they didn't really know all this
stuff going in so it's going to be
another learning process / for us to
teach and do all that anyway yes so I
think there's a few interesting things
in here like phantom j/s is no longer
shipping by default as a like part of
the bundle
um there's some changes to like how
Babel is being run how they've added
some new stuff to import statements so
like number one I would highly suggest
people go and check out the change log
for this and this is this is going to be
the last release unless there's some
kind of security vulnerability this will
be the last release that uses node 0
about 10 yep so the next release will
see is one for which is gonna be started
testing as release candidate soon or at
least as a beta soon yeah which I'm
super excited about like this this is to
me this feels like a filler release um
there's some stuff in here like they've
got more like DDP callbacks are now
batched on the client so that's maybe
kind of interest um there's there's
another thing in here I should really
read one this the meteor dot apply now
takes a no retrial option to opt out of
automatically retrying non I dividend
methods on connection book and so if you
don't know about this like if a method
hasn't returned and you run it and you
didn't get that return value but your
connection like disconnects and
reconnects to the DDP server you're
gonna actually rearick West that method
run and not one has bit me in the butt a
few times I actually know the reason I
knew about is because i had a
long-running method like my very first
experience with meteor I had a
long-running method that would say like
go stream this movie and like you know
movies like two hours and so fired I you
know I request the appletv to start
streaming a movie and like it would just
if it died in the middle like when I
started back up when the app started
back up or something then it would
refire that call and start streaming
movie again yeah so that was like by way
of finding out that this would happen
and you can do if you do like this town
I'm block and return right away you can
still run code that's fine
but it'll you know happen in the
background and not retry later but this
is good that it looks like there's a way
to tell them not to retry yeah that's
really helpful on mobile we want a
couple methods on the native our native
apps that on my startup methods but if
you like disconnect which happens
frequently like yeah you when you
reconnect that those methods fire so
we've had we've had to do we've hit some
cpu like CPU intensive like times where
all the mobile apps were just like fire
in and sometimes they're even double
calling the method on on a restart so
you get like two methods firing there's
a bunch of bugs and your CPU when when
methods go long like that you're just
like you know you just gonna shoot
yourself in the foot and your users are
gonna hate you yeah you know another one
that I found really really interesting
is the Mongol collections you can now
specify like define mutation methods did
you this at all I just pulled it up well
better to talk so this is interesting
because it looks like it allows you so
if people don't know this like meteors
client side inserts right like that the
stuff you do allow deny for like it
those are just methods and it's so
they're just defined on the server when
you define a collection those are
defined and when you make that call you
under the hood you're really just making
a method call and this now allows you to
um define your own it looks like if i'm
reading this right uh which is a little
puzzling right like you read the guide
and you're like hmm allowed and I is
kind of not recommended for obvious
reasons that we
over on the show before and yeah like
wow why are we are we doing this why are
we continuing down this path I don't
know this is I don't know I think like
for the for this new release like this
one I think what excites me the most is
the Babel compiler changes so you can
actually put your own babu are some
configurations you know yeah in the
Babel RC file so that's going to be
really cool if you want to start writing
es7 or 2016-2017 or whatever but
whatever number it is now I'm modern
JavaScript once already modern
JavaScript you can start doing that
which is super cool now thank you sir
using the decorator functions and all
that stuff you know even the invaders an
async await so the kind of like opens
the door there um so that's cool yeah
yeah I'm excited I mean again I haven't
used it but I uh I think I think it'll
be good but my hope is one for follows
pretty quickly behind it yeah you know
like I think they wanted to just get a
lot of this stuff into the code base so
people could upgrade it incrementally
make sure everything works nothing
breaks and this release and then when
you make the leap to 1.4 like obviously
I think that's gonna be that's gonna be
much bigger for a lot of people in New
having node 4 is gonna be I think it's
gonna take some testing and some poking
and prodding like testing your app will
see ya also another cool thing from 1.33
is you can you can do is server is
client wraps around import statements
hmm hey and do that yeah and that's
actually really cool cuz now you can
like wait structure your entry points a
lot cleaner now yeah so the only thing
that was kind of weird though was that
an import like some of the changes they
made to import statements only apply to
the application modules they don't apply
like you can't use some of the new
imported stuff in packages so
oh yeah like take some time to look over
that and what not yeah take some time to
plan out your app going forward if
you're using packages is uh you know the
way you migrate your code to imports or
whatever we are going to do it's going
to be a little tricky you know so yeah
yeah no no no it's not tricky just
canara so NYC yeah all right so there's
thing called meteor camp that's on july
8th to 11th and it's at the United
Nations in New York City or they called
open camps and there's going to be a
bunch of open camps in the month of July
and um Adrian right planning yeah Adrian
landing or a planning on on meteor or
get up or whatever now hey Jane landing
he's the organizer for the meteor open
camp which is our meteor camp in New
York City so and if you guys don't know
it's going to be hopefully it's going to
be a good big event they're gonna have a
bunch of meteor speakers including josh
and myself and the the front-runner the
person who's keynoting the whole thing
is our nota and they actually this is
actually a non non profit conference or
camp or whatever and they're using the
donations and all that they've gotten to
actually get are noted to come to the
United States so that's actually pretty
cool and the other speakers like I think
Abigail Watson is speaking some people
from classmates taio which is another
meteor app so it's gonna be oh and
thomas gold i think his name Thomas
Thomas or whatever his name is he block
us about reacted meteor he's gonna be
there so it's going to be a cool cool
little meteor conference you know we
haven't had an official one yet we've
had the
on conferences we've had meteor or the
meteor club camp right Space Camp so
those are the meteor advanta set up
happening the community believe haven't
had anything quite like this where
people are going to be coming from all
over the world or the states to come
talk about meteor and yeah actually my
like my talks are definitely not going
to be about meteor like per se but it's
like I'm gonna be about like you're
using meteor how to like do some stuff
and I I don't think that people should
come I think you would still learn
something if you come to this event and
you're not necessarily using media here
in production but you're just using it
for con or something you're still gonna
learn a lot about just general jobs for
ya our nota is definitely gonna trick
you know do some do some cool little
demos I'm sure so yeah well I think his
talks on like what meteors gonna look
like in 2018 I think he said good that's
that's quite the the date target to pick
I think even picking 27 teams gonna be
hard to predict um yeah I don't know
like I still haven't decided what I'm
gonna talk on I'm kind of torn like I
could do something on Cordova and
building mobile apps or I could do
something on take a meteor after
production like some of the things you
got to help were there or my other
thought is like why you should be
looking outside of meteor and looking at
other technologies and why like being a
one one trick pony isn't good for your
career yeah I don't know I did um might
be might be kind of like not in the
right head crowd for that kind of
conversation may have you ever know you
never know like a bunch of meteor fan
boys and girls they're like super like
diehard about like you know cuz I'm
gonna say DBP and pub/sub sucks I don't
want someone to come in like shoot me or
something in LA don't any of that stuff
to happen but I think it would be a
great event in there actually accepting
donations but so whether you can go or
you can't go are those donations help
you know get all the or
sorry get all the speakers to the place
and helps kind of sponsor the event
they're going to give out lunch and
stuff so essentially if you really care
about this whole open source and the
tech community of meteor we could
contribute in you know Clyde's like 20
bucks for something like that do you
have the money and do that and we cool
it'll help Adrian out and help with all
the speakers out too because we're going
to be taking time out of our days and
come in and doing all this stuff stuff I
thing about my plane ticket so I'm
screwed but it's gonna be fun I make a
little trip out of it yeah I'm uh we're
gonna we're gonna drive in we uh we got
a new car a couple months ago just for
like we don't have a trailer yet but for
hauling a trailer for taking long road
trips with the family and so we're gonna
we're gonna load that thing up and we're
gonna drive in tuesday i think the fifth
and we're gonna say like Wednesday
Thursday Friday Saturday I guess we'll
leave sunday to come back home because
the kids hosted one day but we're gonna
make a little family trip out of it so
should be cool yeah fun and exciting
like my kids have never been to New York
City so it's gonna be a new life
experience for them uh-uh I haven't even
been to New York City so really nice I'm
a California guy man I don't leave why
would I leave this fun out here man look
at that blue sky life hopefully it's on
a colder super hot there and today's
actually been pretty nice here it's like
85 out high of 85 that's pretty good
yeah yeah but yeah so please everyone if
you're interested it come any major camp
and YC yes all those things will be the
shut up so you guys can do it Oh most
definitely uh yeah and so I guess I
guess that's it but thank you for
listening we'll be back next week I
think maybe we'll do a show I'll bring
my
Road audio gear and maybe we do a show
maybe to see it's an excuse to get a
nice mic for that thing huh yeah uh we
could even continue doing the video that
could be nice uh with like you me and
Aaron Oda or something or yeah okay fun
you know what we could do and here's a
really interesting idea is like I know
Kent Kent can't see dots when he went to
angular clock for his JavaScript air
podcast he would like do like two minute
Q&amp;amp;A with the person that just came off
right just talked or you know who's a
speaker for the day they were just do
two min the q and A's so maybe what we
could do is we could cover the whole
weekend or the days that we're there and
we just do like talk to the actual
people that are presenting and that
could be a lot of good content for our
shed yeah yeah definitely yeah so I've
got I've got a nice nice gear it's like
a zoom h6 and some heads up mics and I
got three of them and we can plug it
into the zoom so me and another person
like we could just have like a quick two
to five minute conversation like you're
saying yeah well this one yeah all right
cool do it do it do it live awesome
alright guys thanks for tuning in as
always check out modulus dot IO and
digital ocean calm if you're looking for
hosting they are at the best yeah and if
you if you disagree with anything we
said on the show hit up those YouTube
comments because I'm gonna reply to them
hey cylinder fires yeah yeah yeah you've
been someone was asking about well that
was space dojo show but they were asking
about like redox and stuff so yeah you
guys are having a conversation so that's
pretty awesome and as always patreon
Preon con such media club and you can
for 10 bucks a month you can join for
any amount you can support the show and
then for 10 bucks a month you can join
the slack channel
all and get access to some of the
smartest dang people I know yep next
time see ya this video has been in space
