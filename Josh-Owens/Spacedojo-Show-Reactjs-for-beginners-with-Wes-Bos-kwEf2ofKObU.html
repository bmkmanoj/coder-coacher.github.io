host Josh Owens along with my co-host
band Strahan
hello joshie Pugh how you doing
sweetheart good luck or not yeah and
we've got we've got a second co-host
Ramsey Ramsey
Lanie er right yes Ray's not even here
it's it's a ram Slayer
Rams lair I totally put my that's my D&amp;amp;D
characters name and the special guest
this week is Wes welcome Wes thank you
thank you hello everyone you know
I've debated how do you say your last
name is it just boasts nope mas yeah
it's fast like SS it's about a 50-50
shot most people say I guess half him
say both it's so the thing is I always
get names wrong and so I just assumed
when I saw your name I thought it was
boss and I thought that's that's
probably all right wrong again so yeah
with you where are you from what do you
do
I I'm a senior developer at a creative
digital agency in DC so I do mostly
front-end development and increasingly
more back-end stuff as well hmm
yeah companies called include n CL UD
what about us
uh so I'm up here in Canada I live in a
city called Hamilton outside of Toronto
and I do a whole bunch of stuff but you
can probably break it down into I help
companies build stuff with front-end
technologies I'm pretty much a
full-stack JavaScript guy and then I
also teach people to build stuff with
JavaScript and CSS and HTML so I do
teaching at a bootcamp and a part time
class here in Toronto called hacker you
and then I also
I have a couple products myself yeah
nice so you you have react for beginners
that's actually how I heard have heard
about you yeah yeah I launched that one
a couple months ago and it's it's been
doing really well
nice yeah that's awesome yeah so I just
I thought it'd be fun to get together
and focus on react and I know that you
know this this used to be the meteor
Club podcast and the last time we talked
about it we kind of had a meteor focus
and maybe this time we don't have meteor
focus and we just kind of talked about
the ecosystem and you know how how
people can get started and you know just
generally kind of debating the finer
points of react as well yeah absolutely
let's do it man sounds great let's go so
what what's reacting good yeah can I can
i Euler with it wow this is gonna turn
into the hot dog debate all over again
Wow yeah totally so uh Wes um some
people might know you from your YouTube
channel and I remember back in the day
first hearing about you with your a
flexbox video ISS what what were you
primarily like a front-end guy at first
um I guess like in my entire history of
web development or I I was I've always
been doing front-end development I've
been doing it for over 10 years now and
I've done quite a bit of in there my
early days it quite a bit of PHP and
WordPress and cakephp and CodeIgniter
and all that but about five years ago I
kind of took a look at the landscape and
saw JavaScript and I'm like this is it
started to become more popular and I
started seeing it being deployed to like
what node was like I remember don't lean
the first version of node ever so I was
like I really need to just double down
on on JavaScript and in front-end
technology so that's been my my focus
for last couple years
very cool very cool yeah I was I was
curious um I'm assuming that everyone
kind of knows what react is here so I
won't dive into that stuff but one thing
that was curious about is from the
designer perspective and Ramsey like
you're you're down for this too because
you've got a similar history as Wes
right man yeah yeah yes very cool um
what do you got what do you two guys see
as adoption for react with designers and
front-end developers you know yeah I
I've seen pretty good adoption here at
work
we don't use react and anything in
production just yet but we do been doing
a lot of side projects and we have
anything from UX to visual designers
information architects they all have
basic fundamental knowledge of HTML CSS
and so I you know there's probably like
a small learning curve when they when
they saw JSX for the first time but it's
it's pretty similar to HTML and then as
you know I'm a I'm a big component of
using CSS modules so like it's not
really that it's not really that
different you know from from regular
regular web development except for
obviously like the the logic and stuff
that goes into to react look um a design
standpoint I haven't really it hasn't
been a challenge anything really I don't
know I've been seeing a little bit of a
hesitancy from designers well you know
it's interesting you bring that up
because I think I saw gosh I wish I
could remember where I saw this now but
there was like an analysis of like
angular versus react and the fact that
angular is more HTML centric and they
layer in some JavaScript versus react is
JavaScript centric and they layer in
that HTML and you know I find that very
interesting but I'm still of the mindset
that like you know I I don't know I want
to I want to meet this mythical designer
that has a problem with JSX like I keep
hearing like
people are hesitant are worried about it
but I don't think it's a real issue like
yeah well I think what I see that the
barrier to entry is is the the tooling
in actually writing quite a bit of
JavaScript in in and what I've seen in
terms of designers picking up react is
they're not like they're not gonna start
slinging webpack in building their own
like module set up and writing all the
code but where they can do is they can
just jump in once you give them an
object or an array full of data and they
can understand that you can loop over
things you get this data you can create
your HTML but with that I think with
angular it's it's much more it's much
easier because they're more comfortable
in their HTML file and in JSX doesn't
have ng-repeat or any anything to do
logic so you do kind of have to brush up
on your own working with arrays but I've
seen it yeah I would agree I think the
are the most confusing thing would be
the you know lack of if-else and while
loops having to use either calling
functions inside the component or using
ternary operators and so in once you've
seen the ternary operator and you're
like pretty comfortable with both sides
of the of the equation it's pretty
easily repeatable so maybe like a crash
course today of like this is basically
how the logic is kind of working you
know in this component I mean I've
definitely written some pretty gnarly
components that have a lot of logical
sign and I can see I can see how they
might be confusing but as I've been
using reacting more and more you want to
make smaller components and make it much
more manageable I think very cool
so like Wes outside of your react for
beginners you do some in-person training
right yeah and is that like training for
people who are like brand-new to web
development
yeah that's most of the people who take
my courses
are are people who are within the first
year of being introduced to web
development so I get to see a lot of the
the pain points and I think that's the
reason why a lot of my video series are
doing so well is because I pretty much
just write down things that people say
that are hard and explain those to be to
be pretty simple for them now in those
classes are you guys teaching react um
not in that one
we don't have a react workshop just yet
but it's it's more focused around like
we have a JavaScript course that I lead
is well it's more focused around
fundamentals and understanding like
what's the Dom and what our events and
regardless of what you're using you need
to understand that that's how javascript
in the browser interact yeah yeah do you
think that like once they get past your
class with JavaScript and obviously they
would know like HTML and CSS do you
think like react is something that like
people would wit would gravitate towards
next that's probably like a common
stepping stone yeah I think it's I think
once you're comfortable with the event
system once you're comfortable with
manipulating and massaging data it's one
of the the next steps it's a bit of a
harder step I think then than picking up
something like angular but it's
definitely that's why I created the
series because if you you just need to
know a couple more things to be able to
get up and running and then once you
have it it it starts to work and then I
also see that it's making people a
better JavaScript developers this is
really pushing people to learn better
JavaScript because like you I see a lot
of people who were worse I don't mean to
pick on angular still really liked it
but you see a lot of people who have
been building angular apps for a couple
years and they don't their JavaScript
skills haven't really gone that far
because there's a lot baked into lob
baked into that framework right and then
as soon as if people are picking up
react is it just forces you to just
write JavaScript at the end of the day
yeah that's that's a great point I mean
my leg es2015 skills have like really
really increased the past you know six
months or so as I've gotten more than
willing to react maybe it's like well
maybe it's a combination probably
combination use webpack and all that
stuff but I mean the main driving force
was I wanted to use react so that's like
I just want to say that's really great
point yeah oh thank you yeah I think if
you put yourself and that comes back to
like the designer beginner or whatever
you're talking about is if you put
yourself in a situation where you you're
pushed it's it's amazing how quickly you
can get up to speed and then push
yourself a little bit more and more and
before you know it in a year or two
you're you're in a really good spot with
your JavaScript skills now when do you
find that when when you're pushing
yourself to learn react there's a
tendency to like over push yourself and
like all some people feel like they have
to learn Redux
you know they have to learn flux all
that all that fun yeah relay or web pack
like there's all the stuff that that
comes in on top of it yeah there's
there's a lot of like decision anxiety
around react because it's react is very
it's very small and what it does and
then if you want to do anything else
like go fetch data or I do like one-way
data-binding and all this stuff you you
need to pull in all these different
things and it's it's pretty overwhelming
to to look at all these possible things
and and nobody tells you just use this
just use the following five things so
yeah I definitely think that that's
there and that's one of the reason why I
didn't put any any flux or anything into
my series just because like you don't
need to know that off the head you you
just need to know how a reactor works
and it really just grok the
understanding of the ideas behind react
now I'm I'm in your slack group because
I like purchased your course and I gotta
say though quickly getting in there
that's the first thing that's like
requested of you here is what is like
redux
I'm where I've been working on the
series right now because everyone
finishes it and they go okay that was
awesome I understand it now what's next
right because they're hungry for more
and they're they're willing to push
themself into it and also like once you
build an app or two in just regular
react you you start to start you start
to feel the the pain points and where
redox Ursulines comes along and solves
that also we don't some I guess it must
it might be nicer from someone who's
just starting off web development is it
used to non functional programming but
me dioxin itself if you don't understand
functional programming is like really
hard to kind of wrap your head around at
first and so I mean that's really I can
I can definitely see why that's like
number one on people's list after like
just basic yeah yeah yeah it's it's kind
of interesting because if you look at
Redux itself it's less than a year old
right and even a year old yeah yeah so
the idea for like flux came out I think
during react on flash it was which was
like January of last year and you know
it's it's it's still new to a lot of
people like even the people that have
created it are still kind of reworking
it and rethinking ideas in it you know
like you see sagas coming out now and
that kind of stuff and I mean there's a
lot of ideas changing there and I love
seeing like Facebook hire Dan Abramov
again I mean it Redux so I think that's
that's a good signal probably for the
community that it's gonna be the I mean
it pretty much is the one at this point
but you know I I find the whole thing
kind of interesting to watch like
sitting over in the meteor community and
listening to JavaScript fatigue it's
like well we maybe don't have all these
problems exactly we have different ones
but yeah yeah it's interesting
it's I think that that problem is always
going to exist when you're when you're
working with stuff that's so new mm-hmm
but it's also I mean it's it's I love it
because it's like it's almost a
high-risk high-reward but it's like you
put in a lot of effort
learning stuff and it does change but
like when he gets working you realize
like how powerful it is you're like you
like it while back I do like maybe my
WordPress development sometimes during
the day and like even simple things like
I'll find myself using like Const and
let like but I'm not using I can't I
have to use bar like just a little silly
things like that which are like really
miniscule but then you know trying them
actually I realize how awesome it is
yeah now that brings up another point
though so so react isn't is uh gosh such
a pun but react isn't in a flux state
where it's constantly changing and stuff
like that uh everyone hurt here's this
one too anyway uh Wes have you found
that to be kind of like a headache with
like having a larger course and like
having to keep it up-to-date yeah I'd
say it's changing fairly frequently and
all the modules are like I was just
about to record my next one and then
there's a huge braking change in
reactive rotor redux so I have to like
put that on ice until that gets sorted
out but like people are just they're
really just figuring it out right now so
if people we just stuck on what we knew
three years ago or two years ago and
said like this is the way then we
wouldn't be as well off so it's it's
definitely frustrating but it's just the
it's it's part of it it's it's been
selling really well because it's it's
react but as things start to change and
as the next couple of versions react
come out I'm gonna have to continue to
be updating it yeah like I remember
watching it and you know I think in Oh
14 they kind of had at the notion of
higher order components yeah and like
you don't I don't do you touch on that
at all during your class no not in this
costume
yeah they had just just come out like
like a week after and and also like then
I I'm I'm pretty aggressive in in
pushing back on on too much in in my
courses and in my teaching and things
like that because before you know it you
can start
throwing high order components and flux
in in-state and all these different
things at people and then they start to
freak out so I think one of the reasons
people really like it is because I can I
can hold back on some things that you
can you can easily pick up once you
understand them or react yeah yeah I
would agree I mean you know it's not
like it's I don't think it's I mean to
bring up JavaScript fatigue again I
guess I mean all of the JavaScript
landscape keeps changing at a pace that
is definitely frustrating for a teacher
who's creating products that are almost
static once they've been released you
know I gave master a meteor course the
last time I gave it they had just come
out with template level subscriptions
and people were switching to flow router
and like I I haven't redone a class
since then and you know that class is
out of date people like when are you
gonna change are you gonna switch to
react like they always want something
new or like up up-to-the-minute
up-to-date yeah yeah it's definitely
frustrating but at the same time it's
it's why I'm able to like break into
this like I've been I've been doing
videos for three or four years now but
there would already be videos on
everything and I wouldn't be able to do
that if it just stayed that way right
yeah that's true
so like JavaScript fatigue introduces
business opportunities you said yeah so
tked business opportunity I guess and in
for like people coming into web
development it allows them to like just
jump in in and start running with es6
and react and all that stuff and you
don't have to like like learn backbone
and things like that right so like it
also gives people an opportunity like
other people in the chatroom who are
like pretty good at react I've only been
in front of des for like a year or two
but it's allowed them to just gonna take
the newest thing and run with it
yeah so uh do you do you have like a
boilerplate for them that they like just
like a republic clone not really uh so
it starts with a file called mange s and
there's nothing in there
and then I give them if browserify
engulf scripts and they've gulp and then
we we could the entire thing from there
so there's there's not much cooler play
other than that the tooling which is not
not a focus of the course at all do do
people like are people curious so they
ever like what is this stuff do that is
that going on behind the scenes yeah I
talk I talk a little bit about like what
it's doing and I I talk a lot about
modules and how we import them and
export them because that is new to most
people who are coming from jQuery where
they just stick all their script tags in
there it's not new to people who've been
doing node because it's we've had that
for years but they're pretty curious and
I think at one point all I'll probably
do a tooling course but I'm not not
satisfied with how hard tooling is right
now and I think it's yeah it's it's a
nightmare I know I'm like I'm like
working on trying to get real a to work
with like server-side rendering
with web packets yeah yeah I once coded
like a an app just to get server-side
rendering and hot reloading and all
these things working and like I think I
had like 400 lines of code or something
like there's bigger than my app that to
actually get up and running and I think
that will change so I think people
hopefully react will endorse a certain
tooling chain it will just just work and
you just type what pack or whatever it
is to get up and running that brings up
an interesting thing like there is a lot
of pain to get started in the past we
talked about everything changing and
react or not everything but it's
changing as time goes on it's not a one
point
is it like a wise business decision for
like larger companies to like integrate
this should people like wait to learn
react until like the dust settles a
little bit or do you say like now jump
in now like that's a tough question I
mean it really obviously the back is
gonna say yes because he has this I
can't I mean I can honestly see how it
doesn't make sense for for a lot of
companies because especially if you you
either have to train your current
developers who don't know it or you have
to hire new developers that's expensive
at the same time like components offer
like yeah so Google a prety management
right so you really have to like if you
have a large development team and you've
decided to do it like you're doing a
cost-benefit analysis at that point
you're like well how much are we
currently spending time wise you know on
maintaining our application and how much
is react early going to to save us and
then that becomes a problem if you don't
know like if you don't know like it's no
one there knows really how to use react
we just hear about it like didn't like
do investigation you may be a fire
consultant that gets crazy
yeah I think that's that's with with any
technology you pick up if I were looking
at building an application now I would
probably start building it in react and
the reason why is like if you look at it
four years down the road you don't want
to be regretting that you built it on
some some older updated technology and
with the with with the sort of the
uptake that react has had in the last
six months or so I would say people the
industry is definitely going that way
yeah from from a durability standpoint
whatever that's right word but I
definitely don't think react is going to
be going anywhere
in the next couple of years I'd be very
surprised well yeah I mean it's at the
core of one of the largest technology
businesses in the world right and I
think that kind of means that
it's gonna stick around for a long time
like rails is not even pointed of one of
the largest tech businesses but it's
still around because they were there
kind of backing it with their own money
yeah I mean I've heard you know the
Facebook argument is is good but I mean
you know what happens polymer or
something like that didn't really catch
on did it it you know it it hasn't I
think I've messed around with it but a
different talk but I still much prefer I
still think that's slightly different
you know then like angular certainly did
catch on so that to me it feels like a
closer and now I guess kind of yeah I
guess I'm curious to hear what you guys
think about projects starting up you
guys touched on it like hey like like
definitely like adapt react right now if
you're starting a new project because
it's it's it's where we're you it's what
you want to do if your spend a project
now because in a year it's like gonna be
even more stable and everyone's going to
be there but I'm interested what you
guys think about like smaller projects
or weekend projects you know does react
make sense for for all apps oh yeah go
ahead
oh I don't say I mean obviously it
doesn't make sense for all apps but I
mean if you can get it to the point
where like I mean I have like a pretty
decent-sized component library that I've
built myself not like it you know I
haven't packaged a matter you know I can
pretty much copy and paste or plug them
in here and there and like get a lot of
functionality like I've got like a
registration form or like a login form
component and like I just need to like
copy a few things over from the projects
into a new one and it works like so if
you have that already then yeah it's
like it's really fast you know if you
have to start from scratch then I feel
like I'd hackathon and you have like six
hours or whatever we're going 24 hours
maybe it doesn't but
yeah I think that when you're excited
about building something it doesn't
matter what you're building it in
because you can always go back and
rewrite it just make it work and get
your idea actually working so if it's a
weekend project or whatever just you if
if jQuery is what you feel most
comfortable in and you can sling it in
that let go for it and you can come back
and the same thing goes with existing
websites if you haven't a huge existing
website which is a lot of a lot of apps
and a lot of products where it's it's
built on like something like back-end
HTML that it gets generated and then you
sprinkle some jQuery on top you can
start just like kind of doing replacing
just those small little components all
throughout the website and slowly change
the entire thing over I mean that's
pretty much exactly what Facebook did
right yeah I was wondering the other day
like at what point will Facebook not be
rendered by PHP or PHP is just their
REST API or really API or whatever
interesting point yeah like with the
component is there something like I
really do enjoy atmosphere and being
able to go find a package and pull it in
and knowing that it can be like
front-end and back-end is there anything
outside of NPM that like will help you
kind of comb through the components that
are available I guess in the NPM
ecosystem but it gives you some kind of
quality metric or anything like that
yeah there's there's react - components
comm which is it's pretty good but I
definitely think that that's the kind of
the place that I'll go to if I need a
component for something or I'll just
just ask around it was like one called
react dot parts as well and react out
parts will give you number of github
stars
hmm okay why not so like you can kind of
get an idea for that but still you still
need something that will clearly show
that this is what you should use
and that I get that's kind of the weird
thing about react is that you can use
anything you want and some people don't
like that they just want to be told
X Y &amp;amp; Z right well I think you know
there's there's some amount of I don't
know this is a really interesting topic
to me I actually a long time ago
registered a domain called like plug in
hub I think it was and like the idea was
to go in and look at package ecosystems
and kind of give metrics on them and you
know that that stuff I think matters to
some degree because as a developer you
don't want to pull in something that's
abandoned or not being maintained and
like that's not always super obvious you
know if you go into an ecosystem and
like in rails they've switched standards
on what the authentication system is
several times and you know you may
stumble across a ton of blog articles on
you know the original kind of
authentication system everyone used and
like it's it's just it's out-of-date
it's not maintained it might not even
work so with the latest rails version so
you know III think that stuff's kind of
important and if something's popular
that's another signal that maybe it's
it's decently maintained or easy to work
with so I don't know I I like I like
being able to see those stats before I
make a choice I guess yeah yeah and
that's that's with anything from from
WordPress plugins to react ones and
generally what I'll do is I'll just go
to NPM and check out make sure that
they're getting a decent amount of
downloads every day and then I'll also
go to the issue tracker and just see is
it a mess is there tons of issues or
like how's it going
you can also um there's a what's it
called there's a discord which is the
react community got kicked off slack
because they were too big so there's
this chatroom call on discord for
reacting almost big plugins will have
their own chatroom you up in there and
see if there's 20 people in it or
something like at least 20 people care
enough to log
an idol in that room awesome
yep all right I interrupted Ben what was
your question Ben I was actually gonna
give Ramsey some some slack for his
noisy microphone he's muted now so yes
I'm not nice this is good stuff on the
component side you guys think like
there's gonna be an industry a
commercial industry formed around
components for react in the future if
you like entice people to like get in
more like if you think about it if
industry like Hummels around
I really think part of WordPress a
success was like it's professional
themes and everything and people go
there and be like wow this looks so sexy
you know
yeah it's obviously good because it's so
sexy and they just go for it yeah I
probably uh like we saw it in jQuery
there's like weed mo and big corporate
companies and then there's also like
people on code Canyon slinging $15
jQuery plug-in so hmm I wouldn't be
wouldn't be super surprised but I
generally think that the the best stuff
is usually open-source and maintained by
the community and in hopefully what we
see from that is that the authors of
those plugins give hate and consulting
looks whatever whatever like working at
Facebook or whatever it is
yeah I agree I mean I at all I would not
at all be surprised that there become
some marketplace for components but I am
100% behind open-source stuff and I know
like anything that I make you know
whatever is always gonna be a good
source yeah and I think another really
nice model that I see quite a bit in the
WordPress community is that like you get
like the base package which will take
care of 95% of the people and then you
can like buy an upgrade or something
like that for and I I'm almost more
always more than happy to pay whatever
it is that the author is looking for
because that 100 bucks 50 bucks whatever
I do to pay for that would be it seems
kind of weird and it's it's kind of a
touchy subject in the open-source but I
also just love to support authors who
who put in their time yeah yeah that's a
great point because we had Mike param on
and so he's from the rails community and
we talked about this very topic before
and you know he's experimented a lot
with charging for open source work but
he he followed that same model that
you're you were talking about where you
know he puts out sidekick and you can
download it and use it and it works fine
for anyone but then he's got sidekick
Pro which is a yearly license and you
get access to like higher-end features
that I mean you can absolutely go coat
it yourself but at the same time like
it's really just a dollar comparison
right like what's your time worth and
how much you're going to spend writing
that versus you know what it would was
the benefit you're gonna get here so
yeah exactly
great point yeah do you think we touched
on WordPress for a second do you think
if they had WordPress of that adoption
of NPM and everything is going to be
like driving this drive and react more I
think so it was it was big for me
because my sort of audiences are like
JavaScript in the other audiences like
WordPress and they're fairly siloed in
when Matt Mullenweg came out and I sure
favor knows this but he at the state of
word
the big talk he gives every year he's
basically they announced that they
rebuilt the entire WordPress comm
dashboard in react and then he said your
homework for this year is to learn react
and I cried tears of joy
cuz I was like those are my two
audiences coming together and it really
kind of gave the WordPress community a
bit of a kick in the pants that's saying
like you actually need to start start
learning the stuff and start thinking of
WordPress as your your data source and
not necessarily your planning engine
yeah so this is a great segue for me to
do a shameless plug for my project curse
like that's exactly what I'm doing but
on the front end side of WordPress
development with because I use word
president almost every day at work and
yeah so I really wanted to be able to
use react and like CSS modules and stuff
with WordPress to make maintain websites
easier and then graph QL came out you
know with relay and so like my project
basically uses graphs - unrelated to get
data from a WordPress database and like
usually at components
oh so it's cool like there's definitely
some like challenging issues like I got
mentioned earlier server-side rendering
rendering is difficult
SEO is like a huge huge deal with
WordPress but yeah it's been really it's
been fun so how does that work then I
don't I mean I don't mean to take over
the show but I'm really interested in so
how do you get graph QL and WordPress
and all that talking so I'm using
something called sequel eyes which you
basically give us some connection
settings and it it gives you it
basically reads your WordPress or any
any sequel database right to the
database
yeah it basically will read your tables
and you can create relationships between
the tables and then it gives you queries
that return promises and so in graph QL
when you when you're writing your graph
QL schema and your resolve function if
you're familiar at all with craft you
out and the resolve function you're just
writing
like this sequel eyes query ever terms a
promise and then you're using relay to
like pipe that through to your react
components so it's actually I'll it an
NPM module that actually all you have to
do is give it your WordPress connection
settings so basically exactly what you
would put in your your WP config file
and it like returns a pretty standard
graph QL schema ah you can do like so
you don't you know like if you don't
want to have to write all that like it
basically just gives you like you import
to you import like a I think I called
like word Express graph QL schema and
then you basically just use that with
you know relay router or whatever you
want okay I think I did see this so then
what's what's the point of if you need
WordPress at all then is it because in
an interface yeah that's exactly I mean
I basically based on like any look like
the node based CMS's that are out there
and WordPress is vast ecosystem it just
I don't know it makes sense I love the
WordPress admin and now that they have
Calypso it looks like even Calypso's
they're they're known based yeah thing
let's both and react and all that stuff
yeah it's cool yeah that's why that's
like my whole driving force was it
worked behind like the Venus Project was
because I I wanted to use react and CSS
modules and so I was like and Misha Lee
I thought about using the WordPress API
but of course because I was using react
I was like whoa I should learn this new
graph QL thing and so that goes back to
like Ben's question about like when you
start using reactor you go down this
rabbit hole of learning all these these
newer knows I play with it and I guess
in my case the answer is yes it's a slow
thing though right yeah I mean or you
could be force-fed yes like dive into it
for a whole week you're in a cave for a
whole week you don't shave if you don't
eat your family wonders why yeah if I
didn't have
family that would probably be me like I
just volunteered myself
yeah that's pretty that but I've been
learning react this week that's why I
have this beard now that's why and you
wearing the same shirt that you were
wearing last yesterday or last week when
we were courting yeah totally joking
that was one of my questions was like
how do you guys like we all have
families how is there any like life
hacks that you guys recommend for people
with families and having to catch up
what does JavaScript fatigue and
learning react and everything yeah just
ignore it I have a family and I I'm
always on top of it because it's mostly
my job to stay up to date but for the
people that are building products
full-time for their companies is just
wait just like sit by the sidelines and
wait for things to surface because it's
it's makes people really really anxious
when things keep changing and when they
feel like they're falling behind and
when you don't know it you don't know
what relay and graphic UL and redux and
all these things are and the reality is
is like just let it all settle down
we're all gonna come to a consensus in a
year or so on and what's the best way to
do this and if you're not interested in
in wasting your time just let wait till
it gets a little bit more streamlined
and you can sort of start to pick it up
from there you don't have to always be
on the cutting edge we get cut every day
by the cutting edge let us do the
bleeding for you that's a good point but
to answer that question as someone who
wants to be on the cutting edge it is it
is very difficult I have two children
and yet it's difficult to have a day job
and do it I mean I guess the answer is
I'm lucky I work like I'm lucky I worked
out a pretty cool company that gives me
like you know we have like that 8020
rule so I can I can work on some side
projects that work which is really nice
I have like a pretty long commute on
public transit so I can work during my
commute which is nice
I don't sleep very much I'll probably
die when I'm 60 but yeah no no just the
important thing though I mean is to try
to stay healthy during all of this like
at least eating better I've been really
trying to do eat better and I've noticed
like I just had more energy during the
day at not eating like McDonald's you
know crap every day so that's my that's
a yeah you act all a life in there my
other tip would be just pick a project
and see it through all the way often
people get like ooh shiny object do
shiny object oh and then that's I think
that's a majority of the people that
take my course who just want to be told
what to do they want to be sat down and
take five hours to learn something like
that and if you learn that way and I
think a lot of people do is just pick
something that you'd like to do and pick
something that's gonna be really fun
don't make it to do list because you're
gonna get bored of it and just make
something that you're really invested in
and see it all the way through and
you'll be done and you'll feel a lot
more confident in in your skill of
coming up next time yeah and I would say
to like you know pick something not too
hard either right something yeah okay
throw it don't be too ambitious yeah
yeah yeah so the second part of that
question is though when someone someone
says hey I am gonna like take it easy
I'm gonna learn a little bit of react
try and keep my finger on the pulse a
little bit so like when it does settle
down them I'm gonna I can pick it up
what what is the stuff that they needed
to learn beforehand before they're
picking up react like obviously you need
to know JavaScript HTML CSS but they can
they could ignore CSS modules right yes
yeah you know all this I mean use
bootstrap or bootstrap but I like used
I'm sure there's like reactive bootstrap
okay yeah do you recommend that they
have to like catch up on ACMA script
when
fifteen you know no I if you if you
don't like the nice thing about these
things is you can sort of pepper them in
as as you start to learn them you don't
need to sit down and learn
yes sixteen first or es2015 first and
then and then learn it you can you can
start to pepper it in and as you go
along or you see little samples here and
there and you can start yeah that's a
good point too because I think if you're
if you're gonna pick up a react project
you're gonna have to if you do want to
use es2015 you have to do something to
compile it down and make it work in the
browser so you know that would likely
add another layer of complication yeah
well any as any react that you're doing
this day you pretty much need a build
step just because the the JSX can't be
done in the browser anymore mm-hmm so
you do need some sort of a build step or
ents like one of these react online
editors yeah I think that's that's
probably that's like the biggest hurdle
pilots for anybody is is the actual you
know getting Babel and whatever they're
using browserify or well and like if you
don't know where to look
I mean you don't even know to you don't
you probably even know to Google web
pack or Google you know Babel or no even
Noah Babel is and then you're looking to
the Babel documentation which if you
know JavaScript in you're familiar with
it the documentation is really great but
if you're coming in with a blank slate
yeah
it's like oh what I use what what's this
web pack thing I thought I thought a
gulp was the thing you know yeah it's
just it's such a bummer when you just
want to have some fun and you probably
have three hours on a weekend and learn
something and then all three hours go
away right so yeah that's that's why I
start off my tutorial with tooling
because it's no fun to get stuck in that
you just want to get learning how react
works and build some fun stuff now is
this a case for meteor yep yep
yeah I mean if so here's the thing I'll
say if if tooling bums you out then yeah
probably it is a case for meteor if it
doesn't bum you out or you enjoy that or
webpack configs get you excited when you
like on the money like absolutely like
go go do something else don't use meteor
or frankly you want to be on the most
bleeding cutting edge you can be then
yeah like you probably be doing your own
tooling and trying to figure it out yeah
yeah like that's the whole thing with
meteor is like it provides us happy path
and it's it's just enough cutting edge
that it satisfies people but there's
always like that that push it's like no
we want to be completely on the cutting
edge and it's not it's not like that
like you got to roll your own then yeah
well like you also look at things like
amber amber is cutting edge and it works
for them because they have this nice
tool that allows people to actually get
to writing software rather than muck
around with Julie I mean I've said this
probably every every time I talk about
using webpack and and but to a meteor
audience like if it wasn't for meteor I
wouldn't be like at where I am now like
meteor gave me the like ability to get
in doing full-stack JavaScript
development without know without
worrying how to set up like a node
server use Express and then once I like
got that working I was like oh well I
want to know how this works you know I
two years after using a meteor or
whatever so and we knew something is
great that
a meteor Ben's always Pro meteor alright
by the way plug everyone watch the
transmission podcast what's that
transmission podcast it's like the
craftsman podcast ever so everyone
wanted to know what's going down in the
secret walls of MDG and everything which
is meteor development group yeah you did
with my kids to find my way in there be
like yo let's do a show directly with
some cord developers over there yeah we
do okay I'm Barbara Walters of the of
the meteor community
MDG yeah so I'm curious let's let's do
some final thoughts yeah and reacting
everything I I'm curious about our
guests and everything like what does
2016 the remaining part 2016 hold for
you guys uh well I'll start that off I'm
putting out a whole bunch more content
both free and paid ones so a lot of it
will be on react but quite a bit more on
doing some stuff on just vanilla
JavaScript so people that just want to
get better at just JavaScript without
any anything else doing a whole bunch of
just a whole bunch more more training
and hopefully some some stuff around the
business side of it as well teaching
people and sharing what I've what I've
learned along this marketing journey
very interesting I got a quick question
off that yeah how do you determine when
training should be a premium training
course and what it should be free
because you do have a pretty powerful
YouTube presence yeah um I think I don't
know I I guess it's just what I think
people will pay for and what I think
people will sign up for because my free
ones you need to sign up for and that is
huge for me for driving sales to the
paid ones so if there's something like
like the Flex box one was a no-brainer
because it's gonna everybody's going to
need to learn
how to do flexbox and it's it's not
going to change it's done so if I can
create this kick-ass flexbox one and I
did then the next four or five years
it's gonna be pulling in lots of lots of
traffic that will I'll drive people to
my pain ones so I'm pretty pretty
focused on just building the audience
right now and not super super concerned
about the making money from it I know
that will follow with the audience
hmm yeah that's interesting I think you
and I are pretty close in the directions
we're heading this year oh we should
meet up yeah yeah more more content
coming out and whatnot around like the
training content and you know it's funny
to like you never really know what's
gonna be a hit like I did this terrible
video for I gave a great talk but the
video recording was really bad for
O'Reilly for like an online thing they
did and I got the video afterwards and I
just thought if it's done like it was
out there free or I think people pay for
them maybe but they just I toss it up on
YouTube and like that's my most viewed
video last year on YouTube was that and
I would have never guessed like that
would have been the one but go figure
never know interesting what about you
Ramsey yeah mister Slayer what's up I am
going to continue fighting the good
fight trying to get WordPress
development his node and react I had
started out as a whim like I was just
like see how far I could get and then I
got about a couple medium articles and
I'm not like it's got like 800 stars on
github it's gone crazy like way more
than I thought it would and it really
seems like it would be useful to people
and people have been asking like a lot
of questions on github issues and
sending me DMS on Twitter and all sorts
of stuff so probably just gonna keep on
keep on working on that and also re
ruled I'm trying to get that done by
base camp so he's like I have a good
amount of time so we can all look at
your changed up set of rules when we're
drunk and playing yeah exactly all the
game my said there's of contaminoids
yeah yeah I would like really applaud
you guys for doing your trainings and
and stuff like that's really awesome I I
don't think I would have the I don't
think I have the patience I'm not like
the kind of person that can do that so
it's cool that you guys have that that
ability and yeah how long does it take
to like produce like what outcomes is a
10-minute video how much time planning
producing sampling recording editing
that the flexbox one which is about two
and a half hours of content took eighty
sixty eighty hours and then the react on
this is well over 200 yeah I you know
it's funny because I I would say
goodness I could probably figure this
out real quick I didn't really track it
very closely but like the mastery media
class I know I gave like six times last
year so I should really try to cheat and
I'll do a live class and I'll record it
and I I get people to pay me to do the
live class so they're like my guinea
pigs and the last questions and that
kind of stuff so I probably say like
that eight hour course I probably put
somewhere around 70 to 80 hours into
getting it all done that's like some
trainer foo right there man that's a lot
of the work is it's just prepping the
prepping the content and making sure
that it's it's good like a big part of
the reactionaries for me was building
the app before I even the course yeah
yeah like if a video looks good chances
are someone's just looking at code as
they're doing it right like I've got two
screens and I keep my like master code
up on the screen no one can see and like
I'm I'm going along as flaming as I'm
late typing and
sometimes I'll paste things in but yeah
awesome awesome all right so everyone at
this roundtable I would assume that you
guys recommend people or any react over
angular to yes yeah whatever works for
you I really like angular as well I just
was such a politician answer right there
yeah I don't care there's not you're not
there's nothing that you can build it's
not like react is gonna let you build
something that can't build in any other
framework yeah I really like react and I
think it's great but you should do your
own investigative work and see what
works for you
the that's good
alright guys so if people want to find
you on twitter i'm at west boss w es e
OS and I am act very bad hello very bad
hello nice yes you just going to follow
her what what is that where's where's
Ben where's your Twitter low - Ben stir
low - low - be an STR or underscore F
for those in on your score underscore
fire I already already uh pressured
Wesson - follow me
nice okay Phil tonight why why is there
an underscore in front of the Twitter
handle are you like a private function
or something
no it's because I'm I'm been stirred
everywhere it's the first three of my of
my first and last name but someone took
it
some dude in China that only on two
tweets in the last decade
that's the worst isn't that the worst
where's swirl problems
it's like underscore I figured that's
the developer way of doing it and if I
was a politician I would do real the
real banister but I don't want to be
like yes I'm at least like 10,000 to
20,000 followers before you put real
real yeah yeah or at least be like
verified yeah verified there you go
alright guys well I want to say thank
you for coming on the show and opens get
a meeting he's gonna get off teams
alright team thank you so much this is
awesome talk yes thank you for having me
it was fun yeah we'll see you next time
we're gonna have Richard Feldman from
Elm Lang on and we're gonna be talking
about home so I'm super excited about
that alright see you next time a.m. this
