so it's making me kind of grouchy it's
gonna listen to music but no such luck
got it done 2.1 for miles well penny was
in swim practice I didn't push further
cuz she about to get out
she fell off River I've had a couple
conversations the last couple of days
around business value and like working
on applications and what does it look
like like what should we be working on
in particular I won't client asked like
oh should I be worried about blades
going away should I be switching to
react he has limited amounts of funds
and wants to spend it on the right thing
from a developer point of view like oh
yeah absolutely you should switch to
react like blaze is gonna be a problem
at some point with someone on a finite
budget who is making money with a
business like your first focus should be
figuring out how to get that business
making more money you should be thinking
how can I spend some money to double my
income every month like focus on the
business and what it's doing and the
features that are going to drive people
to use it more and more like that's the
most important thing this post is about
es6 generators
diced at home but the girls all made it
to kings island I had to do some water
they um um they they definitely are
there in a king's island having a lot of
fun and when he said she grabbed me some
footage so we'll see what that looks
like
me
me
so Aaron and Claire are about to ride
the slingshot and me as their mothers
are fighting waves of panic
hey so wild flower is like insanely busy
um they don't have they have like patio
seating available yeah he said there's
she said there's a couple people already
waiting for the patio so she has no idea
of
this is weapon on a Friday night
trying to figure out where to eat
so I'm trying another place now so I'm
like they're there in kings island and
I'm here and like the other husband is
somewhere I don't know where and like
we're trying to converge on a restaurant
where we can all eat so the first place
just so yeah you're crazy for thinking
you can get in here that's not the right
place that's in Connecticut
yeah i was calling i wanted to see do
you take reservations and like how long
so the way of frayed people right now
are you sure
yeah 30 to 35 minutes okay thank you
sounds doable them a nap apparently so
good theoretically pop our name in the
app maybe get there in time who knows
hey so they said 35 or 40 minutes for
that place they have an app you can put
your name in on so like I could probably
figure it out and put our name in okay
okay okay sounds good oh good that's
okay well you guys are gonna be there
forever okay so what's happening now is
I'm going to try to figure out how to
use this app get us some resin out
reservations but put our name in and
assuming I figure that out they're gonna
call me when they're leaving from kings
island and then I'm gonna put in our
name and then I'm gonna drive up there
I'm gonna meet at that restaurant flip
side and then the other that is coming
from Dayton so he's gonna draw itself
and he'll meet us there as well all
right so i think i found this app it's
called no wait there we go and it says
get in line at restaurants without
reservations so I don't know apparently
i can just put our name and that's gonna
allow us to get on the waiting list and
don't call us on our tables right all i
just know how it works so i found an app
it's called no way and apparently you
can just pull up there's like a bunch of
restaurants a he's it and you just like
tell it how you're coming and like how
many people want to put your name on
their list and then like you drive there
so right now it's at like 14 to 29
minutes for flip side
so and it's like an 18 minute drive from
here to flip side well I'm a hungry so
her
okay well then stop doing right
I did but I don't get it everybody's
hungry but they still want to keep
riding right it's like we have season
passes you can go back let's go get it
so here we are 40 minutes later still
waiting for them to leave the Lord
always them come on
Oh
you
we're gonna fight
you shouldn't hold your breath you
should actually breathe out when you
jump like blowing bubbles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
