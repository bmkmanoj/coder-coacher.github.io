cut out early today to run wall britains
at swim practice
got the run done got three and a half
miles in quitting an Apple watch a
little more on the iPhone
so i just got done dropping Braden off
and i don't know like family is super
important to me and we like i've talked
about optimizations before i tried to
optimize being close to where Braden
lives so it's about 10 minutes away
maybe seven minutes I don't know and you
know I we exchanged custody every other
week so you know like he was just at our
house for a week and now today he goes
back to his mom's house he'll be there
for a week but the other nice thing is
like with him being in swim practice
like her work schedule doesn't quite
work out to where she can drop him off
it's one picked practice so she drops
him off at our house and then we take
him to swim practice and then I dry him
back to his mom so I still get to see
him every day
I was going east on your worship I'm
Oh
so we're struggling with penny she wants
to quit we let her older sister quit
from swim team she just wasn't enjoying
it and we feel like she's at the age
where she can decide those kinds of
things but with penny like we can't even
buy swim lessons this cheap I don't know
if it's the early morning or what's
really frustrating or we're still trying
to get to the bottom of it but kind of
hoping we can get her to push through
because so we just finished at the pool
and penny was working on treading water
say hi penny and she got it you got it
didn't you you excited I yeah yeah all
right let's go
