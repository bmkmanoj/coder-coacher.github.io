welcome meteor fans I'm your coat earth
I'm your host josh owens along with my
special guest co-host I'm Rishi Kumar
I'd yeah so welcome back to the show
Richie you've been on once before right
yep yeah so uh yeah I guess the big
thing you do like your big meteor news
guy at two right yeah I just gather all
the information and make it easy for
everyone else to get updated no that's
awesome i love it i look forward to
those emails on thursdays yeah so this
week we are talking about I lost my list
or here would it go meteor 105 mocha
testing sikka I think that's how you say
that react native and browser policy so
um I don't know about you but I was I
was actually doing a pairing session
like an apprentice pairing session with
someone and we ran a meteor update to
get like the latest version of iron
router or something and all of a sudden
meteor 105 came across my screen and I
was like whoa what's this did you I mean
did you see any announcement for it
anywhere other than like on crater uh no
I was actually in the middle of
developing or developing in a meteor app
and then all of a sudden I saw that same
message yeah I was like I'm Oh what is
this about and then I went to the
history found out it's just a upgrade on
the Facebook API right but apparently
like if you're using the Facebook API
it's not like from what I can tell it's
not trivial at least what I've seen from
people complaining um actually I looked
at the history oh they got their
breaking out the 11 docs now
um yeah so I guess on April thirtieth
Facebook's gonna sunset the old API and
automatically like forcibly switch
everyone over and so they've they've got
a really good document here a wiki doc
that's like six or seven paragraphs long
that kind of walks you through some of
the changes so if you were using things
like what would change but you know it's
just weird like it was small but also
there was like there was no release
candidate there was no like pre release
announcement or anything so found it to
be quite interesting that they just kind
of pushed it out there like that yeah
but I could see it working with
something like an upgrade on an API
because there's not too much testing if
it's just straight from facebook or
straight from the Facebook like API Docs
you haven't lived through a Twitter API
update have you no I have not yeah yeah
that was a very painful thing going from
Twitter 10 API to 1.1 API um yeah I mean
I so I'll say like their integration
point is very very small right like its
though off stuff so um it's not it's
definitely not the end of the world and
I think they definitely want to give
people enough time enough notice right
just seems like maybe they didn't
realize this was happening and this just
kind of came out pretty fast once they
realize that they needed to change
things but maybe the more interesting
story here is the fact that they talked
about 1.1 last night and now when you
look at the changelog history you can
see there's a bunch of stuff happening
with 1.1 we're getting the the window
support the version solver looks like
some updates to tracker I thought the
new blaze stuff was coming in with 1.1
as well or did that all come in with 1.4
or 1 point 0 point boy I know that's
still its own preview release and so
from what I from what I know they want
some more
stand on it before they want to put it
in any release oh they're keeping it
separate for now until it's it's good to
go ah that's a bummer that feels like a
big thing that they could put in here I
mean the version solver is nice and
Windows support is definitely like a
gigantic thing right II so I don't know
I I got an air pear request from avital
today I guess they need help with their
windows release like certificate signing
or something like that and I was like I
can't take this air pear I have no idea
what I'd be doing touched a window of
machine in years alright so next story
the mocha testing you want to take that
one sure so I respond Lyra least an
article blog post about testing meteor
packages of mocha and so now what this
allows you to do is use mocha
essentially within your tiny tiny test
api's right I guess I mean within your
package testing so you'd like whatever
you'd say like API are packaged on tests
like you can specify mocha now and use
that instead yeah and I I mean I guess
if we're on respond Lee they also
released a new test reporter which i
think is is gorgeous yes it's really
nice yeah I totally agree they've got
like this huge blue header if you're
passing or this huge like pink header if
you're failing and it looks like I don't
know if they don't deepen of this client
server like runtime like how long things
took an all that kind of stuff i think
that was already there but they've made
it they've made it very very beautiful
and responsive and uh yeah i don't know
i think it's pretty awesome yeah I would
agree yeah
and so I would say like tiny test was I
I applaud mdg for having some test suite
in place for building meteor itself and
that was a good thing but it was
definitely lacking in both documentation
and in just general like that there's
really no assertion library and there
there's like I i made a table once when
I was writing the testing manual or the
testing book I was working on and I want
to say there were like 20 calls in there
maybe it wasn't a huge table so like
getting getting mocha in there i think
is gonna be pretty amazing yeah awesome
stuff have you done any testing yet I
very little I haven't done too too much
extensive testing so it's like the the
most i've done is very basic unit to us
so i'm hoping to expand on that and i do
some end end testing as well yeah yeah
yeah so the other interesting thing is
this all live is completely outside of
velocity so they try to use similar
mechanisms for like updating the the new
test reporter so my guess is at some
point we might see someone adopt this
test reporter into velocity which i
think would be awesome as well because i
don't really like the the little dot now
that I've had to live with it for a
while like the little dot in the corner
that she can't move that's it's kind of
annoying it actually uh it actually got
in the way of a login button in that my
applications that's the common complaint
is that it's like it covers the login
button and so I think I think Jonas has
he's got some CSS that you can apply and
she probably just like put that in the
package and you could configure which
corner you want it on or something like
that but still it just it doesn't feel
quite right like I really like looking
at this this looks really amazing so
kudos to the respondent guys
Phil in particular I'm sure he had a lot
to do with the UI there alright so the
next story is Sikka I'm I really hope
I'm saying that right did he put a like
a phonetic pronunciation in here uh no
each other sounds right to me yeah okay
we're gonna go with that yeah two K's I
don't know alright so this is a firewall
that you can install and it looks like
my guess is Ivan Ivan look deeply at it
but it it probably connects into the
middleware itself that media runs on
which i think is connect and it will
look at who's connecting into DDP and
it'll you can basically restrict people
to like how often they can hit it a DDP
connection and request some data from
you and you can do that by IP address
and if you're getting hit too hard it'll
actually offer up like a CAPTCHA that
they have to fill out before they can
get more requests and even then you can
restrict like if someone passes the
CAPTCHA you can restrict how often
humans are hitting it and and so he's
got a video he shows like you can
basically take down a telescope site or
really any meteor site just by
overwhelming and asking it over and over
for too much data and like a ton of DDP
requests and all of a sudden like your
meteor server will stop running and well
I don't think this isn't like a bad
thing I just think it's an easy DDoS
attack vector and so I love seeing that
he's created this and you know I think
the only problem is I saw someone say
something about like you can't use this
with ssl right now and so that that
would be kind of a stopping bug for me
because i just moved most of my meteor
sites over to have ssl now so yeah I
vote I also notice there's a form
epic about uh about people I guess
discussing whether or not sick i should
actually be in the core because of how
how important it is in terms of like
security and preventing attacks yeah
yeah i would totally agree with that and
that that'll definitely be an
interesting conversation right like it's
it's one of those like little
conversations that keeps happening like
to me collection hooks should probably
be in the core and if if mdgs not going
to do their own router then maybe we
should have iron-router be part of core
right because i don't think there's a
there's definitely like there's an
advantage to having mdgs eyes on some of
this code and basically saying yes we
think this is right you know but at the
same time umm err node is a pretty smart
guy and i think the community can almost
do as good at it as good of a job if not
the same type of job right like i don't
think just because mdg got some money
and hired some particular people doesn't
mean that like they're gonna do a better
job at this than the community good
right yeah that's true so I don't know
like I always I always like think that
one out logically and it's like whoa
we're all pretty smart developers so do
we all really believe that mdg is just
that much smarter than the rest of us I
just think they have more time and more
discussions about a lot of things then
maybe the community does but yeah like I
think if velocity was part of core and
they had a team working on it it
probably would already be out and much
more stable than it is now and so that
that's the benefit of having money
behind you but not necessarily I don't
think they would have done a better job
necessarily than what the velocity team
is doing right now so all right
so the next story is react native did
you look at any of this yesterday yeah
so react native I was actually looking
at the syntax so majority of it is very
similar to regular react but the the
part that differs a lot is render so the
the code that you actually put in
renders like it looks like mix of like
XML with Orwell HTML with with a little
bit of handlers on it and so I'm
assuming they they made it that way so
that it compiles down to objective-c for
iOS and I would be super interested in
trying to like integrate meteor a meteor
server and like communicate data with
react native but the the only problem I
would see is the compilation step so
when it actually converts that react
native code to objective-c will will
that break any data connection that
we're trying to create hmm well I mean
there's already so I'd be curious to see
like how easy is it to integrate with
existing like objective-c libraries
right because we already have objective
DDP available I think there's actually
two different implementations of that
now so could could you like somehow rely
on that at the iOS level to to get
things going I don't know that would be
interesting to see ya and so um I think
that's definitely like a hotly
anticipated thing right because uh
someone someone saw fit to put it on
crater and then yesterday I was looking
and it was like top five trending repo
on github as well so a lot of people
were waiting for that to drop and i
don't know like it's also I think a lot
of that it's just JavaScript so you know
theoretically you just easily bolt this
thing into a meteor app in the end I
mean that's all Cordova was just an NPM
package and that's why they were able to
get it in into place in a smart way in
the pipeline
yeah I hope some someone experienced
experiments with this and comes out with
a nice integration because I building
like truly native apps in JavaScript
would be awesome yeah yeah agreed
totally agreed and so the other thing I
noticed when I was looking at the the
trending repos did you see yesterday
that meteor crossed into the top 10 of
that at most starred repos yeah so goog
we're uh were hotly trailing rails right
now who's number nine I think there are
like 25,000 over like 23,000 and
something we're still like way behind
but if you look at frameworks on the
page I think as far as programming
language frameworks I think there were
only three on the page one was angular
which is like number three the other one
was rails in the end then meteor I think
nodes up there too so i don't i don't
know i don't know if i count node it's
kind of a weird one but then you know of
course bootstraps number one so that's
just crazy yeah all right and last up
today is the browser policy versus
superfish and so David Weldon he always
does a great job with his blog post he
he put a blog post up talking about how
they had some customers complaining
sending in some some support tickets
saying that they were getting some airs
and so he started looking into it and it
turned out that it was a superfish was
trying to like inject stuff into the
page and the browser policy was catching
that and like causing errors for the
users and so if you're not familiar
browser policy is a package that you can
install and there's a configuration file
that you can set
for it and you can do things like
disallowing frame wrapping around the
page and so it'll send something to the
browser that says like don't allow this
page to be wrapped if someone tries to
put an i frame around it or something
you can turn off in line scripting or
evals or I mean there's all kinds of
things and you can whitelist trusted
domains if you want for like cross
scripting origin stuff and so it's
really really interesting like I I'd
only ever looked at this stuff once and
I hadn't really thought about it ever
since then and it's really awesome to
see him talking about this and and
bringing this up and it's it's a great
example of like why you need to do it
right like super fish nobody knew that
was there and under the covers like it
was subverting part of the internet
right yeah so this actually opened my
eyes to see the full potential of
browser policy I didn't I didn't know I
what what it could do completely and
this this really helped out yeah have
you used a yen i have used it on one
application i believe yeah yeah i've
only used it on one app as well so out
of like the probably 15 to 20 i've had
my hands in total meteor wise like I've
only ever messed with it once so that's
kind of funny uh there is something
interesting in here they had to increase
their proxy buffer in order to get the
browser policy to work where that is hmm
yeah anyway totally worth the read and
totally probably worth the 30 minutes
it's going to take you to get browser
policy installed and configured I know
I'm going to be working to get this into
my applications over the weekend
hopefully we're over next week good
stuff
all right okay that's the end of our
show this week was sponsored by modulus
you guys know where to check them out
i'm sure modulus io best best hosting
platform ever definitely check them out
and then you know media club still that
things going like gangbusters I think we
got like 50 people in there a lot a lot
of smart people and they're talking
about meteor all the time and it's a
great resource so if you just go to a
meteor Jasta club you can sign up the
mailing list there if you want to get
into the slack chat room you can go to
patreon.com/scishow club and you can
sign up there to support the podcast and
crater and all that kind of stuff and
we've just we've had a ton of signups
joris Colby Chris a Nicholas Devon josh
g all kinds of people it's just been
it's been going crazy it's awesome and
then the last thing is we hit the goal
on patreon and so we actually had our we
recorded our first new episode of meteor
club podcast and so myself and Ben
Strahan and sasha grey and Jeremy shimko
all recorded an episode where we talked
about scaling and hosting and so that'll
probably be out within the next week or
two as a new podcast so I'm pretty
excited about that it's awesome yeah
have you listened to the other new
podcast meteor interviews watching uh
yes I have I saw the one that you were
in and the next one would Sam they're
both very good yeah yeah I love
listening to Sam talk it's always funny
to hear him like you know he gives us
little uh I don't know I don't know if
that's like a British ISM or what but
he's always got these funny little
sayings that he inserts in there and you
really gotta listen for him but it was
it was fun to hear so
alright Richy thanks for filling in for
