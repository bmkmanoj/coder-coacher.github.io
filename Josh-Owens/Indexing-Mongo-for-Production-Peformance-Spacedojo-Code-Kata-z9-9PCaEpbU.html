your host Josh Owens and today we're
gonna talk about indexing MongoDB so if
we look here we've got crater dot IO
which is a site that I run it's built
with meteor which uses Mongo on the back
end and so whenever you hit this page
it's doing a query to Mongo to look for
all the data that it should display on
the front page and if we click around
here a little bit like we click on this
one with comments you see we get an ID
and a slug passed in here so it's
probably using those to do lookups to
find the individual story so we can post
this information onto the page and that
kind of stuff so I have imported the
data from production into the database a
local database so that we can use Robo
Mongo and take a look at to see what
that that looks like I also did this is
more about Mongo than it is meteor so I
just wanted to point out that in order
to get meteor working with Mongo 3.0 I
started my own Mongo server imported the
database and then I started meteor up
with a Mongo URL that just pointed to
localhost 2701 7 which is pretty
standard so and meteor won't start its
own server so you don't have to worry
about 2.6 I would highly highly
recommend getting to 3.0 you get the the
query planner and all the explanation
that goes with that and I think it gives
you a lot more insight and information
to what's happening with your query so
let's get this started
so we're gonna use Robo Mongo which is a
tool that allows you to graphically kind
of browse a Mongo database it just uses
standard Mongo commands you could do
this from a Mongo shell if you wanted to
just start it up in issue these same
commands and so by default a local
meteor app uses the the meteor database
so we'll just open that we've got our
collections here and you can see we've
got a bunch of posts and these are what
comprise
frontpage that we had looked at before
so if we think about it this collection
is almost like walking up to a
refrigerator right and if we say hey
let's get some spinach out of the
refrigerator because we all want to look
like Popeye we open the fridge we look
around in there and eventually we're
probably gonna you know somewhere in the
back we're gonna find the spinach
because no one gets spinach out that
often so maybe a better way to do it is
if we had a piece of paper on the front
door of the fridge that said spinach
right it's got a list of everything
alphabetically and we can scan down that
list and say spinach oh middle shelf
back left-hand corner so we open the
fridge and we immediately grab it out
right that's a lot faster and that's
what indexing does for us it creates a
separate little file that keeps track of
all the information that we care about
and so that way when we query using that
information it can do a much faster
lookup almost instantaneously so what we
can do here is we've got a normal
command DVD collection posts find so we
can throw and explain on to the end of
that and we'll take a look at what the
query planner looks like real quick
so we get the parsed query the winning
plan and rejected plans right so our
rejected plans are empty our winning
plan shows us that it had to do a call
scan and so if we go back to our browser
here we can look at the Mongo
documentation which is great by the way
super super handy we can see a call scan
is it had to scan the entire collection
right so we open the fridge and we just
kind of hunted around for something
there what we really want to see is this
IX scan right that's the goal
and you can see the winning plan even
had to do a filter it wasn't really I
don't even know what it was filtering on
I think because we just we weren't doing
anything here it ends up having to run a
regular like a filter query and so we
get we get different stages as well
which we'll get into I'll show you what
that kind of looks like yeah so let's
let's maybe do a scan for an ID and see
what that looks like and it doesn't even
have to be real data right we can just
say 1 2 3 and we can see it did an ID
hack right and I don't even think that's
covered in the yeah there don't even
listed here
so let's maybe instead we can open
indexes here let's get rid of some of
these so let's instead do a fine for
status two and see what that looks like
and so I have an index on status and so
with we're using telescope
behind-the-scenes and status a post
status just denotes where it is so
status to means that it's been published
at this point so we can see that we had
an input stage here and it did an IX
scan and that's exactly what we want to
find right we have an index it was able
to use that index and to return some
information based on that index we can
see we didn't even have any rejected
plans here and so if we look into our
execution stats we can see that I happen
to know we have 25 48 documents in here
so we returned
25:47 we left one out because it was
likely in an a different status number
and the execution time in milliseconds
was one I believe that's an estimate and
then we can look down here in the stage
when it did the fetch it this all looks
really good to me yeah
so let's maybe let's get rid of that you
can see it had to do the filter again
when we got rid of that so that's not
really what we want to see so did the
call scan filter and we can see
according to the works it had to do
maybe a little bit more than it should
have
specifies the number of work units
performed by the query execution stage
query execution divides in this small
work unit a work unit might consist of
examining a single index key fetching a
document from the collection applying a
projection to a single document or doing
a piece of internal bookkeeping so
anytime it's doing an action it's gonna
it's gonna add on to that so we go back
let's let's get our let's get our index
back in there so we can just call create
index right and so this has changed a
little bit if you were used to Mongo -
you had an ensure index that's been
deprecated now we have a create index
and we can give it different options I
would highly recommend going to read
that MongoDB page if you need to do that
kind of thing and so we can just do
status one and that's gonna tell it
create the index we want to make sure
the status is in that index and so we
run this and then we get insert of one
record and now when we open up the
indexes folder here you see we eat that
status one back let's run this again
and we can see it's not much but you can
tell that we actually did two pieces
less of work by having that index there
right so a lot of the work being done is
is fetching the data but we were able to
cut down on two additional pieces of
work by having that that index there so
this is a move in the right direction
correct
so now let's maybe scale it down let's
think about what an additional
production query might look like and so
since we're using meteor we can
I've got Khedira installed in the
production app we can look at our pub
subs and so I can pull up my response
time we can see what the slow ones are
let's look at this post list maybe click
here we can filter down and see we're
getting status to post it at less than
blah blah blah and then we also have
some sort stuff going on as well so
let's start with the selectors and then
we'll start adding in some sort stuff as
well because that changes how we build
our indexes as well so status to post it
at with a timestamp
there we go
so now when we look at the winning plan
we can see that we pull up the execution
stage - we can see it did a fetch but it
also did had to do a filter right and so
we've added in our winning plan we've
got additional stages inside our input
stage so we've got an input stage here
which it did do a scan write an index
scan but then it also had to filter by
the posted at so that's not really what
we want to see and so again you can see
the works is at 25 48 and we returned
zero objects right so I had to do quite
a bit of work there for us to return
zero objects so that's not really
probably what we want to see so let's
see if we can tweak and use a multi key
index and all you have to do is just
keep adding them on right so we can say
post it at one and we'll insert that
index we can see it's been added
and now when we run we look again I pull
up the winning plan you can see we got
rid of that filter here right and so we
just had to do the index scan and as far
as the work we only had to do two things
so this is a major improvement over what
we had before but if you remember we
talked about sorting so what I'm gonna
do for now let's take out this post of
that well let's get sorting by score in
here all right so we just say sort score
one so again when we look at this
winning plan you can see we've got this
sort pattern on here and in reality
what's happening you can see we start to
get new pieces of the execution stage
here where it's talking about memory
usage your memory limit whoa that's
probably bad right because what's
happening is it's able to let's see it's
able to use the index to pull the
information out let's pull up this input
stage yeah so it does the index scan and
then it does the fetch stage and then it
passes all that up and then you have to
do a sort on that so we've gotten the
data out and everything looks good but
then now the data is in memory and now
Mongo has to sort it all in memory and
that's that's not really what we want to
see so that's that's kind of bad Mongo
can be much more efficient if we just
get a multi key going on and we want to
make sure we put that key the sort keys
last in the order that they're being
listed right so if you remember we
looked in Khedira and we had a multiple
sort kind of algorithm going on they
should be left to right in order in your
index and that is super important and
we'll see more of that and
a minute so we had that index you see it
got in there run again and again we saw
that it had to do actually yeah if you
look at the works before our index that
was doing 5,000 pieces of work right and
that's that's really really terrible and
estimated time in milliseconds you can
see like up at the top of the query it
added up to like 30 so that's kind of
slow so let's run this again look at our
execution stats we got it back down to
10 you can see our pieces of work is
back down to 25 48 so we basically
fetched all the records and then sorted
them
and next can you know execution time
estimate zero so we're looking way way
better with this and if we look at the
query planner again you can see the
input stage is just a normal index scan
so that's great so now let's combine
those posted at actually we'll just do
less than new date right I don't really
want to make sure we return some stuff
actually I don't know let's just we'll
just take this one I kind of like seeing
how much work he has to do to get
nothing out of database
and then again oh yeah we can see we've
got multiple stages here and the winning
plan so the input stage did a scan and
fetch and then we had to sort by the
score so let's see what our execution
stats kind of look like here - yep we've
got the memory usage your memory limit
going on again so if we look here at the
index bounds with a key pattern it used
the status posted at right instead of
the status score so that's not really
what we want so we're gonna drop the
status posted at let's run the explain
again and see what that looks like
it's looking a little better so we can
say that it we didn't we didn't have to
hit the memory to do the sort so I was
able to do the index scan and then it's
filtering those results so we did to
return zero we did 25 49 pieces of work
right 2549 so that's still not quite as
efficient as we want so let's add in
remember I said we we want to put our
score that's our sort we want to put
that last right
Oh Oh still doing a sort pattern that's
not quite what we want to see wonder why
that is
see we got back to let's see what keys
what keys did it use for the scan status
posted at score I used the one we would
expect it to use but why are we sorting
hmm indeed I'll tell you why let's uh
let's drop this index and this is a
tricky thing this is a thing that that
actually caught me off guard that's
that's really why I wanted to do this
code kata in case anyone else runs into
this add this to my blog post - about
indexing and so if we what we need to do
is anytime we're using a dollar sign
less than greater than dollar sign in
anything that that could maybe match
multiple values you need to put that one
right at the back of the index right so
you want to do selectors in the order
you're selecting and then you want to do
sorts in the order you're sorting left
to right and then you want to do any
kind of dollar sign array operators so
to speak and so now when we do the
explain this should look a lot better
for us yep we're getting one stage index
scan you can see we're using the the key
we want execution stats we're not
getting any of the memory limit stuff
you know we're still doing a fair amount
of work but we're you know we're looking
over those documents and we're not doing
any additional work above and beyond the
documents that are in the database that
match the the particular index piece
that we're looking at so I think this is
this is probably about as good as we're
gonna get here so I think that that kind
of concludes this portion
the code kata and if you enjoyed it I'd
encourage you to give me a thumbs up I
will probably do another video if we hit
a hundred thumbs up this time we did 50
last time we hit it so that was awesome
thank you guys and I just wanted to show
you one more thing before we're done if
you are using something like meteor they
used to have a way to call ensure index
and that would set you up in index but
that's actually gonna be deprecated well
intra index has been deprecated on a
Mongo side they're probably going to
update the Mongo driver soon I have a
feeling that intra index is gonna go
away really the better way to do it is
just call raw collection and that will
give you the actual driver collection
and then we can just call create index
right here on it just like we were doing
directly in Mongo itself the only other
weird piece is that the drivers it
expects a callback and you can do
something with that if you want you
don't really have to but basically this
create index works pretty similar and
should work won't break with any updates
that are happening to the driver whoops
oh that's actual method call there this
will save that guy and again if you're
using create index I would advise you to
go look at the docs I think they're
super great just go over here to create
index takes a minute and you can see we
just give it some keys and then we can
give it some options and you can do like
background true so it'll build it won't
block any database activities it'll just
build in the background we can say that
a query is unique and so you could have
let's say you've got a user's table
meteor or it already does this for you
but you have a user's table and you only
ever want one
user to have one email address so you
could set a unique index on the email
field and that would ensure that you
never get duplicate emails coming in so
there we go
