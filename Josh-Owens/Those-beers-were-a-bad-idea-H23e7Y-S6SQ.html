Oh
I just got off the call with our
mastermind group and that thing is so
good like every week we just get
together every Wednesday to 30 and talk
for an hour and sometimes we have a
topic where one of us is teaching the
other is about something that we're
doing in our business and how it works
it's just it's amazing to get a
perspective on your business from
someone who is genuinely like invested
every week and hearing what's going on
and what you're thinking and like you're
giving your critical thoughts on their
business and it just feels like a safe
place like I really really it's amazing
and I appreciate those guys so much so
like Wes boss and Scott Tolan ski
youtube channels they you should check
them out they do great work and it's so
awesome that I get to talk to them every
week about this kind of stuff
Oh
ah
Oh
ah
the clouds look like they're almost a
swirling pattern he's about to pour rain
on us so i'll be honest i procrastinated
a little bit today you can see like it's
getting dark out we still got to get a
run in forever usually gets a little
crazy around the house this time I'm
gonna bring her on the run with me say
hi puppy hey we got a mile and a half in
you see is pretty dark I'm tired she
seems okay but considering we we've
already beat last week's total and I had
two beers I think we're gonna call it a
night at a mile and a half so hopefully
she's calm
Oh
you know my thought for the day would be
find a peer group find a mentor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
