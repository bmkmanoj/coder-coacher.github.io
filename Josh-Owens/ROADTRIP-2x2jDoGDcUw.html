travel day so figured I'd get my run in
before we hit the road we gotta hit the
road by 10am to eat now get a few miles
in and then we have to drive to
nashville which is about five five and a
half hours away got the run in actually
started drizzling right probably the
last mile actually feels good I'm kind
of hot so now I have to go edit the
video that gets uploaded today from
yesterday's footage finished packing the
car and then we're going to head out of
town should be a good time we're going
to utopia in Nashville Tennessee when
he's doing a book signing so it'll be
good for her to kind of draw in that
energy that you get when you go to a
conference with your peers
member
just fill in the air the tires full of
air before leaving and like the craziest
thing I mean we've got a newer car it's
got sensors and like I was filling it
and the stupid air thing wouldn't tell
me how full it was like the the markings
have actually rubbed off and then like
all of a sudden my car starts honking at
me we couldn't figure out what it was
turns out the tire was full and it
wanted to let me know that's pretty
awesome killing the car before and get
out of town it's taking us forever sadly
and just stopped back by the house
because the video yesterday's video that
stuff well I uploaded today so we'll see
hopefully we make good time
you
I just left Cincinnati run on the way to
Ohio eval as people from outside of this
area would call it or Louisville if you
live in it then after that we'll be on a
Nashville
so we made it down to Nashville uh it's
quite hot here like it's a quite a bit
hotter here and then I own way more
human so you could drama though we made
it in four and a half hours I guess so I
fell asleep yeah appreciate Wendy
driving the bulk of it I was pretty
tired from that run this morning pushed
it kind of hard got three miles in 30
minutes so worn me out and now we gotta
unload part of the car head over to the
venue unload all her books tops
member
all right so it's 1111 here it's labeled
tired we're out all evening we got
around I guess six o'clock our time and
set up and met some friends for dinner
my cousin actually is in town I haven't
seen her since I was like Pride 12 I
meant I don't know travel Charles hard
like it can be a little tiring the hard
part is knowing you're losing a day you
know like I I didn't really get anything
done today nothing productive like I saw
some people I hope Wendy set up for her
show tomorrow but you know like as far
as moving my agendas forward like none
of that happen so that that's the hard
thing for me would travel unlike I'm
always hesitant to say yes to it at the
end of this trip it'll be fun and we'll
have a good time and get to hang out
with some friends we haven't seen in a
while so that's always awesome as well
so you know I'm gonna get some sleep I I
gotta go the other thing that this trip
highlighted is that i don't i'm not
prepared for like mobile editing for
this kind of thing either so I hadn't
turned in like a couple podcast I oh my
audio editing guy I've got to get video
version of a podcast up on youtube and i
also have to get this footage this
footage off this camera onto my laptop
somehow and i generally i have an imac
at home and like I just pop the SD card
in the back of the imac but I've got a
macbook and there's no SD card slot so
now I'm going to run to the apple store
tomorrow
hopefully they'll have something there
so we'll see
good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
