going to talk about the most interesting
technologies that we're gonna watch in
2017 stay tuned
Bendu good hey it's our last show of the
year yeah like two days time it'll be
2017 that's crazier yeah yeah it's
definitely crazy
so rather than necessarily like recap
the crazy year I thought we could do
like an end-of-year episode where we
talk about like what we think the future
is gonna be we could probably mention a
little bit of the craziness up front
certainly like in the grand scheme of
things it seems like the world's gone
not so with Britain leaving Europe and
like Trump getting elected even though
no one thought he would get elected like
it's just been it's been kind of crazy
well and in JavaScript fatigue did
happen this yeah that feels so old but
that I I feel like that was maybe in
February or March or something but yeah
you're totally right like we totally got
that new JavaScript fatigue me meaning
them I can't talk today yeah I don't
know like maybe maybe closer to the
hearts of the crater community is like
meteors seen a weird shift right and
we've done a couple shows on that
certainly been a little controversial as
of late we've seen arunoda leave the
community yeah the meteor community and
even yesterday he at a post that they're
shutting down Khedira and but they're
doing in an awesome way right like he's
open sourcing all the code and then
you'll be able to do your own
deployables enough Khedira
which is quite funny because it's like
the thing was a DevOps challenge for him
yeah I've got imagine running your own
is gonna be it's gonna be hard like you
want insight to help your app stay up
but you're gonna have to debug and help
stay the app tracking app stay up need
insight for your insight
he built his own database didn't he ah I
don't think so they were talking about I
don't know if they ever did I think they
were still using Mongo but I had to like
the data collector was like fronted in
node and then like they had their own
they weren't using Mongo sharding but
they were shorting on their own and
software land so like if you just think
if your app started with an a you went
here if it started with a B you went to
this Mongo shard essentially really just
separate databases theoretical sharding
I guess oh yeah I don't know it's been a
fun year though like we've seen the rise
of things like graph QL like that
definitely was not really on my radar
yeah an Apollo along with that for
meteor yeah yeah definitely some
exciting stuff coming out from them like
they're getting view integration I don't
know
I'm super super excited for 2017 and
where it's heading and like honestly I
think if you want to know like where my
head's at with what our technology's
gonna be we've got I finally got the
critter conf
javascript edition up for 2017 I've got
eight of these figures listed I actually
have ten speakers so I'm gonna put two
more up today and then I still have two
slots I have to fill but we're getting
there and I think a lot of the
technology that we're gonna mention
today is a lot like I've purposely gone
out and picked some speakers for a lot
of this stuff as well for the conference
because I just think like that's where
things are heading and it's gonna be
super super exciting and interesting
yeah
yeah definitely so let's dive into it I
think for me the number one thing that I
kind of learned about this year and was
excited to learn about was surveillance
right so like AWS lamda on the backend
and server list gives you an easy way to
take your node code and deploy it
directly to AWS lamda and so like I
don't it's not clear to me is it is it
considered a framework yeah I'm pretty
sure I'm pretty sure it's a framework
serverless thinking server let's don't
work right serverless calm calm I was
wrong
yeah I know that they plan to support
Windows functions because like at this
point I know Google has their Google
Cloud functions I believe it's called
and Windows has our Microsoft has added
error functions yeah so they're all
functions as a service is what people
call it so basically you just code out
one endpoint and I mean pretty typically
I don't even know if server list
supports the Java stuff I know it does
node stuff and I and I think they all do
node and Java
maybe Python as well I'm not too sure
about that yeah so I mean to me like I
got to see actually a double helping of
it at Space Camp and I've got some
videos that I can I can get up shortly
but I was super excited to just see like
how easy it is to work right so like for
me one of the tools I use all the time
in my business is zapier and I feel like
AWS lambda and serverless is like zapier
on steroids right like it's just like
this you you have even more access and
even more code available to you to run
to like execute these things and so
you're building little functions that
have like inputs and then they run some
code and then maybe they have some
output right and the interesting thing
they were showing is like messaging back
and forth in one of these talks and it
was like they were taking inputs from
Twilio through SMS and then in putting
it into a dynamo DB and
and out putting that onto a web page so
like that that was super interesting to
me and then like you had to go both ways
right like if someone puts something
into the web then that needed to like go
into lambda and then shoot back out over
to Leo SMS and so I see it as almost
like an if this than that or zapier or
something like that like just with way
more power behind it yeah because you
essentially have I mean every API is
just its own function so I think it
makes a lot of sense which we'll talk
about later as far as well we'll get to
graph QL but I think graph keel is a
perfect candidate for something like
lambda because it's one endpoint so you
could you can have your graph QL API
just hide behind AWS and then connect to
various AWS services or again it's not
you know serverless is not only AWS but
you could connect graph to you all to
all these various things in the server
side and I think that that's really cool
and and from my understanding it seems
really easy to deploy and play with all
the the serverless stuff and again
that's kind of the goal of the server
list framework is to make that just
really simple as well yeah yeah and they
talked about that during that talk to
that I get to see it was like AWS lambda
like the packaging format in the way
that you deployed it was really kind of
awkward and weird and so I think that
was like the first win was something
like jaws which then became serverless
is that it made it like super easy to
start deploying to AWS lambda and yeah I
get to watch like they actually changed
a little bit of code and did it deploy
like live real-time during the talk and
like it was super super simple almost
reminded me of something like a Heroku
or modulus or even galaxy like you just
do kind of a simple code push kind of
thing and then it then it's up there and
running so pretty I think there's so
many AWS as far as the AWS side there's
so many services there's some page which
trains like them all because they all
have wonky names or just a not super
intuitive names and I thought it was
funny but they just listened they just
they have it all it seems like
it's one of the things that I've played
with a little bit of lambda is the IATA
button I don't know if you've seen they
have their Amazon - buttons which
essentially so I've got a Gatorade one
and I just push it two days later Gator
it appears on my door which is cool or
you know razors or shaving cream
whatever you need toilet paper fun stuff
but they have the same button only it's
programmable so it hits some AWS lambda
API and then you could do whatever you
want so that's pretty interesting for
for prototyping some ideas and stuff so
oh yeah definitely
and I think you know in this this day
and age like you it's super cheap to
deploy to lambda right like they give
you a ton of credit up front and like
you really have to I think have
something popular to drive it over the
limits of what you get upfront and like
the interesting thing to me is in the
day and age of like the echo dot or that
you know the big echo or Google home or
anything like that like we now need ways
to have functional api's that can like
respond to incoming requests from things
like Alexa and then respond to it with
the kind of information that you want
like I you know it's not an example
someone got a Google home and they
wanted to be able to say LH you know
they have three kids and like all three
kids have to do the dishes and they want
to have a rotation and so he just wants
to be able to say like whose turn is it
and then say they just did their turn
and so then it like rotates through and
like I think that's this is another
example of like it's just gonna be super
easy to just write some scripts and
deploy it to something like AWS lambda
and get it all working with with echo or
Google home and that's that's super
exciting yeah I think it's really
exciting I think yeah it's just cool so
it as far as the the cost aspect of
surrealist I guess we should which
probably should have started with a
little bit of how it works but
essentially you know AWS they have all
these web servers and everything and
they just take the unused cycles and
that's how they're able to process your
your lender requests just super fast so
they have all these
you want them to be really fast and then
they're just super cheap so I know at
one point I was listening to code pens
podcast and they were talking about they
converted a lot of their their stuff to
use lambda instead as far as like
transpiling code you know less sass
babble that type of stuff and for almost
all of them the costs went way down
mm-hmm so I don't know it's pretty cool
and I think yeah I think it 2017 a lot
more exploration and you know serverless
stuff will be done yeah it'll be it's
exciting yeah I think it's gonna explode
on the scene this year and become a
pretty major thing and you're right like
I think it's the comparison that you're
you're going from paying like you know
if you think way back in the old days
you had to buy a server and put in a
rack and like connected the Internet and
that's how you got servers going and
then we started to get into the cloud
right and that was the ability to just
go hit a button on a website and it
would provision your server and now like
we're just saying
forget all that I just want a function
to run when something gets hit I don't
care where it runs how it runs just get
it done right you give me an endpoint
you run some code it does what I needed
to do and we're done and I'm paying you
by the second for what's running
essentially it's just uh further
chopping up the cost of the server I
suppose smaller and smaller yes and I
think that it increases developer
experience which is the second thing
we're gonna talk about so there's been a
ton of ton of stuff this year you know
we've seen the rise of web pack kind of
I guess we could say beating all the
other build system or module loaders I I
would say Farish yeah they're still
others out there and and I think it's
good that we have competition and an
open source collaboration so I don't
want them to go away things roll up in
browser 5 would be some of the other
alternatives but ya know a lot of other
stuff is popped up so it's cool to see
but web bag is awesome and
they put on the third release candidate
of webpack - for a while was held back
by just the docks and then they released
the dock site I'm pretty sure it's just
web package a org and if you haven't
seen the new docks so if you've seen the
old docks and haven't checked out the
new docks go check it out
because the old docks you have to be
like a level 55 wizard to translate them
it's just like what was happening the
new docks are awesome huge shout out to
Shawn Larkin if you don't follow him on
Twitter you should because he's funny
and he just web packs all the things so
it's great yeah I loved it like I was
digging through next Jeff's stuff and
like they were talking about being able
to customize web pack and their and like
he he just showed up in the in the
comments of an issue like I don't I
don't even think anyone's summoned him
it was just like someone's talking about
web pack Here I am yeah there's a bunch
of funny tweets where he will just spend
a lot of his time just searching the
hashtag web pack as well as I guess just
regular web pack and so if anybody
tweets about it either likes or comments
it in like within like 20 minutes like
the guy isn't ready he's just always out
there lurking the web pack Twitter I
guess the big issues Twitter I'm gonna
I'm gonna tweet now and we'll check at
the end I'll be pretty funny yeah he's
awesome and so so there's other stuff as
far as Devex
I think babble I as far as transpilers
is pretty much one and and they've done
a ton of work there I don't know there
was a history and state of babble blog
posts the other day and I think that
some super cool stuff is coming down the
pipeline like if you've seen the babble
preset environment where you only need
to you you give it a little config like
okay chrome the last two versions
Firefox last two versions and alright or
whatever and it'll only transpile the
features that need to be transposed or
note it can even transpile for node 2
which i think is super cool yeah
definitely
the guy I haven't like that's one of
those under the covers things I haven't
had
a whole lot with but I did kind of brush
up against it I've been playing with
just lately for testing particularly
like some behind-the-scenes worker stuff
that I've been working on for a client
and I you know like it's it's built in
meteor for now it's it's somewhat
portable in the future perhaps because
we're relying on a lot of node libraries
but like I needed to do a lot of what
we're basically using es6 right because
that's like free out-of-the-box meteor
and like I didn't like just doesn't work
with Babel out of the box like I had to
go put in I had to go add a couple no
nodules to the dev dependencies and then
add a babel RC I mean it was a one-liner
it was no big deal but like it was so
super simple to just get up and running
like just done you know like it was it
was translating my es6 for me I think
that's more of meteor being dissed just
does all the Ekman script stuff I think
the ekam script package it just does all
the babel stuff for you yeah um so yeah
babble RC should play nice with most
things and I just think like in general
the direction that programming is
heading in in terms of the developer
experience I think is getting better and
better you know like I love I don't I
don't think I could survive without the
react Chrome extension and on write or
like the graph QL stuff or redux tools
or anything like that like it's so
amazing that you can just like pop these
into the to the Chrome browser and like
they just kind of work out of the box
and I'm able to get way more insight
then I would through maybe just a
consult on log like I can really dig
into these things and I think that I
love that trend and I hope that that
continues in the future
super super oops head
you know there's a bunch of stuff like
the even for debugging performance and
and the react whatever version we're on
are we on sixteen fifteen or sixteen
whatever the whatever the latest one is
there was a blog post on the the
browsers console dot time API yeah right
into the perf and I think that is so
cool is if you're trying to figure out
okay which of my components are wasting
extra time or wasting time yeah it's
really easy and I think the easier it is
to debug performance and debug bugs you
know the faster the more productive we
are the more were able to ship and so
yeah
definitely yeah and I mean it's not just
like react stuff necessarily either like
Chrome has done a good job like I
haven't looked at Safari in terms of
like measuring performance but I did
like I've got a bunch of stuff ready for
a blog post about like the dangers of
SSR and like I did a lot of measuring on
my local machine to try to figure out
like you know everyone says like oh do
Isis aura it's gonna be way faster but
in the Indian it really wasn't faster
like spoiler alert for my blog post it
wasn't any faster you're really just
translating who CPU cycles you're using
right either the browser's or the
servers and I you know the way I was
measuring this is like a lot of people
would be like well when you're
delivering rendered HTML to the browser
it just feels like it's loading faster
and so I ended up using window dot
performance to like test the timing of
like getting you know the the request
being sent to the server and getting a
usable page back and like there's a lot
of stuff in there that you can play
around with and get timings out of and
it's super interesting and you can do a
lot of performance diving just straight
in chrome like you don't even have to
mess around so I think that you know
that stuff's getting better and better
every year too
I think the hardest thing there is just
being aware of you know having these
timings set up and logged and I guess
just performance testing really and
actually knowing the data because if you
don't know how fast your app is to time
to interactive or those types of things
you don't even know how well it's
performing so yeah I think I think we'll
see that shift I think has been shifting
more there's been a lot of its developer
evangelism coming out of the chrome team
for for these things and I've seen some
cool web pack stuff coming from them too
like the how what is it called the they
try to tell you hey this bundles too big
you should try code splitting that more
aggressively and I think the rise of
HTTP 2 and and those things will
continue to change the boundaries and
change the landscape of web stuff so and
I think to me you know yeah I think like
it's it's definitely you're right like
that's that's one of the reasons why I
like I'm so excited about next year now
is because it's got like code splitting
it's got SSR like it's got all those
things built in and it's using webpack
on other covers and it's been like a
super great experience so I'm gonna like
I'm sneaking next Jass and here as like
a good developer experience as well so
you should check out I mean I got all
the Z this is eat our site yeah so yeah
next came from from that team as well as
hyper the terminal which i think is
super cool like you I don't have you
used it I've used it some and I the
emoji thing was kind of annoying why I
topped on a revenant came out because at
this time we were using Redux and react
and I was like a Redux and react to
terminal like we're just Java scripting
everything let's this is amazing why not
why not and with Jeff at Woods law we
got a JavaScript everything but yeah and
I've seen some interesting performance
things where actually performs better
than some of the terminals I know now it
works on Windows as well
they released the 1.0 version yeah and
emojis should be way better now as well
as some of the double character stuff
where you wanted like accents on your
A's and stuff those were a little weird
at first but yeah I think that's all
work now and that there's still
performance issues so it has to do with
like how they're offering I think for
like when a lot of data is coming in
basically like if you go cat like a
million line file like you're gonna kill
hyper where's the fight like I term it
still works okay so something to be
aware of like that's the one thing
that's stopped me from really like
jumping on hyper full-time but yeah I
totally agree like the team is just
killing it in my opinion with all the
stuff that they're putting out so
definitely worth a look and now dot sh
late deploying to that thing
yeah I may have been the easiest thing
I've done all year ridiculous and they
just keep shooting next now there's a
bunch of stuff and it's it's super cool
there's even a I was gonna start this if
it wasn't a thing but a Zito site -
awesome
we're just a list of all the the cool
things and I was like oh this is
beautiful need to go check that out it's
amazing at a-z IT right yes it is so
pretty cool yeah so I think another big
topic it's not like spoke focused on one
specific technology I guess it's like
focus on smartphones but we're gonna
talk a little bit about mobile I don't
know I don't know where this is gonna
end up in 2017 I don't know what its
gonna look like
I think react native will continue to
grow we're certainly seeing things like
react VR and stuff like that like I
think that that's just gonna continue to
push the boundaries of like what react
is doing and like what react native can
do for you
I think is gonna be super interesting
but I think that
there's no consensus here right like
someone someone I tweeted out like what
what do people want to talk about and
someone mentioned they wanted us to talk
about like PW A's and like I just don't
know like our PWA is gonna be a thing
like what is a PW a yeah right so it's
this this idea that you can hit a
webpage and you're gonna download a
serviceworker and start downloading some
assets basically to a phone and you can
have it's it's like a pseudo app right
like it's still right there on the
webpage you hit the webpage but now like
it can function as an app and so if you
think back to like way back in the day
you can say like save a webpage as a
button on your home screen for iOS or
something like that like it's along
those lines like you can then save that
app to your phone and bring it up and
there's some code that is installed on
your phone but it's like it's still like
all handl it's not done through the app
store anymore necessarily and like I'm
super interested in the idea I certainly
like there's definitely security
concerns because I don't want to
necessarily download and run code on my
phone that's coming from someone just
because I hit their website you know
like that seems potentially dangerous I
think there is an install process like I
haven't played with a PWA to be honest
have you you have an iPhone I do yeah
okay yeah I think y-yeah yes
iOS and Safari are kind of I think
holding that back on the Apple side and
yes Safari in general I don't I don't
even know if it's support serviceworker
I know I've seen I've seen a lot of
people hit on safari for not even
talking about service workers and trying
to just not acknowledge them but I've
seen it appear in their their plans at
least mentioned so I don't know exactly
what's happening with that are you
checking can I use yeah
yeah I'm not sure it's under
consideration brief positive signals in
five-year plan yeah that's right that's
where I saw it yeah who looked a little
yeah so I have played with with pwace in
there because I have an Android phone
and yeah it's there's some algorithm and
I I don't know how I feel about the
algorithm I feel like it should appear
the first time but maybe the first time
is annoying so I think if you visited
last time I I heard about the algorithm
it was like if you visit a website twice
within like a two-week period the second
time it'll be like it'll a little banner
pops up from the bottom it says you want
to add to homescreen no thanks or sure
and I think the only one I actually have
at it is Pony foo they'd do some some
blog posts and stuff yeah and it
basically just looks I mean it's just a
chrome tab without the I think you can
specify there like there's a JSON file
or a manifest file and you can and so
you can specify some options about it as
far as like the name and the icon and
stuff it's pretty straightforward but
yeah it appears it's just like a URL
lists this webpage and so it can look
like a native app that almost makes me
think of Cordova right like the same
thing you know I think on you know
whatever browser technology the phone
has as far as just a plain displaying it
as a web page and then under the covers
it's just HTML CSS and JavaScript kind
of functioning and you don't have that
URL bar like you're talking about you
know you just kind of build out an HTML
app and you gotta like you gotta be a
little more careful because you gotta
make sure that like when you're linking
to things there's a way to get back to
the main screen or home screen if you
don't ya stuck in the app but yeah like
that's alright I think that's super
interesting and I'm excited by the idea
I'd love to see Safari maybe say there
they're gonna do it or Apple come out
and say yeah we're gonna support it in
iOS but there's definitely been like as
far as I know nothing talked about there
and you know I they have a cash cow that
they want to protect right in the app
store
and this would allow you to potentially
skirt the AppStore and I think there are
security concerns like you know someone
let my parents freely browse the
Internet and now their machines are full
of viruses and malware and all kinds of
things right
yeah but I mean at the same time you
could go click download on on anything
true there's a little easier there isn't
like a review process right like they're
at a five-day turnaround like it's
probably even better than that now but
yeah I've heard they've got a lot better
there you go
two days on iOS and two days on Mac so
average right now being reported
she's pretty fast but at the same time
like I think they're running some static
code analysis tools and kind of poking
through and looking for any red flags
and certainly things skate through like
there were instances where like malware
got into like some library and got into
some popular apps and like that still
sailed through the App Store but at the
same time like they did catch it I think
you know when you remove that App Store
review process I don't know I feel like
we're we're removing some layer security
I don't know maybe a little but I think
that I think the biggest advantage of
PWA so other than having that that home
screen icon is and then serviceworker in
general so you have all this offline
support so I've heard a lot of people
because there's I don't know there's
that we're in this age of the the use
the platform stuff for people like oh
you don't even need JavaScript
frameworks and and there's there's
different ways of optimizing and I think
as we see you know Facebook and Google
and some of these companies really try
to bring on because I don't forget the
number but they're still like a billion
people or there's a lot of people who
still don't have access to Internet and
as we see these kind of developing
countries developing areas come online
the network is going to be the biggest
issue
so optimizing over the network with
things like graph QL so you deliver the
minimum payload as well as you know that
layer of caching that service workers
and pwace can provide I think it's a
pretty huge advantage and and again I
think this is something we'll see more
prevalent in 2017 so for sure
hopefully Google and Apple can get along
hopefully that'll make it better for
everybody speaking of you know graph QL
and like minimal like data like you know
I want to describe the data I want I
want to make one request I want to get
it back and that's that's very much what
graph QL is good for and you alluded to
it earlier like we have one endpoint
with which we connect and ask for the
data and you know we may provide the
data that it needs to gather what we
want and then it'll go out and do what
it needs to do and then bring it back to
us in the format that we need and I
think you know in all my days of
developing and working with api's I
think back till H my days of like
working with the Twitter API and you'd
make a call and like get some
information about a Twitter account and
then you get some IDs and then you take
those IDs and you have to go make
further calls to get the data you really
cared about so you had to make two or
three calls to really get to this stuff
you cared about and then and then you
have to paginate through that you know
the idea that graph QL can solve that to
where I'm just saying like here's a
person and I need to get all their
follower IDs I no longer have to make
two or three calls
I'm just making like the one call so I
think that that's definitely like where
it's positioned itself and I think it it
becomes interesting to me because you
know one of the things I always loved
about meteor and DDP was that it was DDP
kind of became this this this fulcrum
point right like it's a point at which
you could shift into a different
technology if you needed to and so on
the front end we're just making a graph
QL call but I'm not excuse me on the
graph QL server its handling things
behind the scenes how it needs to you
need Mongo great use Mongo you want to
use node to build your graph QL sermon
you've known you know you want to use
Ruby absolutely use Ruby instead or
elixir or Phoenix if that makes sense
like you can build however you want on
the back end and the front end is still
querying in the same way and you're
still returning data in the format that
it needs and you don't have to worry
about that back-end anymore yeah yeah
graft you all super cool and and then
the other thing then my favorite part of
graph QL is once you've played with
graphical which is there tooling it's
like I never want to go back to anything
else so so applicable it it's like
sequel servers developer tools or
whatever where you can just you can
explore the docs of all of the your your
graph API and then you can just ask for
whatever you want and then you you can
get that so while you're developing and
like okay I think that this field has
this and stuff you can just see it right
in the dev tool here like okay let's
let's use postman and like I don't
remember exactly what that data has but
you have to actually send the HTTP GET
request or you have to send a post but
maybe you don't remember all the fields
the post has so previously you had to go
actually look in that API code and now
it's just all exposed to you and graph
to you well I think that after doing
that it's like I'd really I don't want
to go back to things like postman and
and that stuff I mean postman is great
but I'm a huge fan of graphical I think
there's even a Chrome extension now
which has maybe that was yeah that was
the Apollo dev tools client it has as
graphical in there as well as you're
like a subscriptions viewer so you can
see what you subscribe to
interesting stuff so again going back to
Deb exit 2016 I think we'll see these
things get even better which is exciting
yeah yeah I'm I'm super excited about it
like you know I mentioned Ruby I I still
have like coming from Ruby like doing
like 9 years of work with Ruby
development like I still have a lot of
things that pop up my feet in regards to
that and you know I'm starting to see
graph QL you mentioned more and more in
other communities and I think that
that's you know gonna be the strong
point because you know there's there's
things that notice good at and there are
things that elixir is good at and I
think that the fact that you can easily
switch to elixir when it makes sense or
switch to Cassandra instead of Mongo or
whatever it is you need like to me that
is that is a huge scaling plus side
because you know I I remember a building
I always talk about like working at
GoDaddy on the the bookkeeping project
and you know we we just we have this
terrible like AV API development
experience and like this haphazard and
scattered and you know the the
JavaScript front-end team was just
adding in like little little bits that
they could like they were just rendering
bits of data to JSON wherever they could
like it was just scattered all over the
app and like it was just terrible
experience and trying to do the mobile
development in iOS like we were doing
native iOS stuff at the time like it was
hard because what they wanted was
slightly different than what we wanted
and even though like you know we're
still building kind of a similar app it
was slightly different and you know it
took us a lot of time to kind of a line
on what the API should look like and
then we had to start versioning it and
like that was a multi-month project and
it was a lot of collaboration between
teams and I think graph QL just allows
you to say like here's some data
available and then you know the mobile
team or the JavaScript front-end team
for the web like they can just ask for
what exactly they need and
we don't have to worry about any and
stuff so yeah after Ellen and I Falkor
is that is a very similar I guess
library but does it does it very
similarly but I think that they both
provide kind of the the cleanest
abstraction or separation of actually
the data itself with the client so
obviously the data and the client are
tightly coupled like I want this view to
display this data but for the client to
note so going back to the stuff like
rest the client has to know how the data
is stored in the various REST API
endpoints and that's that's the kind of
coupling that that is not very good
because it's hard to change the backend
I mean you mentioned stuff like
versioning okay well we we changed how
this API works now we have to go change
all the clients and I think that gets
really uncomfortable and it's just not
the best developer experience and so you
go to you go to graph QL where I mean
you could do static analysis and see
like okay we we want to eliminate this
field in our tree or whatever you can go
say okay you you still there is some
coupling but it's a lot looser in the
sense where okay I want this data and I
don't care where it comes from so the
client no longer has to know where the
data comes from just another structure
of the data think yeah I think that's a
really a powerful paradigm and we've
seen companies like github has a public
graph QL if yeah I think that's huge for
2016 yeah and Shopify yeah yeah yeah
that's cool I'm excited about that I
actually have a project that I'm working
on that's in working with Shopify API so
that's what I was explaining you instead
and I think you know if you look at the
flip side right like you start to look
at things like what is it is it a hyper
media Steve Claire Nick worked on some
stuff
anyway there's this idea I want to say
talking like a different than a
different protocol yeah different than
yeah I think it's hypermedia because
before it was gaining a little bit of
steam here and there a while ago but I
don't I could be wrong on that but
anyway like it's the idea that like you
know it would it would give you a list
of rest endpoints and kind of describe
what you could get and like then you're
able to just say like this is the data I
need and it could figure out which rest
endpoint to hit and just look you know
for any any kind of like Y graph QL is
bad typos and start reading on that and
you'll start to see that there are
people playing with other ideas around
rest and extending rest but I really
think to me it's part of this is like a
mind share thing right and this is why I
think DDP didn't make sense in the long
term for meteor is because you really
have to change a lot of people's
opinions about what an API should look
and function like and I think as a as a
small start-up trying to figure out a
way to bring in revenue that's a hard
job to do right like that's gonna be a
hard task
and so like MDG shifting to graph QL as
their data layer made a lot more sense
because you have a large company solving
real world problems with their api's by
using graph QL and they're handling the
part of changing people's minds right
like it's not even I don't even think
it's intentional like I don't think
anyone gave Li Byron a mandate to say
just go out there and evangelize all the
time to everybody so that this can
become like the future of like Web API
standards but it's definitely happening
because they certainly have a platform
where everyone's like well you know
they're scaling up to a certain level
and like I certainly don't need to scale
anywhere to that level but if this can
help fix some of the problems I'm seeing
or I might run into then it starts to
become an interesting technology and
like that's to me like you're just
trying to change people's opinions give
your technology a try and then it
becomes better for everyone that's
trying it because you know we're all
working together and hopefully building
something great and so I think that
that's another reason why I think you
should give graph QL look because I
don't think like I haven't necessarily
run across or heard any credible
alternatives that seemed to help and
solve a lot of problems that are out
there right now yeah other than Falkor
I think Falcon graph killer very similar
well I think a core needs more love it's
not as evangelized I guess but I think
it's it's simpler than graph QL
sometimes and it can be just as powerful
obviously Netflix is behind that it's
pretty cool yeah check them both out I
think they're both better than the rest
or for most things I mean almost
anything I can think of unless you're
doing like some super real-time stuff
but then you're still not using rests so
and now graph QL has subscriptions so
maybe just graph QL everything but I'm a
fan and yeah I think that's where
meteors heading yeah I'd love to ask
what you're so I know hobby wrote that
post on 10 tips getting off meteor and
you talked about a bunch I've talked a
bunch about DDP what would be your I
guess the best alternative or way of not
being as reliant on meteor when it comes
to the real time aspect and DDP like if
you had a move of a project my answer to
that is like I don't
I don't need real-time like I I guess I
look back and I think like what things
am i meeting real-time for right and
let's take foot cardigan for example
right there selling socks subscriptions
like maybe maybe you want a little bit
of real-time because you have a stock
inventory and like there's selling
subscriptions but they also sell like
one-off fun socks and maybe maybe we
want a real-time count of how many socks
are left or like how many of a size are
left and like you you think maybe like
the reason okay god just say it like you
have like three general things so if
you've ever kind of bought into cucumber
or looked at a and they're stuff like
you pop the Y stack and you try to think
about like why am I writing this feature
and generally comes down to like
managing costs increasing revenue or
protecting revenue and I think that the
hope there is that you're increasing
revenue by letting customers know like
hey you should buy now because it's
almost gone and like that's one little
feature I think I'd almost find a
different way to build it I don't know
what the alternative would be
necessarily I I haven't looked very
deeply to be honest because I just don't
don't know that it matters all that much
you know there's there's apps that
matter like uber for real time or like a
two-way chat but I'm not I'm not
entirely sold that you need it all the
time everywhere you know so I don't know
it's an interesting question I tend to
maybe rely on an outside service if I'm
gonna need that maybe you know yeah yeah
I was just curious I I have an app
that's just a little pet APIs it's a
little oxen thing and I I haven't put
much time into it but I've been thinking
about cuz I rented just weirdness with
the meteor tool because I I mean I was
on meteor one one and I just recently
upgraded it to
four so we're good now but it was just
like all this weirdness was happening
with one one and I was like it'd be nice
to do this to webpack and just play
around with some stuff but a meteor
account system is so nice as well as
just uh you know the instant real time
stuff I was like I know I know there's
like feathers I could roll my own with
just WebSockets but yeah I'm still
trying to figure that out so we'll see
yeah I really think I think in a long
term like the meteor development group
still sees real time as something that's
interesting I do think that the graph QL
team and apollo team will figure
something out and like that'll
definitely be an option down the road
and i mean if you look at or the early
days of DDP like it it's pseudo real
time right like that's the best way we
could describe it because we're not
we're not getting the data updates as
they change they were doing a poland if
so every 10 seconds they would look at
the data that the server was concerned
about that the client cared about and
repol it and see if anything change and
if it did they would feed that down the
pipe and I mean you could certainly look
at something like that I think you're
right feathers is maybe the most
interesting there as far as like if you
do need something real-time like that is
definitely a major goal of their project
for sure and so running at a time on
this episode but we did have some bonus
stuff that we'll just kind of mention I
think that are coming down the pipe
react fiber super interesting basically
they're they're reimplemented I believe
like the the way things get rendered in
the front end yeah
yeah they have a react a reconciler
which i think is a stack-based approach
so it's recursive which is why you get
all the really long like warnings and
errors and reacts where the dis the
stacks are like super long so those
should be shortened which i think is
cool and easier from from a deaf
perspective but it also should up the
performance a lot I'm gonna no inferno
I've seen people on the react team
mention if they were to make react from
scratch now they would have made
something very similar to inferno so
that's another kind of react library
implementation and I've seen people on
the react team talking about you know
2017 will be the year of your react
fibre as well as fiber implementations
so yeah it was really cool yeah it looks
super interesting and they just hired
the one of the guys that worked created
Inferno they hired on to Facebook and
I'm assuming he's gonna work on the
react team yeah so that'll be kind of
interesting to see what shakes out of
that and then I don't know like styling
is a huge question mark still like in
the JavaScript land like CSS and
JavaScript and style guy I don't I don't
even know all the options there's like
styled components yeah there's a bunch
of these just different using like
template strings and even inline Styles
and there's there's a yeah there's a lot
of debate yeah if you go to forget all
the people I follow a bunch of random
people on Twitter that all seem to
discuss this all the time it's a hot
topic people cannot decide on CSS
modules even so there's a bunch of fun
stuff there did a did Sean Larkin ever
tweet back at you check that real quick
and then I also got a Josh Owens have
you gone serverless email for crater
comp so crater conf is coming everyone
should check it out I'm super excited
about that we got one of the guys that
works for survey list so they got some
funding and he's gonna come give a talk
and nice we're excited about that
no no I didn't get any favorites or
anything from Shawn Morgan I did use the
hashtag webpack but it could be I don't
know what part of the world is it maybe
sleeping yeah it's also nears museum
cell yeah it's all good yeah you still
love you Shawn
all right well thanks for listening guys
and tuning in we will be back next year
doing this doing this podcast keeping it
up if if you find it interesting it was
a tweet let people know about the show
we don't advertise anywhere I actually
don't even have any advertisers for 2017
at this point so if you're interested
let me know and as always like keep
posting things the crater that's where
we're gonna be getting the news from for
each week so crater dot IO veneers yeah
same to you Ben alright guys bye so yep
