of the meteor apprentice recordings or a
series or I don't know what are you
called on youtube I guess the series
playlist have basically yeah I don't
know okay whatever you want to call it
will contact you so we're talking about
meteor club podcast and I have Kobe
Williams with me welcome Colby look up
good keep rolling on this thing I i
still haven't put any more out but um
I've got I made slightly more products
on the end slate stuff that I was
working on and I want to get that done
before post these so gonna try to get
that done so i can add YouTube
annotations easily but anyway let's
let's get into the show here let me
share my screen so one interesting thing
I found you know you and I were going
back and forth last time about like the
fact that hosting wasn't seeming to work
right and ssl was being forced and it
turns out that for meteor podcast itself
or not for a meteor club itself meteor
jazz club the engine X config that I
have about a wildcard cert and because
this is a sub-domain on the wildcard
cert is valid and applies and I put in
what was it called
I did it jist here because i was talking
to uh Stefan whole house about this cuz
I mean I used his ssl setup and
somewhere i got this ad header strict
Transport Security and it's got a bit in
here about including subdomains and so
it's room the problem only occurs if you
go to media jazz club and then go to a
podcast mediator Jas club you see the
problem because what it basically does
is it tells the browser's hey you should
only ever try to go to the HTTPS version
of this site and I was reading up on why
this is a thing and apparently it's to
thwart man-in-the-middle attacks as much
as you can so like if you go to your
bank they probably have this turned on
um so that when you type in you know
like I banga P&amp;amp;C when i type in pnc com
normally go to http but in reality if
they have this strict Transport Security
turned on the browser is going to know
if it's been there at least once that
it'll go to the HTTPS version and so by
having this includes subdomains were
it's automatically kicking all
subdomains over as well hmm that's
interesting yeah it is it's really
interesting um I had no idea that was
the thing and so like remember last week
like I kept was frustrated because I
cleared my cache and then I hadn't been
to meteor Jess that Club in a long time
and the other day I went and then all of
a sudden the problem came back no I'm
gonna get to the root cause of this and
yeah it definitely not something that's
intuitive you have that already kind of
yeah definitely but you know again i
bought a wildcard cert so in reality
what i could do is just put this thing
somewhere where i can turn on ssl and
then you know should be good to go right
now it's on Mediacom which I like and
it's been fun to pull you there but I
think I'm gonna have to move it again so
probably put it back yeah I mean
digitalocean
right it's always really slow when you
put on new year calm you know honestly
the slowness hasn't been the issue I
think the only thing is like they spin
it down when it's not right or people
haven't hit in a while and so that's
kind of slow because you'll get that let
me that made your loading thing yeah
interstitial page there that tells you
that it's loading the app which sucks
and then on top of that you get the
loading screen from the the publication
that says it's you know it's it's
loading or whenever double looting
double loading hell fine oh my god guys
look it's a double loading screen oh my
god ah forgot about that name yeah so
yes and we you know I forgot to mention
two we got another pull request from rob
oh and decided to ditch the custom audio
player and just added the the One X
button over here so we don't have the
rewind button we could probably build
that back at some point as well but now
we've got this it's more the standard
audio player what the 1x just kind of
tacked on at the end okay so instead of
the testimony had he went he reverted i
just added a little his own little thing
off to the side yeah little button at
the end of the audio player I mean he's
got all the controls in there and so I
he he said he thought the the Firefox
issue that we were seeing was related to
like resetting the timer 20 and somehow
that was Chrome Firefox up so what I
think you know in in all honesty ah it
still doesn't work right and huh yeah it
does work okay yeah it's working fine in
firefox now all right ignore me we're
good it just dumb IE i'm sure but i have
no way there oh hey sorry all you I
listeners I guess you think we're only
on iTunes anyway
so I mean you're somewhere in the apple
ecosystem most likely if you're
listening to the part all right so
discriminatory I i'd totally am yeah I
guess there's pod catchers in Google
land but I don't even know like why
don't we have four fri six Josh Windows
Phones des Vosges he had odd catchers
are those does anyone that watches this
have a windows phone I don't know I've
never met anyone who had a window foot
on I have I met one guy oh yeah and he
was he was kind of miffed because he he
went to church with me and differential
did that brave journey app for the
church I go to and they released the
Android version and the iphone version
but there was no windows phone version
he's like I can't use it cuz I was fun
he's like in it didn't write like
whatever version of ie he was on it
didn't look right there either so he was
like pretty much Sol I was like we
should install Chrome on your machine at
least and then you should be Hana use
the web right god what a caravan world
to live in yeah windows phone um so I
did I took to see him a little bit about
the testing stuff cuz that's kind of
where we left off yeah we got like our
hello world test running think yeah and
then you know what's funny is like I
went in I had to go in the other day and
change like our hello world was the test
to make sure this was here but then I
didn't notice the title of the page was
read your podcast and i go in i guess i
was getting ready for an official launch
i went in and changed the title of the
page which was the initial test intent
no no funny all right so I'm gonna tell
us window
so maybe we can get another test going
and then maybe we can work on like
Travis or something that might be
interesting as well oh yeah a continuous
mm-hmm so in talking let's see test
cucumber features so as a visitor I want
to see the podcast site for that I can
browse and share good podcast content I
guess I'm you just kind of like get used
to that that story yeah yeah you know
it's it's as the person that's going to
be doing the action right and you try to
get in that mindset of doing that like
as a visitor or as a admin right liked
it you just think about that rule like
what are they gonna have to do to
achieve that role right like I'm gonna
have to log in and I'm gonna have to be
like have admin permissions to get there
so that's kind of what you're defining
there is almost your role or something
like that and then I want to do
something and then you need to so people
that haven't heard it you need to pop
the Y stack which is like you're
drilling down and trying to find the
core reason you're building this feature
and now that i'm talking about it will
probably have to pop the y stack o at
the thing got it yeah it's totally a
thing um where's the initial 2009 that
still doesn't here we go
and they used to have this good um kind
of like log from IRC Oh like a chat yeah
talking about it yeah they updated the
site it looks nice at least um exactly
could be here now that's limey here huh
well can't spell no all right so we'll
just we'll look at this guy so basically
you're just asking why and you're trying
to get down to a core business value
which is protect revenue increase
revenue or manage costs right and so
when you're you're popping the why stack
at least five times trying to get down
to one of those core values and so if we
pop the why stack you know on a test it
tells you whether it's valuable or not
right like I need this test because I'm
either protecting revenue increasing
revenue or managing costs or not not so
much the test but maybe the future you
know and so mm-hmm um i think for me a
lot of this would either be a lot of
what I'm doing is either managing costs
or increasing revenue with a lot of
these tests because I'm trying to draw
in new listeners will then you know
topple into a funnel and be interested
in potentially a product that i've
created and and spent time working on
and could be helpful to them and you
know expose them to that maybe they buy
it maybe they don't you know so
yes a lot of that is you know kind of
along those lines um but yeah so like
what was it like they pop the why stack
on like i'll log in i really wish i
could find that now pop what's uh so
just uh basically like a chat that
they're having about about the whole
concept yeah oh there's no that was the
link that you were looking for yep
totally was totals no one it's gone
forever if gift all right yeah so I mean
I would say that this is probably like
increasing revenue this one because like
we're ensuring that we have proper like
a page is loading we're seeing the right
text on the page and that relates back
to google SEO and and that kind of thing
so when people type like podcast meteor
jas we want to pop up there you know and
so having this h1 tag or h2 tag is kind
of important um alright and so what else
would be important here or do we want to
make sure I think that the first thing
is we want to make sure if we have an
episode it's going to load that episode
oh so we need to be like we know we want
to make sure I guess when they come to
the page the they they see the most
recent episode loaded at the top I
default that are some like that uh yeah
yeah probably something along those
lines but I so this is where you start
to get into test boundaries which I
mentioned last time and it's like if you
think about it logically there's our
application and
there's simple cast api that were
relying on right and the thing about
that is we need to basically stub out
the simple cast part of it and so a stub
is a standing replacement for something
and in unit testing you might stub out
like another class or another collection
or something along those lines because
you're just trying to test this one
piece over here but when we're in
end-to-end testing we want to test
number one as much as we can but at the
same time we want to assume that we're
not going to necessarily have internet
access so we want to test the things
that are under our test per view so
everything kind of our control we can't
control if if their servers go down with
already told art that is working right
right um and so that's why we need some
kind of stuff in there so in the server
is it here yeah so here's where you add
the synced cron and then here is where
what do we call fetch an insert episode
so this guy kicks off and then calls all
these guys right and so we just need to
figure out a way to basically stub out
probably this initial guy and just
insert our own data there and then what
you do here is you could do like for
this particular file on the right which
is doing the Synchron you write a unit
test that's making sure that everything
works properly and you could even the
Sam's got a faker library that you can
use I'm not faker but a HTTP interceptor
which you might be able to use in that
case and start writing the unit tests on
on this this particular file but I don't
know if that's where we want to start
like it's functioning it's okay well we
probably do want test at some point but
I don't know if they're high value right
now just because it works and we're not
gonna be monkeying there a whole lot but
we do need to figure out a way to stub
out that method
so this is where fixtures come in come
our fixtures so you're creating a
fixtures file in the cucumber folder
yeah i'm gonna make a new one though i'm
not gonna use this one that came by
default hmm fixtures so it'll load when
you're in it'll load everything in that
folder yeah hm Jess copy this bench and
insert episodes well this has a youth
trick in it it did that's just how Sam
codes I think he's very particular about
his JavaScript haha uh yeah so like if
you load like a jail in Turin code that
i write it screams loudly haha which I
you know maybe he's the best practice as
well to like come up with a lint file
you're cool with and check that into
your projects and part of your test bill
can actually be to run lint make sure
everything looks good then run you know
your test environment make sure all that
looks good and that's a good way to like
have that no broken windows policy like
if everyone is adhering to the rules and
making sure that builds always green and
you know I think your that's a good
culture to build yeah especially on
those projects are going to be getting
bigger and a lot more people using oh my
looking to
that's about using I guess a lot of
using es Flint I think oh it has some
more like custom policy type stuff yeah
yeah so I've got I do have the lint
stuff installed into them so you can see
like if i say this file and it's missing
something it throws the air there on the
left the double arrows yeah that's all
i've got i don't have the use strict
thing but I yeah so if you if you throw
a dot Jess lint into the end of the
folder it'll read that and it'll it'll
follow the guidelines you give it ok
that's everything yeah so it's just it's
basically running jslint in the folder
every time I hit save that's how that's
yeah and Jess lint will look for that
file so given new visitor navigate just
to the title so basically I just made my
own meteor method over here called fetch
and insert episodes mm-hmm no way you
can stop it out yeah I'm hoping it'll
override it and I just put a console log
in there an episode would be inserted I
don't see it fire yeah I don't make does
it like every half hour or something
right wha but it should have restarted
oh it didn't that's interesting it
didn't restart so I think when I save
this server file oops so we'll just
we'll put these in here so we can kind
of see which one it's running so now
it's rebuilding that's interesting so it
didn't rebuild because the fixtures
aren't being watched i guess oh there
you go so yeah over here we're getting
petrol episodes but over here hopefully
we're seeing that it was stubbed out
doesn't like it not seeing either here
well the other thing we can do is just
fire up the mirror and see what it looks
like to preferably it'll just be blank
right hmm but it's not mom weird is it
even is it like loading that file in uh
you know what is it didn't reach that
whenever you made a change so the the
reason he's got that reset in there he's
gonna find this so interesting when I
put it up who probably watches will be
laughing at us um not really nude so
this I don't know if this is called but
this is where you probably want to do
something like um episodes we're gonna
call they're just media have a way to
just like reset the entire collection uh
me eerie setting well no just more of
like a collection like remove all for a
collection for like one specific
collection yeah i think if we issue a
remove without a selector it would
remove everything good question i think
you can I've seen how to do that like
because you can do that with like your
fixture file where I'm neither I've done
it before I just don't remember yeah I
remember the but yeah there's definitely
yeah I'm pretty sure you just do it like
that yeah and then we need to call that
somehow yeah that's it it's removing
then I think yet to put object in there
the little empty object instead the
remove parentheses I don't know if you
need that or not I just no no I think
just leaving a blank would do it okay
was just flicking it with this other
dated was doing something like big death
light post right here he does of this
dot server doc all reset so given i am a
new visitor right here this background
task this runs a background task runs
before every every scenario within the
file right okay so that's gonna actually
that should empty out the database for
us this favor call okay well empty is a
test database and then run our fixtures
that we have set up right should but
clearly it's not clearly so what I saw
that easy way the way it works right now
I think Ron will run like immediately on
startup so it's probably pulling in all
the data even though it just resets it
once was empty
yeah that doesn't make sense though I
mean it in all honesty theoretically
this think cron should run before I
don't know I guess
why is our fixture not overriding yeah
that's the real question because you
you've written unless unless the picture
you wrote is like loaded up into the
code before the synchrotron thing I
don't know which order that's loaded up
you know yeah hmm so I asked my shoes on
yeah yeah maybe you're right so if the
fixture loads first and then the other
one lives it's overriding in yeah you
can always try to like comment out the
correct one just as the test to see if
that even is true x yeah yeah total so
thinking of it yeah well throw an air I
don't know yeah yeah that'll work no how
long cuz it's trying to call it on
startup so we'll have to yeah will
comment this guy out that'll fix it
cacique Ron I'll give us an hour before
it throws an air yeah there we go
you see the I don't pay it I stay yeah I
still don't see how long though well
okay so you subbed out the thing but now
we're not calling it all cuz you comment
out the when it calls it um it's a good
point so it's not yeah yeah it's totally
not applying that into if it I get
something technically it should air out
on the live one but not on the test one
right right yeah okay that's a that's a
fair point yeah but I don't know if the
meaner will start because it's gonna
exit with the code yeah dang yeah and
while I'm and we can try see if it'll
start the mirror where's the mirror
starting happen oh let's say killing it
to me nope hmm so I'll just like this is
indicative of testing a lot of times for
me like just playing around and trying
to figure out the right way to stuff
something or yeah i guess if we were
doing this more consistently yeah maybe
used to it yeah for sure yeah like I'm
guessing like Jonas is or Sam would
probably get this done a lot faster
knots all right that family they need to
be the needed during a printer series
were they were their predators to them
huh yeah there's only general and we're
done and all they they were a
testing media
honestly this is what I stopped writing
the book cause it's like you know I had
a lot of this figured out before and now
cucumber is completely changed yeah
that's a lot of work yeah I would have
been so at this point I would be on my
third rewrite of the cucumber chapter if
I were still writing the book oh yeah
hated that many time yeah someone else
made an original cucumber and then he
disappeared and then sam took it up and
I there would have been a second rewrite
for that because I actually had the the
entire chapter was done that was the one
I had under my belt and then fam would
have rewritten it and I would have had
to rewrite all the content for that um
which one terrible but then like he's
since rewritten everything again it's
been kind of a drastic change okay so
hopefully hopefully he'll get it more
consistent i know i was actually reading
a opposed i know some people were
complaining about like the testing
situation in media or yeah with was like
all the different options was not like
one consistent approach that people are
using yet i mean honestly like having
been part of that early conversation a
lot of people were concerned that you
know there'd be favourites or you know
like so i think everybody likes mocha
but at the same time yonas has been
working on jasmine and yonas has more
time to work on jasmine and so I think
Jasmine's actually further along but
mocha is more widely accepted outside of
the meteor community so like it's like
yeah it's it's weird I think if you
asked mdg their preference would be to
have mocha like get better and be the
one because it's got such a big
community behind it but at the same time
like it's just mike by himself and he
puts timing on it when he can you know
about stuff top half yeah and definitely
hmm
oh my my next meeting cancelled so we
can go we can be in pain a little bit
longer here huh alright so hows could we
possibly stub this um see this curious
as to why though what's not maybe
there's some clue when they read me yeah
oh wait it tells me to buy a book I've
got the book haha I'm Justin he doesn't
maybe does have an update for it oh I
think our fixtures are I think there's a
difference between us stubbing the code
and where our fixtures are being applied
maybe I don't know you think they'll
like the puller I don't know how to like
verbalize that correctly though it's the
fact that I think their codes not ending
up where we think it's ending up I guess
is what I'm saying yeah yeah I mean I
sled getting the impression just because
it was a load over type thing but I mean
also you saved it and you didn't it it
didn't refresh so I don't know that's
because from
asura call server-side method and test
response with an assert let's take this
let's try this stuff right here okay and
let's let's put uh okay we got to leave
that comment about what we do we want to
call it down here haha yes I guess we're
not even sure what we want here are we
you wanna already up out method oops so
so loading upload data i navigate I
should see the featured episode the page
 load for visitors mariya pardon
all right um so we should get our output
right here we can put that into our
simple steps dan great you're that I'll
back that pending where's that oh okay
function call by well you have to type
in pace yeah can you like turn the motor
on by the phone i can give you my
shortcut that i push a button in it
taste oh nice okay i guess that makes
sense i'll help you with that later yeah
I don't know if you're if you tried out
that window code no I didn't that's what
i was saying earlier like I resized it
manually yeah lets you I I have to have
a yak shaving dated some Winkle we but
yeah you need to set up a sack yak
saving day and I'll help you with your
yaks don't pay me money vanda yeah all
right oh man it's hot in here I know I
ran but first day first world problems
right like I gotta I gotta load my nest
and tell it to cool down my office man
we had a mess but then a lightning hit
it and knock it out really that sucks
yeah knock out a router and our nets at
the same time uh I'm a fun house like if
lightning hit like I lose I actually
have tuna so we bought it an old duplex
and we've got like two AC units right
outside here we've got two furnaces down
in the basement and we have two
electrical panels coming into the house
oh yeah rough so I don't know if you
guys are getting anywhere near that of
rain is like here we are in Texas no we
had we got the last of the tropical
storm Bob blew through on Friday and
Saturday we probably got like five six
seven eight inches of rain tomorrow
night but probably nowhere near as bad
as you all right ah so here I think we
want to call that fetch and insert
bustle mashup and just kind of see what
happens so this client execute a think
that's what it's there mr. not defined
well did something why is this ur not
defined are you kidding me that I did
allowed lapping out look at that do we
need to like do is it okay first of all
worth it I i think is uh right there his
dog fur out of and right here he's
talking about should become so you get
chai which gets this by default I think
yeah we have to tell it to use the
assert his dog gotta hurt yeah so we
could say I should equal I prefer that
anyway um mmm-hmm so be like res valued
should equal yes yeah yeah i think that
reads cleaner anyway
bah wah wah yeah so our result of null
are we don't have any the value is
definitely nothing oh yeah it well we
have a result but not about you yeah so
right here we could just come yeah I log
it out yeah i'm guessing what we're
getting an error but we're not testing
for that where do we oh no heirs null
that's interesting alright so that's
wrong so what's rizz where are you
kicking the same here okay so the value
is definitely know the status is zero
and we have a session ID so it made a
call putting get anything back hmm in
reality what we want to see is something
logged out into the logs ideally so what
you have that log in there that's the
cucumber log it's not the only long
weekend yeah huh we oh man dang it all
right I tell you what let's get someone
to books with Sam yeah I felt like a
great idea maybe we'll have him come in
and help us for maybe even a half hour
and get past this first real jacket we
can probably make a lot of progress just
by having him alright so we'll stick a
pin in it I think the major goal for me
this week is going to be moving the site
and then we'll see maybe even get Sam to
do something like thursday friday maybe
a little later in afternoon our time
because he's in pacific I know yeah I
think he's actually moving so um maybe
this week will be bad oh if he can't
help us I'll lessee if I
right up the problem and he can point us
in the right direction or something
right a good plan apprenticed on the
apprentice series mana let about got it
got alone yep all right dude oh thanks
for uh I don't know not learning with me
learning with me that's fully completing
anything I don't little head there hard
yeah you're all right well you know once
these go up I'll put them up weekly so
tune in next week and maybe we'll make
even better progress hmm right alright
