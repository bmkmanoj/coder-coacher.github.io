big thank you to all the speakers that
took time to give these talks hopefully
you enjoy this video series and also be
on the lookout you can go to created on
Io to get all the latest JavaScript news
and you can also follow me on Twitter
add Josh Owens and we've got some other
exciting stuff coming up in 2017 thanks
enjoy the video today we have Wes boss
with us welcome wife thank you thank you
so I you know I feel like I should
introduce you but probably everybody
knows you right because you're the
famous offender now my chocolate chip
yeah
but if you're unaware Wes has several
paid and free courses I would highly
recommend checking them out his most
recent one is JavaScript 30 it's pretty
I'll let you take you away from here
awesome thanks Josh hello everybody
thanks for coming out and really excited
to be here I've never given this one
online before so hopefully it goes well
so my name is Wes bas I'm from Canada
and I'll tweet out a link to the slides
I'll post them in the chat up here if
you're looking for them I'm a creator of
a series called es6 for everyone which
is just a 66 video course that just gets
down into the nitty gritty into every
single part of es6 and all the little
different bits and pieces so if you want
to check that out at the es6 for
everyone or es6 io is the domain name i
also have a course on react i've got a
book on sublime I've got some free
courses on command line flexbox I got
all kinds of stuff if you're interested
in checking it out but today I'm here to
talk to you about ESX and ESXi Oh
scrappy the most recent update to
JavaScript and it was just a massive
update included all kinds of stuff
there's many years in the making
and I'm just going to go through some of
the pieces that I think are helpful
obviously can't go into it all but I'm
just going to sort of rattle through a
whole bunch of stuff in along the way I
probably like I knew that already but
hopefully you pick up like one or two or
seven little tidbits that you can start
putting into putting into work right
away so to start with things that our
life makers things that make life so
much better and that is the two new
types of variables which is let and cons
so some people say you should never use
var again it's a bit of an opinion there
doesn't really matter all that much but
what I'm going to do here is I'm gonna
explain exactly what's going on with
those things
slashing thank you chat I think we lost
your audio with can you still hear me oh
there you go yeah okay cool
sorry I just popped open the chat people
are saying stuff yeah if you want to
heckle me in the chat please go for it
so we'll also collect questions in the
Q&amp;amp;A part of the app as well and we'll do
those at the end so awesome so there's
two new ways that you can declare
variables in JavaScript that's let in
Const both of them are something called
block scoped so let's take a look at an
example of the traditional scoping in
JavaScript which is function scoping so
if I create a dog variable right here
and then I have a function that has
another dog variable and I run that
function dog is going to be equal to
thicker x' because this of our dog is
scoped to this function here and thus
global scope dog is what's going to be
console.log door alerted when we run it
now in letting Const block scope is
whenever you have a set of curly
brackets that's what a block is in
JavaScript so if I've got an if
statement here and I create a sentence
variable here that makes them just makes
a string and then I try to console.log
it inside it will work but if I try
console.log it outside it's going to be
not it's not going to be a variable and
the reason is because when you declare a
variable inside of a block set of curly
brackets then you can go ahead and it
will be scoped to that block even though
it's not a function here that's helpful
so that is really helpful in general
people say use Const unless you need to
reassign the variable talk about that in
just a second but there is a very handy
use of let where if you traditionally be
using a bar in this case so here's an
example of your traditional for loop
where we're looping from 1 to 9 in
console logging I am one years old two
years old three years old etc Center
right so we understand what's going on
here now what is that going to give us
if we were to run that in the console
well it's going to say I am one years
old two years old etc etc just as we
expected however once we're done we have
this age variable that set to ten so
first we have this like global age
variable that sort of leaked outside of
this for loop because this is a for loop
not a function meaning that this age
variable is going to leak outside and
then also it's 10 because it reaches 10
and actually doesn't meet the condition
in your for loop so that sounds ok it's
kind of weird that we have that like age
variable that just like leaked out and
that might bite us in the butt sometimes
later but um what happens if you were to
try access that age variable after some
amount of time so the classic example
here is if you like to fire off a couple
Ajax requests and then after they come
back you need to access that variable
into which it was fired off with so in
here I'm just setting out setting a
timeout and after 200 milliseconds
what's going to happen
well we've got I am ten years old nine
times so what's happening is that this
four loop is running nine times over but
by the time that we get to the
console.log this four loop is over and
the age variable keeps getting
overwritten every single time it's not
really something thats a bit of a pain
for us since we can't access it and
previously what you'd have to do is you
have to do like an iffy where you pass a
variable in and you make a look a little
closure but it's there for you however
what we can do here is just change our
var when we use a for loop to let and
because let is block scoped see this the
slow curly brackets it's going to scope
the age variable to each of the loop
iterations here so no matter when we
actually call that age variable it's
going to be equal to whatever it was
when that block was run it's not going
to constantly overwrite that global age
variable then as an added benefit you
don't have that age variable that like
that leaks outside of your loop so we
get one through nine we don't have a ten
anywhere we don't have a global age
variable
so cost is exactly like let it's block
scope like we just looked at however the
one difference with causes that
Constable's cannot be changed kinda
that's the idea is that it's a constant
so they can't be changed on purpose so
if you were to create a Const and set it
to something and try to update it it
would throw an error or it cannot be
done accidentally and this is actually
true for both let and cons if you try to
read eclair that variable in the same
scope twice it's going to throw you an
error because it already been declared
so it's still block scoped but people
think maybe come in from different
languages maybe they assume since it's
as constant means they will never change
but that does not mean that it is
immutable so let's take a look and this
is especially the case when you're
dealing with objects and arrays so here
have got a baby us I was born and when I
was born when my parents created an
object and they put an age on it I was 0
when I was born I don't know about you
and I was 7 something pounds probably
and my hair color was brown now over
time properties about me change so I
have my age change my hair color change
my weight changed all of the properties
about me had changed but by using Const
mean make sure that we cannot wipe
myself out because I'm still the same
person I was when I was born I'm still
that same object the properties on me
cannot be changed so we can't
accidentally overwrite Wes
we can't accidentally wipe it out with a
blank object we can't accidentally wipe
it out when a new wes is born so by
using cons and make sure that we cannot
wipe out the reference to that array or
object but properties inside of it can
change there's something called object
out freeze if you actually need to
freeze all the properties in your object
or your array make sure that nothing in
there changes that's object out freeze
that's what you want that case so let's
talk about something called template
strings or template literals and I love
these because everybody sucks at
concatenation so we have single quotes
we've got double quotes and now in
JavaScript we have what are called
backtick
which are our third way to declare
strings however they're sort of like
super strings in that we can do a little
bit more with them than our traditional
stuff so the old way that used to
concatenate variables into a string was
you would have to do something like this
my name is you end the quote you
concatenate in the variable you
concatenate in the new string you open
the quote and often you screw that up if
you forget one of the quotes or one of
the pluses and then you do this huge
long template string or this long string
and it tells you the errors like on line
one clearly it's on that but somewhere
somewhere in that you actually goofed it
up so with es6 you can now just
interpolate your variables right inside
of the value and if you've done any
other language before you're like okay
we have this like forty years ago in my
language JavaScript as an add it so um
we now have the ability to use dollar
sign curly brackets and that's the
syntax to say I am interpolating this
actual JavaScript in this case we're
popping a variable right inside of our
sentence right here
um but you can also do a whole bunch of
other stuff rather than just popping in
a variable I know in PHP if use double
quotes you can just pop a variable in
but with JavaScript you can run any
JavaScript inside of those curly
brackets so you can go ahead and do some
multiplication if you want you can run a
function that will return to you a
number or a string and it will
interpolate the return value into your
string I it's super handy or when you're
creating HTML and I've been using this
quite a bit lately so let's say I've got
this object which is a person and we've
got a name a job a city of bio all
numbers right we've all got this object
before back from an API
well one nice thing about template
literals is that they are multi-line
without having to do that annoying
forward slash at the end of every single
line so here I've just opened it up and
then I've written all of my HTML inside
of that div with a class of person as
templated out mine and I pop in my
person name my job my city my bio and
then we pop that into your document now
as with anything if you are creating
HTML from data that comes from external
source make sure you stand Faiz at first
because if this was coming from an API
or someone's bio where they had an image
with the script tags I know obviously
that would be bad but here I'm popping
it right away in
so what's cool about this is that
javascript is a templating language now
so let's take a look at some of the
different parts of a templating language
that you might have
looping it's the first one so I've got
an array of dogs here where each dog in
the array is an object or each dog has
the name and an age and then I've taken
the dogs array and I've mapped over that
and what does map do map takes in an
array of something it returns you a new
array of something else so in this case
I'm taking an in an array of objects I'm
mapping over it's giving me dog and then
we are returning a list item with the
dog named dog de-age times 7 and then
finally at the end because that's still
going to return you an array and if you
put if you try to put it in an array
into HTML you'll get the little commas
in between each item so if you join it
on the end that will put it in
so we get at the end of the day where
we've generated all of our HTML by
mapping over each one
now how do you do if statements and and
by the way if these look familiar it's
because this is exactly how we do
templating in react as well because we
don't have any sort of logic in react in
JSX
we just have JavaScript at our disposal
so let's say we've got this song object
here we've got a name and artist and
then sometimes so sometimes you get a
featuring property on that object and if
there is a featuring property on that
object you want to put in featuring
Biggie Smalls so what we do here is you
give yourself a back tick you put in
your regular paragraph tag with the name
and the artist and then we'll do a
little shorthand if Turner I can never
say this ternary operator song that
featuring if that is true then we do
featuring songs are featuring otherwise
we return null and that will not put
null into your HTML that would just give
you nothing
everyone's talking about my code editor
spot it's operator mano
everybody asks
now what's cool about this that you can
use render functions just like we do in
react so here I've got a beer object
where it's got a name done a brewery and
then I've got a bunch of keywords inside
of that and and it's fine to put the
beer name in the beer brewery inside of
that now what
I want to do is I don't really want to
do the map right inside of here because
like that's getting a little bit hairy
for me so what I'll do is I'll shell off
the the looping of those keywords to a
separate render function so I'm just
running a function called render
keywords we'll look at that in a second
you pass it your array remember this was
an array of keywords here and then we'll
go on the next slide here's our function
called render keywords which will in
turn loop over each of the keywords and
return a list item for each of those
I've just shelled it off to a separate
function
another cool thing about es6 is
something called default function
arguments
uh so we've got a function here called
calculate bill and every time I do this
talk I think about this like short
stubby chubby little western man called
calculate bill and he goes around with
two guns because I calculate bill so I
hope your classic Leslie gets layers um
you pass in the price obviously and then
you want to calculate the tax in the tip
and in Ontario where I live
the default tax rate is 13% and the the
general accepted tip is 15% so those are
like defaults that I want to set in and
if they are not passed in I want to fall
back to those values values so when you
define the default when you define the
arguments or the parameters that are
going to be placed in you can also set
what they will fall back to if they are
not past it so here I can go ahead and
just pass in the defaults I can pass and
override it with my own defaults five
percent tax rate twenty percent tip rate
or and this is a little bit weird but if
you want to leave just one of them out
then you have to explicitly pass in
undefined as as the actual value you
can't just pass in nothing you cannot
pass in null you can't pass in false you
can't pass in empty string
all of those policy values that you are
used to having passed in is not what you
want because it an empty string is still
it is still an argument so you need to
explicitly pass in undefined
alright let's heat it up a little bit
let's talk about sign called arrow
functions
so we've got here an array of name and
this is just yes five so I'm just going
to make sure that we understand exactly
what's going on and then we're going to
kind of refactor it together but we've
got an array of names and for each of
those names I want to put boss on the
end so I want say West boss kate boss
and lux boss
so I take the names I map over it I give
it a function which gives me the single
name and from that I return that name
West cater Lux plus the word boss okay
everyone get it this is what we're doing
here now um how do you convert to an
arrow function well first you take the
word function and you replace it with an
arrow on the right hand side so delete
the word function but it equals an angle
bracket and that will turn it into an
arrow function so that's the first thing
that we're doing and that's just the
concise syntax then if you have a single
argument you can lose the parentheses
around it
so here I've gotten the name is the only
argument that we have so you can remove
it some people prefer to leave it on
just because it looks a little bit
better to them or like if you add a
second parameter in the future you don't
have to add them in as well that's just
personal preference you choose what
whatever works for you but in this case
I'm removing the parentheses because
single arguments are not needed and
often you'll see like a hotshot coder do
something like that
and it won't look like a function
because it's just a bunch of text and
the arrow but that's exactly what that
is
has something called implicit returns Oh
hold on what's explicit return explicit
return is when you type the word return
and then you return whatever it is that
you want to return for the function now
implicit return is when you are
returning without having the keyword
return so if you lose the curly brackets
the block of the function
and you can lose the return function
that is implicitly returning and all too
often you're coding these short little
functions where you're simply just
taking something in and returning
something immediately especially with
map filter reduce all these array
methods where they're just one-liners
well from that what we can do is release
the block of the function and delete the
word return and whatever you right after
the arrow function will be implicit
return which means it will be returned
and sort yeah Ryan Birgit just lighten
up that chat room good job bud what if
you have multiple arguments well
multiple arguments like let's say you
need the index for that map well then
you have to put parentheses around it
and pass it just like that if you have
no arguments like if you have a set
timeout where you're not passing any
arguments there you just give yourself
an empty set of parentheses or you can
you can really put anything that you
want there there was there's a while
where people were just putting an
underscore so like it's like giving up
the character to undefined just so that
they don't put it there but I much
prefer to put an empty set of
parentheses there because it looks like
a function
ah mods I didn't know that implicit
return is so cool right on Buzz
so what if you want to implicit return
an object
well the curly brackets means that it's
a function block so how do you return
curly brackets if it's an object literal
well if that is the case where you
actually want to implicit Li return an
object you have to put some parentheses
around the thing and then that will kick
in your order of operations for you and
it will return object for you
now all of that stuff was just syntactic
sugar meaning that it didn't really add
any new functionality it was just
allowing us to write our functions in a
bit of a shorter format however there
also is a major difference with arrow
functions is how it handles the keyword
this so with arrow functions the value
of this does not change so you know that
every time you enter into a new function
the value of this will be bound to
whatever it's being called against or if
it's nothing it will be the window so
with an arrow function the value of this
doesn't change it doesn't change in the
function and it will inherit it from
whatever the parent scope is so let's
take a look at some example here again
this is not es6 but let's just
understand what's going on here
I've got like a card I selected a card
with Gore selector and then I'm going to
wait for somebody to click that and when
they click it I want to add a class of
closing which is immediately and then a
second later which is why I'm using set
timeout I want to add a class of closed
so we open the function here's a regular
function here we say this and what this
is going to be equal to the card the
class was to add closing and then we run
a set timeout with a new function ah so
when I have that this is entering
weren't entering into a new function
with set timeout and this is now going
to be equal to whatever it was called
against and in our case it's window set
timeout so this is going to be equal to
the window so how do you access the card
from inside of the set timeout well you
can unless you do some of these tricks
that we used to do where you say self
equals this or underscore that equals
this or underscore this equals this you
just sort of store it in a variable
and then in the scope that you need it
you then reference it so you sort of
have to cash it in a variable for
yourself but
that's not great because you have to
create a new variable now what we can do
in our case is simply just take that
function change it to an arrow function
and now we're off to the races and it
will just work why because when you have
an arrow function the value of this does
not change and it gets inherited from
the parent so it's sort of like if you
are familiar with CSS and you know how
if you position:absolute something and
you put like a top or right a bottom or
left value on it it will then look for
the nearest relative parent to get its
values from we're exactly the same way
where it will sort of just keep going up
the chain until it finds a parent
function or a regular function to base
its this value off of
enhance object literals so there's a
couple new things when you're creating
an object literals if you have the same
name properties so how many times have
you done this you got a whole bunch of
variables to deal with and you need to
put them in an object so you do
something like first first last last age
age breathe breathe right you're right
you're right the same thing over and
over
however with es6 if the property name
and the variable that you are putting
into the object are the same thing like
the property is going to be first and
the variable is first you simply just
type the variable and it will inherit or
assume the name from the actual variable
there and then if you have other things
where the property name is not the same
you just use it as a regular object
um let's talk about method definitions
so you got a you have an object with a
whole bunch of methods on it and if you
want to rename those you just simply
delete the word function take out the
colon and that is still a proper
function I see a lot of people changing
their their methods over to arrow
functions because it's shorter but if
not what you want to do in a lot of
cases because you need it to be bound to
that instance so what we're doing here
is we're just we're still this is still
a proper function this is not anything
changing with this but it's just a
shorter way to actually write it without
having to type out the word function
I'm tooling I'm just watching the chat
here and it seems like a lot of you know
about Babel already so I'll go over this
fairly quickly but um if you want to
write es6 today you can write almost all
of it and transpile it down into
whatever it is that your browser is
compatible with so we use Babel or Babel
its Babel
it's supposed to be babbled
um so you take in your syntax it will
convert it to whatever it is the
equivalent in your es5 you can also
decide which pieces get compiled down
because a lot of the browsers now or all
of the latest browsers support all the
vo6 so in some cases if you're
supporting facilities browsers you don't
necessarily need to compile it all down
if it's new features so things like
promises sets in maps these are these
aren't syntax changes these are these
are actual features in the browser so
you need to use a polyfill in that case
so there's a Babel polyfill out there
there's another one called polyfill
Daioh which will feature detect your
browser and just inject the ones that
you need that one's really nice as well
you sort of just have to go along with
whatever it is that you you need to
support there's a couple things in es6
that are unbelievable and untranslated
symbols parts of subclasses some of this
like more like dependi stuff where if
you're using it you probably already
know that this isn't supported yet but
we all have to wait until you drop older
browsers that do not support those
things but for almost everything I'm
talking about today or everything I'm
talking about today and you can
transpile it down into your regular code
now let's talk about depend and D
structuring these structuring is one of
my favorite parts of es6 it covers I
think as like six videos on it it just
covers all kinds of stuff it covers a
whole bunch of different parts of
working with objects and arrays so let's
look at it
so put simply the structuring allows us
to create and assign multiple variables
in a single line of code
it works with objects and right so here
we go we've got a person variable which
has it first alas a country a city and a
Twitter and it chances are like if you
ever templating with an object
especially if it's a deeply nested
object you just like to put them into
their own variables so that your your
template doesn't sort of get out of hand
so you might have done this before so
first equals person that first 200 calls
person at Twitter City equals person dot
city and then your console.log all those
variables right you just make a whole
bunch of variables and then you well
with you structuring you can use the
curly bracket syntax this is not an
object this is B structuring curly
bracket bracket syntax where you say
cause first Twitter and city so we're
making three variables here equals
person and that what that's going to do
is it's going to check if there's a
person dot first and put it into the
first variable check if there's a person
dot Twitter put it into Twitter variable
check if there's a person dot city put
it into the city variable so we just
made three variables in one line of code
now this is especially helpful when you
get data back from an API where it's
super nested super deeply nested so what
we could do is you can just D structure
Westall links that's social and you can
pull out Twitter and Facebook out of
that nested one into its own variables
so that your templates don't look like
Wescott links that social twitter or
even worse often it's like data dot
results 0.0 miss and it's just method in
infinitely you can also rename them so
chances are you might run into a
situation where if you're trying to be
structure into a variable call Twitter
that might not work because you already
have a variable called Twitter and it's
not your fault that the property is
called Twitter so in this case we can
take the property call Twitter put it
into a variable called tweet take the
property called Facebook put it into a
variable called SB
you can also fall back to values so here
I have a Wes and a boss first and last
but there's no middle so if I were to
try D structure or something that does
not exist it will be undefined but in
this case I'm setting a fallback value
to killer and in that case it's going to
say west killer boss when I come to log
all three of those values because it
will fall back now you can get really
nuts with this and actually both rename
and do fallback values so I'm going to D
structure the middle property into a
variable called middle name and if
middle name if the middle property does
not exist on person fall back to a
string of Twitter and you can also do
this with nested objects where you can
be structure nested values well so that
was with objects you can also do this
with working with arrays so here I've
got details equals and this is common if
you're working with like a CSV you're
getting data from someone in corporate
as a spreadsheet and they give it to you
and you need to do structure those into
their own variables well you know the
first thing is the name the second thing
is the ID and the third thing is their
website so you just be structure the
first thing the second thing in the
third thing so if you do structure an
array it is based on index
whereas do structuring an object is
based on property
you can also swap values with these
structuring so if you have you ever had
like two variables main this need to
switch the values with them so here you
have somebody who's current and someone
who's benched maybe I don't know
anything about sports but maybe
someone's playing a sport where there's
a bench and then there's someone that's
playing the sport and you want to switch
them now so what you have to do is you
have to make a third variable it's like
a holder variable you set the holder to
current the bench to current the current
to holder and you're like what what is
going on here so what you can do now is
you can swap the values by destructuring
and you make an array with that the
values in the opposite order that you
want so current is going to be bench and
bench is going to be current and they
will switch those two for you
return multiple values from a function
here we have a convert currency function
which will take in an amount so say a
hundred bucks and it's going to convert
that to us GBP AUD and NEX and it's
going to return to you an object of
converted currencies previously what
we'd have to do is we'd convert it with
passing 100 and convert it to a race
object and then we'd access the
properties on each of those so rates
that USD however now with the
structuring you can just be structure
them into their own variables as you
want
so because convert currency returns an
object you can be structure into USD GBP
ad and MDX and then they will have their
own variables now what's really cool
about that is that you can just pick and
choose the pieces that you want so here
I'm converting currency and then I'm
just picking the AUD and USD properties
off of that object into their own
variables and the other ones get garbage
collected now next up we have something
called sets sets and JavaScript are sort
of like the arrays that you've always
wanted
so a set in ESX is like a unique array
so it is absolutely unique values with a
nice API for adding or removing and
checking item so I think back to when
you are first learning JavaScript and
somebody told you about pop shift
unshift slice splice and all of these
different array methods you're like how
will I ever remember that and some of
them are inclusive and exclusive and
it's a little bit confusing to work with
the race well the set API is just
beautiful to work with so here I've got
a set and I'm going to add west Snickers
and Cait or what you can do is you can
pass a you can create a new set and pass
it in iterable so anything you can
iterate over in this case I'm passing it
an array and that will turn it into a
set cool thing about that is if I try to
add the same item again so in this case
I'm trying to add a a string of wes it
will make it unique and it will just it
will not take that extra wes I'll say
well that's already in here so why would
I add that again and actually that's
kind of a nice little way is if you ever
wanted to filter an array for just
unique values you could just pass it
into a set and then put it back into an
array I'm not sure there's probably a
better performant ways to do it but if
you turn an array into a set it will
just deduce any duplicates that you have
in that values
now you can delete things with bypassing
it the value that you want to delete you
can check the size by saying that size
you can empty the entire set with dot
clear
check if an item is in there by saying
dot has there's no index of or includes
just that has and that will return true
or false you can loop over it with the
new es x4 of so not for in but for of
so-called student of students new
cultural log the student in there
you can put anything into a set so I was
just using strings there but in this
case I put a object-- into my set I've
checked if it's in there and I've
deleted it
now how people ask me every time I do
this talk does that mean it does a deep
check on the object that's not the case
if I had two objects that were separate
objects but have the same first in ID
values on them those are still two
separate values because there are two
different objects so it doesn't do a
deep check of the values in the object
it just does reference to the actual
object inside of it
whoo so that was a lot es sex is just
jam-packed with all kinds of stuff but
I've just scratched the surface in terms
of what we could possibly be doing with
all of this stuff but you better hurry
up because es7 is coming or es2016 is
coming I'm actually just kidding it's
only two things so yes sex is just a
massive update to JavaScript and then I
think they're like wow it's probably a
bit too much let's let's coalification
so es seven or ES 2016 is going to have
a raid on includes where you don't have
to do that funny that index of thing and
then you can also use the exponential
operator which is to asterisk to get to
^
um there's lots of time to learn es6 I
think that it's really cool because you
can just like learn little things like
oh I use destructuring here and an arrow
function here and I'm starting to use
the new variables and block scoping and
and all of these things here and there
and you can just start sort of tearing
off little pieces of u6 and start using
them in your code today but time to get
at it it's it's a better time we're
starting to see all of tutorials all of
examples all of our libraries all
written in es6 so it's definitely
something we're spending some time
learning so that is my slides today I
would love to answer any questions that
we
all right
I don't know I hit my screen or my mind
you know how to give me back someone
said no generators in this talk no I
didn't talk about generators but yes
generators are very great it's sort of
like the best way to describe a
generator is like a possible function
where if you have code that needs to be
synchronous synchronous ish it's not
actually synchronous but you need it to
like read like that generators is a
great thing for that as well as we have
something coming called a sync await to
the language which is really really
going to help you if you've ever done
like crazy callback hell or you've had
lots and lots of promises yes yes I'm
not sure when it's coming a single way
it's in Chrome already I'm going to
really make her in life yeah I'm not
sure but yeah it's gonna be really good
yeah yeah I'm a big fan of async in a
wait and it works on promises so yeah
super easy to work with
I've been doing a lot of I'm working on
an ode course right now and my my old
everybody used to use the library a sink
and then they'd use like a sync dot
waterfall or a sink dot like all those
methods and I've totally got rid of that
and I've converted the entire code base
over to dish using promises which is you
can really step through everything and
then and then essentially what we're
going to see is that you can write all
of your your routing and everything just
in a wait or you just say oh wait this
data from the database and then the line
underneath it you can just call Prolog
that value there's no callback or then
or in yeah yeah it's super clean and
I've actually found so I used it on a
meteor wrap because meteor has it
polyfill it already and they're using
all the fiber stuff under the cover that
they have Oh awesome Dom actually burned
hit my women's least um so yeah like I
put it in place and I was sucking in
values from an API and it was I was
actually going to fact like the Shopify
API was like whoa you got to slow down
and then like I was using it to bulk
insert data in the Mongo and like Mongo
was having trouble keeping up with all
the call
sign is up having to put sleeps in to
kind of deal essentially or set time
cleanness oh because you can await a a
set timeout that returns a promise
yeah no you did yeah because I'm not
cool but yeah so yeah let's get to some
of these questions so uh they're saying
as while doing functional programming
you have we use closures but let it cost
for these closures doesn't it
I'm lettin defer to that well if you
still have a function that still is a
block scope so it's not that Latin
counts aren't scoped to the function
it's just that they are also scoped to
if statements and for loops and anytime
you have a a block
okay
so anonymous viewer asked Fergie
structure a new investor object can you
specify a particular parent object for
child properties with duplicate name
no I don't know I'm not sure exactly
what that means but can you specify a
particular parent object or itch for
child properties with duplicate
not sure what that means I don't think
so in structuring next logic you
huh George asked how do you find
tablet support I'm not sure what I'm
referring to review Oh for ESX well it's
it's all about
yes it's browser by browser so the
latest iOS 10 put in support for
everything es6 so it's good what right
now what people are working on is
performance so sometimes you can use
these fancy new things but if you're
really concerned about performance
sometimes they're a little bit slower in
what the the people behind the browsers
are doing now is making sure that you
shouldn't have to like go back to the
old harder ways to do it just because
it's more performance so they're they're
making really big leaps and bounds and I
think in in mobile tablet that's that's
going to be important as well yeah yeah
node oh seven and pretty much like full
es6 we're now - right yeah that's the
beauty of using es6 is on the server is
if you're not writing modules that are
supporting like older versions no but if
you're just writing your own app that
runs on node seven you don't need to
worry about any of that browser support
because it will just work in your your
environment just pretty cool yeah
all right
so okay that's all the questions so far
feel free to queue more of Yanam guys I
did it did did you happen to see the
other day the ones the one that comes
over to save this and was someone
tweeted about let's say like like to
default for argumentation for functions
and the fact that explode
did you see default arguments for a
function and it's slower
I haven't I didn't see that at all no I
would imagine like if it's actually a
problem for you a lot of times people
like to just sit around and talk about
how something if you run a function 10
million times it's slower and it's not
actually a problem for you but if it is
then I knew you're profiling and you're
that nitty-gritty into it
then yeah you need to you'll have to
look into this sort of thing yeah and
some things that make sense
my situation
can you still hear me yeah yeah okay I
stopped my my screen sharing
okay your your mic is really duplicating
I'm not sure if everyone else can hear
that but my mic is beginning yeah it's
like
like grainy and also going over and over
if I don't wanna throw headphones on I
think that might be it yeah okay robe
shitty robot that's that's a good yeah
actually I'm trying to hunt down this
problem I think it's my my little M
audio box
oh that's frustrating yeah I need to get
anyone well alright well thank you Wes
really appreciate you coming on and
given the talk you're welcome
excellent III learned some things so
that was awesome - there you go
awesome well thanks everyone was really
fun say hi to me on Twitter yes
definitely wants boss on Twitter and you
also have West's boss comments they want
to see ya about your stuff right yeah
