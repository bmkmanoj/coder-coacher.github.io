apprentice series I am I guess the hosts
josh owens and today we're going to be
working with media club podcast website
and Kobe Kobe cheese from nothing is uh
is with me welcome Colby what was up
although good at good to be here nice
all right ah yeah so I'll just uh share
my screen and will kind of talk through
the goals and then we'll dive into some
work here oh let's see share desktop one
all right can you see my screen I can
okay and so the goal today close some of
this stuff oops funny all kind of like
tabs open yeah this is all from like I
was feverishly working at like 3am the
other night on this this uh this app
right oh yeah I remember you're talking
about that yeah so this is uh this is
the new design that I had made I
actually had a maid for the meteor
podcast itself but then decided you know
we we hit the goal on patreon.com and so
we started a new podcast and we want to
have a site where we can put kind of the
all the relevant links up right so like
you could directly download it which
most people don't know how to do that
right now because there's no link I've
read out the itunes link so far um yeah
and so like if some of you you may have
seen like I did some work with Diego on
this project but when you click here you
know changes the player bar and it
changes the text here to be the relevant
episode so we really need to like just
change some of these words
and then I want to integrate this simple
cast I use simple cast for this so
they've got a embeddable audio player
here that we can use okay it's it's
similar to this thing and so the goal is
I think it it stretches all the way but
yeah we want to figure that out as well
nice so basically strikes with the
browser window or whatever the frame is
in yeah yeah it'll go with a hundred
percent sure oh I think that yeah
they've got a picture right here it
looks like these guys are all good stuff
okay yeah and so I like I actually like
the top one because you can control the
audio speed and really yeah that's my
favorite thing to do is change the audio
speed I hate it when ever I can't do
that on a podcast yeah yeah yeah
sometimes it's funny but like definitely
like I don't know anymore i prefer
something a little faster than 1x mm-hmm
so make sure it's in here yeah okay so I
think we're good we should get those
advanced controls and I don't know like
I like simple cast because even though
it's like 12 bucks a month we get some
nice statistics here so we say like 464
people have listened to the audio okay
so it's just like right there in the
funds real simple to use yeah they said
the other one you had wasn't too
friendly so you know the problem is that
they really like there's no way for you
to just use them they're about the same
price and I feel like they're not as
easy to use their support is horrible
I've actually had interactions with the
simple cast guys they they did a good
job with answering my emails and I don't
know no like yeah pod customizing
podbean site was really really not an
easy process and I feel like it honestly
just looks like crap
it's just a so that people can get these
audio files in a reliable way so my goal
is to eventually move away from that as
well but all right enough talking about
that stuff into design you got built up
or the other one we're going to put it
over now for the new podcast right so
what is a guess some of the big stuff we
gotta get down on this one uh changing
some words and then really I think just
getting getting a some kind of interface
for kind of doing the CMS type stuff you
know like essentially where we're
building like a blogging platform with
some reactive kind of things built on
top of it almost right can you read my
text okay yeah it actually looks good to
me okay I'm really get on my macbook so
nice it's good size good to see you
using the team bucks per night yes
yeah so if you guys watch this via
youtube you'll have to leave us comments
and let us know what you think of the
new format I think it you know it gives
you the video there's no google+ hangout
transparent overlay in the corner where
you can't read anything and you can also
see our faces like talking back and
forth even though we're writing code so
it's a little better experience we'll
see alright so i started the app let's
see did a fire up all right you know I
get this weird problem where it like
I'll try to hit localhost 3000 it just
sits there yeah but if I go start it
like I'm 3,200 or something crazy like
that oh like just that one chord that
messes up yeah my messes up a lose
internet connection well clearly we have
internet yeah look at that lately I just
loaded right up yeah okay that's hard
yeah I don't know I've looked into it
too much maybe that's something some
like unannounced bug is that's like a
new thing right uh no it's been
happening to me for a while probably it
was post 10 but I don't I tend to think
it's something to do with my Mac so I
don't know well interesting yeah alright
so we've got let's let's just look at
the app real quick for review we've got
an episodes collection that's powering
everything and then we've got a
publication
yeah so right now we're just returning
all the episodes and sorting them by
date ascending or December so the newest
one should be first Edison one and then
in here we just have allowed in eye
rolls this seems bad yeah we're going to
do something better here I think or just
deny everything and move to a method
call or something something on the
server yeah come on there we go then
somebody jumping in on their console and
mix everything out yeah yeah totally a
thing they could do I spell that's
probably a good thing to mention then
cuz I think no really it's not really
obvious bring a wing like jumping in
meter at first yeah so I think you know
if you look at the code on the left it's
really just saying like insert update
and remove it's returning the user ID
and so if there isn't a user ID they
won't be able to do any of these actions
but if if they are logged in right so if
they manage to figure out like even if
we don't expose a link to log in and
they still manage to figure out how to
like find the the signup page and all
that then they're gonna be able to log
in and start monkeying with all the data
in the system when in reality we
probably will need either an admin flag
or something there's a couple ways we
could handle that right like we could
look at the user that posted posted the
episode but then that would still allow
them to insert stuff so that's probably
not the best route so I think probably
having an admin flag that we set
manually or something via the database
would make a lot more sense to me
so how are you going to have this set up
to to add the content I could go in and
have like a damn bed panel that you add
stuff from that would be I think I deal
let's look at the router file it's
interesting so we're using the router
doc configure and there's a global
weight on in here and it's uh it's so
like every page is always going to grab
the episodes and wait on them probably
end up refactoring that yeah so we've
got an episode new link right here uh
and we also have an episode route what's
that look like the soul looks like it's
bad thing fail test that was nice broke
are these like built out yet or they
just kind of like placeholder I thought
episode was built out maybe it's not are
you using controllers Sony's no I don't
think this is gonna be big enough to
warrant right on controller huh so
what's got the code ish it's not showing
anything well it doesn't have any data
context right so if we look it's
probably does have the HTML there's just
nothing in it guys yeah oh no no no we
got an air oh you can't use you'll know
iron layout found did you not set the
the template or the default template I
thought we did layout template layout oh
yeah huh I feel like this this is like
related to something different all right
into that rare yet can't render the same
you twice honor its new to that it's
this guy so like zoom but it's got this
like thing that stays up near my tabs
over the long mean yeah I completely
right yeah yeah I didn't know as you can
move it yeah win for them all right uh
well I don't want to I don't get caught
up on that like we don't necessarily
need to mess with that but we do want to
go to episode new here we go perfect
don't like be a little better though
it's kashiwa dating rapper
div class equals container I think
that'll do it right mmm you add that a
closing dude yeah we gotta get you some
surround them yeah probably should get
better than that okay there we go that's
a little bit better yeah doesn't look so
clunky this is basically just something
that you're gonna see you know what else
is going to see right right and I'm
pretty sure this works we left this
working testing in April are you using
your own little simple form thing you
created yeah I am actually access denied
oh oh I'm not logged in that's
interesting so let's see those before
hooks right yeah yeah you're logging
yeah okay ah which let's see what
packages we installed okay reason user
account so I think they've got something
that we can use Mary Mother has before
after whoops you can use yeah but
they've got like they've already got uh
like a method set up for us so we can
just tell iron-router to use what
they've got we oh ok it's already built
in that then yeah all right where the
heck are there
they're the dogs here we go if current
user just a current user cover here we
go ensure you get content protection
this is what we want now we want to have
like a weight it's a and then if
actually an iron rod or plugin right oh
and then you're talking about having
like an admin play it's probably a good
spot to put that I'm like a helper for
is is add man or women yeah maybe at
some point uh what is filters for huh Oh
someone document it's done huh isn't it
Shane it's on undocumented if it's under
spore first yeah but that's uh this is
an iron router thing Wow there I think
this the designer put all this into like
reset the page to the top hmm i wonder
if we actually need that memo thought
that was a fixed problem check so we
only want new episode to be protected
right now
there we go we should get kicked back
out to there we go must be logged in
there you go it's that small wins small
wins testing April set it to today and
the episode it is I think the thing oh
oh is this where I left off maybe we put
a debugger in here for some reason uh-oh
attention-getting dragging what is that
supposed to indicate I always that
dragon dragon the volume slider or the
or the mena where they're at on them
where you seeing dragging sorry oh yeah
yeah i think this has something to do
with like trying to catch the clicks but
not catching dragging basically mmm so
like if you come in here and you click
on this guy it's gonna update all this
chrome up top but if you're like
dragging we don't want to we don't want
to switch you necessarily because they
might get you mean to yeah I don't know
we'll see isn't that can you do that
with like a like a whenever the click is
up and it's not on there it won't do it
I have no idea hmm so having I look for
dragon I think I think we were done with
that so I'm just gonna take that ok yes
we can i see haha you'll know
where we at episode okay can't render
the same view twice I actually think
this can't render the same view twice is
coming from Mongol I think think so you
can try to remove it for a second scene
but not never paint films with mommy
Mongol yeah I've never had any problems
with it doing that yeah let's over here
we'll just do a meteor update maybe yeah
I my help see cuz we need to get the 11
anyway yeah let's turn it back up
yeah no more oh well then I still don't
see manga on the page when I click ctrl
m where I'm being a bad pair let me
close off my notifications is this uh is
this all going on your open source
github or on the private one ah I think
we should make this open source I feel
like it could be interesting for people
to look at yeah just cuz you know
there's not a lot of stuff out there
yeah especially gonna be Dean yeah okay
yeah we'll definitely put this up there
Oh meteor club play around with some
stuff to maybe add tests on this thing
to you we kind of fun yeah yeah that
would be great because there's not a lot
of content out there that shows how
testing is done yeah agreed could force
me to use Jasmine more to all right um
so we got remove the debugger I think
what we need to do is now there's no way
for me to like basically if we look at
the structure since we don't get Robo
Mongo let me close this yeah rubble
Mongol doesn't work with the new MongoDB
year right oh I don't know I mean I'm a
nobody to 230 yet so okay i just use
whatever comes default with uh um meteor
okay so you actually have to tell me or
to use three overnight it doesn't
automatically upgrade yeah I don't know
you know that's interesting is that I
wasn't sure still a new bit Mongo yeah
we'd have to you know we'd really have
to look at the startup script to see how
it's calling Mongo but you might be
right like if you upgrade your system
Mongo and maybe using that but just
starting it up like
locally in your folder rather than
because it starts up its own instance
it's a really interesting question I
don't do it made up assaut maybe we'll
save five minutes for the end of this
thing and play with that you sure sure
sumon go get him ungood T dash B that
was not helpful on chef tamago log okey
there we go ah see I'm a 249 so we'll do
i'm using brew so we'll just do like a
see what version of brew we could do
wonder if like honor if it matters if
you make a new project in the middle do
three is there a way we can tell search
your status oh that's interesting yeah
so they must be doing something
different because my manga version i'm
connected to on port 3201 is mmm 267
unearthed a asum to do with the fact
that it doesn't work sometimes for you
hmm I wouldn't imagine so I mean that
starts it just it's like the proxies not
working right or something alright um
interesting got sidetracked there yeah
so episodes we get this spotlight field
right here if it's set to 1 then it's
gonna prioritize that and put it at the
top for us when the page loads and and
then what happens is when we click on
this guy it changes that spotlight ID so
it loops a different one up here okay so
we need to have some kind of way to
set the new 1i spotlighted I don't know
like the nuke like the newest one like
automatically spotlighted when you first
load the page that we mean uh yeah yeah
that's my thought um and so if we go
that route then I'm always it's always
gonna be the freshest content at the top
ready to be played okay yes what about
just doing like a non create or on
render hook since you know that's when
they're first opening that page you can
have it set the spotlight to the newest
well how let's look at how this is
hooked up now so we've got a spotlight
ID cuz somehow she's running off the
database the designer um client which I
love by the way that she liked actually
went in here and started building now
that's funny I think that's a huge
testament to the power of meteor it is
right it's so easy to jump in and your
stuff going oh yeah yeah look at that
she's totally doing a fine one call with
spotlights at the one and then grab the
idea and just setting that spotlight ID
yeah so we could leave it wired that
particular way and that's literally what
I said today oh yeah yeah now this is
what I was literally just asking in chat
earlier before we started what you know
what was the difference between this I
guess this is depreciated now rendered
its and they they won't must use on
rendered yeah yeah let's do that real
quick yeah I just didn't know the
difference because I didn't see that
update is it on render on rendered I'll
check I think got it because I was just
looking at in my app actually it's on
rendered okay so yeah we just changes to
be just a function so rather than so I
think before I was like template dot
home that rendered equals and so we were
overriding the rendered kind of method
and putting in our own stuff whereas now
we're just registering a call back and
so the on rendered allows us to have
like five of those if we want ten of
those if we want right and um
we don't have to like put it all in one
huge chunk of like blow so if you had a
huge amount of things to do on ringer
yes actually I've got a great example of
that okay cool uh I just refactored that
that map app that I was talking about um
oops I didn't click anything why'd you
do that uh there's that guy an well
we'll just click this one oh this is
already open sourced there you go all
right yeah yeah clients who's that
that's home jealous yeah so you can see
here I've got a non creative callback
which is really just setting a bunch of
initial state so created is gonna run
any time a templates actually created
and rendered is going to run any time
it's actually inserted into the Dom
mm-hmm and so then down here once we
inserted the Dom like this block of code
will check to see if there's a map if
there's not a map then we're going to
shove a map on the page and figure out
the location like we give it the
coordinates and then we figure out the
edges of the map and then down here and
this on rendered block we're actually
adding in an observed changes call so we
can see whenever a marker is added or
removed so basically like we're doing
geo JSON queries and as you map around
its gonna find places that it should
show on the map and as those are added
or removed like we get those messages
from the server it's going to pop and
either add the marker if it hasn't if it
has it's just going to do nothing and
then if the markers basically if we get
a removed call here we're gonna take the
marker off the map and then we're going
to like stop tracking that we had that
marker but so that's kind of like
logically we're doing two different
chunks of things and so so it just looks
better and more readable
oh yeah yeah yeah totally because I did
try to like some of this stuff like the
setting the boundaries and stuff I felt
like this could probably be somewhere
else but then it turned out like it
wasn't great to put it somewhere else I
like this code okay it wasn't firing
like it should so I could probably look
at it more and figure out how to
refactor that but that's in the two over
this video oh yeah that's cool good sign
I don't one yeah yeah good question good
good spot because totally so on render
rather than just looking for the newest
episode she's looking for the one that
has a spotlight so the question I have
is is there ever gonna be an instance
where I'm gonna want to spotlight an
episode that's not the most recent
episode uh I'm not sure that I would I
don't I mean I don't know other reason
other than like I don't know i don't
think i don't think you would yeah i
don't i don't think i would want to
either so you know what's kind of
interesting too is that now that we're
doing this as well we could actually
okay we'll save this for later feature
but we could track the last episode that
they clicked on and we could even track
how far they got into it and we could
save that into like local storage and
then they come back we could preference
if local storage has an episode ID and a
time counter that isn't past you know
the time counter or whatever then we'll
like show them that episode again as the
spotlighted one we can okay so like a
mental on that you were just listening
to and here is again yeah yeah we could
even put a little message on the page it
says hey welcome back we noticed you
were listening here you know I keep
listening just click yeah most of the
time when I go to a podcast website my
number one thing I want to do is look at
show notes because I think a lot of
people probably have their podcasts on
their phones
very true making like usability here I
guess but yeah this is 0 to that point
is there like an easy way to just like
boom jump in see the show notes in the
links well so this transcript link here
opens up a modal with show notes ok so
that was not change the name of that
because I probably would never click on
that if I was looking show notes yeah
yeah we can change that to show notes I
think it's the only yeah it's the only
place is that cool ok so we do we're
gonna do a find 10 should throw changes
javascript is even I know that night huh
instead of pulling from the database
mean no this is all the CoffeeScript you
can see though I so you're saying I saw
another on the right it's just like all
that kind of looks like there's yeah I
always forget because it's still I can
still read it but my brain did yeah yeah
so we want to do like okay II just like
copy paste that into a converter and it
just automatically changes it to elgin
import yeah yeah I just haven't done it
yet um so this isn't true
owner of this but with this button we
might what if we make like a JavaScript
call to control that I frame or
something that would be fun too okay so
I play episode and they just I'll make
the plate the deal at the top rather
than yeah what does it do right now just
update what's at the top yeah nothing
it's just a button okay it's useless
yeah none of this stuff is hooked up oh
alright ah so find one and we want like
we don't care Hatcher's but we do care
about like sort negative one that right
so that it pulls up the most recent we
gotta sort by date negative one here we
go oops date there we go well we don't
let's yep boom good stuff nice that's an
easy one alright so the other thing we
need to do is get we're going to need a
field for tracking like the player I
frame for each episode so basically the
process for me on the back end is to
record it edit it get it ready and then
come into simple cast and upload the
episode and that'll put it out on the
feed and then I also get right here this
window that I can pull up in this iframe
is the embedded audio player so I think
what I need to do is like copy these
URLs right here mm-hmm are these two
URLs and put them into the database as
well so we need to edit that form clamp
use
will prop actually while we're in here
we can add a transcript or a show notes
field as well let's just look at the
processor for knew that this is how you
build out most of your apps will have a
designer put all that like non-attached
buttons in there and then you just start
building them out yeah that's my
preferred way to build it so I mean
that's that's one of three options right
the other option is you become good at
design yourself and then it doesn't
matter where you do what I call like
developer page vomit which is you just
build something mostly unstyled or like
lightly styled using something like
bootstrap and then when it comes in and
fixes it all but I think to me having
the designer do it first puts a lot more
thought into the UI and UX ahead of time
whereas you know me as a developer like
I'm probably not gonna necessarily think
in the way user would think and I think
that's a big job that a designer does
for you and so if you I think if you do
the page first and turn it over to a
designer style then you're letting a
developer who's not thinking about the
user kind of drive what the application
is going to look like and I think that
can end up as a sub optimal experience
sometimes ya hear you that's one thing
that I'm going to think about I'm not
really designing myself but doing my own
personal projects in like that it's
gonna look weird yeah alright so yeah
we're just we're grabbing the entire
form and then shoving it into the
episode field so we should be good to
just add these fields and they should
start working okay so we'll do like um
copy this guy put it down put another
one down here then
let's see there i'll have to check out
simple while i was using the look easy
for more quick for him whatever it is
from ya auto form yeah I mean it's I
think it's out of forms okay there's
just certain things I don't like about
it like I I really don't like the way
that you control your form like if you
want to use auto form is by putting a
bunch of options in your schema because
I feel like schemas related to the
database and you're adding in you know
visualization and HTML options into your
database file and point yeah I do happen
to be that feels weird to me but I mean
if you don't wanna do that then you can
always just switch to using like auto
form without the quick form feature and
build your own do yeah I don't know
personally I like the amount of control
I get here the only thing I miss is like
the validation stuff but I think there
might be good ways to do validation that
don't have to be like you specifying a
huge schema mmm what do you do right now
on this do you have any kind of a schema
or do you just put it yeah just putting
the data straight in okay actually
is that a security issue yeah that could
potentially be a security issue so lime
for over here allows them to really
input anything if i equals process form
yeah so we're processing the form and
grabbing out all the stuff that people
have put into the form so i think the
assumption there is like no one's
monkeyed with the form on the client
side but they could they could add more
form fields with names and you know yeah
don't you need to send it over to a
server function and then have it send
back the well line line five is doing
the insert for us so realistically what
we could do is move this to a method and
then do send it over and like do a check
on stuff that we're getting or something
if we if you cared about the key I care
but I'm gonna support the entire problem
by making people have to be an admin
there you go and so I know I trust
myself there you go I don't know I'm
gonna have to think through that though
that that's very interesting so download
um and show notes or how notes show
there we go yes okay oops lost some
stuff there there we go no do this ishma
notes so what's that look like now
okay so let's get one in totally that's
not the wrong one embeddable audio
player so you're just going to put that
embed code right there BAM okay yep and
then we'll get the download link from
right here they have an API where you
can grab some of that stuff I matically
oh that's interesting huh we put it we
put it a date back and yeah so if
nothing else you can see right here what
we could do is parse the feed mmm I'm
probably like auto add stuff based on
the feed being updated and then just
come in later with the show notes and
add those in because that's the only
thing I think we don't we wouldn't get
right off the bat because yeah simple
cast has the title it has a short
description and I don't know let's look
at that real quick sharing RSS feed what
do we get
which day get this guy here which we
could parse didn't have and I don't just
have like an episode number by itself an
episode ID but that I mean this I think
this would be enough to drive it Yeah
right because we get right here's your
summary would work enough for us we even
get a duration so we pull that out yeah
yeah that's probably worth let's let's
get everything wired up and then they're
probably next time that that be worth
exploring automating that piece yeah I
was looking for ways to make things
easier automating my life is always a
good thing yeah alright so this guy has
legit info so we just need to water that
up so we need to change us out to be the
iframe if that's gonna screw the design
my dog is doing something weird over
there um client it's this guy featured
episode no no that's the bottom part
featured I think that's just this part
right here but not this part okay so
that maybe that's part of you oh yeah it
is because the season comments thing
yeah I think it's yeah it's this block
right here the feature and show up so
tile place eventual time okay yeah so
see this is like where maybe some danger
could come into because we're using the
triple stash because we got HTML code
right and we wanted to come in and be
rendered as HTML code yeah oh you have
to do that anymore you can say it's a
safe string if you want let's see this
magically look like oh we gotta gonna
click on this guy uh-oh what does this
just change the design like you said
right huh what you say sorry oh that's
the new that's a new player before we're
using whatever she had yeah so what is
keeping let's get rid of these guys
maybe let's see what that looks like oh
where to go ahead i push it up we got to
change the Virginia something I guess
yeah we see the progress bar but we
don't it looks like it just uh I just
put the offset up or something well
what's what's latest episode giving us
let's look at that style maybe oh gosh
you gotta you gotta click on the one
with the player in it oh yeah and the
other one thing how do you uh you should
delete that testing in april one where's
the play button coming from this guy
okay so she's allotting one column to
that so i think we can just make this
the full 12 now also it could kind of
want the dark one not the light one but
that's choose a bull so yeah yeah it's
easy to change yes I know that's good
here's the progress bar don't need that
anymore click on it to get rid of all
that see what that looks like okay so
now we just need it like centered and
dark and you dark was a setting of our
choice i think does it just have some
padding on it around that it's doing
dark there we go oh you just put style
equals dark on it you busy yeah i'll
just copy the whole thing and replace it
gonna head in a way to edit stuff later
yeah okay would be pretty easy to do
probably this
yeah yeah I actually like the idea of
automating it more because then I can
just give my I've got an assistant that
helps with kind of getting that the
podcast finished and I can give her
access to this and she can just upload
an episode here and then BAM everything
is pretty much done yeah I don't have to
teach her like two websites or anything
exactly every simple simple cast yeah I
don't we'll have to definitely look and
see if they've got an API to that might
be easier to work with there's the dark
one it's like barely visible now yeah I
think it's cuz that purple is so close
to the black they're using yeah I don't
know when you think around it i don't
know if you can style it any further on
your own yeah not sure if we can because
they're coming in with their own can you
style something in an iframe I think you
can style the iframe around the iframe
it out yeah if I was thinking like if
you had like a wrapper around it with no
margin or padding and then just gave it
up like a water something let's just see
one pixel red so I look like you will
design a trick I did not do anything hmm
should I can make me sad guy we need to
look at let's get her action going
Porter one pixel solid good it's being
overridden somewhere ah wonderful speed
overwritten by the natural I don't know
HD sure sometimes I gotta say solid in
here me that was the missing piece there
we go there you go yeah not like that
yeah you like to read no nothing like
that epic alright so let's go find
episode info the stylus file client use
no client style sheets episode when I
say info here we go okay and not
everybody's take a look no it's there
it's going like them around here can you
see that it's like a on the right side
yeah I think it overhangs it by like a
pixel oh yeah maybe you can just give it
a little bit of a margin on the right or
something or padding on the right to
make it push out and then you'll want to
match the corners to the rest of you
website yeah they've got like but other
than that at the time slate border
radius
really I think what we need to do first
is good to go push down to be centered
yeah that's true vertical centering
always a pain you're just gonna like
card number in there yeah I mean it
already is so oh okay they're like that
I guess it doesn't matter up for this
one yeah it's not going to change size
or anything right no just with I guess
stuff like it is responsive so yeah a
responsive left and right but it's not
going to matter someone goes up or down
and it seems alright so we be just
change this got a 17 you have out a
global border-radius variable unions I
don't know no not me but maybe she did
so who was it really I'm like a
variables file that she keeps stuffing
ah good question so I do my SAS stuff
what our radius 3 pixels roofs what
happened there episode info just try
that and see
yeah they're slightly rounded now what
if that's the UH maybe it's I don't know
he's weird isn't it hey Jerry bigger
what would cause that I thought it was
just the screen cast but obviously you
see new teams what happens if we put
some padding on there yeah I get it
adding five pics yeah pretty pretty is
that bad though because then we see a
purple I don't put the top and down I
just put padding left and right where
yeah so yeah I pen Meyer I don't know
what they're really short hands always
forget to order yes like top he rises
like yeah that's how I always think
about it right like if you see me doing
this I'm probably thinking about how
paddings applied yeah yeah that's funny
yeah it's not terrible um let's see
let's see where we get that though I
wonder if we only need like one pixel of
padding there good question didn't one
or two yeah it's just one okay good
stuff that's bizarre hey ya know maybe
maybe the its own styling has one of
those things where the background feel
Phil's through the border or something
hmm I don't know yeah remember all the
styling options
why I thought we applied the change for
the thought though oh I change you're
wrong one eat pretzels so this one I'm
gonna change top not the bottom there we
go all right looking good make progress
yeah all right well let's stick a pin in
it here and we'll try pick up maybe
early next week I need to look at my
calendar um but yeah I think I think
this is good and so then like next week
we'll get the like all the linking going
on and just put the show notes in here
and that kind of thing you have like a
Trello board with like step features you
want to add in so we can be she's sewing
no no actually I don't want to use
Trello for that since we're open source
let's use github he's like waffle links
and github waffle yeah we could yeah one
youthful fan of the con bond huh haha
and just easier like move your ideas
around I'm like yeah all right I am NOT
opposed to using waffle that's for sure
so I think what do we say finish wiring
up featured episodes so we'll put some
of check boxes in here I'm pretty sure
that's the syntax
here we go as a few did we mention
anything else we thought would be
interesting oh we gotta make sure to how
to admin flag in there oh yeah yeah okay
so that I will be a new one okay oh and
RSS feed into header she's head isn't a
header new and share it sure so oh yeah
it's good give me a chance to test out
the new share it's tough to uh anything
else like what would be required for
launch
yes tweaking the metadata and the
sidebar because this was this should be
Ben and I not been in raat aur mere I ok
so that's your so each other yeah this
is this is all probably static and just
change like some of this wording yeah ok
all right so just have like a little
template for metadata that we pull in
here we go and then I I think that would
probably be enough to get us launched
I'm gonna send this over to the designer
that I love to say I'd like as like
maybe maybe have our tweak that white
farts okay yeah i'm not i'm not sure i'm
in love with that yet yeah and then we
should probably will hide these
pagination and then post launch because
we're recording our third episode today
and we're going to launch the second one
today so I mean it's gonna be we could
probably get like 10 of these on a page
without having to worry about pagination
or something so I got a couple weeks we
don't have to do that before we launch
sure that good point we'll just have to
put it on a a date you know I'm don't
you know when you need have a devil
label we gotta add a label or like a
post launch label ouch market is in the
hand to it for now sure
no all the non enhancements are critical
to launch yeah there we go all right so
we've got like five things we can focus
on and I think would let us get to
launch okay so next up so we won't
wonder Ali why don't we make one yes yes
definitely that would be good and then
yeah so well we'll finish up the
featured episode stuff will add the
admin flag and that might take up the
next episode and then after that we'll
be doing the RSS feed the sharing and
the metadata and I don't know that that
stuff sounds pretty simple if sure it
works right then I think we could
probably get it launched at the end of
the I guess this will be our third
pairing on that so this one is our
second oh yeah this is yeah this is our
second this is our first time parent on
this yeah on this yeah yeah so um yeah
maybe we can get some deployment in as
well that would be entrusted late I'd be
good to him especially y'all with y'all
talking about it alone punkass recently
there we go that's the other thing we
talked about yeah yeah automatical
unmagical huh that would be so awesome
alright cool man well thanks uh dang
preparin hopefully you learned something
hopefully viewers learn something and I
know I love making progress on this
stuff so for sure cool alright well
thanks for tuning in guys and we'll be
back at some point next week to this
