2016 welcome crater fans i'm your host
josh owens along with a special guest
co-host hi I'm Lauren hey Lauren welcome
to the show man thank you yeah so I be
had a last-minute emergency come up and
Lauren agreed to step in so I really
appreciate that me Tommy's working too
hard yeah yeah it's not work-related
sadly Barker yeah so I've got I've got a
pink and blue beard today if you're
watching on youtube if you're not you
can you can go check it out anyway and
see it's the kids requested I do it for
a little carnival they have here small
town we live in fun stuff I it looks
good yeah yes it's getting a little
patchy though it was pretty solid before
but i'ma rub down it's all chalk so
pretty easy to put on so I think before
we get into it like what once you tell
people what you do Lauren I am CTO at a
social app startup called parlay for
making social wagers with your friends
has to be some freelancing and then I'm
a maintainer on meteor core and then on
the docks and the guide repos nice do
you actually have commit rights to me to
do yeah they said don't use it but um
close done is I made a made a patch
branch i created a branch on on the what
I haven't Ivan like touch devel hmm
interesting nice that's pretty cool yeah
so uh and you you guys you you guys you
were involved in something interesting
that launched this week which didn't get
enough up votes but I thought it's worth
mentioning yeah so there's a new
redesign of the of the core meter docks
and then also of the
it's done with with tech so which is
like Jekyll Ruby static site generator
it's used for good at pages but this is
this is like a JavaScript version of
Jekyll and looks really nice dominic and
when from mdg to the design and it's
much easier to contribute because
previously docks was was a was inside
the meteor core repo and you it was
meteor app and so like if you wanted if
you want to change it you'd have to do a
PR 2 meteor core which which you know
probably didn't get merged and so now
it's in a separate repository it's no
longer meteor app it's a hexose oh it's
static HTML and that means it doesn't
doesn't crash your your mobile phone I
was in my head yeah crashed a safari and
chrome on iOS and and I will I will
probably soon merge your PR because I
have rights and it's separated and so
nice yeah that's awesome yeah so I I
thought it was exciting as well like I
like the new design that the fonts a
little small but I I think there's a
common complaint and have a most meteor
sites but I went to submit an issue so i
recommend also farm pump if it's really
bothering me but just in those but i
like it i do miss i missed a little
search functionality but you pointed out
there's an issue for that to comment
what's going back yeah Tom's gonna do it
I think sign hung yes so those are the
big CTA the call to action for that is
is if there's anything in the docs or
the guide that's that's not clear submit
an issue submit a PR it should be easy
to to change it likes it yeah yeah
that's pretty cool I like it though I
like I like the it feels more seamless
between the guide in the right pick up
there often sidebar you
exactly looking good awesome all right
so this week we will be talking about
horizon meteor 1.4 roadmap firebase is a
platform now and react with web app and
meteors are back end but that won't be
kind of interesting yeah so cut big news
week um Google Google's having their i/o
thing one day I want to go to that huh I
hear tickets are hard to get one day I
want to go yeah yeah thank you for
giving away free things like the glasses
and a phone and yeah exactly uh yeah so
I think that the big news we'll get
we'll get to the big news from IO in a
little bit but the other big news was
horizon is out now so you can like NPM
install this thing and give it a try
I'll say like maybe 15 minutes before
the show was reading up on it and tried
the install and even right up until we
were getting started I was trying to get
rethink DB to run right and apparently
I've got the right version and
everything but it it says connection to
rethink be be terminated and it can't
seem to connect to the running version
so won't warm I can't give you my direct
thoughts on it but what I can say is it
looks interesting to me again I think if
media were built now instead of like
three years ago it would look pretty
similar to a horizon in my opinion you
know I think they're using our xjs
observables instead of writing a custom
library like tracker um oh so what about
looks like I've and what is horizon for
the people haven't heard of it oh yeah
yeah so I guess it's I mean it's it's a
direct competitor with something like
meteor or I don't
some of the other ones out there I don't
know there's no other ones amber amber
no no step foot back right is it now how
is it just Frank I don't know I don't
pay attention I pay attention to angular
some I pay attention to react I don't
know um yeah no it's it's definitely
there's like a build tool kind of hooked
together it's got socket i/o um it's
it's got the database integration
they've got our xjs to kind of monitor
the incoming data so like as it updates
you'll get you know you can just use the
observable like you normally would and
have your code update so it's it's
really interesting ok so it's built by
the the rethink DB team it is um I I
sort of feel like like they were they
were like meteor should be the meteor
should use us for their database clearly
because we are the only like native
real-time database I feel like meteor
didn't so they had to make their own
their own stack yeah like you know
honesty you look at UM the way the user
accounts is kind of structured like all
that kind of stuff like accounts based
and accounts password like it is
definitely tied heavily into blaze and
it's definitely tied heavily into Mongo
and like this has been a common
complaint for a long time and I think
that's the last piece that would have to
change in order for something like
postgres or rethink to be able to come
in as a as a DB that you could easily
integrate with um and it's just I don't
know like I feel like maybe that
projects on the back burner I looked at
in a while but I'm watching the repo and
I'm not getting any updates about it um
they definitely did break out a piece of
the the meteor user stuff from the main
repo into its own repo but as far as I
could tell nothing's really happening
maybe it might be waiting until um
Apollo yeah well you know I think that's
that's part of it is that they've kind
of stolen away the team that would
worked on and at this point like I know
sashka at one point was kind of in
charge of it I don't know what is you
know day to day it looks like mdg
anymore but they also took Martin kind
of off of meteor and not putting him on
Apollo as well so you know I don't maybe
maybe right we'll see something coming
out of Apollo that gives you user
integration but based on what I see you
know I just I don't know if that's true
so I think it's in the past and then
everything in Apollo is database
agnostic so it should be able to do the
account system on any database once they
add it yeah yeah yeah I don't know like
that's it's weird right because you're
gonna have a schema and like schemas are
gonna look different here they're okay
right it's definitely interesting I'm
trying to figure that problem out but so
so for horizon there is the do they have
a client-side data cache uh I don't
think so I think they're just using the
RX j s observable so when something
changes you just kind of react to it
okay no pun intended ah more fun intense
so you'd have to do your own like a
latency computation fewer one to change
things on the client before changing on
the server I think so let's pretend so I
was working with Slava on the rethink DB
integration with meteor back when he got
started maybe a year ago and so this is
so the big the big differentiator there
would be or would be that rethink gb has
has native support for change feeds or
having a feed of data like similar to
the manga op log but granular so you
don't need to go through the whole thing
so it's going to scare much better yeah
so Slava's driver use change speeds to
send new data / / gdp decline which is
really cool but the the number of
queries that were super change feed
compatible so like out of the entire
query language recoil
you can you can do whatever to query
anything from breathing but only there
was like a very small subset that worked
with change feeds so like the your
publishers we're very very limited like
um I could I could do like a public feed
but I wouldn't be able to do like a
friend feed mm-hmm and they were
planning on improving those but I don't
know how much how flexible that that
piece of gum my guess is it's probably
gotten better because you're able to
send a subscriber quest and then you
know based on um message coming through
from the SUBSCRIBE call you can do
different things you know like on
replace or remove or do they have one on
new yeah I guess yeah it looks like they
just they're using like an array of I'm
looking at chat messages like their
little example here and they they push
like each result from the SUBSCRIBE call
on to an array and then they're like
pushing those on to like as things are
replaced or remove their kind of doing
various operations on that away so yeah
I don't know I mean maybe maybe it's
gotten better certainly I know the thing
that I remember him saying he needed
something in to dot to to come along
that's when I was slated to come along
and I think you had something to do with
the change feeds that you mentioned and
they're at 2.3 now so my guess is
they've definitely beefed it up and you
know made it so you can have a lot more
stuff to query against I you know it's
just I think it's still early with
horizon more than anything like their
authentication I think they support
OAuth right now but that's really all
they're doing um they plan to add more
um you know I think they've they've got
a couple sample apps but its just oh
still early days
with them oh no it looks interesting to
me I think you know watching feathers
watching horizon watching meteor like
they're all trying slightly different
things but kind of dancing around
somewhere ideas yeah but it'sit's I said
they're doing often that they that they
have this horizon cloud which is
basically gonna be their equivalent of
galaxies mmhmm yeah yeah you know I find
that interesting too because like I i
hear galaxy is gonna become like much
wider just docker host at some point
okay so it's not gonna be like meteor
specific so watching another company do
it I wonder like how interesting or
smart that might be for them because
again there's no like billion dollar
unicorn hosting company out there you
know and I don't think there ever will
be the postings a commodity thing even
when you put good services on top of it
I still think it's always just going to
be a commodity like race to the bottom
pricing thing all right mm-hmm Oh would
you would you call digitalocean a
hosting company I would yeah and I still
don't think like they're never gonna be
a billion-dollar unicorn are they like I
don't I'm you don't have to be right but
I think that's right you're looking for
don't I don't think that there's uh I
don't think andreessen horowitz invested
you know 20 30 million dollars in meteor
because hosting looked interesting and
that's I that's why they're working on
Apollo right all right yeah anyhow let's
do the next one and let's see what's the
next what is next one yeah lost my list
ah meteor 14 roadmaps that's what it was
alright so we've got a blog post or a
post on the forums recently coming
Syrian media 1.4 and the big thing is
node 4 so currently meteors using node
version 0.2 point 43 which is ancient
we're going up to node 4 which is pretty
close to recent there's only two more
versions node 5 and 6 5 is not a long
term tournament and then 6 is pretty new
and lots of things don't work with it
yet so note for it is great Mongo 3.2
which i think i think has has some
significant changes it does yeah
specifically I'm kind of interested
today like we were having a talk with I
was talking to a client and Mongo 3.2 I
believe comes with like you can turn on
encryption for the data at rest so the
data that's stored in the database you
can go and let it sit there encrypted
which I mean they're water projects to
do in something like meteor to kind of
do that for you but to have it at the
database level I think might make a lot
more sense you probably need that for
for HIPAA did the clinical fork party
already have that ah you know honestly
I've I have no idea um well nothing
another nice thing about three points
here is that so so composed which is
which is one of the main MongoDB hosters
cloud posters that that people meteor
use I has hasn't has a new type of
meteor deployment now now they have me
your mom sorry Mongo classic and and
what you speak Mongo plus that is now
their main manga and that is every every
deployment no matter how small is this
charted which and which which is
challenging for the op log and they made
this special because because like I
think each each each shard would have
its own aw blog or something so they
made they made an entry point for the up
logs to be combined or something and it
doesn't work with the current meteor
version of manga
Oh rejecting his three point out that it
will work with 3.2 so you'll be able to
use up log with composed on their
current MongoDB deployments yeah so I
think probably the thing here to point
out as well is like there's a couple
things that are actually going into this
commit because not only you're getting
like you've got um Mongo as far as the
driver like what supported three point 0
is currently supported right like you
can connect to a three-point Oh database
fine with meteor not a big deal but the
thing is by default it still ships with
2.6 so when you're on in like local
development mode and you try to do like
run the query planner like the old 2.6
doesn't have any of the query planner
stuff so um that can be kind of
frustrating and you can mount up your
own Mongo instance and run it you know
wherever you want and have meteor
connect to that but it's kind of a pain
in the butt when you're running like you
know I've got like 10 different client
apps on my machine than I check out
runnin any given time so yeah but this
will come like meteors going to ship
with Mongo 3.2 by default so when you
start and when you do media run its
gonna fire up a Mongo 3.2 instance which
is super exciting to me like that means
in local development mode you're gonna
get like wired target support and query
planner and all kinds of goodies that I
think are going to be pretty awesome was
wired tiger 3.2 it's true point 0 0 but
yeah it's something like locally you
still don't get it but like you know if
you look at like crater crazy dogs a
crater is running three-point oh um I
don't you know I don't know if I switch
to the white tiger or not it's a good
question
yeah so that I think that's kind of
exciting as well yeah and then there it
looks like relaxing core package version
so it looks like there's gonna be less
and less things kind of tied into
release if you don't you won't have to
have it like you know every release
won't be directly tied to version of
blaze or version of media tour Mongo or
whatever yes so they mood plays into a
separate repository github meteor /
place that has a community maintainer
and so it'll I think you should usually
be able to in the future to have them
release a new version I guess an
atmosphere and then you can just type me
your update and not meteor update
release until update just the blaze mmm
package nice figure that speaker
development on that yeah yeah because I
mean I think there's there's some things
that don't necessarily need to be like
maybe it's nice to tie together like the
change log in the docs and say like 1.4
came out here's the new changes but at
the same time like for the community to
move faster i think these individual
repos will be better um I mean we'll see
how it works out mo but looks
interesting all right so the big google
i/o news was that our base has been
significantly expanded I'd forgotten
that firebase is acquired by Google I
was like over a year ago yeah that's
pretty cool
oh my link broke yeah so like you know
when you look at firebase they were I
think they got acquired 18 months ago
and they had about a hundred and fifty
thousand developers at the time and
they've grown to have like four hundred
fifty thousand on their platform now uh
which is pretty big like we've I don't
think we've ever seen particular numbers
out of meteor any of the other platforms
like this um but the you know the thing
was they had the real-time database and
user authentication and like easy
hosting um but they were lacking some
other stuff and so like to basically
just built this big platform around
firebase they've got firebase analytic
now they've got like messaging storage
um so I think you know you look at this
and you think i could probably glue a
lot of this together myself but at the
same time i think they're they're
putting out SDKs that allow you to
easily kind of tap into this if this is
what you're using to run your app on the
back end and I know that there's a
number of people in the react community
that rely on firebase and use it so yeah
I've heard a lot of lot of the use you
should you should of it and it seems
like it has been that the biggest
competitor to meteor for for an easy to
use real-time back end and it has a
whole lot of things it's got its got
like integrated it's got off it's got
messaging like push notifications it's
got deep linking into your apps it's got
like automatic in-depth analytics crash
reporting let's see hosting obviously
you know you know what was interesting
to me there was a conversation I think
it was Ben and I had a couple episodes
back what are we talking about like app
streaming deep linking and all that kind
of stuff and I never understood why we
didn't see more of that in angular like
why wasn't angular doing this kind of
stuff and now that this is coming out
it's starting to make a little more
sense they're targeting pretty heavily
the ios and android community and trying
to get people to use firebase as the
backend for that you know so we've got
like AdMob integration AdWords
integration um yeah just all kinds of
stuff around the phone it's got a native
invites like an invite system so I guess
the the hesitation i had with firebase
originally when i was looking at it
probably like 23 years ago was the fact
that the limitations on on on on how you
sat how come how complex your your data
schema could be and your queries and
your mutations your equivalent of meteor
methods so firebases is not like a
meteor in that you're never hosting it's
completely hosted there's no option to
host your own like there's a meteor and
there's also there's no there's no run
your arbitrary code on the server right
there's no you're not writing
publications and methods so there's
there's a lot of like complex logic in
my methods and and how would I translate
that over to firebase there is there is
some there's validations like so it has
its own user system so you can say which
users have permissions to read or write
whatever docs but it's at the doc level
you can't go like intro intro doc level
like instant my publications I only only
serve up certain fields to the client
you wouldn't be able to like hide those
fields and if you if you just gave read
access to a doc and then there's there's
some validation rules that you can you
can use had sort of that's sort of like
coding like there's one example food I
validate new data is string and new data
valve length is less than 100
so that's that's sort of a little bit
like arbitrary logic there but it's
still a far cry from like whatever you
want to do inside of your methods have
you ever tried using a firebase I didn't
know like I I I went straight from like
rails and backbone and doing a little
bit of rails and angular 2 straight into
mediator back in 2013 so can I didn't
really look at the landscape I just
really enjoyed how Mongo and mini Mongo
and kind of like the DDP bridge in
between handled a lot of this kind of
stuff for me but you know it's probably
the biggest thing to me here is the
pricing like I'm looking at the pricing
and going wow this this seems
significantly cheaper like um they have
now so for free you get a hundred
simultaneous connections and put that
into perspective craters doing I think
half a million page views a month we're
doing somewhere between a hundred and
thirty-two 200 at peak simultaneous
connections um so you know I think like
crater couldn't be on the free plan
basically um if we were to kind of use
firebase is back end but uh looking at
it you know you get unlimited for the
$25 month plane um then you know there's
a little footnote that says there's an
initial limit of 10,000 simultaneous
database connections that's a lot of
people you know like I don't I I think a
couple of the bigger media apps like
mixmax in class craft um peak up over
that and at certain times of the day um
but what's what are those or craters on
total total data database gigabytes or
megabytes stored in Mongo oh yeah it's
not time today got it really low yeah
yeah I think I might like I it's like
200 megs maybe not yeah it's yes so the
$25 month plan on firebase gives you 2.5
gigabytes right
I just thought I don't know that that
data is gonna melt like I feel like by
the time you have 2.5 gigabytes unless
you're like collecting real-time
analytics you're probably not going to
use that much data you know right I'm
kind of user-created platform or
something um you know looking looking at
these other limits it doesn't really
seem like that big of deal and you can
get like pay-as-you-go upgrades on the
gigabytes like all right gig of storage
cost you five bucks you know all right
and it shows they have like an
integrated their version of s3 like
what's what's the dap you've used it has
like the maximum s3 total size that's
probably still out here gigabyte yeah I
mean I so I ran this is like digging
back to rails like we had 12 gigs worth
of photos in an app that I built I'm
called tasty planar and it was all about
room like recipes and so people would
have upload nice photos and then he's
kind of like all recipes and people
would upload photos of their version you
know and so we had multiple photos free
trust be um but yeah I still don't I
mean I don't know I feel like again this
is this is probably in line right
they're charging you in a similar way to
s3 um an extra five gigabytes Kostya 13
cents like this is just cheap and then
an extra five gigabytes of transfer cost
you 60 cents so I mean yeah maybe that
stuff totals up once you get up there
but at the same time like you have gonna
be hard to get up there yeah if you have
that many users like you probably have a
team of people that are giving a crap
about this problem at that point right
yeah so I don't know like this is this
is very very interesting I wonder like I
feel like this is gonna maybe shake up
some things in the hosting space a
little bit could be interesting
yes the other thing I was thinking about
besides how complicated your methods are
raised how you how complicated your your
data could be um so like you run into
this problem with with Mongo if you're
coming from sequin land is like how do i
how do I join between different tables I
don't want to do everything embedded
documents because that's inefficient
with GDP and so you use like publishers
relations or you or you duplicate data
and their solutions so they don't have
an equivalent for joins Ibraheim
equivalent for like published with
relations with eight what they tell you
to do is like if you have a many-to-many
relationship like users two groups you
store all the groups under the user new
store all the users in order the group
so you're duplicating that so whenever
you change it you change but so that's
the solution I mean it works and so you
can it looks like it has a broad range
of like data schemas you could for
applications you could have if you just
format it in this duplicated by doesn't
seem doesn't seem that bad good work
yeah yeah yeah it's kind of interesting
when you think about it like meteors
really not all that different from
firebase right and this kind of taps
into our next story as well because if
you think about like meteor has a back
end in a front end but the front end can
really be deployed anywhere right you
can even just put the HTML CSS and
JavaScript up on s3 and serve that up
and then it can connect into the back
end and get all the DDP data that it
needs and so it's very very similar to
firebase not require it's just the front
end initially came with a lot of tooling
but now you know you can replace out
with whatever you want okay so let's
talk about that story I did not mean to
segue that cleanly but holy schmoley I
did
tell me what ya react westpac yes
alright so there's a blog post called
reactive load peg + meteor as the back
end where someone is using meteor but
decides to not use the meteor build tool
and instead use web pack and it's really
funny because he as soon as I saw the
title I thought about this is tweet from
shashka like last week or something
where he said decided to not that
decided to try not using meteor j/s for
once I feel like I need a PhD PhD and
webpack just to get source Maps quite an
NPM and basic reloading it actually
quotes it so I didn't actually have time
to read it finish reading the article
what does it say and why is it why are
you doing but that yeah so I think you
know for him web packs faster right and
we um it offers interesting things that
you can do as far as I don't know like I
don't know how fast will see this kind
of stuff coming out of meteor and so I
like I understand his want to do this um
you know we need we need code splitting
so if you think about it when you
connect to crater you're gonna download
you know a mag and a half of JavaScript
which includes the HTML that's been
compiled into blaze templates and you
don't you don't need all that right like
someone some guy googling something and
ending up on crater doesn't need that
meg and a half to render the site and
that that's that's a bad experience
right like we want to get to this point
where like you have just enough to get
to site loaded and then like as you need
more things we can just send it to you
so you know you've got this is the idea
of like streaming sites to people or
using web web workers to kind of like
send the initial bit and then send the
rest yep I currently do that allow you
to do it uh I don't think web pack is at
the point where it can do the streaming
but you can do
let's see he mentions hot module
replacement um but I also think that
there is a way to do code splitting
which can at least help somewhat um not
necessarily as far as all the way to
streaming but you know if you think
about it like if I have an admin part of
crater and I have a user facing part of
Crater like I only want to deliver the
user facing code when you're hitting the
user facing part yeah and so that's the
red pack would let you separate the
admin client templates and logic into a
separate bundle that only gets requested
by the browser as soon as you change
routes from like / to / admin yeah okay
yeah cool yeah and so you know and then
it goes even further right so if you
think about like we're using the import
syntax now so we can say like import
this file um I ran across this the first
time I heard of the idea is called tree
shaking with roll-up yes but it's the
idea that you can import the code that
you need right let's say you're
depending on a library and it does it it
doesn't package the entire library just
packages like that function and all the
dependencies yep through like static
analysis or yeah wow yeah so like I
that's gonna be huge in my opinion so
webpack tues got that if you want to use
it now you can use something like roll
up Jas and it'll do it for you so yeah
it's it's really interesting to me as
well right because if you think about it
even if we got code splitting we've come
to this point where we're relying on um
well like it was there was a post in the
meteor forums about like if you rely on
accounts Twitter it's bringing along
blaze for you for free and if you're
using react that's terrible like I don't
wanna I don't want to make someone
download blaze just because I want
Twitter accounts ah authentication like
ah just yeah anyway that's a whole
nother rent but um so like you know if
if they can figure out that i'm not even
using that that that's even better like
so i think this is this is awesome to
see
in that regard uh the thing that I maybe
don't like I've never been a huge fan of
asteroid and I feel like you leave in
some of the good parts of the meteor
ecosystem behind if you're not gonna
bring tracker and mini Mongo along with
DDP and at that point like why even use
the back end just because you feel like
prototyping with Mongo it's better like
you don't have to specify a schema and
therefore you can maybe work faster on
the back end but if your projects gonna
get big enough and you're gonna have
more than one developer on there this
scheme is usually a good thing so I
don't know I don't know if I agree with
the second part of the article i get y
webpack is interesting i'm not sure i
would agree with you know using meteor
as the back end here in this way and so
to me the smarter way is for at some
point I'm kind of hoping now that we're
seeing what meteor 14 looks like maybe
media 15 will come with like releasing
to mpm and so if tracker and mini Mongo
we're on NPM just put them there you
know we don't have to care about it um
we can connect into any old back end and
and we'll be able to use web pack and
you know Zhaan what was great ah right
so I that's the way I'd love to see it
happen I was hoping that it would happen
relatively quickly at least for some of
the popular pieces but it doesn't look
like that's necessarily the case but
again I you have to remember they're
like they're working with a much smaller
team as well so that's that's definitely
knew like a lot of people left or got
pushed onto Apollo so I think there's
like three people core mdg and now
there's now there's community maintain
errs to hopefully that helps well what
happens to meteor when they they don't
have
the data system anymore um they're
basically just like a build tool but
it's a bad bill tool right it's not a
great build tool like maybe the Cordova
integration is interesting but I think a
lot of people are feeling like I don't
know like how okay let's ask you build a
start up on Cordova how are you feeling
about react native I know you've you've
dabbled with it I mean I love to have
the time to to rewrite and react native
um can get a much better user user
performance interaction do you feel like
that is because of blazer because of
Cordova or the combination maybe uh it's
it's it's both but but I mean even even
if you were using react or angular 2
even which might even have better
performance than reacting you should
still be situations where you've your
templates for where we're so complex
that that you'd have noticeable delays
on the user so yeah I mean if you're
doing if you're doing something too i'd
definitely recommend react native yeah
but it's kind of funny i also came from
the rails rails and backbone land I
remember curing well I guess pre back on
i remember curing a lot for load load
time page load time and I know read the
experts like Steve solders over that
book was page speed um I just like since
changing the meteor I've been completely
like inured to the I haven't even looked
at the size of my my client payload and
especially with with Cordova like it's
it's already there and that was after
1.3 they're not even you're not even
have to redownload the whole thing
you're only like you're only reef
etching certain files yeah
but you do still have to wait while
those files load into memory while the
app starting and so maybe that's not
terrible but it could be better right
and so I don't know like we we had I did
some work for a company a start-up a y
combinator startup and they were based
on rocket chat and they were doing some
Cordova stuff as well and you know it
just it wasn't good like we were we're
up in like four to five second range
before they would see a UI kind of
rendering on to the phone and is that is
that like their rendering before the
data arrives are they waiting four or
five seconds for the day to arrive they
were waiting for the data to arrive so
like we went in and sped up like the
data arriving and like you weird choices
then that meteor made like they chose
node but they also chose to make all
publications blocking so that was weird
like you you have to wait for
publication to finish its work before
someone else will get a response from
the node server that actually seems kind
of counterintuitive to me like the point
of note is to let it do its event loop
thing and figure out what goes where and
it's not like we're waiting for a return
value from a publication right if you
were that work for us with methods yeah
so and but we have a way to unblock a
method right like they gave us this time
clock so um but there's a good errno to
put a library out that allows yeah I use
that package for from publications and
and I just like the crap out of it and
just made it unblock everything and like
we drop half the load time right there
the other I think the other part is just
you know the files are so large like
they have to load before you can do
things um you mean like like loading
tube by browser reading it off of disk
into memory right yeah I just I just
think of that as like an order of mine
it's faster than then like fetching it
over the network but I just like dirty
and pay attention yeah I don't know I
mean we were still at the point where it
just felt too slow on the phone and this
is just the start up time not like
interacting with it after yeah
yeah yeah like once you got there like
it was fine but you know they everybody
in the land of instant gratification if
you can't get what you want like the
competitors gonna deliberate pastor see
you cry ground huh you try ground DB ah
we did not know they are currently
evaluating other technologies besides
media to see if scale so because I mean
like mobile apps I i think in native
land like you're always storing data on
the client and definitely make sense
that you're opening this multiple times
and you're going to you're going to be
using almost the same for all the same
data from before last night I I think
there's some tricks you can do right
like if you look at slac like there's
some delay the render like an animated
gif and it looks like it's it's loading
the data in and like that would help
some and then right like if if you had
ground BB you can have a little bit of
data there and then like as it's
fetching and updating then the UI can
show the update once it gets it so right
yeah which is similar to like if you
look at Instagram that's how it works
right like I open my Instagram feed the
guys the old ones all at the top and
then it's like fetching and then I know
boom you get the update right right
though yeah that would probably make
sense um but it was a limited project so
we'll see where they go from here but I
don't know like this is an interesting
post to me and I encourage Julian to
continue to find ways that works that
make sense to him I I don't know that it
would make sense to me you know probably
the kicker here is he talks about redox
at the end and it's like I honestly
would be looking pretty hard at Apollo
if i'm already using redux i'm already
using like webpack and react and all
those kinds of things like I just don't
know if asteroid makes a ton of sense to
me do you know what what what Apollo's
gonna recommend for their build system
or the interstate use use meteor or
here's a here's a way to use web pack
for Apollo or well I think you just
there's no real build integration right
like you just pull in the Apollo client
as far as that's concerned I'm back in
there there they've got the Express
integration so you just spin up the
Express server it's gonna serve the
graph ql endpoint you know i think we we
still don't know what real time is gonna
look like for Apollo I think it'll be if
it happens it'll be interesting I just
don't know like to me I think they'll be
able to provide tools that'll say like
you can do you can tell it that there's
a real time update but they're not like
it's not gonna be like as deep as the
Mongo integration is right now with with
meteor but you're playing about real
time in the sense of like polling is
that real time like well yeah by mean
pulleys fine it's just like adding
pulling soon I think up yeah okay it's
just a lot of times it can be a little
expensive on the cpu side so yea which
was a major problem they had early on
with with meteor Mongo which is why they
went to the op loesch um but you know
you look at like you were talking
earlier about their rethink DB change
feed you talking about Mongo ah blog
tailing like everyone does it slightly
differently and so you're gonna have to
like you're probably gonna have these
little drivers that you'll have to build
for each type of database right postgres
triggers sequel triggers to like those
updates coming out those kinds of things
like right it's probably not gonna be
terrible but it does seem like it's
gonna be a lot of work to get each one
of those done so and and maintain them
in a good way yeah but I think it'll be
interesting into me in the long run like
that's kind of what i got my eyeball
yeah I'm excited bad father sure in
regards to this post that's like what
I'm paying attention to so just my take
on it all right well thank you lauren i
really appreciate you stepping in yeah
thanks for having me yeah all right
welcome it you should make the beard
permanent yeah firmness someone else
never like you say no maybe I'll go blue
I don't know I don't know if I like the
mix we'll see looks like someone punched
my nose and it just kind of didn't occur
to me yeah um yeah so as always thank
you to modulus and ocean for sponsoring
the show they helped me hire a staff
behind the scenes so if you are looking
for hosting consider supporting those
those fine organizations um and you know
everyone like your one black chat room I
think you can testify to how awesome it
is from time to time when you're yeah
stuck somewhere and someone's like oh I
know how to fix that in your like boom
that was ten times better than the stack
overflow um but yeah so if you wanna get
in there a patreon patr 0n calm / your
club it's still me to your club um and
once you sign up i can add you to the
slack she's pretty awesome yeah it's for
