welcome crater fans i'm your host josh
owens along with my regular co-host been
Strahan hey what's up buddy hey man I
don't want you you microphone sounds
great this week yeah oh my god this is
terrible oh now now your internets
cutting out Oh Rose first I could just
don't move last week last week was was
your microphone this week's my internet
connection yeah it's funny now so like
Abby didn't didn't tell me my mic was
like sounding garbled and then like we
did a podcast immediately afterwards for
elm for the space dojo show and like
you're like you're Mike sounds terrible
and so I ended up switching to the
regular Mike I I even tried rebooting my
computer and everything and I have no
idea like why that happened it seems to
have been fine ever since then wow
that's wild yeah all right Abby little
sidekick tip you know you gotta say you
gotta say something you guys speak up if
you if you see something say something
this is there to say I mean haha yeah
alright cool very i love it when Abby's
on the show yeah he does a good job oh
yeah like aa bhi we are one big happy
family here around the crater podcast
Dave you know what's interesting is like
so he did the hosting one with me and
then like today you're gonna record the
hosting one with sashko and rohit right
mm-hmm so you'll be kind of hitting the
same topic from a different angle that's
right that's right yep yeah it is very
interesting I just had to I was just
prepping for it before this show I'm
going to be going right into the
transmission show after this one and we
have some great questions lined up nice
yeah like you know one of them in my
mind like reading the forums like I
appreciate Matt replying but at the same
time he says something like no they're
spending 10k week which is that's it's a
really like that's crazy
so I understand like why they want to
shut this down quickly yeah maybe they
could have done like a quick opt-in form
like I'd be happy to say like take all
my crap off the books yeah um yeah okay
so that's like 52 k a year right and
it's like it's like if if you extend
hosting for a month or two oh no oh I'm
sorry I'm sorry that's half a mil yes
yeah Familia yeah yeah so I was doing
the math and that's that's crazy to me
but at the same time like yeah number
didn't change in the week or two since
he went from Lake that's nice gonna be
free forever and we're gonna give it all
fakes to like my question there also was
a hint from other mdg members like going
back more than a month they were asking
about what very popular packages are you
know want to give him free galaxy
hosting yeah and so it's like well if
that conversation was being had then so
but Matt even alluded to now we're like
getting off topic but Matt alluded to
Like Heaven we there was like a
disconnect in communication in MTG yeah
when i get to the bottom of it I'm gonna
see what's up I'm gonna ask I want to
know so we know how much money it's
costing them math and everyone also said
it's it's costing an engineering time
taking features that they want to
introduce to people who are paying for
galaxy and I want to know exactly like
how much time that is you know like we
know the money why don't we know how
much engineering time was and and then
kind of just get some more answers
around that so yeah I don't you know
it's not it's not tiny right like I know
certainly now I probably spent a week
getting my galaxy s set up going on
digital ocean ya know the biggest part
of transmission is like it's just
helping them communicate more you know
yeah I thought we were getting over a
hump where the communication was going
to be better with mdg and
yeah I'm just knocked by this last week
and this oh and like we got three major
things we have to cover that's like
earning on the edge like we have to put
the fire out thats like how do these
things happen uh I don't know you know
and they have marketing people right I
don't know I love I am a large marketing
team do they know I don't know I don't
know what large would kind of mean I
know a couple of them on there i really
like them yeah and you talk to them you
talk to em DG straight on everything
makes sense yeah yeah afterwards it's
purely in the form of communicating
mm-hmm that's where the disconnect as
it's not like I you know someone made a
suggestion we used to have this thing
called Vanguard where it was like top
developers that were using meteor
professionally yeah and you guys would
like me quarterly yeah yeah I don't know
if it's quite quarterly but they were
like there were probably six meetups
that they had there at MDG and I flew
out for two or three em um but like you
know hey there's a lot of people that
are interested in continuing to make
money off of meteor in some way shape or
form right I mean that's where I met
Paul in person from okay grow mm-hmm uh
like just reach out to some of these
people and be like is this terrible is
this good can we tweak this like I'd be
happy to read those releases and tell
you says this is gonna be terrible this
is the thing that eludes me like like
all the tools people the resources all
of its there it's just for some reason
time after time the dots do not get
connected correctly yep it's unfortunate
anyway with a nest we have we have
another transmission show so I can't be
like too hard on them cuz like if
they're perfect at this I want to have
an opportunity to have a podcast very
true so all right so this this week yeah
what are we doing what packets are we in
right now what we're gonna talk about
what you know I had to get your opinion
in here
but thank you thank you very much yeah I
mean you know a lot of people hear your
opinion on the other one too but um yeah
so this week we're gonna talk about an
interesting amalgamation of topics here
we're going to talk about feather jas
gonna it's gonna make you fly me here
1.3 release candidate aqua actually
neither of us are drinking aqua the
moment a little bit some green this this
is sewer aqua this is this was water at
one uh and then Evan you did an ama
which I was quite interesting as well so
hmm alright let's get into it so timid
into it feathers is it feathers feathers
jeaious that's what I've typed yeah
others to yes so this is like two point
oh I think we did a show when one point
it was out right did we we I think we
talked about it we did and then that led
to us being interested in it we found
out that they worked at bateau be and
then we ended up well we talked to him
about you can jess wright done jeaious
done Jeff done Jay us yeah what's going
that that like came after our interest
of feathers yeah yeah I I don't I still
don't remember talking about on the show
maybe we did but I remember you and Dean
doing a lot of research and you talked
to a lot of people up in Chicago and a
lot of people were like we're using
feathers we are very interested in it
yep um to give like people who don't do
not know what feathers is it's it's a
really light way on how to like
implement like real-time back and front
end data sharing whatever same thing as
like what meteor does really and was a
really nice API and and we eat just like
it kind of just like came out of nowhere
to us it seemed like meteor offered the
real-time data right a really nice API
around it and then
so much more in fact like meteor was
developing a huge ecosystem around this
idea feathers was like a few NPM
packages and you have that and it was
like a real like version of meteor and
to us that like that was interesting
because like that seems like a more
viable way to get that feature done
because ultimately it's just a feature
even one whole ecosystem right right um
and it's been interesting to me before
we dive into like to point oh it's been
interesting to me to see where the
messaging has changed a little bit was
with meteor and mdg where they're not
about like real-time data anymore or or
like getting a modern stack really easy
but it's they're pushing for
professional developers a really nice
environment to develop on everything is
taken care for you it's like they keep
you on the happy path from beginning to
end in the end being a production grade
server hosting and that's interesting
because ultimately real-time data is
just a feature it's just a future and it
is but it's also i would say with media
like an expensive feature that's that's
the question yeah so I'd be curious to
see like what's the leak I you know what
I really want i want to see like and i
don't know how to do this but like a
comparable like here's crater running
with the feathers back end instead and
like what what does that look like which
I don't you know without actually taking
the time to get a working app and swap
it out I don't know if that's aI don't
know do you think like it's gonna I
don't think it's a performance boost
kind of thing well so the interesting
thing is they're using Redis to handle
the kind of like the pub sub side of
things my guess is reticence maybe a
little better at their Mongo at this
maybe I don't know there's a lot of
interesting things going on in here so
it's like this it's on top of it just
being like the real-time feature like we
all like in meteor
all stuff on top of that they have
things that have plagued the media
community from day one which is the
ability to be data store agnostic yeah
you could you could put any kind of back
in right they claim to have over 15 and
they have multiple different ORM layers
which you know meteor comes out every
time it comes up and they're like we're
not doing or I'm later yeah but then you
know the probably the funniest part
about that is there creating an ORM
layer for the accounts package right now
I stumbled across that last night hmm
and that's that's an interesting project
but you gotta do it if you're going to
support multiple databases there's
really like you gotta have a singular
interface that you can interact with ya
on top of it like this is it's not
trying to take over everything so you
could use feathers where you want in
your m and you don't have to have things
be reactive on other parts so it's
interesting i haven't dovin to two point
O at all and this article that we're
going to be linking to kind of seems
like a basic overview of feathers not
necessarily like specifically talking
about 2 2 point 0 features right so I
think like they're trying to still get
market share and two point O seems like
a pretty solid release yeah so yeah I
mean you know I sometimes I wonder about
like the the version number and
conventions right because they had
that's what makes me think here but
we're at version 15 of react now after
we were at Siena Oakland one for it and
we're at version 5 of node I don't know
I mean like it's it's interesting
because they're they're saying they're
making some breaking changes hopefully
that's what they're doing and I i don't
know like this this has been enough to
capture my attention and i plan on
building at least react native app
that's backed with this because i have a
feeling it's going to be easier
trying to use meteor to do that um and
frankly like it's just I don't know I
think feathers is what meteor wants to
be now yeah you know like I saw the post
from well ask oh I wouldn't say that
well I saw a post from sashko and he
said we're working towards being
lightweight easy to use like easy to
swap things out that kind of thing and I
think they're already there right there
using express instead of connect and
they're using NPM instead of their own
package system and like you know there's
there's some amount of pain that's going
to come along for people that adopt a
meteor then we switch from at the
current package system to mpm yeah I
think um yeah I think the software
version of mdg and like Apollo and
everything they're gonna try and achieve
what feathers does so I agree with you
on that mm-hmm absolutely which is great
like it that's what I been predicting
like forever because I've always been
saying meteor feels like a cult you know
needs to join the rest of the modern
JavaScript and and they're doing that
they're and now I'm more passionate than
ever for meteor and you and I like like
we seriously were wondering like what's
the next thing for meteor like a couple
months back where like if things don't
change you know there's like we see some
serious consequences so yeah well you
know and I said I I wholeheartedly
believe they're they're pivoting into
Apollo pretty hard so I think you know
it you probably see more of what you're
seeing like this the meteor accounts
repo you'll see more projects like that
where they're trying to rely on outside
people to do the work and hopefully you
know we get some better stuff out of it
but at the same time like there were
someone someone posted this post about
feathers two point oh and they link to
the product hunt which it was they were
like shots fired because it was like a
truly open source real-time JavaScript
framework yeah
which you know you won't feel like if
you're coming from meteor you like here
I can't get what they're saying here let
me I'm curious ah let's do the
contributor thing here oh yeah it's
really terrible actually um truly well
you said truly open source so we got a
lot of help right you get the total
number but I did look in like the 22
coding that we're like at the top of
that list yeah but I would agree that
there they are not trying they're
building a part of the car they're not
built in the car manufacturing factory I
would have to say that media MTG is
trying to create this whole car
manufacturing factory and feathers is
just like the part of the car it's like
it's like a super charger plugged into
an already existing engine and other
like it's built on top of what other
parts this is this is failing i'm not
i'm not buying your your analogy ok so
which part like you're saying like
they're building an engine and this is
like top coming into like it like mg you
basically you're saying i'm building the
highway i think not like they're still
both building cars it's just mdgs also
building the highway so you can go nice
and sentenced yeah yeah MDGs building
cars but also they're building a plant
that builds the cars they're like
building the whole infrastructure like
everything from nuts nuts to bolt or
whatever they come it's a super
aggressive vision and i don't know like
very few companies execute something
that big well that's what I'm saying
like we've always said like meteors been
a very ambitious project I don't either
plugs into stuff that's already there
it's just it's like a couple hundred
lines of code you know it uses it's
built on top of express socket i/o and
Primus like they don't it's a different
they're achieving a similar thing as
meteor in it in a much much different
way it's almost like guerrilla warfare
that's a better analogy whoa pair yours
the colonists you and I maybe have
review on it right like my guess is
these guys are building apps and
abstracting the framework out yeah
whereas meteors building the framework
and the tooling and then trying to
figure out how to make it better for app
developers so exactly so you know the
interesting pieces of me again are like
yes and you know that the fact that it's
already tied into mpm you know like
connect us is I don't think it's being
super maintained anymore and then you
have like this oddity that sin fibers
and like there's a whole lot of choices
that were made a meteor that are keeping
us at 0 10 just say yeah purposeful
silence mm-hmm I'm done with the
analogies for today okay that's probably
good Oh failure yeah I don't you know
for the life of me well now that we like
totally banged meteor 11 contributors
right so now that there's not a lot
there's 11 there's two there's two real
contributors 31 commits per contributor
I'm just using the same calculations we
used on the other ones yeah yeah but
yeah you're right like everybody that's
not part of core right the two guys kind
of pushing it forward fall under that
that mark um but I still think that's
that's a healthy ratio definitely LC
ratio I think meteors going to be able
whether more storms because I got like a
dedicated developer group towards
developing this stuff and the I are
working on the side there full-time
developers at the Toby building sites
for like Walmart and stuff so yeah you
know you say that though but I I almost
think like looking at the this accounts
package that i ran across last night and
they're working to refactor the whole
thing I actually feel like everything
that's being proposed and being worked
on is by the people of rockets at not by
the people at MDG
and I feel like in the end that'll
probably be a stronger set of packages
because it's not just mdg hired people
like we're getting exposure from outside
of mdg the company to work on this and
and i gotta say like there's again i
don't i was up very very late and it was
very very angry last night there's a lot
of inconsistencies in the accounts set
of packages so now that you're I'm happy
to see it I think it's good that we're
getting outside community involvement
and I think that you know feathers but
I'm just gonna go places too I don't
know is it going to be the Sinatra 22
mdgs rails here or something like that
maybe mmm yeah there's your analogy oh
so much better you're so much better man
okay let's move on I hate you Josh yeah
you know what honestly we get to have a
whole whole bunch of fun I got these
guys scheduled for next week for a space
dojo show haven't even told you that yet
but yeah what I was just gonna recommend
that yeah we're totally gonna have them
on the show we're gonna talk to both the
guys if you can't make it rains he can
fill in between here wait a minute here
they're here in Chicago right are they I
thought they were in Canada who are we
talking about here devil David David I
did feather Lewicki yeah he's in
Vancouver he works for bateau be but
he's in Vancouver and eric is in Calgary
Eric Kreisky I probably butchered those
what yeah they're in Canada bro all
right sorry it's your favorite place
right oh hey announcement for everyone
everyone thinks I live in Toronto ah
that's that is everyone I live in
Chicago I live in Chicago shy town it
looks it looks Toronto esque behind you
maybe that's why does it I don't have a
message for building downtown in the
loop right next to oh I know it being
dyed Chicago River oh yeah it's still
green it's always green actually it's
like extra green though for st.
Patrick's Day is extra green yes yeah
they throw die in there I can't I went
up there for st. Patrick's Day one time
and it was quite impressive mm-hmm so
you you're eating green fish for a month
and then you're like oh oh get it you
should need fish all right I don't know
what kind of fish you're eating haha
alright so meteor 1.3 release client
release candidate yes whoops really use
a number when you drink it yeah so we so
we just like totally like gave meteor
hard time what I did but this is likely
dude this is a perfect segue into 1.3
because a lot of the issues that we were
just mentioning that plagued meteor
earlier versions of meteor mmm I think
you dropped they are now having mpm
support in there they have testing built
in and what is why am I like losing your
gear back okay dude where was I yeah you
talking about the md mmm p.m. support
stoom a three-letter acronyms yeah but
now like meteor is they're recognizing
that they need to move more into like to
JavaScript the normal JavaScript world
yeah yeah and this is like this is where
feathers kind of did it right where and
where meteor could do better and now 1.3
is is a right at our door
step and it is a major milestone a major
step forward in that right direction
yeah I would agree i think the ampm
support is pretty huge like i cannot i
don't think i can set enough for that
personally like being able to just pull
in a moment and no longer rely on a
silly rapper package is pretty awesome
and like we don't have to go bug a bunch
of package maintainer excuse me to add
some script or something to help build
for meteor like that's that like I'm
glad that people took on that effort you
know Luca and Dan and a couple other
people like have that whole project to
auto bild like bootstrap or moment or
those kinds of things but now we don't
have to worry about that um yeah well
maybe which traps a bad example yeah
because now you're talking about like
CSS and compiling and pre pre compilers
and preprocessors and all its dutch
which is borked 41.3 yes they're
actually yeah yeah I lost some time on
that but you know I I think looking
they've got a nice list too if you
haven't seen it yet it's like post 1.3
issues which not sure I fully agree with
adding new stuff and 131 but it looks
like they're gonna push more stuff after
group 13 they're gonna try to get a 131
out within a couple weeks that census
can you hear me yeah I'm trying to
decide if you're trolling me or not no
I'm totally not oh that has me fired up
so I just had to throw it in there yeah
I I said my piece on the video forums
about census I you know here's the thing
like if I were trying to get funding for
a company I would absolutely go build
something like census and I would
absolutely stick unique IDs on every
application ever created automatically
over and over again even if you do
the ID like those are the actions I
would probably take to help me have the
data I need to go get more funding
mm-hmm and I feel like census is even
taking it a step further they're gonna
be able to figure out like IP addresses
where they're being hosted they're gonna
be able to like plug plug a lot of this
data in and be like hey will host you
over here right we'll give you a free
trial like it'sit's definitely yeah it
feels I don't want to say Shamar me but
mm not a hundred percent right either
especially like installing sensible so
another plug for transmission maybe I
was trolling you I'd even realize it
subconsciously yeah you were why not you
noticed this I'm a natural troll I guess
you can call me out from now on on it
because I need to walking eyes when in
trouble but like another plug we have
Zoltan on this show and who's ahead of
the meteor group now or project for MTG
and we're going to be talking
specifically on census and what they
were thinking and and why they actually
needed to do this if there was a better
way to do it try to get a better idea of
like their the frame of mind yeah
releasing this so yeah i just i think
you know if this forgotten if this were
done by other companies you know apple
says like can we use some anonymized
data to make this better but like an IP
address is not anonymize data no no no I
could I mean Apple Apple collect stuff
and they highly depend on on what
version of the OS is you're running on
because they make that like a pretty big
spot in their announcements talking
about user adoption and upgrades and how
it's better than the average so I can
see like meteor wine to do that yeah I
don't I don't really have a huge problem
with collecting some data I just I wish
it were more a front more explicit more
understanding around what they're going
to do
with the data you know I don't I don't
necessarily think they have to tell us
what they're gonna do with the data but
at least don't make it private data like
there was it was a good bit i would
consider sticker I don't necessarily
want to share with them yeah yes but
that's not making it into 13 no but you
were mentioning 1131 yes yes which that
probably will make it in a version of it
yes not the current one because luckily
they are receptive to to everything that
that was set in the forums yeah there's
46 open issues in this list I was
talking about four post 13 but you know
like if we if we focus on I'm actually
kind of curious now history the next
yeah they haven't bought they have a
bother to start writing the history of
the change logs for this yet but there's
there's a lot going in but I think the
biggest thing to me is going to be that
that mpm support in the modules support
right like that goes hand in hand to say
you know import blah blah blah from this
file I think you know now that I've been
working with it for like a month or so I
like it a lot better like it's maybe it
feels like more typing but at the same
time when i open up file i know what's
what's being used in that file and can
make sure that I don't know that now you
can like grep or do a search for where
its reference like I think it's it's
going to be a lot better for tooling and
just for general developer experience I
agree I agree and people need to
understand like how to structure their
app in order to achieve this in the
right way oh definitely want to push
people to the meteor guide to understand
1.3 yeah yeah there's gonna be some
interesting stuff there I don't know
that I wholeheartedly agree with
everything the meteor guide but there
it's definitely a good project yeah yeah
most definitely well in order to like
get the correct imports and everything
you need to structure your folders
correct way so along with the module
support like that makes testing a whole
lot easier so finally meteors testing
story is really gonna be legit yeah okay
so I still don't want to touch it for
like another month or so I'm curious
what do you mean by that I saw that
tweet they I just I think I'd rather
wait for other package developers to get
involved and like say yeah we officially
support 1.3 here's how to do it like I
don't like I have spent so much of my
recent life history and meteor testing
in one form or another that I just feel
like I've lost so much time every time
something changes like I just want to
wait until it feels stable it does not
feel stable okay like we're still just
won't release removed from saying
velocity is dead I mean it works 12 it's
not gonna work 13 um I don't know tis I
just I'm gonna wait okay maybe next
month I'll start writing some tests for
a client if they want you know and in
like for some context for people who are
listening like like I understand I know
exactly what you mean when you see
because I know what you've done before
like yeah you had the testing book yeah
you and Sam worked together on a
professional like course yeah we've
given that training twice things change
one hundred percent between the two
courses which were a time a months apart
and then we actually had a video version
ready to go that we were gonna release
and so and like less than a month after
the class you know like everything
changed again and then what was it
December we decided last he was dead so
he gave the class in August by September
you know we had synchronous support and
cucumber then we switched to chimp now
velocities dead well and you know unit
testing and end-to-end testing like you
could you could use mainstream stuff
like you don't need anything meteor iced
yeah yeah but you still do to some
extent right there like there's they
wrote this mocha driver package
so I guess that's what I'm waiting on is
for people to say like yeah we got a
driver packages taken care of like you
don't worry about that that is
interesting yep yeah yeah so we
transmission did a show last week about
testing driver packages was a big thing
I'm like you know yep who's gonna make
this stuff yeah exactly and I don't you
know again like now we're looking at
something akin to a rapper package that
lives on atmosphere like I get that you
have to do some amount of work to get it
to work with meteor but for me like if
you are thinking about testing up
looking at enzyme or something you know
like let's just stay up the meteor stuff
until it's it feels stable mm-hmm but
that like worry we'll get better I will
yeah it will get better that's why was
gonna say too long didn't read the
transmission show ended up being that
you know meteor didn't want to like
build specialized tools for testing they
want to make it meteor capable of just
using the tools that area out there
right and that's a right cool that's a
huge message to yeah that's the right
message yeah so it will get better yeah
all right talking about getting better
sharing contact information mmm right
like it's such a pain yes oh so here in
Chicago we are you know where Chicagoans
we we do things the old way man and and
uh business cards are really important
out here right well okay grow has has a
strict policy no business cards no no
strict but I've been pushing for him and
I haven't gotten home so so what do I do
you know I fuddle around with the phones
we try to make a linkedin connection it
just doesn't work out so then we just
you know we just don't connect that much
well our boy max Savin came out with a
solution ah called aqua this is saved in
there seven I always thought it was
seven I don't know my I'm just gonna say
it's my shot my Chicago excellent yeah
okay yeah all right Max is saving a lot
no it's like it's like Aquaman right
yeah Banda he's the man of a million uh
like nicknames
and a man anyway so if you guys recall
max was the creator of meteor toys mmm
yeah yeah so he is now introducing agua
which is a way to kind of share social
contact information easily and it's a
mobile app built on meteor and yeah so I
think it's aqua nagwa right again
Chicago accent acquaintances us must be
like this must be like a comparison
between Illinois and Ohio yeah yeah or
or been in the slip totally trolling you
back today so number one I think this is
interesting you know he's built this
meteor app I think using Cordova and I
know not like he showed it off to me i
think it's a it's a fun idea mmm you
know he said he plans to take a deeper
but the idea is like you know when you
meet someone instead of passing off the
business card you just you get their
email address and like it'll send your
digital business card to them and then
you kind of have all that that point of
contact in place which is interesting I
remember Evernote did something similar
to this a while ago uh where you could
put people in and like it would try to
suss out their information on its own
like you would put in you take their
picture and put in their email address
the name and then it would like try to
figure out the rest you know there was
an app that got a little bit of social
lift to where it was like called bumper
stomach day like yeah bones together
yeah I used to have that yeah bluetooth
yeah you know the bump part of it was
goofy but whatever um not really needed
um yeah I don't know it's it's
interesting you know what I think would
be super fun is like you take someone's
picture and try to figure out then
conceptual media or something oh my gosh
it's a doable it's totally doable oh my
gosh it's so creepy and doable yeah yeah
so you know I I'll say this like I've
gotten good at finding people on the
internet my sister-in-law she was dating
some people and she was using dating
site and she'd be like I don't can you
guys find more info about these people
and I'd be like you had you send me
their profile and like you know just
using their picture you could usually go
find all there's like they're you know
they're dating com well remember what
site it was but you could do a lot of
creepy thing oh my gosh he just like
cyber-shot everyone know that you're
yeah that you're creepster tell me we're
talking about avatar photos and all that
stuff we have a great member in the
meteor club and he changed his avatar so
finally see a face and and I had to coax
the guy to do it I really appreciate him
but my what I was going to give back was
was a shout-out on the show if he did it
and he finally did it so so much love to
you SEF yes chef yeah with this it's
Harry Potter looking picture dude it's
cool man i think is like it it is but
it's like it's got like
the train is trolling you so bad no open
today if you're watching the youtubers
and you see it over there like 10 times
louder now but you know he's got like a
little pointy hood on it's quite funny
um but uh was glad he finally did that
because he was just like this you like
no one knew what he look like no no and
he kind of he kind of was saying like my
photo is nowhere on the Internet yeah so
I keep like you can't do a photo sir
Janet yeah exactly that's exactly anyway
well I think we're only like maybe a
year away like the NSA probably has
detected Lake really do a deep search
and be like yes we spotted him across
all these cameras remember when Android
was and I didn't ever had any injury I
don't know more mm-hmm you cut now man
for owned by just smiling and it what
was that you seen Batman hello lost Ben
are you bet oh my gosh am i back yeah
you seem back just don't move on the
camera too much oh my gosh were you able
to hear my voice a whole time yeah I was
like it was like all electronic like
that's what happens when you mention NSA
yeah geez that's what happens to you I
was gonna say like Android had that
feature where you can smile at your
phone it would do a facial recognition
unlock the phone mmm so so no swiping
note no code yeah you know it's funny we
actually when I was at gaslight this is
way back when we had a client that came
in and wanted to basically do that that
same thing before I Android did it and
like they had all this this different
stuff going on like they were able to
use the phone light to like
to the color on the face and then they
would be able to run the facial
recognition and phone software it was a
really really interesting project but
they didn't get funding um but no I like
I like the idea of a quad your social
business card I guess it doesn't
actually say business card if nothing
else go read this post because there's a
funny picture of Trump at the end so and
and go ahead and download the app that
20 max is max is huge on feedback so
yeah so minimal uh check it out on
product hunt yes tweet him tober good
stuff alright the last last topic of the
day we have in you previously with
meteor development group so mdg staffer
and he is known for view Jas he's the
creator and maintainer of UJS and he had
an AMA he did I'm hash note I had never
even heard of hash node so it was very
interesting to go overnight yeah go read
all this but you know that the thing I
always found interesting about the Evan
you hired is like why why did we hire a
guy heading up another project that
wasn't react or wasn't blaze to come
work on meteor like I get maybe he had
some no I died I don't even think he'd
have a lot of insight right to like how
to support multiple front-end frameworks
the key would have to also develop that
insight like just because I write a
front-end framework doesn't mean I know
how to like easily let other frameworks
do the same thing meteor right yeah yeah
did you agree with that maybe he was
coming in to be like the maintainer
ablaze who knows what the plans were
yeah well you know and that's the other
interesting thing I found out is like
there was no hoorah about it but it was
more than just three people that left
meteor in that last round with Evan
David Greenspan is also one
we now know about which you know he he
pushed blaze forward quite a bit it was
a big project him when it came out so we
did lose some knowledge there on the mdg
team uh yeah I don't know like he it's
just really really interesting to read a
lot of these answers but really that I
think the the core one as a meteor fan
you might care about is you know aza
Matt asked this is a little personal but
what happened to meteor what are your
future plans is your newborn girl or boy
and he said yes I left meteor there's a
it was a combination of quite a few
things meteors of framework is now front
end agnostic which makes the front end
work mostly just integrating react and
angular and the company doesn't seem
interested in supporting view
strategically so again like I question
why they hire him um I mean I realize
like he's a smart guy like you want to
hire smart people at the same time like
clearly his passion was somewhere else
and mediator as a company is now
primarily positioned as a platform as a
service and the focus of company has an
increasing producing Lee smaller overlap
with my technical interest which i think
would probably apply to avital and David
greens fan as well you know like
building a hosting business is just
calling a run of the mill yeah yeah I'm
kind of interesting and then he said
view is growing faster than he thought
the internet this is crazy so I find it
interesting that he said view is growing
faster than he thought yeah I think it's
all based off of the support that uh all
the passionate believers have what like
I hear of UJS more than more than I I i
ever would you know i would i would
think i would hear of blaze more
in the world and view j/s just seems to
be like taking off yeah it's interesting
I mean I would agree with that but at
the same time like the only way you can
get blazed right now is to you know
install meteor and it's just not true of
angular or react or view so yeah again
like you just mentioned that like like
view is in the same competition with
angular and react yeah I could that's
another reason why here it's like kind
of surprising so yeah anyway you know I
don't know I don't want to say too much
about it but this I think this is worth
going to read especially if like you
know you like Evan or you ran across him
in the forums or in an issue like I I
think he's an interesting guy to follow
and honestly I want to try to get him on
to talk more about view j/s on space
dojo show as well absolutely Evans a
really interesting guy I really enjoyed
listening or reading his answers and
yeah he had a really good perspective on
everything and he seems like an insanely
working like an insane dude that like
works all hours to like get stuff out
the door so yeah he said like trying to
find it now somewhere in here like all
there was to go back come on that
basically he would be up till like 28 1
or 2 a.m. every night like in addition
to his normal job like trying to to yeah
it is how do you manage building and
supporting a successful library outside
of your day job have you considered
having a company sponsor your
development work he said it does take a
lot of time and effort I think during
the 1 point 0 release process I worked
until 12 2 a.m. almost every day but I
guess the biggest reason is because I'm
passionate about it so I enjoy working
on it most of the time I definitely hope
some company would sponsor he's actually
started at patreon so you can go look up
the article if you want to support him
mm-hmm um it's just it's it's really
interesting to me and you know
I've had subsequent I think we had a
subsequent conversation in space dojo
chat room talking about like how do you
how do you make an open source project
successful you know like Sasha talks
about struggling with getting
contributors on board with telescope and
you know I think you hear similar
problems right like people are
interested in working with meteor but
like what's the size of the user base
like there's 8,000 people on the forums
um so like that's a large user base and
how many contributors potential
contributors do you find out of that you
know we've got like 260 or something
mm-hmm that's a pretty small number so
it's uh it's very very hard to grow an
open source project yeah another guy
down the list ask him about the bus
factor you know if Evan yeah i'm making
view jas like and so it's interesting
you guys should definitely check out
this web page and see what Evans answer
is to that yeah I like the guy he
definitely tell that he is like super
smart super ambitious and mdg really
only hires those type of people so yes
yeah all right cool wrap it up we were
mom we did today holy cow so right you
know I'm these guys aren't sponsoring
but I got a composed I of a t-shirt too
that's cool shirt yeah I like it 8-bit
uh so this this week sponsors are
digital ocean and modulus that I oh so
if you looking for hosting both of those
are great options I host sites at both
places check them out and then if you
want to directly support me the show the
chatroom crater all that kind of stuff
you can go to patreon or Aon calm /
meteor club I really should figure out a
flying change that to space Tojo um and
10 bucks a month I'll get you into the
chat room and I still it still blows my
mind how awesome that chat room is
simply the best 1 i'm part of but i'm
i'm also biased besides my company
chatroom that's the only one I really
pay attention to nice nice just because
of the quality of what gets posted and
the people who are in there so i bet i
bet if if we got some slack stats you
probably pay more attention to space
dojo than ok grow though uh no not true
you're gonna say that I I gotta say ok
grow is like I hear it's pretty funny it
is a hilarious slack room like we have
such a fun time yeah it's actually i
think it's it's higher than hmm nice if
it were just full of goofballs i can't
believe we get worked on alright guys

be back next week talking about all the
crater news see ya ow this video has
