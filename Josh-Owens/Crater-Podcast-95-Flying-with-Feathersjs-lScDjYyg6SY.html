welcome crater fans I'm your host Josh
Owens along with my regular co-host Ben
Strahan hey what's up buddy hey man I
don't want your microphone sounds great
this week yeah oh my god does terrible
oh now your new Nets cutting out Oh
throws first I could just don't move
last week last week was was your
microphone this week's my internet
connection yeah it's funny so like Abby
didn't didn't tell me my mic was like
sounding garbled and then like we did a
podcast immediately afterwards for Elm
for the space dojo show and like you're
like your mic sounds terrible and so I
ended up switching to the regular mic I
I even tried rebooting my computer and
everything and I have no idea
like why that happened it seems to have
been fine ever since then wow that's
wild
yeah all right Abby little sidekick tip
you know you gotta say you gotta say
something you guys speak up if you if
you see something say something
this is there to say I mean yeah all
right cool I love it when Abby's on the
show yeah he does a good job we are one
big happy family here on the creator
podcast Dave you know what's interesting
is like so he did the hosting one with
me and then like today you're gonna
record the hosting one with sashko and
Rohit right mm-hmm
so you'll be kind of hitting the same
topic from a different angle that's
right that's right yeah yeah it is very
interesting I just had to I was just
prepping for it before this show I'm
gonna be going right into the
transmission show after this one and we
have some great questions lined up nice
yeah like you know one of them in my
mind like reading the forums like I
appreciate it Matt replying but at the
same time he says something like you
know they're spending 10k a week which
is that's insane
really like that's crazy
so I understand like why they want to
shut this down quickly yeah maybe they
could have done like a quick opt-in form
like I'd be happy to say like take all
my crap off the books yeah um yeah okay
so that's like 52k a here right it's
like it's like if if you extend hosting
for a month or two no no oh I'm sorry
I'm sorry
that's half a mil yes yeah yeah yeah so
he's doing the math and that's that's
crazy to me but at the same time like
number didn't change in the week or two
since he went from like that's nights
gonna be free forever and we're gonna
give it all fakes too like it's my
question there also was a hint from
other MDG members like going back more
than a month they were asking about what
very popular packages are you know wanna
give him free galaxy hosting yeah and so
it's like well if that conversation was
being had then so but Matt even alluded
to now we're like getting off-topic but
Matt alluded to like heaven we there was
like a disconnect in communication in
MDG yeah when we get to the bottom of it
I'm gonna see what's up I'm gonna ask I
want to know so we know how much money
it's costing them Matt and everyone also
said it's it's costing an engineering
time taking through features that they
want to introduce to people who are
paying for galaxy I want to know exactly
like how much time that is you know like
we know the money why don't we know how
much engineering time was and and then
kind of just get some more answers
around that so yeah I don't you know
it's it's not it's not tiny right like I
know certainly I probably spent a week
getting my galaxy s set up going on
digital ocean you know the biggest part
of transmission is like it's just
helping them communicate more you know
yeah I thought we were getting over a
hump where the communication was going
to be better with MDG
yeah I'm just shocked by this last week
and this and like we got three major
things we have to cover
that's like earning on the edge like we
have to put the fire out that's like how
do these things happen I don't know you
know and they have marketing people
right I love I am a large marketing team
do they know I don't know I don't know
what large would kind of mean I know a
couple of them on there I really like
them yeah and you talk to them you talk
to MDG straight on everything makes
sense yeah afterwards it's purely in the
form of communicating mm-hmm that's
where the disconnect is it's not like I
you know someone made a suggestion we
used to have this thing called Vanguard
where it was like top developers that
were using meteor professionally yeah
and you guys would like me quarterly
yeah I don't know if it's quite
quarterly but they were like there are
probably six meetups that they had there
at MDG and I flew it up for two or three
mm but like you know hey there's a lot
of people that are interested in
continuing to make money off of meteor
in some way shape or form right I mean
that's where I met Paul in person from
okay grow mm-hmm
like just reach out to some of these
people and be like is this terrible is
this good can we tweak this like I'd be
happy to read those releases and tell
you this is terrible this is the thing
that eludes me like like all the tools
people the resources all of its there
mm-hmm it's just for some reason time
after time the dots do not get connected
correctly yep it's unfortunate anyway
well we have we have another
transmission show so I can't be like too
hard on them cuz like if they're perfect
at this I want to have an opportunity to
have a podcast very true all right this
week yeah what are we doing what podcast
are we in right now we're gonna talk
about well you know I had to get your
opinion in here
but thank you thank you very much yeah I
mean you know a lot of people hear your
opinion on the other one too but yeah so
this week we're gonna talk about an
interesting amalgamation of topics here
we're going to talk about feather J ass
gonna it's gonna make you fly me here
1.3 release candidate aqua actually
neither of us for drinking aqua at the
moment a little bit some green this is
sewer aqua this is this was water at one
and then Evan you did an AMA which I was
quite interesting as well so mm-hmm
alright let's get into it so feathers is
it feathers feathers Jess that's what
typed yeah others yes so this is like
2.0 I think we did a show when one point
was out right did we we I think we
talked about it we did and then that led
to us being interested in it we found
out that they worked at bateau B and
then we ended up well we talked to him
about can you can Jess Wright done Jas
done Jeff done J is that like came after
our interest of feathers yeah yeah I I
don't I still don't remember talking
about in the show maybe we did but I
remember you and Dean doing a lot of
research and you talked to a lot of
people up in Chicago and a lot of people
are like we're using feathers we were
very interested in it yep
to give like people who don't do not
know what feathers is it's it's a really
light way on how to like implement like
real time back in front end data sharing
whatever same thing as like what meteor
does really and was a really nice API
and and we it just like it kind of just
like came out of nowhere to us it seemed
like meteor offered the real-time data
right a really nice API around it and
then
so much more in fact like meteor was
developing a huge ecosystem around this
idea feathers was like a few NPM
packages and you have that and it was
like a real like version of meteor and
to us that like that was interesting
because like that seems like a more
viable way to get that feature done
because ultimately it's just a feature
even whole ecosystem right right and
it's been interesting to me before we
dive into like 2.0 it's been interesting
to me to see where the messaging has
changed a little bit was with meteor and
MDG where they're not about like
real-time data anymore or or like
getting a modern stack really easy but
it's they're pushing for professional
developers a really nice environment to
develop on everything is taking care for
you
it's like they keep you on the happy
path from beginning to end in the end
being production grade server hosting
and that's interesting because
ultimately real-time data is just a
feature it's just a future and it is but
it's also I would say with meteor like
an expensive feature that's that's the
question yeah so I'd be curious to see
like what's the leak I you know what I
really want I want to see like I don't
know how to do this but like it
comparable like here's crater running
with the feathers backend instead and
like what does that look like which I
don't you know without actually taking
the time to get a working app and swap
it out I don't know if that's I don't
know do you think like it's gonna I
don't think it's a performance boost
kind of thing well so the interesting
thing is that are using Redis to handle
the kind of like the pub/sub side of
things
my guess is Redis is maybe a little
better at their Mongo at this maybe I
don't know there's a lot of interesting
things going on in here so it's like
this it's on top of it just being like
the real-time feature like we all like
in meteor
stuff on top of that they have things
that have plagued the media community
from day one which is the ability to be
data store agnostic yeah you could you
could put any kind of back end right
they claim to have over 15 and they have
multiple different ORM layers which you
know mediator comes out every time it
comes up and they're like we're not
doing or I'm later yeah but then you
know probably the funniest part about
that is they're creating an ORM layer
for the accounts package right now I
stumbled across that last night mm-hmm
and that's that's an interesting project
but you got to do it if you're gonna
support multiple databases there's
really like you gotta have a singular
interface that you can interact with
yeah on top of it like this is it's not
trying to take over everything so you
could use feathers where you want in
your app and you don't have to have
things be reactive on other parts so
it's interesting I haven't Dovan 22.0 at
all and this article that we're going to
be linking to kind of seems like a basic
overview of feathers not necessarily
like specifically talking about to 2.0
features right so I I think like they're
trying to still get market share and 2.0
seems like a pretty solid release yeah
yeah I mean you know I I wonder about
like the the version number and
conventions right because they yeah
that's what makes me think here we're at
we're at version 15 of react now after
we were at sea and we're at version 5 of
node I don't know I mean like it's it's
interesting because they're they're
saying they're making some breaking
changes hopefully that's what they're
doing and I I don't know like this this
has been enough to capture my attention
and I plan on building at least react
native app that's backed with this
because I have a feeling it's going to
be easier
trying to use meteor to do that and
frankly like it's just I don't know I I
think feathers is what meteor wants to
be now yeah you know like I saw the post
from well I wouldn't say that well I saw
post from sashko and he said we're
working towards being lightweight
easy-to-use like easy to swap things out
that kind of thing and I think they're
already there right they're using
Express instead of connect and they're
using NPM instead of their own package
system and like you know there's there's
some amount of pain that's going to come
along for people that adopt a meteor
then we switch from the current package
system to NPM yeah I think yeah I think
the software version of MDG and like
Apollo and everything they're gonna try
and achieve what feathers does so I
agree with you on that
mm-hmm absolutely which is great like in
that's what I been predicting like
forever because I've always been saying
meteor feels like a cult you know and
you said join the rest of the modern
JavaScript and and they're doing that
there and now I'm more passionate than
ever for meteor and you and I like like
we seriously were wondering like what's
the next thing for meteor like a couple
months back we're like if things don't
change you know there's like we see some
serious consequences so yeah well you
know and I I said I I wholeheartedly
believe they're they're pivoting into
Apollo pretty hard so I think you know
it you probably see more of what you're
seeing like this the meteor accounts
repo you'll see more projects like that
where they're trying to rely on outside
people to do the work and hopefully you
know we get some better stuff out of it
but at the same time like there were
someone someone posted this post about
feathers 2.0 and they linked to the
product hunt which it was they were like
shots fired because it was like a truly
open source real-time JavaScript
framework yeah
which you know you won't feel like if
you're coming from meteor you like here
I can't get what they're saying here's
let me I'm curious
let's do the contributor thing here oh
yeah it's really terrible actually truly
oh well you said truly open source so we
got a lot you get the total number but I
did look in like the - - yeah we're like
at the top of that list yeah but I would
agree that there they are not trying
they're building a part of the car
they're not built in the car
manufacturing Factory I would have to
say that media MDGs trying to create
this whole car manufacturing Factory and
feathers is just like the part of the
car it's like it's like a super charger
plugged into an already existing engine
and other like it's built on top of what
other parts this is this is failing I'm
not I'm not buying your your analogy
okay so which part like you're saying
like they're building an engine and this
is like coming into like it like mg you
basically you say building the highway I
think not like they're still both
building cars
it's just MDGs also building the highway
so you can go nice and fast yeah yeah
MDGs building cars but also they're
building a plant that builds the cars
they're like building the whole
infrastructure like everything from nuts
nuts to bolts or whatever very few
companies execute something that big
well that's what I'm saying like we've
always said like meteors been a very
ambitious project plugs into stuff
that's already there it's just it's like
a couple hundred lines of code you know
it uses it's built on top of express
socket IO and Primus like they don't
it's a different they're achieving a
similar thing as meteor in a in a much
much different way it's almost like
guerrilla warfare that's a better
analogy where yours the colonists you
and I'm maybe
different view on it right like my guess
is these guys are building apps and
abstracting the framework out yeah
whereas meteor is building the framework
and the tooling and then trying to
figure out how to make it better for app
developers so exactly so you know the
interesting pieces of me again are like
yes and you know the fact that it's
already tied into NPM you know like
connectors is I don't think it's being
super maintained anymore and then you
have like this oddity that's in fibers
and like there's a whole lot of choices
that were made in meteor that are
keeping us at zero ten just saying
purposeful silence I'm done with the
analogies for today yeah I don't you
know for the life of me but now that we
like totally banged meteor eleven
contributors right so now there's not a
lot there's eleven is two there's two
real contributors thirty one commits per
contributor I'm just using the same
calculations we used on the other ones
yeah but yeah you're right like
everybody that's not part of core right
the two guys kind of pushing it forward
all under that that mark but I still
think that's that's a healthy ratio
definitely healthy ratio I think meteors
gonna be able weather more storms
because they got like a dedicated
developer group towards developing this
stuff and these are working on the side
they're full-time developers at the tobe
building sites for like Walmart and
stuff so yeah you know you say that
though but I I almost think like looking
at the this accounts package and then I
ran across last night and they're
working to refactor the whole thing I
actually feel like everything that's
being proposed and being worked on is by
the people of rocket chat not by the
people at MDG
and I feel like in the end that'll
probably be a stronger set of packages
because it's not just MDG hired people
like we're getting exposure from outside
of MDG the company to work on this and
and I gotta say like there's I don't I
was up very very late it was very very
angry last night there's a lot of
inconsistencies in the accounts set of
packages so now that you're I'm I'm
happy to see it I think it's good that
we're getting outside community
involvement and I think that you know
feathers but I'm just gonna go places
too I don't know is it going to be the
Sinatra to mdgs rails here or something
like that maybe mmm yeah they're sure
now jeez
so much better there's so much better
man okay let's move on you know honestly
we get to have a whole a whole bunch of
fun I got these guys scheduled for next
week for space dojo show I haven't even
told you that yet but yeah why I was
just gonna recommend that yeah we're
totally gonna have them on the show
we're gonna talk to both the guys if you
can't make it rains II can fill in here
wait a minute here they're here in
Chicago right are they I thought they
were in Canada who are we talking about
here
daffle David David as a feather Lewicki
yeah he's in Vancouver
he works for BtoB but he's in Vancouver
and Eric is in Calgary Eric Kreisky I
probably butchered those what yeah
they're in Canada bro are you sorry it's
your favorite place right oh hey
announcement for everyone everyone
thinks I live in Toronto that is
everyone I live in Chicago I live in
Chicago shy town it looks it looks
Toronto esque behind you maybe that's
why does it I don't know a building
downtown in the
right next to oh I know it means I'd
Chicago River oh yeah it's still green
it's always green actually it's like
extra green though for st. Patrick's Day
I can't I went up there for st.
Patrick's Day one time and it was quite
impressive mm-hmm so you you're eating
green fish for a month and then you're
like you shouldn't eat fish I don't know
what kind of fish you're eating
all right so meteor 1.3 release client
release candidate yes whoops drink it
yeah so we so we just like totally like
gave meteor hard time which I did but
this is likely dude this is a perfect
segue into 1.3 because a lot of the
issues that we were just mentioning that
plagued meteor earlier versions of
meteor hmm I think you dropped they are
now having NPM support in there they
have testing built in and what is why am
I like losing my your your back oh okay
dude where was I yeah MPM support its
tomb a three-letter acronym sir yeah but
now like meteor is they're recognizing
that they need to move more into like to
JavaScript the normal JavaScript world
yeah yeah and this is like this is where
feathers kind of did it right where and
where meteor could do better
and now 1.3 is is a right at our
doorstep and it is a major milestone a
major step forward in that right
direction yeah I would agree I think the
the NPM support is pretty huge like I
cannot I don't think I can set enough
for that personally like being able to
just pull in moment and no longer rely
on a silly wrapper package is pretty
awesome and like who don't have to go
bug a bunch of package maintainer excuse
me to add some script or something to
help build for meteor like that's that
like I'm glad that people took on that
effort you know Luka and and Dan and a
couple other people like I have that
whole project to Auto build like
bootstrap or moment or those kinds of
things but now we don't have to worry
about that yeah well maybe bootstraps a
bad example yeah because now you're
talking about like CSS and compiling and
pre pre compilers and pre-processors and
all that stuff which is port for one
point yeah yeah I lost some time on that
but you know I I think looking they've
got a nice list too if you haven't seen
it yet
it's like post 1.3 issues which not sure
I fully agree with adding new stuff and
131 but it looks like they're gonna push
more stuff after group 1 3 they're gonna
try to get a 1 3 1 out within a couple
weeks that happens this can you hear me
yeah I'm trying to decide if you're
trolling me or not no I'm totally not
that has me fired up so I just had to
throw it in there yeah I
my piece on the meteor forums about
census I I you know here's the thing
like if I were trying to get funding for
a company I would absolutely go build
something like census and I would
absolutely stick unique IDs on every
application ever created automatically
over and over again even if you delete
the ID like those are the actions I
would probably take to help me have the
data I need to go get more funding and I
feel like since this is even taking it a
step further they're gonna be able to
figure out like IP addresses where
they're being hosted they're gonna be
able to like plug a lot of this data in
and be like hey
he will host you over here right we'll
give you a free trial like it's it's
definitely yeah it feels I don't want to
say smarmy but mmm not a hundred percent
right either especially like installing
sensible so another plug for
transmission maybe I was trolling you
I'd even realize it subconsciously yeah
you were you noticed I'm a natural troll
I guess you can call me out from now on
on it because I need to walk guys when
in trouble but like another plug we have
Zoltan on this show and who's the head
of the meteor group now or project for
MTG and we're gonna be talking
specifically on census and what they
were thinking and and why they actually
needed to do this if there was a better
way to do it try to get a better idea of
like their their frame of mind yeah
releasing this so yeah I just I think
you know if this forgotten if this were
done by other companies you know Apple
says like can we use some anonymized
data to make this better but like an IP
address is not anonymize data no I could
I mean Apple Apple collect stuff and
they highly depend on on what version of
the OS is you're running on because they
make that like a pretty big spot in
their announcements talking about user
adoption and upgrades and how it's
better than the average so I can see
like meteor wanting to do that yeah I
don't I don't really have a huge problem
with collecting some data I just I wish
it were more a front more explicit more
understanding around what they're gonna
do with the data you know I don't I
don't necessarily think they have to
tell us what they're gonna do with the
data but at least don't make it private
data like there was it was a good bit I
would consider standard I don't
necessarily want to share with them
yes but that's not making it into one
three no but you were mentioning one 131
yes yes which that probably will make it
in a version of it yes not the current
one because luckily they are receptive
to to everything that that was said in
the forums
yeah there's 46 open issues in this list
I was talking about for post one three
but you know like if we if we focus on
I'm actually kind of curious now history
the next yeah they haven't bought they
have a bother to start writing the
history of the changelog for this yet
but there's there's a lot going in but I
think the biggest thing to me is going
to be that that NPM support and the
modules support right like that goes
hand-in-hand to say you know in poor
blah blah blah from this file I think
you know now that I've been working with
it for like a month or so I like it a
lot better like it's it's maybe it feels
like more typing but at the same time
when I open up file I know what's what's
being used in that file and can make
sure that I don't know that now you can
like grep or do a search for where it's
referenced like I think it's it's gonna
be a lot better for tooling and just for
general developer experience I agree I
agree and people need to understand like
how to structure their app in order to
achieve this in the right way I
definitely want to push people to the
meteor guide to understand
one-point-three yeah yeah there's gonna
be some interesting stuff there I don't
know that I wholeheartedly agree with
everything the meteor guide but there
it's definitely a good project yeah yeah
most definitely
well in order till i get the correct
imports and everything you need to
structure your folders in the correct
way so along with the module support
like that makes testing a whole lot
easier
so finally meteors testing story is
gonna be legit yeah okay so I still
don't want to touch it for like another
month or so
I'm curious what do you mean by that I
saw that tweet they I just I think I'd
rather wait for other package developers
to get involved and like say yeah we
officially support 1.3 here's how to do
it like I don't like I have spent so
much of my recent life history and
meteor testing in one form or another
that I just feel like I've lost so much
time every time something changes like I
just want to wait until it feels stable
it does not feel stable okay like we're
still just won't release removed from
saying velocities dead I mean it works
in 1/2 it's not gonna work 1/3 I don't
know
I just I'm gonna wait okay maybe next
month I'll start writing some tests for
a client if they want you know and like
for some context for people who are
listening like like I understand I know
exactly what you mean when you because I
know what you've done before like yeah
you had the testing book yeah you and
Sam worked together on a professional
like course yeah we've given that
training twice things change
100% between the two courses which were
eight eight months apart and then we
actually had a video version ready to go
that we were gonna release and so and
like less than a month after the class
you know like everything changed again
and then what was it December we decided
velocity was dead so he gave the class
in August by September you know we had
synchronous support and cucumber then we
switched to chimp now Velocity's dead
well and you know unit testing and
end-to-end testing like you could you
could use mainstream stuff like you
don't need anything
meteor iced yeah yeah but due to some
extent right there's they wrote this
mocha driver package so I guess that's
what I'm waiting on is for people to say
like yeah we got a driver packages
taking care of like you don't worry
about that
that is interesting yep yeah yeah we
transmission did a show last week about
testing driver packages was a big thing
I'm like you know
yep who's gonna make this stuff yeah
exactly and I don't you know again like
now we're looking at something akin to a
rapper package atmosphere like I get
that you have to do some amount of work
to get it to work with meteor but for me
like if you are thinking about testing
an enzyme or something you know like
let's just stay up the meteor stuff
until it's it feels stable like worry
we'll get better I will yeah it will get
better that's what's gonna say too long
didn't read the transmission show ended
up being that you know meteor dinna
wanna like build specialized tools for
testing they want to make it meteor
capable of just using the tools that
area out there right and that's it right
cool that's a huge message to yeah that
that's the right message yeah so it will
get better yeah
all right talking about getting better
sharing contact information mmm like
it's such a pain
yes oh so here in Chicago we are you
know we're Chicagoans we we do things
the old way man and and business cars
are really important out here right well
okay grow has has a strict policy no
business cards no no strict but I've
been pushing for him and I haven't
gotten him so so what do I do
you know I funnel around with the phones
we try to make a LinkedIn connection it
just doesn't work out so then we just
you know we just don't connect that much
well our boy max Savin came out with a
solution called aqua is this saved in
there Savin I always thought it was 7 I
don't know my I'm just gonna say it's my
shot my Chicago excellent yeah okay yeah
all right max is saving a lot no it's
like it's like Aquaman right yeah Bandar
he's the man of a million like nicknames
man anyway so if you guys recall max was
the creator of meteor toys mm-hmm yeah
yeah so he is now introducing Agua which
is a way to kind of share social contact
information easily and it's a it's a
mobile app built on meteor and yeah I
think it's aqua nagua right again
Chicago accent acquaintances this must
be like this must be like a comparison
between Illinois and and Ohio
yeah yeah or so number one I think this
is interesting you know he's built this
meteor app I think using Cordova and I
don't know like he showed it off to me I
think it's a it's a fun idea you know he
said he plans to take a deeper but the
idea is like you know when you meet
someone instead of passing off the
business cards you just you get their
email address and like it'll send your
digital business card to them and then
you kind of have all that that point of
contact in place which is interesting
I remember Evernote did something
similar to this a while ago where you
could put people in and like it would
try to suss out their information on its
own like you would put in you take their
picture and put in their email address a
name and then it would like try to
figure out the rest
you know there was an app that got a
little bit of social lift to where it
was like called bump or some like that
you like yeah together yeah I used to
have that yeah Bluetooth yeah you know
the bump part of it was goofy but
whatever um not really needed
um yeah I don't know it's it's
interesting you know what I think would
be super fun is like you take someone's
picture and try to figure out then
conceptual media or something oh my gosh
it's a tool it's totally doable oh my
gosh it's so creepy and do a wall yeah
yeah so you know I I'll say this like
I've gotten good at finding people on
the internet my sister-in-law she was
dating some people and she was using
dating site and she'd be like I don't
can you guys find more info about these
people and I'd be like yeah just send me
their profile and like you know just
using their picture you could usually go
find all theirs like they're you know
they're dating calm well remember what
say it was but you could do a lot of
creepy thing oh my gosh you just like
cyber stuff everyone know that you're
yeah that you're creepster anyway
talking about avatar photos and all that
stuff we have a great member in the
mediator club and he changed his avatar
so finally see his face and and I had to
coax the guy to do it I really
appreciate him but my what I was gonna
give back was was a shout out on the
show if he did it and he finally did it
so so much love to Yousef yeah with this
it's Harry Potter looking picture dude
it's cool man I think is it
it is but it's like it's got like
the train is trolling you so bad no open
today if you're watching the youtubers
and you can see it over there it's like
ten times louder now but you know he's
got like a little pointy hood on it's
quite funny but no what's glad he
finally did that because he was just
like this like no one knew what he
looked like no no and he kind of he kind
of was saying like my photo is nowhere
on the internet yeah
so like people like you can't do a photo
sir yeah exactly
anyway well I think we're only like
maybe a you don't way like the NSA
probably has detect alike really do a
deep search and be like yes we spotted
him across all these cameras remember
when Android was and I never had any
injury I don't know more mm-hmm you cut
now man for only by just smiling I know
what was that you seen Batman
hello lost Ben are you bet oh my gosh am
i back yeah you seem back just don't
move on the camera too much oh my gosh
were you able to hear my voice the whole
time yeah I was like it was like all
electronic like that's what happens when
you mention NSA yeah jeez that's what
happens I was gonna say like Android had
that feature where you can smile at your
phone it would do a facial recognition
unlock the phone hmm so so no swiping
note no code yeah you know it's funny we
actually when I was at Gaslight this is
way back when we had a client that came
in and wanted to basically do that that
same thing before Android did it and
like they had all this this different
stuff going on like they were able to
use the phone light to like
- the cÃ³lera on the face and then they
would be able to run the facial
recognition and phone software it was a
really really interesting project but
they didn't get funding but no I like I
like the idea of your social business
card I guess it doesn't actually say
business card if nothing else go read
this post cuz there's a funny picture of
Trump at the end so and and go ahead and
download the app that - no max is max is
huge on feedback so yeah so hit him up
check it out on product hunt yes tweet
him
Dober good stuff alright the last last
topic of the day we have menu previously
with meteor development group so MDG
staffer and he is known for view j s
he's the creator and maintainer of UJ s
and he had an AMA he did I'm hash note I
had never even heard of hash node so it
was very interesting to go yeah go read
all this but you know that the the thing
I always found interesting about the
Avenue higher is like all right why did
we hire a guy heading up another project
that wasn't react or wasn't blaze to
come work on meteor like I get maybe he
had some no I I don't even think he'd
have a lot of insight right - like how
to support multiple front-end frameworks
the key would have to also develop that
insight like just because I write a
front-end framework doesn't mean I know
how to like easily let other frameworks
do the same thing meteor right yeah yeah
do you agree with that maybe he was
coming in to be like the maintainer
ablaze who knows what the plans were
yeah well you know and that's the other
interesting thing I found out is like
there was no hoorah about it but it was
more than just three people that left
meteor in that last round with Evan
David Greenspan is also one that
we now know about which you know he he
pushed blaze forward quite a bit it was
a big project him when it came out so we
did lose some knowledge there on the MDG
team uh yeah I don't know like he it's
really interesting to read a lot of
these answers but really that I think
the the core one as a meteor fan you
might care about is you know aza Matt
asked this is a little personal but what
happened to meteor what are your future
plans is your newborn girl or boy
and he said yes I left meteor there's a
it was a combination of quite a few
things
meteors a framework is now frontend
agnostic which makes the front end work
mostly just integrating react and
angular and the company doesn't seem
interested in supporting view
strategically so again like I questioned
why they hired him I mean I realize like
he's a smart guy like you want to hire
smart people at the same time like
clearly his passion was somewhere else
and be beter as a company is now
primarily positioned as a platform as a
service and the focus of the company has
an increasing recently smaller overlap
with my technical interest which I think
would probably apply to avital and David
Greenspan as well you know like building
a hosting business is just kinda like a
run of the mill yeah yeah kind of
interesting and then he said view is
growing faster than he thought internet
this is crazy so I find it interesting
that he said view is growing faster than
he thought yeah I think it's all based
off of the support that uh all the
passionate believers have what like I
hear of UJS more than more than I ever
would you know I would I would think I
would hear of blaze more
in the world and view j/s just seems to
be like taking off yeah it's interesting
I mean I would agree with that but at
the same time like the only way you can
get blazed right now is to you know
install meteor and that's just not true
of angular or react or view so yeah
again like you just mentioned that like
like view is in the same competition
with angular and react yeah I could
that's another reason why here it's like
kind of surprising so yeah anyway you
know I don't as I don't want to say too
much about it but this I think this is
worth going to read especially if like
you know you like Evan or you ran across
him in the forums or in an issue like I
I think he's an interesting guy to
follow and honestly I want to try to get
him on to talk more about view J s on
space dojo show as well absolutely yeah
Evans a really interesting guy I really
enjoyed listening or reading his answers
mm-hm
yeah he had a really good perspective on
everything and he seems like an insanely
working like an insane dude that like
works all hours to like get stuff out
the door so yeah he said like trying to
find it now somewhere in here like oh
there was to go back that basically he
would be up till like 2:00 8 1 or 2 a.m.
every night like in addition to his
normal job like trying to - yeah here it
is how do you manage building and
supporting a successful library outside
of your day job have you considered
having a company sponsor your
development work he said it does take a
lot of time and effort I think during
the 1.0 release process I worked until
1:00 to 2:00 a.m. almost every day but I
guess the biggest reason is because I'm
passionate about it so I enjoy working
on it most of the time I definitely hope
some company would sponsor he's actually
started a patreon so you can go look up
the article if you want to support him
mm-hmm
it's just it's it's really interesting
to me and you know
I've had subsequent I think we had a
subsequent conversation in space dojo
chatroom talking about like how do you
how do you make an open-source project
successful you know likes Sascha talks
about struggling with getting
contributors on board with telescope and
you know I think you hear similar
problems right
like people are interested in working
with meteor but like what's the size of
the user base like there's 8,000 people
in the forum's so like that's a large
user base and how many contributors
potential contributors do you find out
of that you know we've got like 260 or
something mm-hmm was a pretty small
number so it's it's very very hard to
grow an open-source project
yeah another guy down the list ask him
about the bus factor you know if Evan
yeah I'm making view Jas like and so
it's interesting you guys should
definitely check out this web page and
see what Evans answer is to that yeah I
like the guy definitely tell that he is
like super smart super ambitious and MDG
really only hires those type of people
so yes yeah all right cool wrap it up we
were we did today holy cow so right
you know I'm these guys aren't
sponsoring but I got a composed IO
t-shirt - that's cool shirt yeah I like
it
a bit so this this week sponsors are
digitalocean
and modulus hosting both of those are
great options i host sites at both
places check them out mm-hmm and then if
you want to directly support me the show
the chatroom crater all that kind of
stuff you can go to patreon.com/scishow
joe and ten bucks a month will get you
into the chat room and i still it still
blows my mind how awesome that chatroom
is instantly the best one I'm part of
but I'm I'm also biased
besides my company chatroom that's the
only one I really pay attention to nice
nice just because of the quality of what
gets posted and the people who are in
there so I bet I bet if we got some
slack stats you probably pay more
attention to space Tojo then okay grow
though no not true you can say that I
got a say okay grow is like I hear it's
pretty funny it is a hilarious slack
room like we have such a fun time yeah
it's actually I think it's it's higher
than mm-hmm I see
if it were just full of goofballs I
can't believe we get worked on all right
guys
