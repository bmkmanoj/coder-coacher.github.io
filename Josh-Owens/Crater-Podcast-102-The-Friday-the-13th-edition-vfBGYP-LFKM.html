spooky hmm okay the day I'll be hit his
head bad day already man wake up hit my
head got a little bruise on my face show
people at work so I can date on it you
know that's what they're made for I
guess yea fukin greater fans i'm your
host Josh Jones along with my co-host
Bobbi I yer alright dude so today uh I
think we got a good lineup we're just
talking about before I hit record here
talking about unlimited repos on github
UJS 2 point 0 Mongo 2 point 0 and t even
graph ql bro no wait how do i graph
queue up no was it yeah awesome so yeah
let's let's dive into it um who I'm
feeling off my game sorry uh github yes
that was like a big announcement this
week it was like two days ago a day ago
something like that like I just I woke
up and like normally we don't even see
like github news hit crater but this one
was big enough that someone posted it
there and it got some upvotes I think if
you're just if you have like a paid
account in your private developer like
this was great news right like yeah my
bill just dropped five bucks a month but
I think if you do the math the the
amount of money they're gonna make off
of medium to larger companies went like
you know way through the roof so more
than compensated for the fact that they
drop my bill five dollars it works well
for some I remember I know like the
company that works next to us in our
accelerator they were saying that like
oh yeah like it's actually more
expensive for us now because they have a
lot of developers in a certain project
and I think it's like how much
per head it's like the pasta I think its
nine bucks per head but you it's like
$25 and you get five collaborators and
then it's nine dollars a collaborator
after that and that's I think also a bit
of a change to like the I think before
you could have people collaborating with
you and that wasn't that big of a deal
yeah you know you could like they were
limiting you by repo versus per user um
yeah I don't know it's really really
interesting like I think back to the
early days of differential like when we
went we went to like make the
fifty-dollar account or something like
that yeah we really did it because of
the number of repose we had so it would
be advantageous in that case but I think
now you know there at like 20 25
employees like it would likely cost them
more now than what they were paying for
so yeah there's also people who have
like a lot of employees that work on
like a monolithic application so like
they're only gonna ever have one repo
yeah yeah and so that sucks for them too
I don't think we'll have to upgrade
right the same plan you are right now
well so the nice thing and I think they
did this right you know looking at their
announcement they're not forcing anyone
to switch right now well I guess if they
forcibly switch the page private
accounts but I you know they dropped the
bill so it seems like the right thing to
do there um but then they said like you
know go ahead and take a look you can
evaluate it if it makes sense go ahead
and switch you can stay on your current
plan um and we don't have any plans
right now to do away with the current
plan but if we do you'll have at least
12 months notice so yeah I I think
that's pretty awesome um that's the
right way to do a pricing change like
that in my opinion um so kudos to them
for doing it right like what do you guys
out of curiosity what are you guys using
that work pop please github dia yeah we
have three or three private repos yes it
and two microscope or now
Microsoft services are in the repos and
they think thankfully we're on that God
our grandfather clause type thing so we
can operate with the same pricing
strategy we had before now we have like
20 engineers that would have cost to
this a little bit more yeah well I know
in a start-up like ours we're not really
concerned about technical costs on like
these are like github is it one of those
integral parts of your your your
workflow for a big team even though the
good individual so it's like one of
those things that like it's like here
your your servers your database and your
give up or your repository like three
things that like integral to your dev
team working right you gotta like pretty
much just like you know go with the
changes and like you know see what it
works for you because there's not much
alternative I mean just like get lab or
something like that like bitbucket but
obviously like I have every time that I
run into bitbucket it just feels
inferior to me like it's it's hard to
navigate it's hard to you know even I
don't even think they have I know I
think atlassian is the one that puts
together bitbucket um they maybe have
some tools but they don't have any kind
of integrated like issue tracker do you
guys use github issues oh yeah it's what
I think we don't use issues because JIRA
which is by at lat walk really
interesting we use that tool but that's
mainly because github is github is made
for developers by developers atlassian
is made by developers for whatever a
product manager was thinking of zero
really sucks right to be honest like
just re-use it's hard to be customized
essentially most people are using like
one-tenth of the features it actually
has this is hard cover any other
features that that's right but our
product managers have used it you know
in the past because it's like one of
those like industry things that everyone
uses that stuff so we use that and I
actually like on Apollo everything is
done through issues that actually works
well when you just went only developers
and stuff like that it's nice to use
issues issue track
is great for uh you know open source I
think yeah well I like to like having
private repos working with customers I
find it's a good place like they seem ok
to collaborate there and I've got one
designer and one developer as well that
worked for me and like they they're
they're comfortable there as well so
it's just easier for me to assign work
and get off your shoes that kind of
thing so it's also good for your career
because most people use github mmm like
might as well just like understand kid
and like I'll get her where she works is
your next company probably is using
github yeah yes that's a fair point yeah
alright but one lot one last comment I
think I want to like kind of like
command github like there's probably one
of the nicest like migration paths I've
ever seen like no one has ever said you
got 12 months and we don't know what
we're doing but it's going to be in 12
months we'll figure it out but don't
worry right now I've always no one has
ever given me that luxury it's always
like oh yeah in the new release
everything is broken so you know good
yeah good luck you know and stuff like
that or yeah we're changing our prices
at the end of the month or we're getting
rid of all the free servers in two weeks
okay like you know things like the hole
i come in github for three servers in
two weeks were you referring to someone
specifically not really haha no i
totally agree like it's to me know the
way I read it is like you don't have to
switch now and if we ever decide we're
gonna force the switch you'll have 12
months from that point yeah to kind of
make a decision and that's it it even be
more than a year from now that you got
to worry about exactly it's like I I
think at that point like if you switch
to get lab or anything like that like 12
months is plenty of time to make a
decision even in an enterprise you can
make that decision so yeah it's once
again it's developers for develops
products for developers by developers
it's like how we think like we wouldn't
do that hopefully to like another class
of your professional like ourselves
yeah I don't you know it is kind of
interesting though I think this is
slowly over time if you pay attention
and github like it's less campy and less
funny and less like yeah like it feels
more businesslike reading this article
was more like business e to me you know
i mean they did it the right way but
definitely like there was no funny octo
cat header like first time I read I get
how blog post in a while so kind of big
news I guess yeah and they have the NAG
we're going on to so like every your
profile if you're in a private repo half
the page is like the announcement so
it's like oh yeah yes good base you know
and do it right some people like to get
rid of that trick in the little section
of the page so that was github pricing
to point out I tell us about view js2
point oh that's great ordering my friend
know so as most people I think view if
you've been using laravel you know what
view is which laravel is a PHP framework
if you've been using just straight up
like if you're just in the JavaScript
know how you know what view is and view
is this a front-end reactive front-end
reactive framework for building really
composable user interfaces and the
Creator his name is Evan you used to
work at MDG um like it's the easy easy
author of this and with a view to point
oh he's made some really really nice
changes to the framework I'm going to go
into a couple done right now the thing
about view is the thing about view
that's different than other like
JavaScript frameworks is heavens take on
reactivity and his take on reactivity
mainly is that everything should just be
getters and setters on objects there
shouldn't be like these rapper functions
or like crazy magic essentially she just
be playing to JavaScript objects that
invalidate themselves get and set that
was a whole a principle of you another
principle abuse everything is a
component and you write these components
similar to angular directive so it's
readable components know so in view two
point oh they did
bunch of do stuff so they got a verte
they're using a virtual Dom renderer
which is super cool they have their own
implementation of virtual Dom so that
your components already know when they
should update themselves and that's
beautiful because in react if you want
to control rendering or updates you have
to use should component update and
that's like kind of way you're strict
too and you have to either do some
calculations in this function to return
true or false whether to prevent
rendering and Evan looked at that
problem in the react community installed
it in view by automatically doing this
type of should this thing updates behind
the scenes now some people like myself
don't like that type of stuff like I'd
rather control my own destiny but if
you're trying to go fast and you're
trying to make a good application why
worry about small stuff like that you
know it isn't until your app is so big
that thing matters another thing is
people like evan is a designer he went
to the Parsons School of like you know
as a technical technical hearts and I
talked to him about that he is a
designer mind like design minded first
like purpose right and designers
templating is really really natural so
he wanted people to preserve their love
for templating interview but if you like
jsx do you like that react syntax you
can drop down into the virtual Dom layer
of you and start writing jsx or not
really necessarily jsx but a virtual Dom
code so that is also potential and then
I think the last major point to bring up
is they they do they're going to give
you server-side rendering and every
everybody who talks about JavaScript
frameworks the first thing they ask is
Oh where's the server side rendering you
know I got a render stuff on the server
make my page load faster and Evan
definitely you figure that out too and I
think a lot of this comes from all the
pain points at meteor that people were
talking to him I think use has taken
notes because they don't really give him
the time of day for his frame work there
and it's kind of sad that it didn't
because this product looks super good
now you know everything about it is like
the well-documented the docs look
beautiful
the actual component model i think is
very very very elegant and it sits and
the reactivity model is like very
controlled there's controlled renders
everything you wish blaze was view it is
like seriously I kind of wish that
meteor took of you into more of a
support and approach because right now
the PHP community is blowing up and
their applications are going to get
they're going to start blowing up
because of the front-end capabilities
now you know I think laravel is a very
very like cutting edge PHP framework
that is actually like been around for
years now and they've adopted view as
like the front-end library so you've got
a bunch of people in that side of the
world actively developing components and
libraries and all that stuff so I know
it's a great ecosystem and just wish
that we because he solved all the
problems that people wanted in place
it'd just be nice that it if you was
that blaze replacement that have been
cool yeah that's my take on it yeah you
know it's it's it's interesting you
bring that up right because he did work
at MDG and like you know we've we
watched him like he was working on react
and blaze and like they stuck him on the
front-end team and like clearly he's a
he's a smart guy to put there but at the
same time it was definitely a head
scratcher like why not have him do view
integration like if you're gonna drop
blaze like why not say like well we're
gonna maybe have a quick bridge to get
you to view because there's a nice
separate community that's been building
over there and you know that that's
something they wanted to see with with
blaze I don't and it definitely was odd
but um you know it's interesting too
because he's got I guess you call it
view x yeah there's a like a
unidirectional data flow for view right
redux but you know like view ups or what
everybody reads it I thought it was
French for a second I was like what is
this luxe thing but yeah that's another
thing like I talked to Evan about you
know about redux when he was at meteor
because we were just transitioning from
blaze to react so
like them as the damn as I because we
are on a customer we're like a customer
meteor they like content us and made
sure that we had the right tools to
migrate to react to Mike that was going
to be a good process for us and yeah we
him and I talked about it and very
insightful and i I just I really feel
like he was just taking a step back and
seeing how this stuff is gonna play out
very smartly very why just see how this
stuff's gonna play out and then he's
like okay someone one here such a
virtual Dom line okay I'll take that
server-side rendering everyone wants
that okay imma take that and a really
nice clean templating syntax but also
jsx because people wanted both he did
book write something ways in doing
something everyone wanted to react like
really honestly I think the people are
building media apps right now they
should invest their own time and making
a view integration because it might make
your life easier maybe but I'm kind of
curious like I want to read more on the
streaming server side rendering right
because he's he's talking about like
they render the component and you get a
readable stream back and then you can
pipe um pipe it through the HTTP
response so like this what did I say hey
this ensures your server is responsive
and gets the rendered content to your
users faster yeah so I know that's
that's really really kind of interesting
to me because I feel like if so the
thing with server-side rendering is like
when you stumble upon a site that's
using it it actually does feel a little
bit faster um in my opinion like with
for example Nova versus like non
server-side rendered the way crater is
now like the new version feels much much
faster with SSR so they get making that
even faster to like send some code and
then send some data along as well like
that that's really really interesting to
me yeah and it really is that that
perceived performance goes up because
you see HTML right away so like in your
brain you know that uh I'm ready to go
you know mm-hm
it isn't until later that the JavaScript
comes and right so I think it's great I
think I can't wait to see what happens
in the future per view it's great agreed
agreed and if Evan listens to this like
I did ping him privately I'm in her back
but I'd love to get him on to talk more
in depth about view on the space babies
villages show yep definitely give me a
great topic since we've talked about you
know react and react native and all that
kind of stuff so interesting stew you
native that would be some interesting
stuff native you native yeah we've got
natives crib we've got react native ya
need view native he didn't he didn't
reference that in the pose to like maybe
that's a possibility somewhere by the
limit look at other peoples the mistakes
right yes the window away speaking of
sky's the limit were the next topic is
from max Gavin he you're not familiar he
wrote something a while ago called
mongol and i really like i was always
kind of impressed with Mongo it was like
um I don't know it wasn't it's
interesting to me because it was
developed as like a package that you
drop into your meteor app but it gives
you like this you I on the page and it
shows you like what's going on in your
mini Mongo memory cache and that kind of
thing well and I I think it's great um I
wonder like what would it look like if
it was a Chrome extension instead kind
of like what read or react has something
like huh also there's the the people
forgot their names but we use this at
work we use the meteor dev tools which
just has a blaze inspector as a DDP
monitor and has a mini model querier so
like dad this nice utility doesn't have
the all the orbs and stuff then all that
death stuff but if you need a basic
instrumentation that that was there for
you yeah but definitely so
he didn't have a changelog but I asked
him what was going on with it uh honey
sent me a list so he's added support for
transformed documents so people aren't
familiar with it with meteor you can
apply transforms as data is coming out
of the database um and you can attach
things like change the data or attach
new methods onto the object if you want
like fun interesting things you can do
there so their support for that he
improved the scoping and CSS so
hopefully that's not bleeding out
anywhere the inline editor is a little
bit better um you can right click to
close a window right click on Mongol uh
when it's closed and it'll move it off
the page I guess um and uh yeah just a
couple other improvements but I think
you know this is the precursor I think
today he just announced meteor twice
three so we're gonna see a lot a lot of
little improvements coming out there as
well and those are the like the orbs
that you were talking about that kind of
stuff like definitely um Mongols like
one piece of that he has jets better for
tracking like reactive state using
meteor and then like with meteor toys
he's got like 15 different orbs as he
calls them and you can do interesting
things like pretending to be a user and
all kinds of fun stuff so that was
pretty cool to see that update coming
out I think that we're at this point
where like it was announced so long ago
yeah maybe not everyone's heard of it
like I noticed in the forum post people
like I had no idea that even existed
yeah it's been around for a while yeah
yeah definitely it should be in the
guide maybe I don't know me there should
be like a tooling section of the guide
that talks about Mongol and meteor toys
and the chrome tools that you're talking
about wasn't there like someone who like
forked Mongo and made their own version
or something yeah I think there's some
con constellation compilation that's
what it was yeah Oh looks like those
people dropped off so much like
everything in software
that's cool I didn't we haven't heard so
anything from max in a long time about
media related anything up until recently
so yeah it's been nothing mobile game
he's been jet-setting around the country
around the world so nice to see him back
yeah like changed yeah all right dang it
thought I was reading I shouldn't be
reading the chat room while I'm shooting
the podcast trying to schedule another
podcast yes Oh graph ql the last story
of the day you won't tell us about that
yeah so this is a this is a really good
post it's actually Spidey apologize
Jonas to be a specific and this is
actually so he could he covers like
three questions that I get asked pretty
much a lot so let me I'm gonna go
through this article i'm going to give
you some tapes on like um you know what
the right answers are i know a lot about
grad school now so the questions that we
usually get or is gradual easy to secure
i know thats question that you're very
interested in is easy to build a
graphical server and the last thing is
can I use graph qu Elle with any insert
front-end library here yeah um so and
the answer to all of these things are
the answer is there are easy answers to
all these questions and so let start
with the first one is grab feel easy to
secure well the thing is and thing that
most people don't realize like the graph
ql like the query language why the QL
card is very misleading because whether
you're thinking about query language
you're thinking about it database you're
thinking about Oh permissions to a DB
but in reality grab kill is an
application query language essentially
like it queries the data that is given
to a
right so a lot of security you can
imagine that whatever you're doing with
rest api is today how are you making
them secure can also is essentially just
a restructuring grab college is a
restructuring of a rest api into a
different syntax that anybody can
consume so the same principles apply you
shouldn't lose any security whether you
use graph ql or a REST API right now
what graph cool doesn't do is make sure
you have your security so if you're not
writing secure sup already graph ql will
be insecure you know i mean so that's on
actually that's on the server developer
who's publishing this data and
especially media right solution you're
responsible for the security of that
date yeah yeah yeah definitely and
that's like the key thing for me like
whenever I do a meteor code review is
the fact that most people don't realize
like publications are where the the
security happens and I would think that
is true here too right like the
resolvers are where the security really
needs to happen and so like there's a we
talked about this a little bit there's a
piece in the documentation that shows
you how to like set the user ID
basically using tokens um yep on both
sides and then you can kind of rely on
that and query your data based on who's
the logged in user and what should they
be able to see and all that kind of
stuff so I think you're right it's
really not that different um it's pretty
someone how rest or meteor currently
work trip and we're working on we're
working on some type of graph ql ought
to take authentication and Apollo so you
can have the luxury of making sure the
various resolvers or secure via the
proxy itself but let's say that doesn't
exist this and it's never going to exist
you yourself should always take it take
responsibility and make your stuff
secure because you cannot rely on tools
to make yourself secure for you I mean
you can use them but you have to
remember that they need to be secure in
the first place so that's the answer to
that question the next question is is
easy to build a graphical server um
the answer the quick answer is hell yeah
it is easy and there's a there's a
package called Apollo that helps you do
there but if you didn't use Apollo
there's a lot of different graphical
server implementations and if you wanted
to build your own the only things you
really need to know are one prior art
and what I mean by that is the look at
other graphical implementations to you
need to know what the graphical spec is
like you need to read the spec and how
it works essentially then you can make a
graph shows server and there's not this
like very sparse documentation on how
exactly you can build one but you know
Jonas has a couple a couple of blog
posts about the whole graphic you'll
server so essentially autograph your
server needs is a schema and that is
going to be the application schema so
when the client asks for certain data
the graphical server can resolve that
data so on the other end of the side on
the server side you need resolve
functions and this tells a graphical
server how to fetch data for a certain
type right this also goes into security
too because if the client has a certain
schema and the schema you know if you
imagine the schema as you know just
plain-ass like objects or you can you
think of the schema keys as functions
they can take parameters so if I say on
the clients if I want to get the post
and I only can take an ID then no one
there's knows there's actually no
security hole in the client because I
can only pass ID I can't pass anything
more than that right so it's very secure
on the client because the client is dumb
and it can only do what it's told
instead of it just you know instead of
people who like type like put like you
know stupid parameters that may like
crash your your your business logic and
all that stuff like which happens to
people that stuff's not possible so yeah
it is easy to build a graphical server
and there's a really good our diagram
that was made by dom and mdg on how this
whole server to client relationship
works i encourage people to check it out
so that's that and then the last
question can I use graph to l with
angular react m
redux and yeah the answer is yes all you
need is a graph cool clients you need
some type of interface that can speak to
the graphical server so for example
harder noda right he made this thing
called laka and that is a really that is
an implementation of a graph qol client
and essentially what you can do is you
can MPM install lockup and you have
these certain methods that will talk to
the graphical server that you set up at
Apollo we're building Apollo client
which is the same type of implementation
but a lot more like cooler features like
a query parsing so you don't have to
write these huge schemas and resolve
functions all in this massive object you
can actually do schema separately from
your result functions and we parse those
and we make them pretty and do all that
great stuff also the Apollo client has
integrations to angular 2 so if you want
to fit into your current workflow you
can just use angular tues integration to
apollo using react react apollo and as
more people get involved there will be
other integrations but today let's say
you're not using apollo all you need is
a graphical client and you should be
good that's all you need and with this
that means you can have a react native
app you can have a mobile app you can at
all these front ends as long as you have
that client interface you can talk to
rapid sir so like how do you grab ql
it's actually very easy the first thing
is to start graph q le and you'll start
figuring out all the pieces as you go um
but yeah this is actually and the second
show we talked about this stuff but I
think it will continually try to educate
people as these these posts go up
because it's really having having them
trying to build something of scale and
personally it's getting really nice you
know yeah I would agree like there's
definitely this has been like a
long-running kind of problem um I'm
trying to think there was a standard
that Steve clam Nick was working on uh
and it had to do with
gosh now i can't i can't think of it now
uh it had to do with like a REST API but
like being able to ask for a bunch of
information about the rest api and not
necessarily having to make a bunch of
calls repeatedly gosh now i cant
hypermedia that was it do you ever hear
hypermedia ooh i lost audio do you know
what that is i am you know sorry that's
all right yeah so um the idea is that
here designing hypermedia pas every web
service needs a killer a baha'i to
interact with numerous clients and other
web services users expect the
applications they use to work together
and interesting fresh ways
ProgrammableWeb has created interesting
experiences blah blah blah hypermedia
and restful principles drive the large
distributed app application drive the
largest distributed application ever
World Wide Web I have what is like oh
here you go flexibility loose coupling
yeah I don't know a lot of fluff on this
page good hmm yeah I can't find it now
but I seem to remember the ideas behind
hypermedia we're kind of similar um in
that you're just able to send in
quest and it would tell you it I think
it was like aware of all the things that
knew about and it could respond and tell
you like here's some things you can ask
for basically yeah so I mean it's it's
like dancing on this idea that like you
know I I did I like if I think back to
the days of me consuming Twitter or
Facebook api's you know I have to make
multiple calls to find out all the
information that I need and that's for
me as developer that's frustrating like
I'd rather just be able to make a call
and say like here's the data I need to
run you know my particular application
and just get it all in one swing it
would be amazing whereas instead we get
like you know with Twitter you get like
multiple rest calls that you have to
make you get like rate-limiting that's
applied to that and all kinds of things
and it's like that's no it's just really
a bad experience in my imagine like
imagine a huge data store like you might
have to call like five api's join them
on the client and then now you've built
like these like special utility
functions that can never be reused
because they are like so specific and
like the data you get back probably has
like 15 keys that are just like
properties that you don't really care
about like I've been in those nightmares
or the rest api is kind of inflexible
and the people who write it are
inflexible which kind of sucks you know
no imagine just saying like imagine
being a client developer where I mean
back then when I was just consuming REST
API I didn't really care what what
happened like just give me my data cuz
I'm trying to make the really good
Alexis um I think that is the same
principle here I don't I don't want to
have meetings about the API changes I
don't care about the API I don't care
about how you did it okay or the
database I just want the JSON that's all
I care about yep I know mobile
developers very well there that they're
kind of some of them most of them are
like that they want to build really nice
products and hard developers and we
should get bogged down by having to do
so much overhead to render a list I've
done under facebook news feed i bet you
they're doing that with the rest oh man
there's so much metadata about every
user every post every new street like
that would be impossible I mean it would
be very possible because they did it
before but it was really you know crappy
experience so then like you know I think
most people should start graphic yelling
really whether you use it in your app or
not like start getting into it because
you know once facebook and you know like
once relay but in you know real estate
stand alone once that gets bigger like
like anything Facebook does nothing will
just blow up and then people everyone's
really start using it and the best thing
you can do for yourself is get ahead of
the curve whether it's valuable to you
now or not it's going to be valuable in
the future kind of wish I go on the
react rocket ship before it took off you
know but I'm on it now which is great
but I give it nice to be there when it
blew up you know yeah so I'm trying to
do the same thing with this graph girl
stuff yeah no I totally agree i think
it's it's definitely like where things
will head in the future and even if you
know graph ql itself ah gosh now i wish
i could remember the tweet but it was
like along the lines of like even if
relay fails the idea of graph ql will
live on for a long time because it's
like it's out there's a speck and it
makes sense to a lot of people and once
people start conforming to it like it's
I think it's your right like it's it's
gonna take off I think it'll be another
next big thing to replace rest got my
window open to that 22 Cheers yeah guys
like sitting out there Longhorn family
yes what did you say that II haunted
yeah I guess we'll call it on a show um
yeah so big
nice one there a lot of it just for you
yeah and so um big thanks to digital
ocean and modulus for being sponsors as
always and if you want to hang out and
the select chat room you can go to
patreon ln comedy club join their 10
bucks a month kitchen like that's that's
like what two cups of coffee at
starbucks get you the best source of
like finding answers to your questions
around building JavaScript apps ever
yeah and like you know testimonial at
the end every time like they're always
say well I'm or do I have to say no
there's like a lot of people there are a
lot of interesting people from
JavaScript community and meteor
community in that chat room the people
that you probably read their blog posts
are in there so I read their blog post
and comment on them rather than just hit
him a personal message on slack right
and I'll answer any DM on slack in the
meteor club chatter and I'm sure
everyone else will so it's really a good
community to join and yeah do it
definitely and then in case you missed
it today too I announced the next crater
cough the you know mobile edition I'm
kind of excited about that so yeah if
you're interested in like building
mobile apps this is with JavaScript not
necessarily like native we're not
talking about Objective C or Java or
anything like that we're talking purely
JavaScript so Cordova react native
Native script any of those kinds of
options that are out there we're likely
gonna have a talk on it I'm actually
super excited too because we have some
of the new spring guys coming in and I
think James my talk he's talking
definitely talking about switching from
Cordova to react native but I'm I'm kind
of hoping he'll show off a little the
graph ql action they got going on as
well hopefully we get some some yet so
Apollo action out of that yeah I I did
ask I did ask Martin walraven to come on
but he's on vacation at that
so he went so maybe someone else from
the Apollo team can do that presentation
yeah I reached out to a couple other
people so we'll see what happens um I
also think I'm super excited for john
pinkerton's talk as well from this
spring like he's going to talk about all
their automation so they're like you
know doing a git commit and then I like
triggers building the web app and then
it triggers like building the mobile app
with getting it to the App Store for
update and now that the app stores down
to like two day review time like my
guess is they're gonna start shipping
stuff like crazy yeah and like that that
automation is in our Apollo projects
like your github like it's really clean
like when we submit a pull request
there's so much stuff that we have
automated and it just makes contributing
a lot easier then that was the main
point is we want everybody everyone
listening anybody to come join us and
help us out and it's not going to be
like the stuff in the past it's like
transparence you can help and we're
making it easy for you give you all the
information to do it so do it yep

we'll catch you next week alright see ya
