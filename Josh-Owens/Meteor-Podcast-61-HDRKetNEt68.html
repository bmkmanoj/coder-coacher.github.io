welcome meteor fans i'm your host josh
owens along with my co-host I Walker hey
how's it going man is going yeah nice
friday afternoon it's effective pretty
nice here for that yeah yeah yeah it's
not too bad I was uh was out just a few
minutes ago at the local holiday
festival they have here in Wyoming is uh
quite crazy which Wyoming's a
neighborhood in Cincinnati right yes
yeah um yeah they do this this crazy
thing was silly string I guess like
every kid there has silly string so well
it's just like the whole downtown areas
covered in silly string now she's only
like two blocks but I'm better better
than glitter ah I should at today's
Brad's birthday I shoulda sent him a
glitter bomb for his bow oh god yeah me
too that's not too late you can only
send up Billy did yes I might have to do
that alright so this week in media we're
talking about meteor having no future
how to build a slack clone full-text
searching with Mongo Google crawling and
how that's changing and riding a package
alright so the first story this actually
came out last Friday but I wanted a
little more time to kind of digest the
branch that I guess it's on yeah there's
a lemonade future branch and so this
someone posted this up on crater and
they were doing a clever play on words
oh so the the fiber package the is um
there's a future part of the fiber
package which allows you to easily kind
of wrap up asynchronous code to act like
it's synchronous and so you like you
like instantiate a future and then
you'll give it to something and then
down below like where you want it to
wait for the
the code to run you do like a future dot
wait and then you do inside your
asynchronous code to do like this future
dot return and so they've they've
removed a lot of that and now they're
using meteor promise which is a new
package that Benjamin Newman has created
kind of weird his his user name is Ben
Benjamin on Twitter but he goes by ben
newman so um so yeah like he's just
released this package and they've been
basically tearing it out and using
promises now instead and so I don't know
it looks it looks kind of interesting i
think it's a it's going to be a good
shift because they're basically they're
um they're prepping for es6 and yes
seven updates and i don't know i think
this will this will be a good thing so
yeah i don't have too much to add about
that is a little too deep for my general
usage of meteors I don't get down to the
steps like that so future futures versus
promises they sound pretty similar to me
yeah kind of but I think one's gonna be
more supported in the native language
and yeah so deep down like they kind of
a accomplish the same thing they just do
it in slightly different ways yep yeah
alright cool let's jump to the next
topic which is slack clone this is a
blog post by Daniel Lee and breaks down
like you know if you were gonna try to
build something like slack using meteor
how would you do it of course meteor is
a great real-time framework so it's
super easy to make the slack like tap
with a chat apps have been all the rage
in meteor demos since the beginning of
meteor this is a look you did one you
went to uh gosh remember when you went
to what was that that we've a famous
yeah famous like famous dash chat
Mediacom I think it's 3d chat now is
just like I knew
it's something to play around with and
so of course I chose chat but yeah this
is a interesting tutorial again it-it's
very in-depth it's a free long blog post
a nice walk through so I think if you're
learning media and you're looking for
another sort of a demo to pass through
this is a nice one takes you through all
the steps including the HTML side of
things with a lot of sample code yeah
yeah I thought it was really interesting
and then like there was a whole thing
that popped up on crater and the meteor
forms kind of around this to that
original post showed up and then
apparently Tim Braden over there in
norway denmark 0 somewhere over there
and then it's great north of Europe he
he posted some slides and apparently he
had worked on something similar and his
slides kind of walk you through the same
thing and then now they're they're
kicking around this idea of creating a
open-source chat / at like clone I think
called impact yeah and they're kicking
around different names but they want to
like create an organization and try to
basically give telescope a run for its
money as a premier open-source manner
yeah yeah I saw that I joined I joined
Josh's patreon channel from finally had
user cycle um contribute to that by the
way great experience in there Josh you
know activity as you I mean too much
activity to be honest like I couldn't
keep up with it I just popped in
everyone's gone I'm like wow look at all
that shit just happens yeah yeah yeah
you know the thing for me like I I've
gotten to the point where I can't even
read everything anymore either but it's
just nice to be able to jump in there
and either show off some code i'm
working on or ask some questions or you
know like and there's always like really
smart people in there like I was
watching sashko and
Sam hatoum just have a conversation in
there earlier like that's kind of
awesome to watch yeah yeah that's it
stuff like I I've got a couple of other
like high volume slack channels and it's
funny like slacks great especially I
think I feel like it's really good when
there's not a lot of volume but what's
the volume it gets going like you could
miss a lot of stuff and they've missed
it you know yeah yeah I don't know we
try to use it as a project management
tool on my main project and like I don't
know it was that way last night like I
had people over in my house and we were
doing stuff and then I came back and
like apparently they'd all been chatting
for hours and there was just like all
this stuff for me to digest and I'm like
can someone just give me the damn cliff
notes yeah yeah so yep good good good
tutorial again back to Daniel's post
here check it out if you wanna see
ignite example out of bubble meteor crap
yes and I don't know what this Scotch
dot IO is but I love the domain so I
love scotch scotch scotch scotch all
right uh what else do we have we've got
full-text searching this was a timely I
was actually thinking about creating a
search function in the app I was working
on and then this came out like literally
hours before I was gonna work on it so
oh this is amazing then it turns out I
did it all client finds to the server
side but it's all good so basically this
walks you through how you can get text
indexing going on for a collection and
this this is a tutorial post again just
like the last one and I think it was a
great great walkthrough but they show
you how to get the full text search
index going on and then how to like use
it in your publications for doing
searches and I guess you get like dollar
sign text is how you do the search you
wrap that then you do like a dollar sign
search and you get the bayou and then
you can score this part I didn't read
too closely it looks like you can sort
on the score so
you get like a matching score back and
then you can sort by that and all that
kind of stuff so I think that's kind of
interesting as well but yeah and they
just give you some some notes and
caveats but basically it just shows you
how to publish using full text search
and no no that's cool it's a quick read
it's worth it my opinion yeah yeah I
remember I did a simple full text search
for telescope bag in like twenty
thirteen traffic on i do i'm looking to
trade dollar sign regex right that's all
yeah ended up doing mine yep that's why
i did it i am looking at this commit
from way back in the day and i was
dollar sign regex so yeah yeah i think
it was before like the other thing i
think back then like Mongo didn't have
full text search enabled by default
maybe yeah you're accusing it so yeah I
think it was in 26 but it wasn't
necessarily enabled everywhere yeah and
a lot of places 124 yeah back in the old
days we had to do it a different way hmm
well worked uphill both ways what your
app should have full-text searching and
I don't care what it is you should have
full-text searching yeah yeah no you
know i'll just say like you know for me
what i wrote was client-side just doing
some filtering with what's already been
published and my guess is actually will
probably move to this later on um you
know pass on that that that filter that
people are typing to the publication and
and used text on the other side to do
the search but you know this is a i
don't know i think dollar sign regex
will take you pretty far too yeah it's
the quick version all right next up next
topic is jon was the topic it's called
google crawling yeah this is we're
covering a story from Search Engine Land
com but it is applicable to meteor since
all these meteor apps are single page
apps that's you're always worried will
they be able to index this properly and
this talks a little bit about how Google
in fact does index JavaScript apps very
well in which he runs through a series
of tests I haven't read this whole
article
it's really really big and I'm not so
interested in this other than to know
like does it work did you spend a lot of
time with this one I didn't I was hoping
you bought him now I mean yeah basically
the gist of it is that it's tricky like
my google google does index JavaScript
apps just fine the problem really comes
into like third-party tools that do like
generic scraping uh let's say I don't
like look if it's if it's a tool that
tries to read a URL then and then come
up with a preview image for example like
you can build a feature like that into a
product and if you're trying to do in a
very naive way like meteor apps might
not do super well with that so yeah but
in terms of just like will your content
being in Google with just straight
JavaScript the answer is i think yes
yeah yeah yeah from the looks of it so
number three seems like the he's got a
list of lake all the things that they
tested and number three is uh
dynamically inserted content and they
said in all the cases that they tested
the text was crawled and indexed in the
page rank for content winning actually
said winning um but yeah they just used
like document dot write in function and
they use the html5 push date as well to
kind of test things and so it looks like
google is getting a lot smarter at this
crap yeah and they need to because not
everybody is gonna you don't work so we
like we use fan you know as a phantom
Jasin spy durable like that was the
thing you had to do it early days with
meteor to feel confident that google was
going to index you correctly the reality
is not everybody who's rebuilding single
page apps are gonna have a tool like
that in so either google get to lose
some of the web or it figured out how to
crawl through javascript and so they
figure out how the crawl through
javascript well i mean it seems like
they have to do this right because if
you look at I'm angular right i mean
that's that's like a big thing for them
and um you know they're redoing it to
two point oh now and yeah i think they
just they can't be pushing this this
framework out there and not support it
in there they're scraping in my opinion
um so it seems like I'm guessing that
was really the impetus for all this yeah
yeah so that's good news yeah good to
hear yeah but this article i got
definitely worth a read even even if you
just skim over the you know the numbered
points I don't see the result but good
good read oh alright and last up this
blasted meteor chef guy he beat me to
the punch line I was working on a blog
post about like how packages work and he
wrote a tutorial on writing a package so
miss a little different but I gotta say
like kudos to him I think he actually
took it even further than i was going to
shake it i think this is like maybe a
20-minute read and he even goes as deep
as like showing off using tiny tests and
all that kind of stuff so it's it's
pretty amazing and he's got a coupon
code in here for getting fifteen percent
off Sam's book as well so if you haven't
picked that up yet you find that on here
um I've never written a blog post this
big yeah I mean this is just wow this is
crazy and you know what's interesting is
I still think there's parts that heating
cover that I think I'm gonna cover am I
on my package but yeah this is
definitely worth a read if you're
curious about how the package system
works or how you can build your own
package like I this totally worth
spending some time on I wish this is the
kind of thing I had when we were
starting to write our packages oh hey
you know like we were honestly just
fiddling around and looking at like core
meteor packages to figure out how to
build something back in my day
the second time we've said that holy
crap yeah when oh there was like the old
generation of media developers now
apparently that's cool yeah all right
yeah this is good stuff so like I said
this is from meteor chef Ryan Glover he
did an excellent job meteor chef calm
we'll put it in the show notes as well
so yeah have you guys been been doing
much package writing there Oh package
writing I haven't written code in like
weeks now I don't know I don't know
about differential I got you know I've
kind of split off them spending all this
time on you on user cycle right now that
I'm gonna know what the heck they're
working on so yeah we should probably
from differential and sometimes it's
nice I know what's funny yeah I know
inside ya can't be in two places at one
time unless your name is Aaron oda Aaron
Aaron notas there's many of him yeah
fins and his clones alright guys thanks
for tuning in this week and as always
modulus was our sponsor and you should
check them out apparently i nag you a
lot about that and someone switched to
modulus and they loved it last week so
yes it happens all just their they're
good guys I know them personally so
check out their stuff modulus done I oh
and then as we mentioned patreon.com /
meteor club that's patr yo n.com /
meteor club ten bucks a month I'll get
you into the slack chat room and I will
say there's some poop jokes going on in
there some gif ease but there's also
some serious discussions about meteor as
well so oh good stuff alright guys we'll
see you next week see ya this video has
been a meteor club production you can
