welcome back to the third session of the
third day of critter mobile Kampf
today I'm excited to have Spencer with
us speaking I worked with him when I was
at differential and he's carried on kind
of the meteor torch there and been doing
react native work as well and so today
he's going to be talking about using
react native a meteor to quickly build a
cross-platform app so I will turn it
over to Spencer okay so is all right
there's my screen um yeah so today I'm
gonna be talking about what it's like to
build an app with react native meteor my
name is Spencer then if you want to
access any of the you know like stuff
have written on medium my email list
I've got a website react native meteor
calm and that's just website that links
to my medium page okay let's see yeah
before we get started just want to give
you guys quick overview of what I'm
actually going to be talking just quick
personal intro kind of like why I'm
actually talking here today a quick
overview of meteor and react native for
anyone who's not familiar with those
than just discussing how the two
technologies actually work together what
it's like being a developer using this
stack and then know just quick overview
of actually getting an app into
production some pros and cons of the
stack and then just a list of resources
that you want to go down this route just
kind of taking some of my last year and
making it easier for you so you can
really jump into it so that's what I'll
be covering today hopefully they'll all
um be super valuable
so who you know why am I talking right
now
as Josh Mensa mentioned I'm a developer
with differential I've been working with
them for a while now
I've been using react native since about
July of 2015 so pretty soon after it was
officially released to the public
meteor since around the end of 2013 I
think spend quite a while with that and
then since I started using react native
I've been using it with meteor every day
since July of 2015 so I've got quite a
lot of experience in this arena with
this this is where I spend my time in my
day job and then as of last week I moved
to Nashville Tennessee so if you're in
this area let me know so trying to
rebuild a little Network here and then
as I mentioned earlier I write about
react native and meteor and how I use
them together on media okay so quick
overview just what react native is just
so everyone's kind of on the same page
react natives its native apps with
JavaScript we used JavaScript and react
for just about everything which means
you know if you've got an understanding
of writing JavaScript and using react
you barely need to know anything about a
objective-c or Swift in the iOS
environment and barely any Java in the
Android environment then also I want to
mention that these are real mobile apps
it's not a webview kind of like what
Cordova does these view you know as we
see here on the right a view or a text
component those will actually render
down to kind of native equivalent so
it's not it's not a webview it's an
actual real mobile app and then lastly
just like react react native is backed
by Facebook they're kinda leading the
charge of managing and distributing
react native with a lot of open source
contributions so that right there I
think seeing that uses it they build it
they use it at the Facebook Ads manager
I believe and some of the group's app
those are built with react native
so not only are they working on
developing it but they're also you know
they've got a stake in it they they use
it in their apps okay and then also I
want to mention if you've got experience
with with using just building a normal
native app via for iOS or Andrew Android
you're probably used to you know having
to recompile your code and by using
react maybe you don't have to kind of
wait for that as you can see here
hopefully showing up alright but by
simply changing a lot of you know a
little bit of your code you can hot
reload it in your app and it's it's
great because you don't have to you know
wait or change out of your editor to go
and recompile your code your code it's
just all you know get a hot reload right
there which is one of my one of my
favorite parts of react native okay a
little background on media meteor is
just it's a really fast way to build
apps JavaScript everywhere we've got
JavaScript on our client we got it on
our server the database which is MongoDB
you know it's you're storing your data
like a JSON object so that's very
familiar there and then also the build
tool or what meteor is it's got a nice
it gives you a few things for free and
it's really nice in the sense that you
get real-time pub/sub if you want to use
that out of the box it's there it's
ready to go
same with user accounts then you got
like meteor methods there's just a bunch
of little things that every every modern
app is going to use meteor just kind of
brings that to the table to you up you
know right out of the box without you
having to do any sort of configuration
and then behind the scenes and we'll
cover this a little bit more later we're
using WebSockets which you know over
WebSockets were speaking DDP which is
the protocol the meteor development
group put together to actually make all
of this stuff work together then also
meteors got a Cordova integration if
you're familiar with Cordova it's just a
webview taking your website and kind of
wrapping it up in an app
so that you can actually you know build
you can take a website and make it an
app essentially and that's built you
know that's out of the box in and react
native art sorry and meteor and then
finally and this is something that's
really exciting now compared to you know
a year ago react angular in blaze
they're three different front ends that
you can use they're kind of called in
meteor in the meteor world first-class
citizens of front-end so you got you can
use reacts angular or blaze blazes
meteors kind of homegrown a front-end
solution that's built off handlebars so
what kind of touch on what's so awesome
about being able to use react easily
with meteor little later on okay so now
that we've kind of got an understanding
of know what react native is and what
meteor is how do we actually use the two
technologies together especially you
know coming from if you got like a
meteor background because meteor just
does so much for us out of the box so as
I mentioned earlier everything kind of
happens over WebSockets and a meteor
server is going to speak DDP and now if
you've tried to work on react native and
meteor say a year ago or nine months ago
is even six months ago it was a little
tricky because you kind of had to have a
little bit more intimate knowledge of
DDP which really isn't used you know
outside of meteor but fortunately open
source community being as amazing as it
is there's a NPM package called react
native meteor out there and essentially
what react native meteor does is gives
you a full meteor client API in react
native so you've got your pub/sub you've
got methods you've got your user
accounts all of that and it works the
same way that it does but you would
expect on the web um
beyond just you know the meteor client
API that you used to there's a few nice
to have components that
Meteor brings to the table I'm not
really going to cover those here
but if you're interested in wanting to
see like you know list views that easily
integrate with your media data go ahead
and check out react native meteor now
also you know I've got to give credit
where credit's due
and that maintainer and I apologize if I
pronounce his name incorrectly but Theo
Matthew he's put in a ton of work and to
actually making this package what it is
he's been super responsive we work we've
we've talked a few times because I know
they're using out the in progress teams
using it in production apps at
differential in our clients we're using
it as well so react native meteors kind
of like the magic that allows us to use
react native your together it'll do all
that hard stuff for us behind them and
then the first thing this is something
that is a bit of a deviation from just
using meteor on the web or meteor in
Cordova in those instances meteor
because you know it's as
all-encompassing as it is you don't have
to worry about making the connection and
it's just going to do all that behind
the scenes for you but since react
native is kind of you know it it's a
separate stack from meteor you have to
think about it as react natives are
client me or think about meteor as your
server and we need to make that we need
to manually establish that connection
between the two again fortunately for us
react native meteor makes it really easy
all we have to say is you know connect
meteor connect and then put in our web
stock at URL and that's what that ws
colon slash slash is that's just the
WebSocket protocol first it's like HTTP
and then we're putting in our IP address
and our port number and then meteor is
you know we can connect to the WebSocket
connection at forward slash WebSocket
and this will this goes ahead and
establishes our WebSocket connection it
manages it so say somebody you know
their connection drops or whatever
happens it'll go ahead and manage
reconnected
and it'll give you it'll update its
connection status you got access to all
of that data and of course its handling
it's it speaks GDP behind-the-scenes so
it's a really simple one-liner but it
does a lot of stuff especially if you've
used react native and meteor together in
the past where you have to do a lot more
of this stuff manually so that's the
first step in getting these two out
layers these two stacks that actually
work together um and then also just like
on you know the meteor web client we've
got this create container function which
is going to allow us to connect um in
this case my component to the meteor the
reactive meteor data and again just like
the standard meteor API we got things
like me to dot logging in meteor dot
user all these different things that are
going to allow us to have reactive data
and we can propagate those down through
props so that we can use the way that
react allows us to actually pass props
down and all of that and its normal way
so we can just create that container and
this likely looks very very similar to
what you're used to writing when using
meteor and react on web so that's all
all we need to do to connect a component
to our reactive data now if you're
familiar with meteor which ensure some
of you are you've likely used the meteor
methods and again I'll reiterate like
he's done some incredible work to make
the ache essentially exactly the same at
meteor methods is no different we're
absolutely use meteor call you know to
fetch data basically do all of your
credence that you need to you can pass
in any parameters for that handle the
result all of that just like you would
on
the wet it's it's super simple and again
this is all going over WebSockets and
speaking bdp so for anyone not familiar
with meteor this is essentially what you
use no arrest endpoint to so if you want
to fetch data it's kind of like a get
request create data it's kind of like a
post and so on so that's what we're
these meteor methods are coming into
play then also just like so many other
things react native meteors put together
the account system er given us our
client-side API again you know it's
one-to-one to what we've come to expect
from meteor on the web that way you know
your your code is essentially exactly
the same it's just in this case where
react things are compatible with react
native then you can install it over NPM
something to touch on here is you know
on the web all right any app once
somebody logs in I kind of expected to
stay logged in for at least some amount
of time and on meteor per the web or
media for Cordova it's going before that
user token and local storage and that's
kind of one of those deviations that we
have between meteor on the web and
meteor in react native where on the web
it's being stored in local storage but
in react native we don't have that so we
need to in the past we would have to
manually store that token that we
received back in a sink storage which is
essentially the same thing as local
stores just kind of tapping into the
native pieces that iOS or Android has to
actually store that store and persist
that data that's what meteor dot login
with password is going to do accounts to
create user it's going to not only call
those methods that are going to allow us
to do these different things but also to
store those tokens and allow a user to
just automatically be logged in the next
time they open the app up which again
I've talked about you know do penis six
to nine months ago you would have to do
all of this manually but now that we've
got react native media we don't have to
worry about that at all happens behind
the scenes for estimate it just works
kind of like the magic that we got from
meteor and then lastly um you know
something
meteors been kind of famous for at least
when it first came out was it's real
time pub/sub system right out of the box
um if you choose to use that and the
react native context again you've got
access to that we can see you know
starting on line 13 if you've got a you
know media dot publish items then you're
returning a cursor of items you know
from that publication you can go ahead
and subscribe to it here and just like
you know on the web we're able to return
a handler and wait until we wait until
that publication and the subscription is
actually ready and the data is on the
client to go ahead and show that data
and then finally we got this meteor
collection I don't stop find and this is
one of the bigger deviations in my
experience that react native meteor has
from meteor on the web so you know
typically if you use meteor on the web
you're going to be able to say you know
something like items that find that
check to actually return an array of
that data and the reason we can't use
that syntax here is because media being
the tool that it is you're defining your
hands on both the client and the server
so you can use that same variable in
both places and there's a meteor has a
really robust implementation of or
they've got the implementation of Ming
Bongo which is when you say dot fine is
actually going to return cursor rather
than an array in react native we don't
we don't know about the variables that
have been defined on the meteor server
and we can't import those because
they're in completely separate
environments
so this is kind of the workaround theas
put together that's meteor dot
collection items and that's going to tap
it into wherever the data is stored
within react native and however he's
handling that we'll go ahead and tap
into that to actually get that so you
just got to know the kind of the
collection name there first is actually
using the variable that's returned when
you create a new Mongo collection of
meteor and then finally the mini Mongo
implementation that is being used in
react native meteor it's not quite as
robust as it is on meteor meteor web
just because you know the one that's
written for meteor it's not on NPM and
it's only a meteor so this is kind of
like the best the best stopgap until we
can get access to that their
implementation and this stuff you know
you can use majority of the same stuff
you would use on mini mountainous you've
got fine fine one I think you can even
do updates and inserts and all of that
but the only difference for like fine is
it's not going to return a cursor it's
going to go ahead and return an array
for you and again once that date is
there and it it's real-time its reactive
so once that data updates and if it's
published to the client it'll go ahead
and update that array then you can go
ahead and handle that in your component
to update the you and what whatever way
makes sense for it okay so we've kind of
got a brief understanding of how you
actually developer I connect the meteor
stack to the react native stack but as
as developers like what's it actually
look like to develop for the snack
what's your kind of your day-to-day
gonna look like well the first thing we
have to do and this may seem really
basic for people but judging off the
questions I've received for people
coming from meteor especially people
who've worked with me for a while nail
it's kind of weird having to go outside
of the meteor command like you know
meteor just we get you to doing
everything we got meteor create we got
meteor run we got meteor run iOS all of
that stuff and we're still going to use
some of that in this case we'll use
meteor create crater meteor and that
will give us you know the most
bare-bones meteor app we could possibly
have
then on the other hand we've actually
got to go ahead and create that react
native app which is something that I
don't want to say confuses people but
you're not used to it if you if you've
worked with meteor for a long time
you're just so used to meteor doing
everything for you so with that running
react native and nit creator RN that'll
go ahead and put together an entire
entire you know native app for you so
you've got a functioning iOS app there
and you've got a functioning Android app
as well granted extremely basic it's
just screen of text but it is a native
app and something that brings me to
something I want to bring up that I love
about this specific stat is just how
quickly you can go ahead and go from you
know an idea to actually going ahead and
building on the Left we were in your
create creator art crater meteor on the
right we ran react native and it crater
RN that's two commands we've got a fully
we got a functional web app we got our
meteor server alright we've got a fully
functional react native that we don't
have to worry about any of that
configuration we don't have to worry
about you know messing around web web
pack it's we run those two commands and
we've got two fully functional apps that
we can now go ahead and start actually
you know building our applications which
I really like just coming from like more
of the business perspective I'm able to
jump into the the business problems
versus kind of like the developer
problems of setting up a web pack just
messing around all that stuff
and again like this might seem super
basic to a lot of people but to actually
run the apps again you kind of have to
go out of just the meteor context you
got a meteor and react native they're
not kind of tied together like meteor in
Cordova would be you're going to have to
go ahead and start meteor on one one
terminal and then react native in
another terminal window like like this
is ridiculously simple but sometimes
it's especially you know I've said this
multiple times coming from meteor for a
while it just weirds kind of have to you
know open up a new terminal window to
use different command and different
command beyond just meteor to you know
start running your app and developing
with it so if you're going down this
route remember that you run meteor
meteors acting as your server then react
native you've got to run that through
its build tool to actually you know get
that up and running and then finally
this is kind of a note that just if you
if you do decide to go down this route
remember and I don't know the reason for
this but if you're developing for an iOS
simulator so just choosing a device in
Xcode and running for that you can use
localhost your meteor connect but if
you're developing for anything else and
this is in the development environment
you need to use your machine's IP
address or wherever you've got meteor
running so like if you're developing on
your iOS you know your physical iOS
device if you're developing for the
Android emulator or an Android device
just remember that locals won't resolve
epically on those devices make sure to
care for machines current IP address and
plug that into this meteor connect just
so you know you're actually able to make
that DDP connection otherwise you'll see
in the console that the DDP connection
is failed to be created
okay so yeah once you get those once you
got media running and react native
running that's the point at which you
can go ahead and make that connection
that media dot connect and you know
using and having access to meteor
methods the pub/sub system the account
system all of that and then you know
from there on out you're able to do
whatever you need to for your specific
app um but if you want to go ahead and
skip over that the whole step of
generating me to your app generating
react native app and kind of figuring
out those little pieces you need to do
to actually integrate those I put
together and it's been out there for a
few months now this react native meteor
boilerplate and it's it just goes
through a lot of that configuration that
I've talked about today media dot
connect you know pub/sub examples meteor
methods and Method examples it's just
going to go through a lot of that and it
gives you some super super basic
examples just so you can see what it's
actually like and not have to worry
about those really really minut details
that you're only ever going to do once
once per app um and then also with that
I want to mention on the react native
side that's where all the work is on
meteor it's super super bare-bones so if
you go to like you know if you download
the boilerplate get it all running
you're going to see the most basic
possible meteor app if you go to in the
browser because I put there's there's so
many different ways to do a meteor app
especially with meteor right now I
didn't want to touch that just so people
had as much choice as they could so all
of the work is going to be in the react
native that and I'm also put together
some basic directory organization
there's not much there to it but I think
it gives you you know a decent
understanding of what it's like to
actually develop for it because it's
kind of thinking through the way T to
structure an app and I think just a way
to structure files it's a little bit
different on the
in a native environment verse lab just
then that mostly comes from like
differences in routing and different
different ways to think about that so
yeah you know before I move on I
actually want to show you guys what this
reactant meet your boiler plate brings
to the table so we'll jump over here
let's see it's not running okay so here
is the you know once you've got we can
see here we've got the meteor server
running and then down here this is
actually the react native packager
running um so yeah that just goes to
show that you know you've got these two
different technologies running side by
side and we'll go ahead and just it's a
super super basic boilerplate because I
wanted to make sure it would stay out of
your way if you want to use this to
build an actual application I don't want
it to you know get in the way it's just
a boilerplate it's not supposed to do a
bunch for you but just a few simple easy
to remove examples so first off we'll
just go through the create account and
this'll this will tap into that account
stock create user that I talked about
earlier we'll add that then put in a
password since we're going to create an
account you can kind of see just one way
this is why I'm choosing to do you know
passport verification make sure the user
is putting the two passwords in the same
then once we do that we'll go ahead and
create that account and then here you
can see like I said it's ridiculously
simple but we've just got some basic
routing set up here so you can just see
in this case I think I'm using IX router
to just handle these different
transitions and to see you know how once
you look in the directory structure you
can see how we're actually up we're
going to
files to do this then also here we got
just so we could experience different
tabs we've got like a profile screen
which will show you know Spencer
handlebar labs calm and this is pulling
from the meteor dot user so if I
actually open up I'm not doing this look
okay I don't break anything if we open
up oh c'mon go and jump into our users
collection let's see should be this one
so go ahead and edit this document and
since we're using just edit number there
since we're using meteor standard user
accounts it's going to set up a
publication behind-the-scenes first when
I say save you can see that in this
instance we're using the meteor pub/sub
system so as soon as I save that data in
the database
it'll be ripped up reflected and be in
the react native app so just like you
would expect on the and a meteor and a
meteor web app or meteor Cordova app
we've got this live reloading data then
also we can log out go ahead and test
the air capabilities figures I get an
error when doing this live um oh there's
a bug somewhere in here but we can go
ahead and we'll be able to tap into that
account system that user account that we
just set up before and if we refresh the
app it'll go ahead and log us back in
it's making that DDP connection doing
everything for us behind the scenes so
that's the react native meteor boiler
plot especially if you just want to mess
around with it and see what it's like to
build with this um I'd highly suggest
you guys
take a look at that and just search
react native meteor boilerplate and
it'll be their hub okay back to the
slides okay so that's kind of what you
know you can expect from developing for
the stack what about in production um
you know you've got meteor you got react
native what's it like getting it from
your development environment first off
and I'm not going to touch on this much
um but you got a we got to deploy your
meteor app somewhere and you know kind
of the three top options I think and I'm
people might have different opinions but
there's galaxy which is you know meteor
developments group action it's their
actual commercial offering that's meteor
hosting and that's what no I I generally
use mock which is open source and allows
you to deploy meteor app to you know
digital ocean or AWS second stuff and
then modulus is similar to Galaxy DM
it's just another way to deploy a meteor
app so that's like the first step you
got to take is to actually deploy your
meal and then submitting to the Apple
App Store what's what's that like is it
going to be different since you're using
react native which is JavaScript like
are there any complicated steps and the
answer is no like this is an actual you
know native iOS app so you're going to
go through the exact same processes that
you would if you're developing a native
app so I know this is oversimplification
probably wrong terminology but
essentially need to go ahead and compile
your app need to compile all of that
objective-c that's going on behind the
scenes when you do that and you know
compile it as real as a release or
create that archive
react natives aware of that event and
it'll go ahead and minify your
JavaScript bundle and all of that just
kind of store everything you know ready
to go looking like the native app that
it is
at that point you need to go through
iTunes Connect you need to jump through
all Apple's hoops it's a normal time
intensive process especially if you're
coming from like deploying to a web
where it's one one or two commands you
know it's out there and your clients
have all of that so it's a very similar
process to what you might be familiar
with if you've developed an iOS app um
and then also and this is a tool that
you know we use a lot we're starting to
use a lot that's called Fastlane if
you're if you're not familiar basically
it'll take all of these steps that you
have to go through to get an app into
the App Store and put it all into like
one command so I can just say Fastlane
beta I can wait you know 10 minutes or
whatever it is to compile the app at
least you have uploaded to iTunes all of
that is done within Fastlane and because
we were generating a real native that
we're able to use this Fastlane tool so
we use Fastlane for our iOS the iOS
version of the react native app and
working on right now to handle that
release process to our beta testers so
if you're familiar with it but you're
worried you know if you use react native
that you can't use some of these
conveniences that have been developed
for iOS developers just know that things
like Fastlane you can totally use them
we're using it right now so it's a very
it's a standard process there and the
same goes for the Google Play Store
you're actually generating an Android
app so you need to go ahead you need to
sign sign that app you need to generate
your release apk
apk you need to upload it to the fat up
upload it to the Play Store again all
the normal steps that you'd have to for
a normal Android app and this is
something I'm not sure but I wanted to
bring to people's attention is Fastlane
it's an absolutely incredible tool and
in the past it's been totally iOS
centric like that's that's all it's done
but
I believe the scope of the project is
it's kind of expanding to include
Android and we're not using it yet but
again you're building an Android app
it's just you know you happen as a
developer you're just happening to write
it be a react native you can use this
Fastlane tool hopefully in the near
future maybe even now to handle that
deployment process that you've got to do
through Google the Google Play Store and
then finally over-the-air updates this
is one of the like the supreme
advantages of using react native or any
any sort of way where you're running
JavaScript on your on your native app
and react native is actually running on
the JavaScript core environment on both
iOS and Android and that means that you
know we're able to actually send updates
to the the phone or whatever the device
is over-the-air rather than having to
like we said earlier we don't have to
compile native code it's just JavaScript
so we just kind of need to you know
bundle that up and then ship it off and
if you use meteor in Cordova like that
was one of the things when I was first
getting started with react native that I
was worried about like how am I going to
do over-the-air updates but since it's
just JavaScript you're writing you're
able to ship that over-the-air and one
of the tools were using that we're using
a differential is called code push the
it's a it's a delivery service that we
were able to it takes care of a lot of a
lot of the smaller things so team
collaboration just kind of like running
all the commands behind the scenes so if
I want to send out a new over-the-air
update all I just have one command I
have to run and code push handles you
know bundling minifying getting all the
image assets if there's any updates
there it handles getting all of that
together and it ships it off and then
next time somebody opens up the react
native that look for that update if
there's a new one out there
you've got a few different ways you can
actually download it and then the user
has your new updated code and I don't
know if I mentioned before but there's a
bunch of different tools out there
rather than code push cope it just
happens to be the one that we ended up
going with their backs it's actually
built by the Microsoft team so again
like that's that's an advantage it's a
larger team you know or it's a bigger
organization actually you know putting
at her behind that and the team within
Microsoft that's developing code pushes
one they're like really smart and
they've done some awesome stuff there
but well it's like their job to handle
this open source stuff and to develop it
so that was one of those reasons we went
down the code pusher out but you're not
comfortable working that just know
there's a bunch of different options you
can use to handle these over-the-air
updates and then finally with
over-the-air updates talking to few
develops you know put a word of warning
out there like it sounds awesome and
that you can do anything and like you
never have to deal with you know Apple
or Google in their kind of the pain that
is you know releasing that an app
through the app store but there are
limitations one there's technical
limitations so if you're ever you know
changing native code like renaming your
app if you're adding something like a
blur view which is going to tap into you
know native implementations and
basically if you ever text code or you
ever have to go into like Android studio
and modify anything that's one of those
updates you're probably not going to be
able to send over the air so be aware
that just know that you can't send every
single update over-the-air then also
beyond just the technical limitations
there you want to you know be aware of
kind of their terms of Terms of Use
um you know if you're developing that
that is a calculator one day and then
you're completely changing it and
shipping all the new stuff to make it
into
some other app that you know rather than
as a calculator it does I don't know it
takes pictures or something like that's
a pretty big difference in the intended
use of that application and that's
that's kind of a no-no on Apple's terms
so just be aware of that like for that
stuff for a change a function in the app
or if you're creating a new a new
feature I typically suggest going
through the App Store going through that
normal sometimes painful review process
just to make sure you know you're
covering your bases there but if you've
got a bug fix or something it's
completely okay to send those those
kinds of things over the air and using
react native and code push it just makes
it really really easy to do that okay um
some pros of this stack see there's
there's a bunch one you know both meteor
and react and ver super super fast to
get started with and again to develop
with like oh it's they're doing a lot
for you to make it easier to focus on
building your application rather than a
lot of the configuration stuff um it's
JavaScript everywhere rarely will you
need to touch any Objective C or Java or
some cases Swift so if you know you're
comfortable with JavaScript you can get
really really far with react native I
mean like I said earlier meeting in RAC
need to take care of a lot of that
tooling so you can just get going and
build right away and then if you're
using react on the web you're able to
use react principles across your entire
stack you've got you know react on the
web and then you've got react native on
your iOS / Android apps you react native
so that's really it's really awesome
especially if you're kind of like a
full-stack developer like you're working
on the web mobile app the backend it's
easier to do those context switches
since you're using react principles egg
wear whatever pro there's a condom a few
cons are the there's there's a loss of
flexibility especially on the meteor
side it's a big tool and you're locked
into a fair amount
it with it making it super easy like you
know that really really easy pub/sub a
really easy pub/sub system you're kind
of locked into Mongo at this point which
for some companies that's a non-starter
for a lot of stuff for everything I work
on it's fine like mine goes perfectly
fine database for us but it's something
be aware of like you do lose some
flexibility by taking in this ease that
maybe it brings to the table and then
also you know meteor makes it easy to
build react native makes it easy to
build and the reason it's a lot easier
you got this layer of abstraction on top
of it and this can lead to some
confusion if you ever run into you know
debugging issues because you know
sometimes that'll lead you down
something that knows and end up in a
objective-c file or a Java file and it
gets a little tough um it's somewhat
easy to read code and kind of kind that
it is something to be aware of um but I
do have to admit I have to say as a
caveat caveat to that um you know I use
react native a meteor every day on the
react native side like I rarely rarely
even less so every day with every new
release have to touch any Objective C or
Java should just know that like yes it
can sometimes lead to a problem but it's
getting less and less and the error
messages that do come with react native
are typically really really good and
also something be aware of if you're
familiar with meteor and you kind of
keep up with it you know this but here's
kind of in a state of flux now people
are kind of trying to figure out you
know what's next what's me or look like
six months down the line so just be
aware of that
but I will say like I'm still using
meteor any side projects I'm working and
I still use meteor again because I can
start building you know within 5 minutes
worth it versus having to spend a bunch
of time setting up my actual development
environment and then finally last thing
I want to talk about is just you know
before you use meteors pub/sub
stone it looks like magic it's awesome
but just think if that's the right
choice for your application especially
on the web sometimes it's just real-time
doesn't make sense and especially when
you consider you know how often
connections are dropping on mobile just
these are things you need to be aware of
when you're using WebSockets and you
know have this real time option at at
hand just be considered of that I don't
know that it's a con but it's something
that you've got to be consider very
quickly talk about you know looking into
the future especially on the meteor side
we got Apollo which is kind of graph QL
super easy could adopt and incrementally
adopt you've got more choice so instead
of being locked into Mongo you can you
can tap into a whole bunch of stuff so
there's a future if you're afraid of
kind of like this meteor the state of
flux in it flux it is in there's there's
kind of like a path forward it's just
not a super defined path at this point
but just be aware of that
hopefully just about done have an
understanding of meteor and react native
how to actually connect those two
technologies together how to develop for
the stack and you know just in different
spots to get started what it's like to
use your getting the app into a
production environment quick coverage of
pros and cons and then a quick look into
the future resource list I guess we'll
see how we can actually show this but
these are just a few the different
technologies I talked about throughout
this that's react native meteor react
native meteor could push fast lane the
react native meter boilerplate and then
finally react native meteor calm which
will bring you to my medium post where I
go into a lot more depth on a lot of
this stuff there so if you want to learn
more check out react named Mediacom sign
up for the mailing list and yeah just
read some that stuff I hopefully it's
pretty billy and that's it so
yeah thanks everyone for listening and
let me know what you thought you can
reach me Spencer and restore underscore
Carly on Twitter and yeah if you've ever
got any questions or want me to dive
deeper into something just hit me up
there shoot me an email awesome good
talk to her Spencer
now brief word from our sponsors before
you see the rest of the talk
Raygun spend more time building great
software and less time fighting it
Regan helps keep a watchful eye on your
web and mobile applications and tells
you when problems arise you can learn
more at Regan comm native script back by
telluric by progress is an open source
framework for building truly native
mobile apps with typescript and angular
to use your web skills to get native UI
and performance on iOS and Android enjoy
the rest of the talk that uh yeah so
there were some so far um the first one
is from Ryan have you ever used redux
with react native immediate before since
leaving meteor I fall in love with
writing stateless function views
functional views which are fed from a
top-level store like reader it's all
data flows one direction and is easily
understood for my experience using
meteors pub/sub system mixed data more
difficult to manage yeah so we do use
read I was very heavily like the entire
app I'm working on right now is
everything's based on redux um but as
you mentioned using the pub/sub system
makes that really really difficult and
you know and folders closure like we
don't use meteors pub/sub system for
anything beyond like the user account so
that's its consideration to make Redux
with react native and meteor it's
totally possible but tapping into the
pub/sub system is going to get tricky
the one thing that we do use it for for
user accounts we just kind of manually
you know check if there's a difference
between I think it's like the user ID or
if you know
if meteor dot user returns null or if it
has an object we'll go ahead and
manually update the storm like a
component should update our component
will update whatever that lifecycle
event is is how we actually go ahead and
manage that that update it let's see
what else do we have what is the
fundamental reason to use both react and
meteor together instead of going all in
on react atmosphere blaze question mark
yes so reason we're using react and
meteor together it's just like the speed
that we can you know get developing
really meteor for us is just a server so
we're using it for kind of the
out-of-the-box Mongo um you know we got
user account so we've got a lot of stuff
there where it's just one or two
commands and we've got it we don't have
to worry about that anymore and where
it's just good to go so it's I love the
stuff we got for free and that's that's
the reason we use meteor awesome is the
data fetched on the react native side
cached in a Singh storage would it
persists when losing the networks um I'm
not super familiar with react native
meteor behind the scenes but I don't
think it's cash so like if you do lose a
network connection if you're not you
know properly making checks in your app
you might lose that data but like like I
mentioned earlier we're using Redux so
if you're using if you're using Redux on
your react native client things like
Redux storage you can go ahead and write
that to async storage to persist it if
you do lose a connection kind of give
the user at least a temporary experience
all right I am almost done with my iOS
native app would you recommend recoding
and react native to go X platform or
just move ahead with native web native
Android I mean I guess it I don't know
that's a big question
yeah um so like maybe I'll jump in here
like I'll just say you gotta decide what
makes the most sense to your business
and like write about that that business
value and if you think it's gonna be
hard to hire someone to do the Android
side of things or you're worried about
the Java side like for writing Android
like that might make sense to maybe
rethink it and recode it but I'm not
sure
there are a lot of instances where I
would stop something that's close to
production and go back and redo it on
another platform at this point yeah I
guess I'd say just uh if I'm if I was in
that situation I'd say like maybe if
you're gonna start this Android app do
it and react native um and be aware that
way you know if you know if you want if
you've got the resources if you got no
you need feature parity um you can kind
of as you're working on your Android app
just you know slow sprinkle in this iOS
stuff and just be aware of that um but
to cut just to drop an app and then
rebuild that it depends on your business
I don't know yeah yeah I can't imagine
like sitting and waiting waiting on a
business like launching a business would
be the right move my good question them
uh uh in my iOS app is all core data I'm
intrigued by realm as a cross-platform
database
how does react native deal with the
database across all these platforms have
you used roam yet I haven't
it's I wanted to tap into it but I think
instead of going realm we ended up using
Redux um
which does everything we need it to but
realm does look really interesting I
just can't talk about any just
um specifics on it but I do know there's
like a realm react native binding that
you know you're able to use realm in iOS
and Android Oh Sebastian asked is meteor
dangerous choice for a long-term
solution is there possibility and may
lose support in the future I mean
there's possibly any always support in
the future um yeah like I would I would
stay maybe it loses like MDG support in
the future which is oddly weird cuz
they're not on the group but like I
don't think it's gonna go way um I think
it'll just be more of a community
supported solution which is essentially
what's happened at this point right like
right but Ben Newman's the guy working
on it and that's about it
and they recently just as of like
yesterday said he's gonna be working on
Apollo integration for a meteor 1/5 so
like even he's sort of meteor sort of
Apollo so yeah I mean with that like
maybe meteor as we know it today won't
exist and six months a year but you know
as we see with like I think it's meteor
1/5 or 1/4 just kind of like integrating
Apollo the stuff that meteor development
group is working on today there are at
least be a path moving forward of
integrating with these new technologies
and doing doing that stuff yeah yeah
so not a way but maybe very different
yeah uh okay this is a common one too
like how much code reuse sharing can you
get between your meteor react v later
and your react native components I guess
yes none yes so this is something we're
trying to figure out a little bit um we
don't super have a use case right now to
dive into it since we're not really
building for the web but something we're
looking at is mostly
since we're using redux we hope we're
going to be able to kind of share our
reducers our actions all that stuff but
when we actually look at the components
you know since react components going to
I don't have divs h1 tags P tags all of
that which react native doesn't know
about we use you know view component
Technic on all of that there isn't too
much we can use there and I don't know
that we want to because you know what I
was probably going to look different
from your your your native that put
those things behind the scenes the Redux
stuff that's where I see a lot of that
code reuse happening I just haven't been
able to dive into that because it's not
on any apps that I'm working on
yeah alright I think that was the last
question which is good timing we got
about four minutes full panel starts so
Thank You Spencer for that talk it was
very very interesting to watch sure
thank thanks for having me all right
guys we'll take a quick break and we'll
be back around 4 p.m. Eastern in four
minutes to start the next one thanks for
watching this crater cough talk from the
Mobile Edition 2016 for more information
about upcoming conferences such as the
one in February 2017 go to camp crater
