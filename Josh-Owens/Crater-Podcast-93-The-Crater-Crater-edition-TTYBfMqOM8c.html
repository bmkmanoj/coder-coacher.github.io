2016 welcome crater fans I'm your
regular host Josh Owens along with my
regular coast been Strahan hello
everybody what's up dude what's up bro
and uh strange this is like the first
time you know I've done the podcast to
give him like three weeks or something
yeah right and I'll dude wild it was uh
it was a first last week without having
you yeah that's the I think that's maybe
the first show we've done without me I
don't know that's interesting there
might have been one in there with a
differential like someone okay maybe
they subbed in I don't know I'd have to
go early days yeah clearly early on yeah
we missed you man yeah you guys did a
good job we did alright we didn't write
hey I still haven't even made it through
the whole thing but I was like I was
watching actually got the Youtube
version up and watching it like 1.25 x
yeah i found myself uh wishing that
there was there was a faster speed and
2x faster speed than 2x yes yeah on
youtube I am I just first I need to like
double the time i have in my life
somehow you know i just find like
sometimes words become unintelligible or
i don't know i don't i could do 1.5 but
anything above that I just don't know so
there's different ways to like listen
right so like if you got like 1.5 you
can take every word in if you got like 2
or higher than to like you're really
looking for the cliff notes so like
you're you're waiting for like sections
and stuff on YouTube it's easier because
you can visually see where the sections
are too yeah it was just audio anyway
that's yeah it's wild man mmm wildlife I
will I will say it was an interesting a
week off of the podcast I was supposed
to do a class on Monday and Tuesday but
I got sick and didn't Oh last weekend
and I didn't have time to prep for the
so moved it back to Friday and Monday oh
and I think well we did meteor 13 and
react and this is your mastering
meteorite yeah new and new and improved
updated yeah totally it's been uh been
an interesting ride and I have a feeling
we'll hear more about it over the next
couple weeks to leak yes 1.3 gets closer
I've started to form opinions of
opinions on mantra now too yeah it's
it's now that uh it's not so much
JavaScript fatigue out there but like
people are are finally catching up and
you know I'm bracing or changing or
consuming all this new stuff now like
opinions are coming out and there's
gonna be iterations on top of that now
and in opinions and it it's going to
leave the good stuff but man there's
just gonna be 2016 is gonna be very
dusty there's always gonna be dust
stirring up I think for the whole year
yeah so yeah definitely like I think you
know that I'm excited for the MPN
integration that's coming but I you know
at the same time over the course of the
year I think that will also become a
little bit of pain point as we move into
like doing away with excuse me I believe
God well I mean it's so atmosphere Oh
got something way through atmosphere is
really just a informational site right
like they don't actually host any
packages most people don't realize that
but the the package servers actually run
by meteor and they'll be doing away with
that so yeah supposedly at some point
this year though they'll do away with
that but you know I think when that
happens it'll be a little painful again
like having to shift all those packages
over to mpm getting them published and
absolutely and the question that that
I'm thinking about that is an answer
correctly or fully yet because how many
packages really will be converted over a
lot of lot of popular packages that are
being used right now are acceptable and
functional right now but
they don't get maintained you know are
they were maintained a long time ago are
you gonna are they going to make the
trip over to mpm well you know my
response to that would be like how many
of those do you need to make the trip to
NPM right like I'm already starting to
look at react router and AH the reactive
helmet and all that kind of stuff
because like I don't that stuff's not
not going to go anywhere in my opinion
like again the reactivated me is
probably double the size of the media
community and you know they're they're
pushing that kind of stuff forward and I
think that that is gonna it sits there
now you can use it it's going to stay
stable you can bring it into your
project and use it with a meteor 13
project pretty easily yeah I would have
to agree and then a lot of people are
going back home we're going to lose
functionality or like ease of use and I
think really we can we can make packages
that like plug into these other popular
ones yeah like go out and like build a
whole special router for meteor like we
could we could make things that will
make a react router work better for us
right you'd right yeah like someone
already has a package that uses react
router and SSR and you can install that
now I mean it doesn't Italy I don't
think it'll work right with meteor 13
but it'll be interesting to see that
kind of get updated as well so yeah well
a lot of good lot of bad I think it's a
lot more good because I've always been
saying meteor feels like a call feels
like it's on its own planet now now
we're like joining the mainstream and
there's going to be some pain with it
but ultimately it's gonna like meteor to
the masses yeah I really interesting see
like you know there's a I've been
working with someone in that they're
gonna do their first space dojo guest
post and it's on trekker react and like
you know I I think tracker react starts
to become interesting outside of the
meteor ecosystem as soon as like tracker
becomes a package you can install from
mpm yes you know and in
so then you have like things like our
xjs or something like that and then you
have tracker and you can use track we
react and it's like minute it's easy fun
stuff all right so like this is the
intro to our show indeed like I just
totally like like a whole story right
there and I did he really didn't have it
in our list we we got so yeah I guess we
did right like that's well yeah you good
segue that's what you got got me there
you go oh that was those intentional
they lost its all time so on this joke
we're going to talk about tracker react
we're going to talk about critic off day
one videos a mini Mongo explorer and
functional programming for JavaScript
people mmhmm yeah so yeah trekker react
like it was really interesting i
actually found it halfway through the
class like I don't know maybe my
students got annoyed but we switched on
the first day of class where he's in
react composer and on the second day
class we were using tracker react and I
you know I think um I want to like
welcome to the modern state of me I was
right okay this is a class on JavaScript
welcome yes we're gonna have some
fatigue here lesson number one you're on
shifting ground yes yes absolutely i
mean you can't take a class on me tiro
13 beta and not feel like you're on a
little bit of shifting ground mmm yeah
things are still shaking out the life
jacket if you go to joshs class
everybody learned stuff that's what
matters well no seriously if i could do
a little like plug for you mastering
meteor got me started in like everything
you know i was like one of the very
first things I ever did as a developer
and look like a year and a half later
like look at where everything has come
so I mastering meteor is just like it
was a great like platform so up highly
recommend it guys go check it out at
space dojo com or mmm yeah hey yeah it
is but I gotta I gotta fix the website
so you sign up there cool that's my
that's my project for the weekend um
yeah so like have you have you done
anything yet with uh me to react at all
yeah yeah but with meteor or no yeah but
we're just using the mixin okay so if
people aren't aware like mix-ins are
dead they're just they're deprecated
already i think in zero dot 14 so when
when version 15 comes out right not zero
dot 15 but 15 um they'll be I don't know
I I would assume that actually given the
version changes they would probably kill
that out of react pretty fast i don't
know it's been marked deprecated that'll
be interesting haven't looked into that
yet but i don't know now that are gonna
be having minor releases and bug
releases yeah it really says who knows
what it's going to look like now yeah
well i would assume like you know any
time like when meteor goes from one
point whatever at a two point oh i would
assume that that's the time you'll see
things die off like that are gonna get
deprecated you know and the coming
months probably ah but yeah so I you
know mix-ins are dead they're going away
at some point so you know get meteor
data and all the the kind of hackish
stuff that mdg wrote to get react
working will go away and you'll have to
have something else in its place and you
know you've got the the air no de camp
which is react composer and then you
have the tracker react and then I mean
there are still ways that you can use
the mix in in meteor 1.3 like you could
use the seven decorators or there's a
react mix in that I think Abby shows in
one of his posts that you can use to
kind of make everything work still but
to me tracker react is super super
interesting because I can just wrap my
component with tracker react and it's
basically it just got a little bit of
code it goes and wraps the entire
component with tracker and so anything
that would
kind of kick off a computation right any
reactive data source that meteor has
will automatically update and rerun
anytime that computation we get
invalidate just like how blazed works
was similar to how blazed works right
with Trevor and I I think it's super
smart like if you look at the docs on it
you can see like I you don't even really
change one licky add one thing to align
a code at the top of your react class
and it'll do all the smarts for you
after that and it was I think it's more
the meteor way right like it when I look
at react composer it feels different and
weird like we're writing some JavaScript
that's generating a container but we
never actually like write any jsx to
generate that container mm-hmm and so
it's not super apparent how that's all
getting there and like you're not
passing the components like it's doing
it all for you and some niceties come
along right like loading like react
composer will say it's loading if your
data is not ready uh but I you know I to
me I would agree with you tracker react
feels a lot like template level
subscriptions basically it's like
component level subscriptions yes and I
really really like that a lot yeah so
and I could stuff I guess in Sasha wrote
a post to probably worth mentioning
Sasha grief and he has another option as
well it's like a list component list an
item component which is interesting but
I think I still like to control it
myself so tracker react is still I think
maybe Aaron notas goes too far in it one
direction and like Sasha's goes too far
in another direction and I like that I
get more control tracker reactant that's
good way of putting it yeah meteor ish
yeah right in the middle well we'll have
to everyone let's keep an eye on
adoption of this and go out and try it
out yeah you know we're gonna as a
community we
usually settle on one one thing or two
things yeah it'll be interesting to see
what happens with this well it'll be
interesting to see to write because like
there's if you're if you haven't been
following all this there's a thread on
meteors react packages repo that Evan
you started before he left mdg and he
was kind of proposing the changes that
would happen after 1.3 and it looks like
tom coleman to pick that up now and so
that that'll maybe be interesting but I
you know they were discussing react
composer and other options but it sounds
like they still want to build something
even though i think tracker react is
probably it mmm hopefully they'll pay
attention to that more stuff yeah what's
not cool well guys if you want to check
it out go to github com ultimate jas
tracker react yep good stuff simple
library it's really small actually yeah
they it like i was saying that he was
just doing a rewrite you know yeah cool
contributor to the meteor world thank
you do you know indeed very cool so some
big news some some talking about
contributing to the media world he did
something great like we had a couple
weeks back we had a crater comp remote
crater calm and and you opened up videos
to the world yeah exhilarate they were
just too good to sit on man like people
gotta watch this stuff especially a lake
may I know you're on day three but I
think day one really came in pretty
strong I would have to agree like I
watched these later yeah and I was like
wow this this is a stack day yeah I know
it was interesting right like there's
definitely a lake for me i found the the
programmer ones maybe a little more
interesting like derek bailey his talk
was like it was great definitely like
honestly he breezed through like he had
this great list of yeah
2015 syntax changes and was going over
like he just went over a small subset
was like six things or something yeah he
went over I got a list here he went over
arrow functions object literal short
hands I dressed prams modules which is
really good oppressed and destructing
assignment so is good stuff that and
that's just a small subset right well he
still you know he went over that stuff
in depth and then kind of breeze through
some of the other stuff that you can go
learn more on too and that was just like
honestly it was it was pretty amazing
photos of 40 45 minute talk he gave yeah
yeah so that was that was just one of
the videos so so you really stay one
which was more talks for videos second
one released was a peek Corey someone
that maybe the JavaScript world doesn't
know about but everyone in the media
world does yeah he's known for for
security yeah talk on hacking meteor
with no SQL injection I you know I love
I love his backstory right like I I tend
to do some consulting here and there on
security stuff as well and I've written
a couple blog post but like Pete's whole
story is set up from the get go about
you know he started a job as like a
person that used to check people's
systems for like hack ability and he got
to learn a lot of neat tricks and tools
and how to kind of almost think in a
black hat way as like one of his first
jobs so yeah kind of cool you mean white
hat right wait well yeah I guess now
it's it's white hat right since he's
doing it for the good of everyone else
that's right yeah but know that video is
great because it is he goes in there and
like he takes them so if you have a
plural site subscription you can go look
at this I love that yeah you can go look
at the the I have what's that guy's name
like please roll what a troll he's a
pretty well-known kind of trainer but uh
Pete just takes his coolest like the
code from his course and I starts
hacking the crap out of it and then he's
like
okay now that you've seen how to do it
like here's how you would actually go
fix this and make this is like some
serious stuff so like in the course you
build an e-commerce site with meteor
yeah so you dealing with people's
shopping carts there you got user
accounts you got uh money being
exchanged yeah yeah yeah he totally
shows how like you could take a seventy
thousand dollar product and get it for a
dollar yeah yeah I like you should be
well if you're if you use meteor you
should watch this video like it should
be required watching in my opinion yeah
yeah it's um I think the biggest
surprise like so their solutions once
once the light bulb goes off people be
like okay well this is how we work
around it but in the meantime people can
go along and not grasp how powerful
queries lectures are mmm and I in Mongo
yeah like this really like shows you
like hey you can't like ignore that you
really can't so it's fun it's cool and
you want to get better with like Mongo
queries just watch this thing yeah yeah
and then um uh what's-his-name Dom from
mdg gave a talk on like building
reactive interfaces she's pretty good
just a little short but it was good it
was an extension off of an article that
they wrote on the percolate blog yeah so
and I wouldn't say it was like
specifically for reactive apps like I
really think like this it should be open
for every designer till I kind of get
these guidelines and just a modern way
on building apps and user experience
yeah yeah more on user experience yeah
the majority of it was like you know ux
like you know thinking about animations
and how we can use animations to
highlight highlight stuff so it was
interesting and then Ramsay gave a talk
on CSS modules yeah in react which I
don't know for me like I is probably
slightly less interesting just because I
don't really write yes that often we'll
see avoid it when I can
you really enjoy DevOps that that's your
hobby so like your developer with with a
leaning towards the back end yeah and
then I'm a developer leaning towards the
front end and so I like I really enjoyed
Dom's talk I really did because I don't
see you I'll say like I did enjoy Dom's
talk I just wish it would have been
maybe a little longer yeah because I do
enjoy thinking about that user
experience like I have a client right
now where they just have loading screen
it just says loading and I think the
cleaner thing you know it's a it's it's
built on rockets at the cleaner thing
would be to have like the animated kind
of like background that slack shows you
which is like kind of like fake messages
moving around and then all of a sudden
gets replaced by real stuff the cool
thing with slack is you could do your
custom loading messages yeah is it so
anyway it's fun so I really think Dom
was very efficient in his talk so so I
really could yeah yeah the guy who's
saying that I wish that there was a 3x
speed on YouTube nice nice that's but
like Ramses talk was really good too
because um talking about like JavaScript
fatigue and in like all the dust being
kicked up on where we're going to settle
there's a huge thing going right now
with CSS mhm and react introduced inline
styles to the mainstream or at least
brought that conversation back because
like for longest time and inline styles
were bad bad horrible and then react was
like inline Styles is a way to go and
kind of like brought the conversation to
the forefront and then there's like this
big tug of war back and forth so Ramsay
laid it out he's like you know this is
why inline styles are bad and then he
like took on the challenge which I
really appreciate because this is a
question that everyone's going to be
asking like radium looks like a good a
good package to use with react you know
in CSS and it's pretty popular and he
lays it out like why not to use radium
and after listening like and that needs
to be talked about so and I really think
you did a great job laying out why CSS
modules is superior and it was really
neat in his demos and examples that
he walked through his web pack
configuration as well and how to
integrate preprocessors like good stuff
so it is that it was actually a very
technical talk really enjoyed it yeah it
was it was good just maybe less
interesting to me yeah and that's cool
you know you know what I probably find
the most interesting out all this is
looking at the stats like you know when
when I upload videos I'm always like
what you know what are these videos
gonna do like staring in at you that's
weird um you're watching the video
version you just saw that but uh uh you
know uh like I really thought like
Pete's talk would be like the one that
kind of like took off but it was
actually Derek's he's not over a
thousand views on that thing yeah few
days well so like Derek is Derek that's
right that's Ross perhaps a little more
well-known we're talking about
JavaScript as a whole I can secure 2015
that's another thing Pete is Pete which
we love Pete and that's why I introduced
it like everyone should know him he's
known in the meteor world now everyone
else needs to know and then he was
talking about no SQL which people don't
usually search no SQL these terms like
mommy yeah i mean that's why i rename
the talk to hacking meteor yeah i think
it's a little more on point you know um
but i don't know you know just i find
that stuff interesting like it's very
interesting i posted this everywhere
like Derek posted on his blog and
tweeted once and like I was posting
Pete's everywhere and I was like 358
people watch so you know I'm telling you
is required watching for Pete's
definitely check it out seriously but I
you know I think I wonder like I can't
see the analytics for it yet but I kind
of wonder if if YouTube itself is
driving a lot of search traffic to the
Derrick's es2015 talk
we'll find out once YouTube is like the
third most popular search engine right
so it's like mm-hmm you know what what
are people searching yeah definitely
yeah it's interesting Eddie anyway guys
go check out day one uh hey Josh what's
uh what's the thoughts on releasing the
other days are you guy like do it gonna
do like a different day each week uh the
next three weeks or yeah I'll probably I
don't know what they have at least that
on um but yeah probably sometime next
week I'll release day two videos and
then day three videos and we had like a
bonus makeup session too because um Sam
couldn't make it at the start of his
talk so we did that later and then um
Jeremy had an emergency come up so we
rescheduled his and it has another day
as well Wow so yeah we're gonna I'll
probably release day to next week and
then day three the week after that very
cool yeah very cool I think everyone
should watch my video to like know what
not to do at a talk ah because like I
have never had that experience happen to
me before work we're like say someone
gets tongue-tied or they totally like
blank out at a talk if they got up on
stage I love public speaking I love
seeing people and seeing their reaction
this was the very first experience that
there was no one to see it was taught
nope you in a room talking complete
silence and I I locked up I totally
locked up so I'm curious to like replay
that video and see what is like III
broke in I was like the voice of God
it's a call like not and you know why
yeah I I felt the heaviness of stress
lift off me when your voice came in it
was so weird it was like that is funny
it's like oh the voice of God uh oh it
is so weird because I never everyone
who's always have always said like
people have always talked about the fear
of public speaking and I always like
felt foreign to those Congress
asians like you have a fear of speaking
to an empty room I could totally relate
I think that's similar to what they feel
now so honestly oh man i have i have
great compassion for people who for all
types now nice anyway all right ah Mini
Mini Mini Mini Mongo explorer yes yeah
what is this hmm yeah we got a handy
google chrome extension here yes yeah
definitely um so I guess if you're
familiar with like react right like this
is one of the things that I've been
enjoying about react is there's there's
dev tools that you can install for
Chrome adds a react tab and you can kind
of like browse through it like this is
you know one of the arguments for why
like blaze maybe wasn't going to stick
around is because there's no blaze tools
like this no surprise here's one right
exactly uh it's called mini Mongo
Explorer and so oh wait uh was supposed
to say something about meteor toys how
are you yeah Maxo and he said he said my
silence was consent that i would i would
say something about meteor toys on on
the podcast um so it's like a meteor uh
what was it called Mon Mongol right
Mongol what was uh what's his his Co he
is just okay it's coming back to me now
sorry sorry max no message me man so you
know the interesting thing is that
interesting I can't talk is that you
know he's doing browser based tools
whereas I i think that uh using chrome
inspector as a way to kind of get data
onto the screen is also a valid way to
do it and that's exactly what mini Mongo
explorer is doing there's a Chrome
extension that you install it looks like
it's not in the chrome store yet so you
have to download he's got a compiled
binary in there
and you can open the chrome extensions
tab and then drag and drop the binary in
there yes oh I love enabling developer
mode in my Chrome browser so i can get
all the hackers and their malicious
anyways i think uh but you know it like
if you if you click the link and you
take a look like it's it's pretty simple
you know it's it's just showing you
counts it shows you collections on the
left and there's counts for how many you
have and then you can click on that and
kind of open it up and start browsing it
so it's pretty slick looking it is like
yeah it's just another developer tool so
what are pretty important like redox is
really like making a lot of ground and I
think it's because of their tooling yeah
so this is this is good stuff so I
commend uh gosh radica me I don't know
how to say your name dude it that
sounded like an awesome like porno name
right there vedic me read it could be I
don't think of me I'm sorry I probably
butchered that that's welcome to the
club dude you are you are much better at
saying names than I am so I just maybe
I'm the one that says them so I take the
most eat for screwing them up alright
well I'll get the next one then okay so
our last topic to talk about today is
another article from Czech corcos I'm
pretty sure I've screwed that name up
before too yeah cucos know anyway so
like last week we we covered an article
from chat as well and it's along the
same lines he wrote another one which I
really appreciate functional programming
for JavaScript people and he I love chat
this is why I love chat because he is
super smart he's studying to be a PhD or
maybe here he is I got
I catch up with him but I love how he
introduces this article and he's like oh
you know I learned functional
programming and I want to like make an
article it's like introduce it to other
people a little bit more dumb down da da
da and then like you read this article
and you're like oh man I feel stupid you
read more like oh man I feel stupid her
yeah or you're like oh gosh I would
nobody I need to spend my whole weekend
under steady this chat is just at a
higher level than all of us all rights a
night so I would say like most people
feel this way when they first get
introduced a functional programming so
like it's okay to be like what like to
feel like maybe something's melting
inside your brain well and I'm even like
talking about like how he correlates so
like he introduces different things
about functional program and he's like
oh it's like this or it's like that or
now man now it's like what
mathematicians have always been doing
and da da da nearly why what what is
this algebraic blah blah blah what Eddie
who this is like really good i really
appreciate it because i'm going to go
back to this article and read it even
more in depth he really does step
through it from a very basic level and
build upon it and i think that's what i
really appreciate it so longer article 2
longer read it's going to get you
searching for more things you're going
to have google browser open or the
google open down the side just like
searching things as you read it but he
steps in a natural progression into
functional programming compares it to
haskell a lot of times and it's good it
is really good especially for someone
who lives just in javascript like myself
and I really don't explore other
languages that much this is this is
really good and the performance is great
my question is and I'm curious what you
have to say about this Josh what was
everything going on right now and a lot
of things going on in in reactivity of
data data management tape manin the
whole UI wars should like functional
programming like that's another thing
that's like coming to the forefront now
and is getting pretty important
well yeah so I mean if you think about
like rejected so much stuff like where
do we prioritize it learning this and
going into it it's like man are we like
shaving hairs here like the law of
diminishing returns is it really like a
good thing to like learn this stuff I
think it's good thing to learn this
stuff and I think if you look at like
we'll be doing a podcast next week with
Richard Feldman talking about elm-in-elm
lang you know and i think that uh if you
if you look at elixir or you look at elm
or any of those like they're all kind of
taking these functional ideas and
applying them and i don't know like it's
it's super interesting to me and like
all these ideas even if you're using
javascript which could go either way
right it can be a functional language or
it can be you know object oriented and a
lot of people are annoyed they've added
the object oriented stuff and they're
more but i think it's worth taking the
time to learn if nothing else just to
understand how you might write some code
in different ways and i'll do think that
a lot of these like i was trying to say
like they're these ideas are coming in
to react in redox and kind of being
imported from these other languages and
these thought processes are coming in
because you know that at the end of the
day like you want to be able to write
code that says bug free as you can and
and that's really like functional to me
functional program is either about
performance or like eric etching or
something is better there that you're
trying to achieve and so it's it's at
least worth learning what that side
looks like and maybe test it out yeah i
find it harder to read um code existing
code that it's like all functions even i
found myself scrolling up and down a
file like crazy trying to understand
what function does what and if we're
just like and when I was going through
Chet's article and two different ways
that you can use it like a functional
composition
oh it's another one uh like function
caring and all that stuff crating yeah
yeah yeah and it's like oh my gosh like
now you got to have this deeper
understanding and if you don't you're
like totally totally totally going to be
lost going into someone else's code base
and reading it like you want to be able
to read it I'm gonna be able understand
really what's going on I I just think to
me that's like the first time you open a
jsx file that's got a lot going on
you're like whoa you know what is this
and then like the more time you spend
their the easier it gets to read like I
feel like I can open to j sx now now and
kind of understand what's going on
absolutely and you could read it from
top to bottom and in you're good to go
anyway that that's I I'm still the
jury's out for me pick this I you know
to me I guess I would compare it to like
learning spanish right like at some
point the language is a little bit
different here and there which is I mean
maybe weird because we're talking about
just JavaScript still but uh you know
like the way you construct things in a
sentence is going to be different and
like functional is that way to you know
functional programming and so like as
you start to convert to that and figure
out like you're gonna get better the
more you use it and I think that you
know at some point you'll be able to
open a file and be like oh yeah I
totally get what's going on here I see
what you're doing yeah I guess this is
total war because as his programmers we
always like to say hey we're lazy so so
we build things so it can be done for us
and we don't need to repeat herself and
keep it dry and also but then like we
introduce these different ways of
writing stuff and everything and it's
like super complex and different from
each other and so at the same time we
don't not lazy in that sense of things
we got to like become a polygon or
something like that and so it's like I
don't know I don't know where to put
myself so I kind of sitting in the
middle here you know it's interesting
like you're saying a lot of work like it
was reading another article today about
like microservices and how they have
this tendency to turn into Lake
distributive monoliths instead of micro
services and they were talking a lot
about that as well like the fact that
one of the advantages microservice is
the fact that you can be a polyglot
right like you can use the best tool for
the job but then at some point like you
start to build these libraries that you
have to rely on and all of a sudden like
you've got this distributed model if and
you need to import this other library
that is being produced and to be able to
consume something and I don't know yeah
these are all real problems I guess to
real problems yeah they're just they're
so far above us sometimes like I don't
know feels like it's not not my problem
right now yeah so guys if you're
watching this we're listening to this go
ahead and like respond and let us know
what you think about this dilemma where
where should the average developer land
you know so I definitely see people who
are building mainstream packages or
frameworks platforms like they
definitely need to know this stuff but
like the average developer I'm curious
I'm curious what you all think yeah my
my gut would say like give it a try oh
absolutely yeah yeah you definitely
don't want to be you definitely cannot
draw a conclusion without giving it a
try yeah yeah so be ignorant like that
okay don't be you know I waiting word
the thing the thing that I think is
maybe the most scary is that it's like
some of these concepts feel so foreign
like I remember people explaining
object-oriented coding to me and like it
like I wasn't getting it at first you
know and then like I kept practicing and
kept trying like you just finally it
just clicks for you all of a sudden and
I think that you know it maybe feels
that way and it can be frustrating to
like get through that piece that's a
good point yeah like like monads someone
says monads and you're just like
yeah yeah that's a horrible name to call
me we try love like 50 listeners right
there when I said monads I just they
have paws and through their their device
cross room anyway oh yes that's the four
topics for this week indeed thanks to
Chet that was a long read man oh you
know most but I open most medium
articles in there like four minutes long
and this one was like what does this one
say set up 17 minutes it takes more than
17 minutes guys but I yeah like if you
just straight reddit like it would take
17 minutes but none of its gonna soak in
like you're gonna stop and reread and
think about it yeah yeah good stuff
beyond 170 minutes that's what you
should set aside for it Thanks he's a
10x programmer yes yes magnitude more
yeah all right team yeah whose response
ters uh modulus actually I was I was
actually talking to Kent Dodd to and
getting some tips on finding some
sponsors so if you're interested I'm
putting together document about it but
modulus is a awesome awesome sponsor
they like never even hesitate they just
say like oh you're doing awesome content
yes we want to be involved so very cool
love those guys they never even bad and
I so if you're like that's cuz you put
you put out good stuff man if you're
well I you know they have some good
stuff too so absolutely if you're
hosting you should should give them a
try we're definitely like discussing the
ins and outs of that in the space dojo
slack chat room I think I don't know
they got some some potentially
interesting things up their sleeves soon
so maybe we can talk about that at some
point in the future mmm fun fun yes uh
and then yeah as always like patreon
pton com
/ media club you can join their keep
saying one of these days i'll change
that URL will see should be spaced ojo
now um yeah and then you can join the
slack chat room we had a couple people
join this week so that was awesome yeah
always a good time yes and we're gonna
have oh yeah i forgot the other one
we're gonna have our first-ever space
drunk i don't know maybe this is
terrible idea oh my gosh you're not
seeing that yeah totally where if you're
in the slag chat room and you haven't
heard about it yet we're gonna all get
drunk and today I'm next Thursday 10
am-10 p.m. next thursday eastern time
will be in slack maybe even a hangout
who knows i'll have a couple drinks but
i'm not gonna get wasted not wasted no I
just I felt superbad at Space Camp when
I got wasted mmm yeah yeah yeah the
missing a crater podcast show right that
never got posted big got posted oh did
it yeah it's just parts of it but it was
heavily edited cuz the sound quality was
so bad and that's how I know chat so
well yeah because of that conversation
cuz he sat in my lap yeah after that
show marilyn monroe style and that's
another reason why i'm not going to be
getting drunk yes gonna handed you a cup
in a thing a Barban and set go at it yes
yeah oh my gosh oh my gosh i'm glad i
still have a job this is this is like
this is a sign of how cool paul domin in
the ok bro team is the fact that you're
still employed after that night because
i still remember the one I don't
remember much of that show I remember
chat sitting in my lap and I remember
Paul down and staring at me while while
we're recording that and I was like oh
what's what's gonna happen it was fun it
was super fun it was cool it was super
cool like that oh dang you wearing it
man yeah sure my regular rotation
very cool all right well thanks for
tuning in guys will be back next week
I'll be will be here next week right
because you you've got your interviewing
tom and then we're going to interview
Richard Feldman I'm pretty sure so well
tom is actually being recorded on Monday
so right or another but yeah we're gonna
be doing Abby fills in for me when we do
they still Joe show yeah yeah which is
good which I definitely appreciate Abby
man what a great Abby I'd be someone to

your name now before someone else does
oh it's terrible no I real i live on
Twitter that that's where I'm at right
now yeah pretty much me too alright guys
