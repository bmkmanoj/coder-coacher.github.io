20 6 2016 welcome crater fans i'm your
host josh owens along with my plethora
of co-hosts we've got a bir with us he's
gonna be a guys how you doing coming
from you coming to you live from san
francisco we got Ben Strahan with us yes
totally so we just like showed up at the
front doors of mdg Abby and I we just
walked in and we just took a meeting
room yeah we're good I don't even say hi
to anyone yet no like we just totally
crashed this place so nice I love it I
love it and so then we also have the og
co-host rye Walker with us welcome Ryan
yo Cincinnati my show 100 assorted yeah
I went out I went out and did like a
hundred push-ups and then ran like a
hundred miles all in honor of this no
yeah I drank 100 beers way to go nice
nice that's how I usually do it like i
said 100 emails today oh he's grown or
you came over i earn miles i slept a
hundred minutes oh that's awesome velbon
auger on the plane on the plane yes
Stewart away nice so this this week is
gonna be a little bit different I
thought we'd get all the co-hosts
together you know we're missing denied
even think about Dean oops oh whoops
sorry Dean I don't know if he listens
anymore he's like often node land um
yeah and so I just I thought we'd all
get together and kind of talk about the
state of meteor this started a meteor
podcast and I think we've we've kind of
morphed and started covering more news
definitely a lot more news but um you
know I don't know I thought it would be
really kind of interesting to stop and
reflect where the media communities at
and where it's headed and
what that's gonna be like in the future
so yeah and then I want to hear about
the future of this podcast yeah now that
i beez on board i want i want to know
what you guys have been cooking what to
expect yeah I don't know if it'll be
much different Oh trust me it's gonna be
different nice yeah I you know maybe
that's maybe that's our first question
we got some questions on the the YouTube
channel like wit where's been going why
is he leaving what's going on oh don't
yes this is news for right yeah oh wait
thing about this yeah so doing all this
stuff with josh is amazing and being
part of the community and so I totally
like found what I wanted my career to be
which was a developer advocate where
evangelist I got all all those
checkboxes but I've never had the
opportunity like put all those skills
together into one so i'll be going to a
company called connect to io may
twentieth but may twentieth their
rebranding their company so it's kind of
top secret so I can't reveal yeah maker
that make fair maker faire on San
Francisco my first day on the job I'm
actually flying out to San Francisco I'm
my people back here I'll be back yeah
have you ever been to that been i havent
know it's a lot of fun I'm went one year
it's pretty awesome Oh maker make it
yeah makers dress yeah something like
that that's me cool first day yes yes
I'm totally murdering right now like
this is my job to know these things I'm
like yeah yeah that meeting later that
day a conference what do I read about it
it's like super exciting so I'm stoked
to do it and I'm stoked to slay kind of
step into the next season of my career
so super excited and very happy and to
be a part of this and everything that
Josh was doing and everything and I'm
handing it over to me good friends Bobby
yeah is there JavaScript there is there
meteor there so it's interesting so it's
like the maker community they they have
a couple boards that they made and
primarily they are a cell service so
like you can get a Wi-Fi board or
Bluetooth board to stay connected but
how can you like like connect to the
internet through like cellular without
having a phone so I got like a board and
they have a whole nice or a worldwide
network that they sell so they're really
just a cell provider and they but they
built the board on the side so it's
exciting for meteor there's there's
JavaScript but then I also be working
with all other languages they have
different SDKs everything so I'm pretty
stoked to like get all those different
experiences it's gonna be a completely
new community too hmm it's going to be a
community that doesn't cry on forum
posts and stuff right it's addressing
code no podcast have to be created
because of this you know this created a
joint I like dude like this there might
be something that walks by me we're
behind enemy lines yeah we are yeah I
love that we false fostered this culture
of like an emissions I'm shaking my head
right now rise like I don't want to be
part of this I mean it is actually kind
of cool that you guys ended up like we
delayed the the taping a couple days
just because you guys were gonna be at
MDG together so yeah cool pretend like
we met each other alien virgin so
actually you know that was another
question I had is like let's go around
and what's your favorite memory of the
like doing the podcast in some way and
I'll start and I'm gonna say I don't
know if we ever published it but Ryan I
did one in the car on the way to the
airport do you know that oh we like
bought but the gear it like at our
Center
yeah on the way yeah that's the airport
yeah well we bought it because we
thought we'd interview like mad or
someone at MDG but then they were too
busy and then we had to get a podcast
out so we like got all the show notes
together in like ordered an uber and set
up in the car and recorded in the car
that's awesome and I never ever let my
iphone in the car during that trip to
it's like yes in a number not a good
thing nice so what besides that what's
your favorite you talking me me me
because right all right um I'm trying
remember what our first one was do you
remember the furry first podcast where
we did that or anything it would have
been at centrifuges I would think yeah I
can't remember the first one but I
should go back and listen to that Brett
probably my favorite one cuz I like you
know I love the idea of starting
something and like nobody listened to it
and I can't remember in it but it's like
that important first step right or just
deciding to do something and and impress
it out terrible yeah it's kind of
horrible like yeah you should I make it
get a snippet of it may be playing this
uh I know you don't do anything but yeah
I make chris Christie would go find it
Chris and put a little intro or
something and how bad it was find a
worst moment from that podcast that's my
favorite moment nice nice that's awesome
what's your horse my favorite moment is
probably when I got really drunk its
base camp that's I think that's my
second maybe it was like it was like 10
minutes after meet Josh and then we had
to go on to film the show you guys were
way late like getting them a plan yeah I
don't care like all day to get there we
had a bunch like side things are we to
do but anyway uh yeah so like Carl Dan
eager from okay grow as was a give me
scotch for the first time ever in my
life and it just like hit me when I'm
sitting there and then before I know it
like I'm being loud and being obnoxious
I have checked
corcos sitting in my lap staring into my
eyes and then there's like from a like
right in front of me I finally made eye
contact with Paul dowman and he's like
really straight face and I'm like and I
sober up that Tiger like oh man that's
funny so what are you good what's your
favorite moment now I have so many five
so many theatres moments you know
because I've been on the show for like
four times we got actually know your
listener to you could say new fan my
favorite crater moment I've actually
listened to this show with every single
podcast like or every single host on the
show right now like when r I was doing
it consistently I watch every episode
and then band started doing in there for
some reason Dean start doing it for a
little bit there's a little switch off
and then just been for a long time and
then now I started doing my favorites
one or my favorite moment of the crater
podcast was when someone commented on
YouTube saying that then sucks and baby
took super offense to that so like the
next show that we did the band hobby
there's youtube show he called him out
which was I thought was great yeah
that's gonna be edited to you to see oh
yeah yeah the comment guy edited like
four times wouldn't like I don't know
what he was doing but he was like saying
I wish thing gets really sick so he can
shoot transmission anymore and all that
stuff but I'm like oh my gosh i still
remember it's like a kickstand been too
pessimistic you on everything Wow right
side of that is that they like me so
well it's cool really what her account
picture murderer calories youtube I
think it was a joke it was actually josh
red comes Josh always Josh's Josh's
other account just to like you you bend
the doors open then she go out get out
of here no no no but it was funny
because you did like troll the YouTube
community I think episode before
arable comments are terrible nobody
leaves good comments there and then like
the next episode like you're getting
nasty comments on YouTube this show has
grown a lot definitely like I think like
back when we were just covering like
meteor topics like it was hard to get in
a book like it was hard to stay
connected to the show every week because
not every week there was amazing meteor
topics coming so they used to be a
really like like nice hitting like good
shows and in some weeks were a little
off and then ever since we made it like
open to all the types of JavaScript
views like I will say like every week
has at least you know half the show is
super interesting and then sometimes
maybe like you know sometimes we cover
some small stuff like you know putting
stuff on like those like small tutorials
and stuff like that Redux tutorial stuff
yeah all those tutorials in my place
totally awesome by the way yeah that's
killing me so I think the show is like
groaning breath and like I think it's
going to get bigger in terms of like
what we talked about especially since
the we have a person who's going to go
into like makers community maybe we can
learn some things there and bring that
into the show he's gonna be trolling us
with all his like blog posts and stuff
on crater I'm just gonna make new
accounts and just roll him back so it's
gonna be okay so it was like a big redux
I remember that redox episode I remember
I was sitting in a and up in the window
seat of an airplane looking out
listening to that podcast that was a
good one Thanks what's this read us oh
no more more stuff much stuff to learn
yeah i think it's it's been interesting
like how much like even just this week
there's been a lot more react news I
think the meteor news on crater which
has been an interesting um you know
that that brings up an interesting
question like I've kind of shifted I was
forced to work on blaze this week and it
was terrible
end of last week it was really terrible
um and like it was it was actually blaze
performance problems like worse yeah um
but uh you know I got done with that and
I'm like yeah I told the client they
need to switch to react like how are you
guys feeling about react now like are
you guys kind of full-time in to react
or like I guess where's that at wellstar
like I'm interested i'll start with oh
yeah yeah so before before 1.2 my app or
our appt at work pop was 100% blaze like
it was a hundred percent blaze with a
lot of abstractions to get around blazes
like core issues right we like
throughout helper libraries that were so
specific to work pop that use certain
situations that we actually had more
technical debt when we decided to go to
react me we have so much more technical
debt because of all these abstractions
that we built you know and we build such
a tight-knit system that people need
those abstractions and we literally had
to burn them on fire and get rid of them
right so from there we decided to go to
react but we couldn't go a hundred
percent on day one so what we did is we
used the react template helper which
allows you to put react components in
place and we essentially started at the
smallest of components so like let's say
we're in a huge blaze template and we
went to the button we change the button
to react and then we change the
container into react and then we changed
the navbar and we went from the the
route up and that really helped us get
it to react I'll say right now my
hundred percent focus is in react some
of my teammates still have to use blaze
in our legacy products but I've been put
on the team of like how are we going to
push our front-end forward given react
in the tools and then people have to
maintain the old stuff sucks for them
great for me though and it's been a
hundred percent buyin by my company
because every time we have a bug with
blaze all legacy blaze we don't even
really think about how we're going to
solve the blade
problem because it will probably take
this less time to just write it and
react and have that faith that it's
going to be performant and we haven't
been wrong yet we haven't had like crazy
table renders and all that stuff that
usually sucks in blaze so on my side
it's been pretty great since 1.2 um yeah
no no complaint so I reacting like one
hundred percent buy-in for sure on my
team cool yeah yeah with me it's just I
I kind of like had projects that were
like a small team that were like left in
place so I had to like working that for
a while I built a huge mobile platform
that was like built-in meteoric which is
like a wonderful thing to maintain
luckily it made me a contributor to that
library so if anything so i right I kind
of like lived in blaze for a little too
long and kind of did side things with
reactive whatnot but made a shift about
three months ago I'd say all new
projects were one hundred percent react
it was like no question about it and I
think going forward now for this point
forward we're going to start using react
router is the default to like we've been
playing a flowrider reactor out or
whatnot but I think we're going to be
going more and more in in the react
world and especially with like Apollo
coming out and grab ql is just we wish
it now our attitude is like we buy in
early okay grow in like and we go all
that direction cuz it's like clear as
day now we're yeah if you buy an early
your content is the earliest content
which is kind of good and bad right I
guess yes okay grows like the
consultancy like they want to have mine
share a lot of things that working on
the Apollo is very new and like they
start blogging about that it could be
like the first first mover is right and
and a bit more maybe where people come
to you for like those prime yeah yeah
it's tricky right because you got to
feel like you're picking the right one
exactly I'm kind of curious though like
because like rise opinion as a CEO now
like what's your opinion on blaze vs
reactant yeah you're the guy spent money
right yeah we're all like react okay
great you're like the hours is that no I
put very I remember we were talking
about this couple months ago Josh our
murder was on the podcast if we were
just having lunch but where I was like I
don't know like you know but at the end
of course we're using react and you know
I used we used meteor 2013 you know we
were these crazy people that that will
be super early adopters that's why we
did all this in the first place so it
was never you know I mean I did have a
debate for a moment like Shh just
because if new yeah but like the other
thing we're doing inside of astronomers
we're using es7 you know so we made a
meeting in LA last week we were showing
off our code there's some smart dudes in
LA and and you know we should like
what's that like it's like a little
decorator thing going on es Evan and you
know he's like a Safety's off huh you
know so we have this is any company
that's just right on the freaking edge
of everything so of course really is
reactive of course we'll use Apollo will
use everything that's edge yeah you know
that work that just in our blood I
actually think from a start-up
standpoint it's so important to be that
way because it really helps was
recruiting you know like I can get
anybody any smart dev I tell hey here's
a react project like there's a high
chance they'll jump in or if I say ts7
you know so yeah I think that's a
totally all of our home our polish it
was a big bin was it was at the last
presentation that you gave out here
could have been calling it was cool he's
a good idea you know but yeah so you're
not always right but you know it's to me
it was it was closer to react and it was
too bleh so yeah absolutely I have a
question on that like so my company we
did the same thing we're we're a lot
younger and take the edge we take the
edge and that
that is a good advice for young company
let's say you get 30 engineers and 10 of
them don't care about edge you're like
I've been building Java services for 20
years why do I did this could be way
easier if I just did not use this new
technology yeah I think it's tricky like
if you hire CTO and that is older or you
know like why there's a start-up in town
and hired a Java dude after they have
been using some more cutting-edge stuff
if he started tearing everything down
and turning into java and they ended up
that didn't work out after a few years
and they got rid of them and now we're
back so i think it's tough like
leadership has to really support that so
from a CEO down like Greg's our CTO he's
right with me on this so we're super
alum you know it's really more yeah just
so I would say just fight at all like I
don't really want curmudgeons in our
company that say you know that the
latest stuff isn't the best stuff it's
just fun it's just fun to be on the edge
it's fun to be able to be you know have
that learning mode happening all the
time and I don't really think it's that
much riskier you know like you can
always roll back to the previous version
of meteor as you're upgrading it and
yeah I just worked with a lot of
companies where like we were on Rails to
their customers back in the day reals
too but rails was on rails for it's just
a really shitty world alivet you know
I'd say keep it keep it on the edge the
new normal my book yeah yeah I dunno
yeah good I was gonna say I definitely
think like being on the edge can be good
um and like I I tend to just throw
myself into it too like I uh recently I
guess back in February did an updated
class and we gave it on like an RC
version of 1.3 it wasn't even fully
baked I gave the class again in April
and like quite a bit how to actually
changed from februari to April even when
Marcie might not be what you want to use
you know yeah man I can't release tip
our seas for the most part yeah but I
wanted to force myself to get into react
and get into meteor 13 and use
words you know i think it's it's
definitely much improved as from like a
developer perspective opening a file
that's in a 1.3 syntax style for the
most part reads a lot better to me Gilda
way ya reads like how everybody else is
writing code for the last couple years
while we weren't right so it's nice to
see some familiarity in in the new
meteor code and then oh you know other
NPM modules is seems relatively the same
right so that's good yeah and of course
we were using coffeescript through this
whole thing too so you know I never knew
what normal code looked like I remember
showing in one of our one of the meteor
vanguard things some of the code i had
written for assistant I oh that i had
only has not had these nested things
going on because of like weird problems
i was having with Google's API and he
just was like what am I looking at is
just the most bizarre code I've ever
seen in my life you know is a good way
to start something good you know it's
funny like I feel that way I have a
client it's an older client and any time
I have to get in that project like it's
all on CoffeeScript and I had actually
already switched to JavaScript at that
point but designer that I and hired did
everything in CoffeeScript and I was
like yeah we'll just go with it like I
know it now that I like the in-house
team is starting to maintain and they're
like we don't know coffee scratch I feel
so terrible for that but yeah they're
gonna use some like converter and then
their code is gonna look really ugly
because they were like CoffeeScript to
JavaScript oh yeah yeah boom funny okay
what's the next question Josh I know
what are you doing you're you're
obviously react though yeah yeah one
hundred percent by in on reacts myself I
think it's it's definitely it's a huge
community right like Ben and I were
looking at the stats I think and the
download stats for like one day of react
router equals like all time downloads of
flow router ever ya know it with iron
Rock
cuz I hours number yes one day of
reactor outer is what gives Rick it was
like a year of iron rounder mmm maybe
that wasn't yeah it was a day of flow
router but it was already like way past
I around her too yeah it's just like it
was it was like and I think that's where
after that day I remember that being
like a turning point where I was like
okay we I kind of like pushed it where
everything needs to be like to react
stack if you have been many developers
by contributing and being part of that
community and like we're like one
one-hundredth of that it's a no-brainer
if we're able to integrate their library
then go for it yeah yeah does it happen
given to pushing the envelope and really
like tell them the community like hey
this is how you should handle state you
know it's out there tons of people are
using it so like why aren't you and then
given like practical examples too close
yeah I think the thing that has plagued
us as meteor developers is the fact that
we have we've been using systems that
were builds we were using systems that
were built like to me it sounds it seems
like they were built because they were
just for the fun of it you know like a
good way to little bit to describe this
is like two weeks ago I had to build a
drop-down component and on the weekend I
was just like chillin and I was like oh
yeah I can go to NPM or i can see
builders myself because I'm so smart and
I'm so great um so I built it myself
right every way I'll stop there but so
in the in the heavy is it miserable and
here this is a metaphor we're going to
go to do so I'm so great I'm so smart
and I'm going to build this drop-down
component and I launched it on Tuesday
for a release day and it doesn't work on
mobile I think about then well I think
about mobile you know like yeah so what
I do I said like oh you know well fix it
in two weeks you know time to fix it
today mmm except fix it when I when I
want and my coworker was like oh I can
fix it for you have a PR I was like nah
man I gotta I gotta do it I gotta fix
this drop-down component myself I don't
want your PR I'm sorry
oh okay yeah anyone so back to this week
I think you should have like a film crew
inside work box offices I wanna like I
want to see this reality show this is
this is an mdg parable right here isn't
it exactly yeah what I was describing
over his energy favorable and like
that's what that's the world we lived in
before 1.3 your live we were living with
technology that was not considered like
from the other sources right I'm gonna
love this show from well you know Kate
here's the thing I'll say about that
like maybe from the outside it might
look like not invented here syndrome or
ivory tower syndrome or something along
those lines but i will say you have to
look back and think like when i started
with 06 um medium that was like back in
2013 like there weren't mpm libraries
that were loaded into the browser back
then you know flake no I mean they were
inventing a lot of infrastructure that
didn't exist and now like that
infrastructure exists sadly lake maybe
maybe the downside is that they didn't
do a good job of figuring out how to
share it and like make it community
standards so now we're instead adopting
other community standards but I think it
takes a lot of time and effort to really
put that stuff out there and get it
adopted in the first place you know yeah
I think that was a big thing and now
like something betters coming along and
so they're shifting so I think it's just
all part of growing up yeah it's a
growing pains but yeah yeah I'd also say
they tested they tested like hey maybe
blaze should be standalone they take you
know but wasn't that you dry it wasn't a
huge test but it wasn't a big success so
yeah that's the thing like it wasn't
blaze wasn't ready to stand alone wow
you know and i'll say like I'll ding
them on this one right because they did
try to launch blaze a standalone thing
but I think they did a really poor job
and I talked about this blog post I
wrote about like why mdg needs Facebook
and react and you like you can go see
like there's just tumble
google group that they created yeah
where they wanted to like support blaze
and they really didn't like have anyone
show up there to support it and they
didn't really leave you look that repos
like not updated and a long time like
it's just I think a lot of people had a
lot of questions that went unanswered
and once that happens like you know all
right the the biggest thing to me
that'll kill a project is bad
documentation yeah and i think that's
that's kind of what happened when they
try to spin blaze out on its own yeah
yeah you know i just say like a failed
experiment in the startup business
success you know though the tribute then
they had this hunch maybe they didn't
really feel the pool they wanted now
again it'd be nice if you clean up your
mess after that but cleaning up your
mess takes more time as is just to leave
it there and you know we've got a ton of
messes astronomer that we've left on the
internet I wish we had time to clean
them all off but you know you just even
in the differential github repo we still
have some messes left over there I'm
sure you know Josh yes reposing need to
be gone but it's just work so yeah I
just thought you know I it just like I
to me react just came in like a freight
train from the side and just smashed
that and it's good I mean it's good it's
good that we have a like a cross
technology I mean I think like the
dotnet people are using it and the rails
people are using it so it's great
because it's standardizing that front
end yeah i think it's it's interesting
to lake once places like Netflix and
facebook get behind it it feels much
bigger too so mm-hmm in other people's
minds anyway like that's good for an
option for sure so i'm curious now that
we talked a little bit about the past of
mdg and meet here what do you guys think
about the future now that we kind of
know what's coming because
oh wow right eye first yeah that's a big
sigh no I want to say I'll get I want to
give props to MTG like there's like
probably out five companies that are
pretty influential and how we approach
astronomer and one of them is meteor MTG
you know I just love the approach of how
they launched the the complete openness
I love that they launched it without the
user packages back in the day which you
know a lot of flack from that but they
also got a lot of feedback yeah I think
we want a lot for us to learn from from
mdg and how they've know they try to do
Galaxy once and it kind of petered out
you know so galaxy was actually galaxy
two so if you think about that the
sequencing could have been different you
know again welcome to the world of
startups um and I think I think that
it's the Apollo stuff seems really smart
and good I don't really like figured out
exactly what that means I haven't played
with it yet because it's uh you know
just not ready for me yet but i think
that uh i have a lot of I mean it's the
growing up obviously they're dealing
with bigger companies and I know that
there's a lot of if I mean I just go
back to like how we're doing it like
I've had so many different versions of
our pricing page I've confused so many
people on how to do price you know like
what's the stronger to free is it but
like yeah you know whatever it's
everything I have a lot of compassion
for what they had done because I'm
basically trying to do the same thing
and I'm doing it worse you know to be
honest but again they have a lot more
money than me so they say it's it's hard
it's hard to do things all straight A's
when you're when you're working with
limited resources stirrups are hard a
lot of things to juggle yep yeah so
that's my take iPad I just think
whatever they do is going to be great
that's my attitude on it it's like
they're doing the best they can they've
done pretty good so far that's good
attitude for sure counterpoint later I
was like there's definitely like dust
bunnies on the floor and all that stops
like like it's not perfect
but well you know we were also building
abstinent nano a man and with us being
as astute as we are and we still pick it
as our platform like that's pretty darn
awesome this for me is like meteor is
evolved that than just like application
development framework when I first used
meteor and blaze it seemed like I was
there was no concept of the meteor way
and I've ever having to tell people
that's not the meteor way you know and I
realized the meteor ways it's a myth you
know it's just how did the way the
meteor way is on any is not anything
it's just how do you build really
performant efficient reactive
applications and that's not the meteor
way that's just the way and how sweetie
you're helping us now right well since
1.3 in the future like I think meteor is
just the best cure for JavaScript
fatigue if you look at javascript today
you have to know so many different
toolings get no babble if the no yes not
sorry that already covers it there's no
web pack or a browser five you have to
pick a front-end framework you have to
pick a back-end express or khoa or
whatever you like you know and then you
have to do some type of DevOps right to
put out digital ocean this is so much
fatigue and especially like for someone
who is just getting into this or it's
kind of like a mid-level where they
probably to just have their own app they
need to know people or pay a lot of
money to accomplish this I think meteor
is the perfect cure for JavaScript
fatigue because it ships a build tool
though is pretty slow that's the
negative though slow it will handle
whatever you wanted to get out of grunt
it'll handle the web pack situation for
you the babble situation you can ship
your code to galaxy so the hosting
situation is covered you got first class
support for a you know react blaze and
angular you have the whole package there
and you I don't see anybody in the
meteor community getting fatigued by
anything though
react developers were complaining about
two months ago because with us you hit
you say mpms all react and then you type
meteor and everything is done you can
start building something right away yeah
I mean I would agree with that like I i
did a code review for a client the other
day and there on meteor 12 and they used
an MPN version react and they had like a
custom browser if I set up and all that
kind of stuff and it was actually a
little more painful than I wanted it to
be and I thought I'd you know told the
customer that they should probably
switch to 13 and use the the stuff
that's in meteor now because it works a
lot better mom I'm a little bit sad like
they I know that we were all like tired
and frustrated we wanted to see 13 ship
but at the same time like I feel like 13
wasn't quite ready when they shipped it
there were some pieces missing which
they've been adding yeah with with
smaller releases which has also been
interesting um had a little bit of
sintra resting cuz like i can't imagine
1.3 being any bigger like it that was
that was a big it was but i mean like
you're you're in this weird hybrid state
of waiting on meteor itself to be on NPM
like there's no good way for me to
create an NPM package in meteor or on
NPM that like requires pieces of meteor
yeah like there's some hacks you can do
that make it work but um and we'll get
there I think we'll get there and that
to me that'll be the the huge piece
right because once all those little
packages are on there right if we think
about like for me I think about what
rails look like and people could go out
and build a Sinatra app and still pull
an active record I think that's going to
become really really interesting when we
can draw in even more developers to work
on parts of meteor and and they're not
necessarily using the whole thing you
know that to me that'll that'll bring a
lot of growth so say I wonderful part of
the challenges like I remember again I'm
gonna go back to my rails days and ehh
was there and he was like so opinionated
and he
help drive like I feel like one of the
things would be really helpful in meteor
13 14 whatever going forward our
deprecation against the way you know I
just really rich deprecation like just
like tell me like if I'm using
iron-router just say you should be using
a router you know it's a fact right if
you can you could ignore that somehow
fine but I mean pick so he you know dth
always did a really good job of like
saying you know f this F that choosing
telling us what to do and is does that
person exists at MDG to the extent it
needs to I mean there's definitely a few
guys that are somewhat opinionated but
just not quite as strong of a leader you
know yeah I would tend to agree with
that because like we haven't seen any
deprecation like 13 shipped and like we
now have to shove everything into the
imports folder there's no way for us to
get rid of eager loading and move to a
full import set up so like that to me is
like we should have at least a
deprecation to say like oh hey I mean
maybe it's harder to write because we're
relying on Global's but I bet there's a
way to detect that your line our global
not importing what you need yeah well I
mean it's an interesting standpoint so
like rails was open source and they
didn't have a business based on rails
you know rails was and how shoot of a
business and so meteor is a different a
business plan all together where they're
building something and that's what their
job is and now they're going to have a
business off of that so I think the
problem is that type work businesses are
too far misaligned like building a
DevOps company to do hosting is too far
away from building a framework like
meteor in my opinion I think it's closer
than base camp was the base camp was a
work management thing and you had this
web framework and here you have a web
hosting company with a framework there
just seemed to me like they should be
more compatible maybe they're too close
you know yeah I'm well I feel like you
know like the 37signals guys could if
you looked at top three contributors all
worked at at
37signals you know and so they would
they would do some work and then like
extract that idea out to rails whereas I
think like a lot of the work that's
happening is happening in doc docker ec2
or like it's not happening necessarily
like there's a very little piece of um
galaxy that's built a meteor and that's
it yeah but I'm an addition they can
definitely some external people on the
meteor core team for the open source
project that's just like a let me a
no-brainer if like they haven't done it
yet right that's still the case it's
still it's on the room yeah well that
one seems like an easy one to get off
your roadmap so I don't know yeah it's
the other thing that happened to like
you know again I know from the VC
standpoint like they stick started
launching this stuff like it series be
and that's when you get these really
serious business vc's involved and
revenue revenue is important and getting
along with going after big markets are
important so again I kind of wish like
the Galaxy will launch back in earlier
days because they probably what it would
have been structured differently I think
they could it change lots of things
maybe the whole blaze you know react
thing could have been a different story
too but you know again like startups you
just deal with what happens and yeah I
think that you know again 13 was a bit
of a sort of reaction to react train
slamming the side of them and I think
it's I know it seems like it was slow
motion response from the inside of the
meteor community / from the outside I
think they really did a good job of
dealing with that that sideswipe you
know yeah if you are a brand new
developer coming in for I would say no
like you're you're the same developer
that you are but you didn't use meteor
in the past you have a new project
coming you're in you're interested in
meteor you're also interested in other
things as well what would you would you
check me to your out you know or is all
this drama that we're talking about too
much yeah I mean for me I would just say
like and I'm be honest like as soon as
things get complicated i'm looking for
the next framework that's simple again
you know and i think that's you know you
guys have had some conversations on the
podcast
on that and you know I think that
certainly meteors at risk for something
simpler to pop through this opinionated
again and small and you could write just
one big long document you could read it
like be excited to start working on it I
don't know if that's the current state
of meteor seems like there's some
complication there you know yeah i think
i would like definitely pick me dear
again so i'm interested as new job them
going to that might be experiencing more
languages and more frameworks or whatnot
and I have this hypothesis that meteor
is still going to stay my preferred
stack and if that comes true then I
would have to say like you know maybe
the maybe the pass was painful or
whatnot but if I'm still recommending
meteor to people in the future then I
think mdg did their job did they do it
perfectly no but no one does anything
perfect especially when they're creating
something brand new ah you know I'm like
I think they're good they got they got
staying power they got a lot of good
stuff i'm excited for them i'm kind of
sad a little bit that i'll not going to
be so much involved in the new year
world and that says something right
there yeah that like I'm gonna miss it
cuz it's like awesomeness yeah I I think
any sizable community comes with drama
right like there's I think there's even
a ruby or rails drama Twitter account
that like tracks like day since last
drama do it now you're like minded
Wow Green stole our idea that guy
totally trolled us today they laid on
his horn the entire time uh yeah no I
think um you know any time that you have
people that are passionate about the
technology like the thing that I I do
admire about media right now is that a
lot of the the drama does center around
like development or technical choices or
you know there's not as much around like
these people are being terrible or
somehow hurting our community like we
haven't had a whole lot of that which I
think really really great become a
couple conferences we really haven't had
too many problems come out of those so
like I'm very very happy with that um
personally I think the mediator
community's been great in that way um I
don't know I'm kind of curious to hear
Abby's answer to this question because
you've played with feathers now too yeah
i play with feathers and let's just okay
let's be straight up then before 1.3
before 1.3 i would recommend meteor to
junior people people who want to get
into it they want to learn web
development sure I think 1.3 and beyond
I would not recommend to a new person
problem and I wouldn't recommend
feathers to a new person either nor
because these are for professional
developers I think these frameworks are
going to become for really for
professional enterprise customers or
people like us who are living wage to
face on doing this stuff every day and I
don't think it's going to be good for
people who just want to work on a
saturday afternoon at a coffee shop for
an hour and you know contrary to what r
i said i don't think it's going to be
one of those things where you read one
document and you're ready to go because
i think it has a professional developer
there's just so many facets that you
need to know and i think a framework
that can help you plug and play all
those things requires a little bit of
experience yeah what's the triptych is
like originally as i read some of like
meteors early pitch decks for example
yeah postlets but they didn't give it to
me but I got from some other source and
they were targeting like junior
intermediate developers with this
framework was awesome like and I
realized like that's why I was so easy
to learn in the beginning because I
think literally they were aiming at the
junior level and I remembered i did a
little talk about how this is the new
PHP because it's like jeezy to PHP but
it's not as hideous PHP right you know
in a lot of ways but yeah I agree like
it's now become a pro tool and I'm gonna
always default to I can work in a tool
is designed for amateurs it means it's
easier you know and if it can get job
done and meteor did it built the right
apps and it felt like it was easy to use
and so I'm you know I'm always seeking
that maybe maybe meteor can get back to
that after this you know the blaze
reacting calms down but like when I look
at Apollo like I know thing I loved
about meteor was was it just it was just
Mongo and that was it you know now
that's gonna go away you know and that's
that to me is like it's a sad thing from
a simplicity standpoint for the front it
has to be done from a professional tools
damn why you know right yeah now as your
team gets more mature they want more
control on every piece of the pie they
want control of everything and meteor
months ago do not have that control even
with the with the new build plugin stuff
that came out in 1.2 that's more control
and it's still in a meteor way but
you're not written the couple double
audience for my company so like little
steps like that helped me realize that
this is going to be a professional tool
I don't know if like we already see
beginners are really confused with the
1.3 tutorial they don't know how to
import export stuff you know like like
about collection declarations like I get
a bunch of questions it just then my
question becomes is that because the
media a 1.3 guide is such a far
departure from how other places other
tutorials are telling people how to
build stuff to give it go get discover
meteor like I literally ran across a
post the other day and read it
guys like I want discover media but for
meteor 13 and it's like that doesn't
exist at all and there's no like you
know nothing else asha something what
does it exist you know what I Sasha a
shunt on their their tone in the way
they are approaching the content is
different than the meteor guide enjoy
the meteor guide has like some
assumption that you already look you
already banged your head on the keyboard
for hours before you came here to help
you know but when Sasha so i should like
as soon as you know nothing doesn't care
if you know anything and we'll still do
the same like Sasha tone or it's like
really professional really like positive
and kind of fun you know and he's a
great designer so it's really easy on
the eyes wait and also like that was
that was his life so like when meteor
came along like he was moving from front
end and then meteor came along he's like
wow look what's available to me and then
he became a full set to be able to
develop her through meteor so he was
actually like discover meteor was like
his story yeah pretty much and then Tom
came in to help him because there's so
many rough edges uh I think the same
thing with with rails again I'm going
back to that like there was this agile
web devel mizzou be on rails book I
remember are so awesome and I read that
thing ten times but now it's the rails
guide and if you go to the rails guy
that's just big and you know again if
I'm learning from scratch I never
talking but rails open source though
like I know where there's more
experienced ones if we got an issue with
meteor guide we should like you can do
it yeah it's also way we are um we're
trolling them saying like on the past
you guys controlled everything why don't
you give up more stuff and now they're
giving up more stuff as we're like oh
this guy that you put out is bad you
gotta do it yeah it's like I would I
don't know like maybe that does fall on
us on some level but at the same time
like they didn't actually give up as
much control as you think like I tried
to do a debugging guide and they gave me
some commitments but at the end of the
day like I realized I was really just
copying a blog post over from my blog to
their guide so I don't know like but
that's the only thing I really let
anyone work on I agree with Josh like
and everyone here has provided some kind
of content to the meteor community that
doesn't need to be in the guide because
all of us have our own voice they have
our own opinions and people listen to us
because of that right if are all of our
opinions is went to the guys no one
would know the originality that we bring
to the table for the type of content
that we write know and like I think I
don't want any of my stuff in the guide
because that's like ah be content like
do you want to learn how if you want to
learn meteor the way that I would like
to teach it to you and I think the guide
is more like this is a very general way
of understanding it and maybe that
doesn't help beginners maybe that's
what's maybe maybe beginners either
discover meteor like God and some people
just need like some like table reference
but they can just like pull it out okay
cool actually the topics if there was
going to be a you know welcome to meteor
book right now it's just it's a thicker
book you know it's just harder so yeah
great with then I would have but I do
think so too like answer the original
question then asked and started all this
one um I would still probably recommend
meteor like my hesitation with feathers
is like what um bobby was talking about
right like I need to go figure out web
pack and I need to go figure out like
how to make sure my build tools running
the right way and all that kind of stuff
and think that gives me pause like I
realized at the end of the day it might
only be a weekend of work but I'm not
sure I want to spend that weekend up
front like getting all that ready and
getting it done correctly and you know
it's it is the JavaScript fatigue
problem like there's too many choices
like do I punt on web pack and go with
steel Jess or something like that like I
don't know but
meteor you know I I deal with the slower
build times and just you know it works
it doesn't whip pack joke it's like the
web pack joke is like Oh gonna start a
new project today spend 12 hours on web
pack yeah I'm not gonna do the project
anymore I got preprocessors working
though not the face of benefits do yeah
to be clear I would I actually
recommended meteor to a new person today
so that you know absolutely but I am I I
do have my eyes open for for what's next
maybe you know someone can figure out
you know the Sinatra of of meteor like I
I might be interested in that yeah yeah
I don't know i still think like for all
the the rallying i do against having
eager loading still in there and having
to use an import folder I think that's
still like an eye on the new user and
deciding like they can still do things
the old way and write code that still
functions in a way that's easy but they
don't have to go grok like es6 syntax
necessarily yeah so yeah if meteor was
not in 1.3 and knowing what i know now i
would not recommend it to a beginner
because let me tell you this is live
because if you're a junior person your
job is to get the next job right your
job is to get the next position that you
really want if you're working at some
like stupid agency um just kidding I'm
not working there anymore no I'm just
getting OH don't hate me maybe you're
working at some really crappy job and
you're using meteor and like right off
the bat like your standards of like how
people code is completely different than
maybe the next job you're gonna get
right and I think like if you're trying
to if you're a junior person you're
trying to get to the next level you kind
of have to go with what the industry is
doing using tools all that stuff like if
you're still writing code with Global's
you go to your like
your your interview and someone asks you
like oh yeah what kind of module systems
you guys use or how did you guys you
know pack up all your stuff the junior
person is going to be like oh don't you
mean just putting a global variable
equals an object and putting everything
on that and exporting it from a package
JSL that doesn't exist anywhere else but
here like these are the things that I
would be hesitant to tell a junior
person to go fall in love with and for
1.3 you don't have to do that you would
just do it normally so your argument was
that song confused so you're saying
you're saying you wouldn't recommend one
point sir before you said 1.3 or before
or 1.2 and lower you recommend to yeah
no leg but now one confer beginning for
beginning I'm talking about from what I
just said right now it's cut yeah of
course so confused i would say meteors
perfect yeah i use it because 1.3 is
still the 1.2 and so a beginner would be
able to jump in with blaze yeah with
Global's don't have to deal with modules
anything in fact can be ridicule that
discovered meteor still works with with
1.3 yeah yeah absolutely there you go so
there is for beginners okay now the
question of saying is meteor too
complicated too thick or whatnot now
what I be said before is like it's not
so much meteor that's thicker it's
JavaScript that is thicker and you gotta
know this stuff anyway to get a job so
do it and it's not like don't blame the
fatigue on meteor technique meteors
going to provide an environment to fly
more friendly for you to learn so that's
true I you know it's like the mix and I
saw those things really were relevant
start recommending in hobby yeah all
right and now I'm dropping the mic so
I'm if I'm a junior you two guys I don't
know I kind of hang though it's just
like I class will begin a different
junior developer for some reason for me
beginner was when I was a beginner I
didn't have a programming job I wasn't
online on reddit and hacker news like
typing something to my terminal in my
eye was a beginner when I was a junior
developer I realized my career this was
I wanted my career
I would be the best did I remember those
two feelings yes I got different
standpoints totally looking at those
different satellites and giving the
meteor to both of them in the current
condition a little different for each is
a little different and I think it would
be up to the person that's recommending
it to frame it in the way of knowing who
you're talking exactly whether it's cool
that meteor cancer fossil bone and in a
very different way yeah that's cool that
is quick I would just say junior dev
fees were using meteor now then you're
going to interview just say I I've been
working on react and that's all you
gotta say yeah don't you mean you're
just talk about react in your living
room in AB really reactive as get paid
like 10x the rest of the industry I
don't know you know they do 10 x but
they are at the top of the the front-end
framework average income there before I
got my job the new job that move into
there was a large company like a large
international very popular company that
was going to move everything over the
meteor and their headquarters in Chicago
their developer Tunes headquarter the
the salary was insane it was just insane
and I was all meteor so I checked me
here is salary is like above react no no
no no I would disagree oh yes and then
knowing josh is hourly rate that's well
I would say it's much higher work at
that night that's the problem funny
funny guy shouldn't pull your age Josh
shouldn't he said he had worked for me I
told him weaseled anatomy yeah no
actually you know I had a conversation
about the raid today and they're like oh
my god and I was like not that I like
pretty upset that my level is probably
gonna be charging around that and they
were pretty booked up so you know yeah
ya like like like it's kind of we all
talk who's in who's in the community we
know everyone's hourly rate and whatnot
and then we also hire contract meteor
developers to
okay grow and there are these boxes for
beginner mid and then senior and
everyone like pretty much falls in the
box and and like Josh your rate is very
competitive in the back of you falling
like without a doubt there's other
developers awful we've hired two and
they're in the same price range yeah
yeah if someone came to me you know it's
funny like I had this conversation today
about my rate and they're like well like
what would a good senior person be and i
was like i wouldn't pay senior person
under eighty dollars an hour like I
would question what they were doing if
they give you a rate low in that or how
much experience they actually have most
definitely that is not a senior guy as a
contractor no maybe like a side gig for
see you yet thank you if you get him on
a good good day you know yeah all right
well I think we're at the end of our our
ear this little one if we should have
gone for a hundred minutes maybe no yeah
well good it has been a real pleasure to
do 100 shows with all of you gentlemen
and I thank you for that so yes 100 more
oh yes oh thank you gosh platform it's
been great yes and your friendship and
your guidance it has been I mean you
know what I'm gonna I'm gonna put myself
under the gun too I I hope maybe
tomorrow or sometime this week I'm gonna
announce crater mobile cough as well
which is gonna be July thirteenth to the
15th and I've got some good speakers
lined up a lot of react native stuff
going on a little bit of Cordova stuff
so it's gonna be super interesting some
meteor stuff as well you have a mobile
talk if you want some yeah a valuable
food and Abby is a very entertaining
talker so he told it every last one you
should have like a round table with like
export cordova person expert react
native and have them go at it and as
well so
James I think you guys are gonna meet
him later well you got you guys met him
at a been met him at Space Camp James
backs Lee he works at the news rich i
thinkin yeah contribute on Apollo with
that yeah yeah but he's gonna give a
talk on going from Cordova to react
native and like using meteor as the back
end so little more interesting legis
more good yeah cool right thanks guys
all right to s beach yeah by this video
has been in space dojo production you

out more about us at space dojo com or
