seventeenth 2015 local meteor fans i'm
your host josh owens along with my
co-host roy wang rui walker yeah and as
you can see if you're watching this on
youtube we have a special guest co-host
with us doing it at cliff yeah nice so
you've been on the show before Dean but
for maybe new listeners where are you
from from Chicago I work at a company
called opinion lab where we're doing
some interesting things with meteor and
node and looking to hire as well and
also I'm a co-organizer of the chicago
meteor meet up nice yeah yeah Gerard
from differential was just up there
right yeah yeah he we had a very good
night despite the fact that there were
tornadoes and severe weather threatening
the area people were like he's not done
yet there's another package that
integrates reacted meteor he's trying to
tell us about so he's a great thorough
and people enjoyed him a lot so Gerard
love to love to see you there nice
that's awesome alright uh so this week
we will be talking about this package
kitchen thing I don't know maybe you
know a thing or two about that Dean ya a
story night and blaze components I
figured since we have three people
conversations might run a little longer
so we're just gonna do three stories
this weekend but short then sorry for
you listener donor us right haha yeah
alright so once you kick us off with the
talking about package kitchen team yeah
alright great so package kitchen package
kitchen meteor calm was a site that I
whipped up because I believe that we
needed to have the bar set as low as
possible as far as the amount of work
needed to take an idea and bundle it up
as
a package for the community to consume
would be great but also I have you know
you can use packages locally which was
kind of a intended use case of this is
that you could download you type in the
basic details of your package and then
you can download a kind of template set
of files as a zip and just drop it into
your local packard packages directory so
I was something I was obsessing about
over the weekend and when Monday hit I
said I just have to like do this and and
it's you know been picked up on crater
got voted up and so's got the highest
traffic of any of my shares in a long
time so yeah nice nice so why do people
like making packages do you think or is
this this seems to have filled some kind
of need what do you think no is best
practice about packages and how do you
approach when you write a package and
when you create another file and the
client directory or directories yeah I
guess to me like package creation is
there because you either one need to
separate some functionality right so
today I was having a conversation with a
guy and a lot of people were like well I
want to build one app and I want to have
Cordova in there and I want to have you
know web in there and how do I control
you know what the Cordova app looks like
so you either have to look at going with
something like polymer if you want to
deliver kind of the same experience on
both or you can look at something like
bootstrap on the web and ionic on the
you know the phone platform and so
package is really the easiest way to do
that because you can say you know you
can push all your design files into a
package and only loaded and web for the
web platform and only load it in Cordova
for your Cordova platforms so to me like
that's interesting and then the other
thing is just what code that you reuse
you know that that stuff is it's it's
better put in a package for me so like
accounts entry is probably a great
example yeah which
I keep saying is deprecated and you
should use user accounts now but it uh
you know that was a thing like r I
actually wrote the first iteration of it
in an application and then I needed to
write something so I just extracted his
work from his app and started packaging
it up and testing it and making sure it
worked the way we wanted and then the
designer jumped in and he's like well I
want these options here and so then it
became like a full-fledged thing at that
point and all of a sudden it was in like
five applications instead of one so and
what was your approach to configuring a
package I don't recall exactly for the
accounts entry or user accounts package
how does it do do its configuration uh I
think a lot of that stuff is usually
handled via like a config file or like a
just a JavaScript config block that you
put in somewhere that's right it's right
you call it and you pass eight a config
object yeah brings it though yeah but I
think that's like that's how we did it
early on till I guess either we
discovered me to your settings or meteor
settings out added I don't know who was
always there and I didn't know about it
but now I was doing it I just put all
that meteor settings I believe actually
Dean has some thoughts on meteor
settings from packages don't change yeah
well you have a good memory there Josh
but I I had noticed as a few people have
I've seen in the forums one of the
gripes that I find some people say when
they come to me here is even when you
have packages there's a lot of global
namespace stuff going on I've heard that
complaint levied against session
variables too can you know session get
you know like just anybody you know
getting set and with respect to meteor
settings and packages yes like a package
can read meteor settings which I thought
would be one way to configure it is to
give it access to me to your settings
which it has already but then that's
when I discovered that meteor settings
is rewrite
at runtime and I was a package from a
package for anywhere in the app and I
thought you know hmm I was already a
little wigged out about the read because
there's passwords and things that we put
in meteor settings and and then the
right I just thought oh well that's
that's not the intended use case anyway
it doesn't write back to the file why
would you allow a right on the thing so
i I just I raised it on I think stack
overflow this forms hadn't been created
yet and I got some good you know
counterpoint to that which is that it's
no more global than a lot of other
things in meteor it's just a tightly
sandboxed as a platform that's just not
its approach and and also that there's
if you're if I was really concerned I
could use encryption things because
packages control load order and they
load before your app your app could have
a decryption key in it and then you know
package at runtime could you know your
package would be the only one who could
you know get the decryption key yeah but
I mean that doesn't feel like an awesome
solution either so I don't know I mean
to me I'd almost rather like it why not
just give setting or packages access to
like a meteor settings namespace that
they can read and write and set you know
they specify I mean we already have like
if you want to export something into the
global namespace you you have to do that
specifically by saying API dot export so
I think you should have to say like API
dot settings or something and yeah that
would make a lot of sense kind of like
public is it was a reserved keyword kind
of thing yeah yeah well now we've set it
on the podcast someone out there should
make it true I guess so so tell me real
quick like on meteoric settings maybe
amidst understand this but the whole
meteor settings files isn't exposed to
the client right it is not only under
only this stuff under public is exposed
to the client right yeah but as a
package writer i can i can say i can add
a file into the server environment that
would read your meteor settings and
I you know I could be malicious right
now and go out and update accounts entry
and add in a thing that looks for like
common keys like s3 keys and you know
stripe keys private keys and all that
kind of stuff and just like you know I
mean it's not that hard to do if you
look at telescopes Sasha's actually got
a sneaky little thing in there where
he's phoning home so anytime you install
telescope it like sends a little DDP
method to him saying hey you know
someone's got a telescope install
running clever here's the URL and so he
always knows about the new telescope
sites going up but I mean you know I I
could write the same thing right you
know done so you know caveat emptor cya
when adopting a package there's there's
a reason they're open source yeah yeah
well yeah and I would just argue that I
guess the question is from the package I
guess you couldn't get it at a configure
objects that you do in it in it inside
the unit like process is that the theory
is that meteor settings has is readable
by the package whereas if I say like
meteors you know like feminine and
knitting this my account century the
package wouldn't have access to that
object yeah you'd be explicitly passing
some information in yeah yeah so that's
why I just didn't know like if you're
inside a package do you have access to
what's we're running in the media your
app whatever has loaded before you you
do yeah okay alright so yeah so kick it
could include the so called strike
secret key put in a in a different
object that so yeah I don't I just think
that um yeah well we don't have to go to
yeah I'm that's that's interesting
attack vector to write like I could
totally rather than stealing your key I
can just put my key in instead you can
NAS its rewrite that's awesome yeah and
you can give me all your credit card
charges and I'll handle them for you
that's cool we're just like one out of
ten maybe you know just little round
robin action
a style if last name match Owens okay
okay so here's here's what I think the
big takeaway is is read the code for any
package that you install because it
could have something malicious like that
special josh or being are involved nice
we just think about it we don't
implement it uh no but i like i like
package kitchen because i think the
thing most people don't understand is
really a package is just just a meteor
app right like a little self-contained
bunch of meteor files and the big thing
is the package KS which I don't think
stuff is greatly documented anywhere so
yeah the documentation came along but
it's it's unusual in that it's a it's an
executable it's a DSL it's not a JSON
configuration file so you know so it's
just a little bit different and and
basically the the meteor the package
kitchen it uses reactivity to derive
your source tree from the you know
handful of variables that you input so
it's all it's in fact it's all
client-side all your things are
reflected and run through a utility that
I made a package called a worksheet but
basically just a chain of reactive
dependencies that result in the source
files being built and then a client-side
j/s dipper and and downloader so it
basically once your package is ready and
you click download zip it adds all the
files that you're seeing on the right
into a zip file and then basically
base64 encode zit and sets the browser's
URL it's like a data URI and the browser
that causes the browser to say oh you're
downloading is it so it's entirely
client-side that was an interesting
adventure learning along the way nice oh
right jump to the next topic yeah next
topic is starry night
cute little site like the painting the
background the starry night is a new
media testing framework management tool
that kind of takes a different approach
from the current velocity system
inspired by some other things author of
this is Abigail Watson who obviously uh
well just starry night is related to
Night Watch which was the packet with
the testing framework she had built out
prior to the velocity introduction and
looks looks pretty interesting I have
not tried it yet when did this launch
Josh you know when this hit was less it
was last week I think maybe yeah so yeah
I haven't haven't had a chance to test
it out but um the ideas you know it
includes acceptance tests and it kind of
is leveraging tiny text as uh as the
testing framework which obviously you
know mdg uses and it's happy with so no
no it's an interesting like enough I
think it's important that we have to
continue to have experiments and all the
aspects of meteor right like we can't if
the framework isn't ready to be locked
down just yet on in all ways and so I'm
really excited to check this out and see
what's going on whether you guys tried
it out or I haven't I mean honestly I'm
more of a cucumber guy myself having
come from rails land and the land of
cucumber and I guess jasmine I mean I
still haven't done a ton of jasmine
testing just enough to be dangerous you
know the interesting thing to me is that
this is actually like a it's a full-on
command line tool like it's not just
testing if you look at it she's got like
a rename utility a finer replace or
refactor utility so I mean it's kind of
interesting because it is it's like a
testing thing
but then like through everything else in
with it you know so yeah yeah oh I and I
remember like back when we were getting
start on velocity like Night Watch just
had a different she's had a different
view like she won't do the testing from
well sir it right right Night Watch is
different Night Watch is actually built
by other people so she wanted to build a
safety harness early on was the one she
was working on Oh shaky on her ok I
think you are my bad yeah and I'm so
sleepy huh yeah i think that one yeah it
was definitely like you know i'm almost
trying different approaches like how do
you hook into the system under test you
know and how do you like get your your
testing code in there and make sure that
everything is the way you want it to be
right because you got to deal with
fixtures and all these different kinds
of things and I remember like you and I
were sitting in the office with Abigail
and she was like explaining the
difference between leica and some of the
other options and I don't know it was
interesting but then you're right like
velocity came along and everyone kind of
like agreed to head in one direction and
try to figure out how to make that an
awesome thing and I think what I was
just gonna say like you know and then
got the official mdg buy-in and so like
you were able to hook into the actual
command line tool which you still I mean
outside of velocity no one else has
really done as far as I'm aware so like
when you get starting night you actually
have to do like npm install as a global
and then that's the attack vector for
running this is similar to meteorite and
that it's an executable that runs and
kind of wraps up the meteor commands for
you yeah yeah yeah what you think about
Dean yeah well and that's the way that
you could get started i think is you
know as an NPM module like like
meteorite did so it's a quick way to add
something to the ecosystem i'm still not
sure i have a particular pain point that
i'm hoping this addresses but i haven't
taken the time to
actually executed I started learning
about Night Watch and selenium as kind
of prerequisite knowledge so my pain
point that i'm hoping any any tool you
know gets me too is uh is the continuous
integration you know just running once
getting that exit code possibly
providing xml output i'm still groping i
feel in the dark a little bit despite
the fact that there is a lot of help out
there and i had a situation where when
we were running tests inside a docker
container on an ubuntu system um the
tests wouldn't exit they kind of hang
after the last test even though i I'm
familiar with in double dash test and
double dash wants and I tried a bunch of
stuff there and so you know my
impression was just that like if someone
is starting focused on CI tooling like
like the starry night packages maybe
some things will be you know kind of
there from the get-go know where
velocity really had the in browser thing
reactive test results got it down you
know and that's kind of its vision so i
wonder if there's you know kind of two
visions of the testing experience I
don't know that I'd say yes to that so
to me I think the CI is probably the
hardest part to solve when you want to
do it in meteor itself so when you're
writing your own tool like start a night
right and it's just an NPM package that
can kick off its own things and do what
it needs to do like she can write that
the way she needs and everything will
work fine but velocity itself is
actually hooking into the meteor build
process and so that I think is where
some of the complication comes in
because you're dealing with the fact
that you now have two groups trying to
do something and like as a like I just
made a change to the dash dash test
stuff you shouldn't have to tell it once
to me the assumption is when you type
dash dash test it should assume that you
only wanted to run once in
sit and it wasn't doing that and um you
know I it was a one liner right it
wasn't a hard change but you know now
all of a sudden it's got to sit out
there a way to be approved and then it's
got to wait for the next release cycle
that's where it gets into and so I think
that that makes things slower or harder
to kind of think about uh and get right
I mean I remember spending about a week
ago not a week ago about two months ago
I spent about a week is trying to get
the I server to like run and pass I
could get it too I finally got it to the
point where it would run but then like
it would pass on my machine but not pass
in the CI environment so there was a lot
of fiddling there and i think it's it's
a little bit harder because javascript
is asynchronous and so at least with
cucumber a lot of times which you have
to keep upping your wait time and you
know it's it's all just depending on how
fast that CI server is running your
tests yeah yeah I I appreciate the
complexity of how you know what what has
to go on to to run your tests in the
context of your app we tried some kind
of a jerry-rigged approaches before
velocity had been approved and none of
them got very far and so I'm definitely
looking to the velocity to do some you
know of this stuff and maybe I'll
understand it but I'm not gonna roll my
own at this point dim yeah ok leavin
next topic sure uh so I'm still trying
to wrap my head around this topic it's
funny I always pick the topic since this
one of myself you like a challenge
apparently I do um so I you know I was
looking at the crater
the more popular stories we missed it
last week because this actually came out
nine days ago the blaze components and
building reusable components for blaze
and okay so he's got a tutorial site and
he says the problem is let's say we have
an input box that auto selects the text
on clicking for easy changing its value
is read from the database and is written
to it when they user changes and play
meteor would look something like this
right and so he's got the HTML template
and he's got some coffee scripture
JavaScript you can click back and forth
yeah up orders and events yeah and so
what if we now want functionality on
another template our options are either
to duplicate the code refactor the
template refactor the code instead or
create a helper class that does the same
above in an organized way and also
provides inheritance so we can create a
modified version or extend the
functionality yeah interesting okay and
so proposing instead that you can just
build a component and it'll do what it
needs to do and you register it yeah
looks like he's using es6 oh he has some
es6 examples yeah yeah because he's
using like classes he's extending he's
got a blaze component class and you
extend that with your component and then
register it yeah so I know react I we
had react fresh on the brain from last
week but like it is this assemble some
existing a component a thing that you
know I was like react or or maybe a
asp.net or something well I would just
throw out that you know we're using
polymer with meteor a user cycle and
like we have components through that
right but they're not meteor components
this isn't it it's a symptom of like all
their frameworks have the concept of a
component meteor still doesn't have that
we've been talking about it for a year
you know like this is a long-standing
topic and meteor hasn't provided a model
for this yet right I don't remember did
they say like they want this to be a
community thing or they still working on
internal idea for what a meteor
component would be so I mean I almost
put the blaze to proposal on here for us
to talk about but I think some of that
is maybe detailed in there um but I just
think that yeah they really want
feedback from the community and they
want to build the best solution they can
and you know I think no matter what it's
going to take time coming from them just
because they they really like to do a
good job with this kind of stuff so and
that takes time yeah but this packet
just meteor blazed components this is
his MTG involved in Esther's it's all
guitar yeah I think it's all just meet
are impure library um okay yeah yeah so
he's you know it's it's it's a little
bit of um it's like well how would I do
it you know it's it's moving the whole
conversation forward though which I
think this good yeah I'm to remember is
he a guy like somebody else was talking
about maybe it's this of being able to
wrap polymer components inside though
these you know that was part of this
conversation I have no idea there's 45
comments on this thing I actually read
all of them yeah yeah yeah so like I
don't however with this there's just a
bigger the different conversation around
of components but yeah I mean basically
components is a big part of what's going
to need to get resolved in 2015 i think
for meteor I don't think the community
is going to stand stand around and wait
much longer than that before will be a
lot of community driven you know systems
out there and it's kind of like a tricky
part about this is i don't know that i
would implement this you know in my code
because if meteor comes out with
something official in three months
you're gonna be tearing that out you
know so be fun to you know it's got a
blaze to thingies get move forward
um some statement from those guys on
that would be nice yeah agreed yeah it
kind of reminds me of the evolution in a
world I was part of years ago the Java
servlet JSP world and you know you
started out with a JSP which is kind of
like a PHP a kind of big collection of
everything and then there were
components that you could call into and
then sometimes they would take their
configuration with angle brackets which
harkens back a little bit too that's a
cold fusion even mmm yeah so this quest
towards a little you know drop in things
that have a few configuration options I
think when you use like a WYSIWYG editor
for designing HTML cables you right
click on them and configure how many
rows and columns they are that type of
thing you know every framework I've seen
as has gravitated towards creating one
or more of these you know oh I believe
it's it becomes a important part of the
platform when it matures that's that's
the tricky part of it if this was like
if you had to do this from the beginning
if you had to use components and that
was the standard tutorial it makes
meteor feel a lot more complicated you
know closing in on like ember and
angular in terms of complexity and we
lose a little bit of our special secret
sauce there if that happens but time
mature apps need this kind of stuff like
we're dealing with this in in our in our
own apps like you know the lack of being
able to extend a model uicomponent hurts
you know once you use the same kind of
concept ten times in your code change it
it's a big pain in the ass so um it's
it's tricky yeah I mean it's interesting
too because not only like is meteor
coming along but also the web itself is
trying to figure out like what's the
best way because I mean you know here
we're talking about like blaze
components but then there's also like
you know capital W web components
you know everyone's trying to figure
that out and you see things like polymer
or ionic or you know everyone wants to
know what's the best way to build this
reusable bundle of HTML CSS and
JavaScript and you know nobody knows yet
like until the browser's catch on and
support something you know widespread I
just I'll just crap shoot right yeah
it's definitely edgy so yeah all right
stuff never resolution on that ah my
hope was to solve it right here right
now yeah all right well thanks for
tuning in guys i'll i'll mention a
couple other things we didn't get to
today but there's now reactive postgres
sequel maybe we'll talk about that next
week wow that's kind of interesting and
I think that media should hire this guy
like what the what the heck you know
this is yeah now put out my single
support and now he's putting out post
Kersey core support and wow what's going
on mdg hmm yeah I also launched in case
you I'm sure you guys saw but a new
meteor club podcast will we do a round
table it's like an hour long thing
actually recording that one next launch
that you can check that out we don't
have a website up yet when open next
week we'll have it up you have an itunes
a store link yeah yeah we've get we've
got an RSS feed tube but there you go
there is lean and mean right yeah yeah I
learned some things already on that show
about about mop oh nice yeah awesome
well the next the next one will be
interesting too because we talk a lot
about Cordova so that ones in the can
and ready to go I'm just gonna post it
today and then later today we're talking
about how to build a testing culture
actually so yeah
yeah like how do we shift meteor into
like a culture that is accepting and
welcoming and crazy testing in their
applications so package all the things
life all right and I think that's it you
know thanks to sponsor modulus as always
there awesome so sure you heard the ad
in the beginning if not check them out
modulus thought I oh great hosting
platform well thanks for joining us Dean
yeah all right good to see you guys John
