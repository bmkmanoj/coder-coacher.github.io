designs
I got this tripod in this mic for
father's day and so now you'll notice
that the videos will be in 1080p
promised I would use the camera but the
mic here battery is dead I think I hope
test test test one two one two Oh
testing it's the summer solstice the sun
just went down still pretty light out
though think we'll get a long dusk I
still haven't done a run so I'm gonna go
do that I may try taking river for a run
to mm-hmm you ready go for a run so
grabbed our new harness it's got a front
clip we'll see if that works better if
she starts pulling again we'll switch to
that time does Jernigan minds
tonight just got done with the run it's
a crazy day like I don't know I've
barely had any time took bring this one
this morning didn't get any footage
there came back home for a little bit
picked him back up took them to his moms
then came home to shower had to jump
into some pairing I'd like a maybe a 45
minute break between pairings did
another one so I did a total of like
four to five hours of pairing today I
was kind of a marathon session turned
out I forgot to eat this is a little
grouchy this evening we ended up with
chilies really you know they used amigos
and you you saw the truth I mean this is
on the loose down
for dinner not the greatest place but it
did I I knew I wanted to go run still
after dinner and the it would be light
enough to do it so tried to be cognizant
and just get a salad for dinner and I
that helped some we ended up with three
miles you know still up no that's
something see but is it confirmed so
good i miss him you saw the clip at the
beginning of the video that was some new
stuff that i got from father's day so i
got a nice gorillapod joby gorillapod
for carrying around this DSLR camera and
got a new mic that goes on the top of
the camera to give me a slightly better
sound so I've done some recordings with
this this video camera but um the sound
always turns out quite bad because it
picks up the whole room rather than just
directional focus so going to start
playing around with this and try to get
more 1080p video drives me nuts doing
720p because most of my technical stuff
is 1080p or 4k I've done some 4k videos
as well so curious Joby and then Oh
shark Mike
hey you saw the truth for me I don't
have the time good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
