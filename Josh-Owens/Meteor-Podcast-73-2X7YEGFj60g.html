2015 welcome meteor fans i'm your host
josho and slung with my co-host it's
been Strahan what's up Ben what's up
Josh happy Friday man indeed happy
unhappy friday it's like getting to be
close to 90 degrees in my house it feels
like something's wrong with the AC
bomberman whoa yeah sucks to be you yeah
we're gonna have to go like hang out
somewhere else for a while see if we can
get it fixed yeah man yeah we had that
happen to us last year ooh yeah actually
we did too like right at the start of
the hot season like our AC died and they
said it'd be about a thousand to fix it
or about 3,000 to put a new one when I
can put anyone know we moved yeah that
was stupid good I'm gonna buy a thousand
dollars worth of fans put in a whole
house fan you know it honestly it would
work but you know the train is a problem
so when you sleep with the window open
the train comes right at you and it's
like right here Oh night you like uh I'm
awake now I would love that yeah I'd be
perfect for Polly fasta Krait their ice
yes you weirdo sleeper you all right so
this week I just do anything fun this
week exciting me yeah I mana I'm i have
a blog post coming out and I was telling
you a little bit about it this like this
weekend and last week was dedicated to
like I don't know revamping and moving
around my my personal experiments with
productivity and some big boost some big
exciting news coming next week so no be
good but that that's the only exciting
thing that's like whole week's been
focused on that yeah okay all right whoo
yeah I put out a email to the media club
list and
I I got more of a response than I
thought I would were like getting close
to selling out of on-site tickets for
meteor space camp so that app that's
quite interesting so now I'm starting to
get more people that are like well stay
off site but like what hotels are nearby
so now I'm gonna like do all this
research oh so so you're the so you're
the guy who's organizing it and you're
the concierge yeah totally you know what
us we we are getting stoked it okay grow
for this event like then just today a
lot of guys booked their flights nice
and we got a couple of them coming in
early into Chicago and like spending the
week with us and then we're going to
like do the divan trip down Oh was
awesome yeah so that's gonna be it's
gonna be a blast anyway so we're really
looking forward to it we're like
planning our whole like beginning in of
October around this event as a company
awesome yeah I'm excited huh all right
so this week we're going to talk about
yes 2015 patterns and meteor can't say
es6 anymore really would have yearly
release I'm gonna will SAT right I don't
know they promised seven was going to be
coming on the heels of sex Wow it'll be
2016 right so gives them a whole year
and a half their little less uh
constellation def console I don't know
I'm curious what do you want to talk
about their you so drama react for
meteor devs react talking about react to
get help what do you want to talk about
that for so I don't know you put that
out on the list yeah well I made us a
popular post we show Friday Night war
with Mongo yes and a hackathon dental
alright so let's get one things to talk
about indeed as gary vee would say let's
get into the show yes he's one of my
like I always get amped up you know I
was listening to him the other day on my
overcast and you know for entrepreneurs
it's little slow so I speed it up to
like 1.25 mm-hmm don't speed Gary be up
to one boy to file such too much too
much slow down yeah yeah for that anyway
ah oh this is you know I mean Ryan lover
this guy Oh showered he puts out such
crazy good blog well you know why
because he's from Chicago no that's got
nothing to do with it it's cuz but Tolan
made of gold you talking about me when
he said that by the way was he he's
nowhere near six foot haha nice yeah so
I mean like this I think this is a good
post like it's it's worth a read
especially if you're not familiar with
yes 2015 not yes except I'm never gonna
let that go he's really annoying um yeah
I don't like yeah so I mean he covers
some of the syntax changes i don't think
it's like earth-shattering I think you
know if you're not familiar with it
again it's probably worth a look he
talks about let and you know basically
he shows you some code before and some
code after he implements some the new
patterns and they're not the pretty good
patterns i would say um you know the
scoping stuff he covers that a little
bit too like the scoping is changed a
little bit in 2015 so this is a little
more reliable you don't have to worry
about like saving it in context changing
and that kind of thing which is nice
which is it's also funny right because
with coffeescript you have like the
single arrow and then you have the fat
arrow and the single arrow wouldn't like
rebind
context but the fat arrow did and so I
feel like they just kind of like took
the idea of fat arrow made it to fall
and that's kind of what's happened here
but you know I don't know I mean what
are you what are your thoughts on all
this stuff you love it are you guys
dragging the es2015 yet you know oh you
guys fail oh that's a little harsh ah
alright you're gonna pinch his pockets
on your own I might occur nice I'm just
kidding no I mean it's an interesting
question right like I mean you guys so
the other interesting thing is like I
know based on what Paul said the other
day that you guys aren't green fielding
any brand new projects right now right
so I mean every ball they're actually
sunsetting to clients really soon so
we're going to be having new stuff
coming up so that's pretty cool like as
a company yeah where you are you gotta
use es2015 for it we're gonna we're
going to try and use everything new like
every time we have we so we actually
keep track of the things that we want to
try out mm-hmm and as new projects come
on then we implement that stuff right
away but since we like give a little bit
of time between implementing it right
away and when we first like realize that
we want to try it that gives us time to
play around with it and see if we really
want to do it yeah yeah no I I started a
project over the weekend playing around
with the idea of like a micro service
that's consuming API and then spitting
out a DDP feed that I can consume in a
nap and I was using yes 2015 for it and
uh huh I like it yeah I mean and it's
it's noted it's a good thing to say that
with meteor 1.2 you could use both like
you you're not you don't have to go out
and learn right well it's backwards
compatible right yeah yeah I don't think
they've taken a whole lot away like most
of its new syntax I believe so you it's
not like we required to upgrade but I
think exactly you be foolish not to
because I think it just makes things
more clear
my opinion right like you gain const and
you know let instead of our is a little
bit cleaner and how the scoping works
and that kind of stuff so exactly you
know this context and then who the hell
likes type and function all the time
like I love it get out of here dude no
but um bye-bye knowing that it's like
optional you could like have it grow
organically into your project or into
you yourself because I it's it's
psychological you gotta like get the
patterns going yeah yeah so you know you
could like kind of do both for a little
bit and then when you submit your code
for review whoever's like reviewing it
could hit you over the head and be like
yo who's the new syntax well I'll be
good but yeah our new projects will be
using that and I'm gonna be pushing for
react as well and then you project mmm
it'll be fun it'll be I love working it
okay grow they are they are crazy and
you're not just paid to say that oh wait
oh you are ah ha ha ha just kidding just
keep I don't know I wonder what'd happen
if I like maybe hey Paul every time I
mention okay grow in public you have to
pay me right yeah fifty bucks wow that's
a little high man I'd probably go thank
you from the team is that shoot you're
gonna fire me for fifty bucks re well I
won't say that fifty dollars per mention
yeah I don't know it depends how
influential this show right here would
probably put put them out of business
just this episode alone yeah hey you
said it a lot I don't know alright so
yes 2015 You chef you figured it out if
you're not well sorry you're gonna get
left in the best all right so uh
consolation dev console yo demo demo
demo hey tell me about it been yo so I
like I I want on crater that I oh it's
like an awesome website right and I'd
like hey what's what's happening today
and then I saw this thing consolation
console it seems a lot like
meteor toys right it does and so I go on
there and they have a little demo I go
on the demo and I wonder if I can pull
up right now I'm on that demo right now
and dude they have a comparison chart
but with meteor toys I was like whoa
this guy's like throwing some eggs at my
boy max 7 I don't know so it's a
jealousy okay so he's just he's extended
the Mongol peace to lake but it doesn't
it's not responding to hockey Oh control
be he changed it right because it's not
Mongol anymore yeah why didn't I think
of that yeah yeah and so I was like
alright great so you got like an open
source version that has all these extra
tools on it and it's extensible you
could write packages for yourself and
incorporate it uh and I reach out to my
boy max and be like you know what's
going down and all that what are your
thoughts and uh Max's and gentlemen he's
like hey you know I love the community
and all that and it kind of our
conversation fell back on on a little
bit what we talked about on the meteor
club podcast about pay packages yeah you
know and it's like where they do similar
things what you got to think of like
where the inspiration came from and and
Max is like always pushing the
boundaries now that he has a pretty
expensive paid product you know he's
going to want to support that and push
out updates and stuff like that yeah i
still think business models may be a
little off right because I mean a
one-time ninety nine dollar deals like
probably not quite right for him I would
have to agree but I'd also have to say
um it's like the first pay package that
to come out of our community and so I
would be shocked if he would have gotten
it right like that would almost be like
hey pick some lottery numbers for me too
well I'm yeah that's totally fair right
like like we got we got the inside and
learning from Mike param and
it was interesting but the thing is like
he got it wrong before I got it right so
I mean I wouldn't i wouldn't expect too
many people unless you're like
specifically going and looking at other
places you know for inspiration it's
gonna be hard to kind of find and like
there's so many different communities
you could turn to and look for something
and you know doesn't yeah not everybody
came from ruby like that's where I came
from and that's why I knew about Mike so
yeah so like my big thing adding this to
our list is I'm really interested on on
what's going to happen in what community
is going to have gonna do like if this
consolation stuff takes off and and
people start to start extending it and
adding more stuff to it then it could
really like take off if max keeps on
adding premium features and support ah
and answering the people who pay with
their money like it's kind of like a
start to a little bit of a race and we
knew it was coming you know we had a
feeling a lot of people said hey I love
what max is doing the moment that an
open source one comes out I'm gonna be
on it and a lot of other people said hey
I love what max is doing let's support
them yeah so it's interesting it's out
there it's almost like hey you know I'm
gonna I'm gonna wave the flag and start
the race and I'm curious to see what
will happen yeah yeah I don't know I
mean it's definitely interesting right
like i mean he he released mongol was
open source and people loved it and then
he thought hey let's take a deeper and
you know now like the open source stuff
is there and i think it should be there
right like I mean there should be part
of it that's open sourced and I don't
know I'll call it like I see it some
people are cheap right and no matter
what like I don't pay for slacks like
it's free but then other people are like
I really want my history and that's the
thing you don't get with the free slack
so they go out and they make us fat
clone and maybe maybe some other it is
there's so much history on meteor club
by the way I'm kind of annoyed you
should start paying there's so much that
cost I know it's insane
but there's so we do so much talking I'm
meteor club everyone like you can't even
go past more than 24 hours axing yes
only people talking yeah it's well I
think I think we're at the point where
it's maybe like you get like maybe a day
and a half if it's a slow day I have it
slow day otherwise there's like way too
many goods oh yeah now now I'm just
curious like what what is it up to like
how far can you go back right now team
building boom okay you look at that I'm
going to tell you how far we can go back
in our in our channel I'm gonna go right
now can we get past today ooh I mean
yesterday yesterday at 2pm that's as far
back as I got less than 24 hour right
notice I mean this would this would eat
a whole money for this would eat up all
my patreon money it's ketchup nine
hundred and twenty dollars per month oh
yeah that's a little ridiculous I the
eight dollars per users a little RNA in
my opinion but you know hey hey Josh I
think we need a sponsor yeah maybe it's
like spot oh honey all right hey we're
going back to 2 p.m. yesterday if we
double how many people are in the group
we're gonna have like no we're gonna
have a mention and with the moment I get
on on Fleck the next day my match is
gonna be gone I so I have a theory on
this is like there's a number of like
people that are gonna be in here and
active and responsive and like it's it's
not gonna be like if I bring 300 in
we're not necessary gonna have double
the number active people I think so yeah
there is like a fall off anyway we got
way off topic their way off topic one
thing I really like about you Josh
though is that um that you're flexible
you're intelligent I think in this
package conversation a lot of times
people have a knee-jerk reaction at
first and they'll just like shoot out
their first feelings about it and I i
think the right reaction would be to be
like just curious
it's what's really gonna like happen
after this and you should and I share
that I think that's right all right you
know for me like coming from the
standpoint of lake always wanting to
learn and grow a business like these are
the things that you have to sit back and
pay attention to and think like oh
what's this outcome gonna be can I give
this outcome in some way by doing this
or that or you know these are the things
like you know I've talked a lot about
measuring things and like if you have an
idea like write up a hypothesis and
trying to test it in some way like data
driven development essentially it you
know I'm a big fan of that and like this
is again even though I'm not measuring
it I do get to kind of see the outcome
and and sort of measure like the
community response right yeah and that's
valuable to me so yeah yeah we've had
lots of talks about development and
marketing and we've disagreed on on a
lot of things like about marketing stuff
and at the end of the day we're just
like let's test it and that's where it
comes in like you got to just see what's
going to come out on top and you gotta
have loosely held opinions you really do
and I think the one thing that I had to
say is I like both I like what max is
doing I like what consolations doing
what I dislike are the people who have
really strongly held about pig packages
and stuff like it needs to be opened up
and see what happens some experiments
yet to be determined yeah yes okay
that's my rant I'm getting off the
soapbox all right let's move on so I
think um yeah I don't this one this one
came out a couple days ago uh actually
when did it come out it came out on
august twenty seventh but what are we
talking about here think it posted to
crater until react for meteor dies yeah
so react on react podcast right yeah
yeah well so it's gonna become the
crater podcast and I actually think I
don't know I'm curious to hear
everyone's thought here yeah I might
change the
tagline to be where meteor reacted node
news lands hmm right I don't know I'm on
the fence I bought this is the first
time i'm here in the node part I heard
that I just I feel like every day all
day long like chocolate and peanut
butter is being mixed and we're trying
not to pay attention and we're just like
lalala lalala want to meet here what you
know that's that's not the case like it
would definitely like blurring the lines
a whole lot I'm five hundred percent
behind you for blurring the lines yes
yeah i mean i think it's it's good right
like it's it's interesting because no
matter what like we read that other side
of the coin you know thing last week and
it's very much like you look at react
and it's very much the opposite like
taking the opposite approach of what
amber and handlebars and all those kinds
of things took um and it's for better
for worse it's interesting right and
yeah you know he's got some interesting
points in here he says that you know
it's battle-tested they've been using it
for facebook and instagram so you know
chances are they're hiring smart people
and they're implementing it and figuring
out the problems and fixing them and you
know hopefully making something stable
and good on the front end so that's
interesting to me because I mean no
matter what at the end of the day like
there's no way that meteor in my mind
can hire enough people to compete with
react on the front end or compete with
angular on the front end right you talk
about blaze yeah yeah blaze blaze but I
mean it's blaze is backed by a meteorite
and even though I like blaze and I had
this conversation privately with Sam
corcos and he pointed out like um you
know it's to him and maybe feels a
little slower to get started with react
but in the end it's faster because he
feels like the maintainability of it is
much much better in the long run mhm and
you know I think that's a lot of a lot
of what I'm seeing here um you know
even here he talks about it being
predictable and focused and I think that
yeah that's that's a lot of what people
are getting it yeah yeah well before we
talk about this blog post on
differential let me move my soap box
over here down stand on top of my
soapbox oh I think it's great that that
you want to like change it to crater
podcast and that you want to have that
that tagline because my biggest
complaint for the longest time is that I
do not want to be seen in the developer
community as all that dude drink in the
meteor kool-aid and like everything
media and everything media we have our
own we have galaxies are hosting site we
have we have our own package manager we
have our own front-end render blaze you
know no we have everything and it's and
it's all spoon-fed to us from mdg yeah I
mean so that that just this is my
soapbox man you can't don't knock me off
I'm totally that's like that's the
absolute opposite of one of the core
tenants of meteor itself right I mean
you you look at their seven principles
or whatever and one of them is too yeah
it even says here in this article i'm
reading right now brace the ecosystem um
boom thank you and I think that react is
definitely a huge part of the ecosystem
no matter what you say or do like it
it's definitely there I don't think it's
going to go anywhere I don't think like
at this point if it was gonna be a
failed experiment it would already be
like cratering yeah yeah well you know I
love it like 1.2 are going to be like
breaking stuff out a little bit more
things going to be more modular I love
that that's a great move and I see like
every day in our slack group there's
like one question or one discussion that
gets started about NPM packages right
and so that's getting going reacts
getting going and so you could tell like
meteor is like it used to be an island
and now the islands like shifting and
joining the mainland and it's like yeah
so anyway we got it we got to change
that podcast name what
what's ETA for that mmm I'm the I'm the
boss man josh is quiet now mmm okay for
the website or the yeah for crater yeah
no I'm like five hundred percent behind
you this again jeez yeah you put me on
the spot um Wow don't send me any dirty
emails about this later yeah I'm gonna
say like maybe two weeks so I've got
I've got an inside track maybe we'll be
getting some press around then as well
too so can I try to get it done before
the press hits not soon all right um
look I did that was my secret mission
yeah yeah you can buy you been Wow yeah
you've been lobbying this for a while
and I've been resistant but i think i've
seen the light here uh definitely
definitely not meteor all the time all
everywhere like I understand now that
there's a much bigger world out there
and we can embrace it so okay so reactor
meteor developers yes branch oh yes yeah
it's I just think this is a great
article he talks about some of his why
he likes it some of his learnings you
know keep your children dumb parents
talked down to the children because
children are dumb mm-hmm it's truth yes
did you see that thing i'm on twitter or
like someone said that I don't we don't
like the developers terminology for
master slave no I did not see that he
did it anyway so I'm a parent so I don't
know i might be offended at this little
article here I don't want to keep my
children down uh okay uh yeah I like
seeing children know do you children
super smart yes they are they are
serious and thankful impressed my
daughter is safe because she was so
smart seriously I'm impressed her yeah I
gave her a high five tonight how cool
she is indeed alright so the other thing
is like you know everyone's like I jsx
it feels
to me you know we're mixing things
together like well I hate to be the one
to inform you but mr. developer you're
already mixing your javascript in your
CSS and HTML together happening for you
with blaze Oh Josh you cash you've taken
a whole 180 I I have it right I'm still
writing a blaze but I mean at the same
time like I'm starting to think this
might be interesting and uh that the
project I was talking about that I
played with this weekend like I'm i'm
making a micro service and then i'm
gonna make a react front adapt to try to
consume it and i'll put everything on
the page so should be interesting mm-hmm
this is were way I'm flustered it's hot
I think it's great great article are our
friend Nick win tidge the crater
designer wrote this it's definitely
worth a read especially if you're not a
fan of jquery soup is he article yeah
and nick is someone that you could
really trust like he's really good at
this he did uh well I'm the same like
there's some people you shouldn't trust
that well I want to get my like general
bearings and directions as a developer
from like people who like really are
battle-tested what they do anyway so I'm
just like taking it from Nick like he
built meteoric so like he did a pork
from angular to blaze or small of ionic
and so now he's like he's he's talking
about how great reactors and so he has
this experience at the front ends he's
someone that I would pay attention to I
what he has to say them that's what I'm
saying you know if if Gary Vee came up
to me and started talking about react
you know or somebody that I would be you
know getting your lame bro stay in your
lane anyway that's all I'm saying man so
I'm saying all right let's go yo Friday
Night war with Mongo feel like I should
get my camos on or something
yeah totally like mango is like this
purple dinosaur that looks like Barney
and he showed up at the catera offices
and they totally like battled it out
like that's what I heard right there's a
rumor on twitter if someone like that
yeah definitely uh so Friday a minute
wait a minute oh this is an official
blog post oh I wonder where I'm getting
my stories are from okay anyway what
here maybe maybe just maybe Ben's been
drinking a little I don't know uh yeah I
don't I so like friday i was just kind
of like poking around last week saying
hey let's look at some crater stats cuz
that you know i try to pay attention at
least once a week and make sure it looks
at least a zippy as i can hope it could
be at this point actually i'm really
impressed side note again I'm impressed
with how much you look at stats and you
read high five you actually I really am
so keep it up yeah back to 10 people so
yeah like I just I I noticed well I'm i
was talking to Charles right and we
talked about this last week and I was
trying to show him how to dig into like
pub/sub data to try to speed things up
in your in your meteor app and it was
like the data was just gone and he's
like well I'm not getting any data and
I'm like well let me look at crater and
it's like this big white or purple line
that's just flatlined and I'm like I
don't I don't know man the data is just
not there and it's been missing since
like eight a.m. eastern time and so I
messaged Aaron Oda he's like yeah
something wrong were you know trying to
fix manga right now and I'm like oh okay
and no worries and then like a couple
hours later he comes back and he's like
mind you this was pub sub data that I
was having trouble with right he comes
back and he says oh lost we lost a
couple hours of like method trace data
and I was like oh it's weird nom but so
he he did promise like publicly that he
would kind of give a a teardown of what
happened essentially and it boils down
to Lake you know the he was having like
CPU
spike usage on his Mongo instances like
the hard times were big enough but to
see if you just couldn't keep up and
just a series of unfortunate events with
how he tried to put a new secondary
server into the Mongo replica set that
he was working with and apparently it
just blew up the primary and everything
went haywire with their aggregation tool
that they had built so mmm is this an
argument teeth for using composed uh no
I don't think so I think ok he's at the
point where this is not the kind of
thing like he if you understand like how
much data he's actually processing and
pushing around like there's I don't
think there's any feasible way you could
reliably use compose in a cost-efficient
way I think you know this is this is
just one of those things that you learn
because you're handling it I think maybe
this would have been less of a problem i
compose but I don't you know again like
he would have hit a scaling wall there a
long time ago and had to just like send
them fork loads of cash mmm to try to
keep up with what he needs um but you
know I think the interesting thing here
is that at the end he talks about how
they're gonna short it and they're gonna
shard not shorting but char ding oh wow
set that's always a weird weird to me
shorting um anyway uh I just saw I just
saw the movie the interview dude did you
remember seeing that goes well North
Korea oh no we didn't watch that oh it's
so good oh okay oh I'm now gonna ruin it
anyway yeah chart shardene talking to a
big part of one scene okay let's see
well we'll get back to this we're
talking about char ding and
you know he's going to do it on the
application level right so it you know
Mongo will support it on the database
level if you want to go that route but I
don't you know I haven't really heard of
anyone trying I know Abigail wats in
there for a while was playing around
with the idea but she said like getting
an entire sharted set up is actually
quite difficult it required something
like six to twelve machines to pull off
like a fully shorted set up and so she
was trying to use vagrant to do it but I
mean that was the last I heard of that
experiment we talked a little bit I
thought it was interesting but you know
it didn't really go anywhere but he's
going to do it on the application level
so when you sign up they'll pick us like
a replica set to put your data on and
then like any time you connect into the
app it'll just connect to that replica
set to pull your data over so that makes
sense kind of interesting right and so I
am I don't I don't even know where these
are anymore but I used to do a podcast
called web pulp TV it was like a video
podcast and I talked to Lucerne this was
a long time ago um and we talked about
he's that he was that maybe he's still
the CEO but he was this yo of New Relic
at the time and he talked about their
shorting system and it sounded very
similar and how it worked right like
someone would sign up and they would
just like look at all the database
servers and pick the least loaded one
and you know put you over there and they
would kind of keep track of client
levels and then as they needed to they
would just add a couple more replica
sets in they were you know called
something else because it's my sequel
but essentially they would add in a new
load balanced my sequel set and they do
a couple at a time and then start
distributing new customers there and so
like it was an interesting way to like
have a growth path to deal with all that
data that's coming in see what that says
so I do alright well we'll just move on
to the next story then yes since we got
approval all right we just got a cool i
just did your story so you do my story
okay fine what do you like my boss or
something yeah haha yo meteor universe
listen up oh wow this is crazy like he
just sent out an email at the same time
you're saying this yeah that's that's
why I showed you by fall oh I saw you
show me he said yes yeah okay then he's
also sent out an email but I couldn't
show you both okay so so everyone what
are we talking about let's fill you in
here there's something amazing happening
in October yes then I need here the
meteor Space Camp is happening in
October but even before that there's
something amazing happened there is a
worldwide global meteor hackathon
happening October tenth and eleventh you
heard it first here saturday Saturday
sir that's right Thunderdome and I and I
am pretty sure that once this podcast
comes out you guys will see it on
Twitter you guys will be able to see it
on their their blog post that there will
be a link where you can sign up for a
hackathon come in officially sponsored
by meteor development group and I our
boy Nick co gave us the inside scoop and
said hey we can mention it on this
podcast just like three minutes ago yes
yes so Nick you're awesome thank you man
indeed so a hackathon October is shaping
up to be a really full month man mm-hmm
I don't know are we going to see
something interesting from them in
November then I don't know I see ya
September I think we'll definitely see
something this month interesting right
why would you want to have a hackathon
yes October 10th boss if you're pushing
hard for some big relief whoa just gonna
I'm gonna say it again just like throw
it out there I think I think September
dev shop we're gonna see release mmm
yeah that's a given yeah that's a given
I'm wondering like do you think this is
just one point two are they gonna be
like kind of rolling out a little bit of
galaxies here and be like yo guys here's
some here's some galaxy credits go like
show us what you can put that there so I
mean my thoughts are here yes I think we
might see some interesting announcements
around galaxies especially because one
of the one of the sign up form thing
says like which of these statements best
describes you and haha I mean it's kind
of what I like this is a little bit of
data mining right like they want to
associate like a little bit about who
you are with your email address and i
don't know this is definitely feeling
this question feels a little bit like a
lead generation tool i don't know we'll
see mom but you know i mean no matter
what they're they're putting a lot of it
looks like a lot of hard work into
organizing something that's gonna be a
lot of fun for the community so yeah and
i definitely hope that we if nothing
else like give us a video right like
that would be a lot of fun like demo
launching a product and and maybe the
the first place is a free year on galaxy
or something like that would be kind of
cool yeah yeah so what do we know about
this so far i'm gonna go to the rules so
let me jump on this page where we at
here boom this is what we know guys this
is this is what it is you have to build
an application using meteor it's in 24
hours by the way yes all apps need to be
built within 24 hours between october
tenth and eleventh and your teams can
only be one to four people wow you know
im so I'm looking at the categories and
prizes in this this one know who's gonna
win this what with the best app with
less than a hundred lines of JavaScript
maximum 80 characters per line some
clarification on that as well like is
that just can I I just move all my code
two packages like well and that's the
thing that they said like you can kind
of cheat within the 24 hour thing here
they kind of said hey there's one way
around this is that you could make a
public package that that and don't get a
little don't give it all you know smart
aleck here making it we're gonna be
looking Ben and I are gonna be looking
i'll just tell you now well you and I
are kind of an artist I think we're
gonna be like the ones like causing this
again shenanigans maybe maybe don't know
I don't I I would not trust me would be
the police well like here's the thing
like for rails rumble um you know having
done that in the past the the thing that
that you couldn't do was write any
actual Ruby code for an application you
could open source libraries ahead of
time but you had to publish them
publicly for anyone to use not just
yourself um and that's what he's saying
here yeah I think I think there needs to
be an even finer line drawn in the sand
around like how much of your application
can be in that package and you know if
it's i don't know like it's it's a
little dicey there for me because before
with rails like you can release a
package and you can have like generators
to do HTML or something but the rails
engines were pretty terrible back in the
day and you can really write like your
UI and up in a gem so that wasn't really
a thing or a concern um but Kim him
right like you can actually write your
entire app in a pie kitchen that's a
little crazy yeah yeah a little cool
anyway you can use public packages
that's the rule and the package can't be
like the majority or like specialized to
your application but it can be a package
so let go ahead and like start writing
what you want to pack on and make it a
public package which is cool like there
hopefully atmosphere will grow a little
bit because of this so you know my other
thing that I would hesitate about is
they say you respond with a github repo
with app code so I'm kind of hoping
they're gonna work with github and
provide private repos that you can check
in on and that they also have access to
write like the judges and stuff but
because I mean like I didn't have to
open source code in order to participate
in rails rumble and we actually tried to
make like my first exit was my my first
rails Rumble app we built tasty planar
and we sold it to one of our other
co-founders for an undisclosed sum of
cash so you know I don't know some
people like I actually in that first one
uh rails Rumble one of the people that I
think they want a prize but they didn't
take first place was encoder which Oh
going on to be like a huge business so
you know hopefully uh hopefully we don't
have to open source these things I think
that would be a little off pretty
interesting I'd even think about that
yeah i'm just gonna automatically think
well I got plenty of private repos but
other people okay back and other people
don't you can you can like just rely on
the fact that you're gonna keep
iterating on the business and like you
can only write so much code in 24 hours
and the majority of your legitimate
application will happen after the fact
and that's not a big deal but then you
know maybe you'll end up with meteor
toys and constellations right because
you had to open source the initial bit
hmm interesting yeah they're there does
need to be a little bit more information
on this yeah yeah well I think it's just
one of those things like it's a little
weird just because like I think the
package system is so powerful and you
know I don't know there's definitely
some some different bits here what fun
stuff so we've all been clamoring for
this so I'm happy we're getting this
yeah yeah I was just gonna say like hey
what have you been thinking like like
your team wise nah yeah I have no idea
oh so before like you know I didn't when
I won the first rails Rumble I didn't I
did
really uh I just want guys I knew right
but I think I've got a I've got a slack
chat room full of 171 people that I bet
with becomes like steamed if I wanted as
I'm saying your max out at four people
are you gonna do yeah I don't know I
don't know well luckily luckily i'll
make it a little bit easier for you Josh
I do not want to be on your team oh I'm
gonna I'm gonna bring down man I'm gonna
bring you down no actually uh okay grow
we're gonna be we're gonna be teaming up
or we're gonna kind of be doing like a
company thing didn't huh yeah yeah we we
got some fun ideas rolling around in her
head and we were big enough where I
think we're gonna split it up into two
maybe I'll get Paul on my team no I'm
already aiming at MIT no I bet I bet I
got more pull than you will see oh you
know what you should do now that you're
being a jerk to me you know what you
should you should start the bald team Oh
give us call you should get Sasha and
you should get um shoot who is it who's
the first one I'm sorry Jeremy shaam ko
oh and Sam tattoo Sam hatoum in you oh
dude yeah what I mean you just wanted to
just say i would like to lose oh I was
gonna say how would how would I like to
be envious of my hair that's what I was
busy I mean you can enjoy your hair
hahaha setting pouting in the corner why
couldn't I win this is why I love
pakistan's all this dirt talk going on
this is gonna be good so I think you
know for me the only thing that kind of
bums me out is the fact that it's only
24 hours sorry i participated in
actually the very first rails day which
i was still learning to be a programmer
so that was really really terrible but
it was a straight 24 hours and i think
it's one of those things where you like
you're literally like you've got red
bull tapped into the veins and you're
just like ahh but i think 48 hours is
way better for
titian in my opinion especially he want
to see quality things um I mean it take
before I think can still accomplish some
pretty amazing stuff but you know what
and we've been we were thrown around
hecka hackathon ideas here and there
just randomly you like the past year and
we always defaulted to 48 hours doesn't
talked about it like we'd even think 24
hours ever like that is really tight
yeah it's a tight timeline right I mean
and like what are you gonna do like if
you're gonna like they've asked us to
reserve our meetup space for like it's
gonna be hard to find a bit of space for
24 hours sorry guys no just reserve it
for four hours and then reserve it the
next day for four hours and like you'll
have like a getting started part and
then you'll have like a like a show
everything off part at the end but who
wants to lose like if I got to leave my
space like I'm gonna lose 20 minutes
driving like that's terrible I don't
want to do that that's yeah that's like
120 for that your time is gonna be gone
by the time you get there that well you
know in Chicago you can get come hang
out with us we're going to be camping
out at our poll working place 24 hours
long we have two kitchens over here we
got private rooms or you can like nap if
you want dude we got gigabit internet
nice yeah maybe I'll come on Pine enough
I'm good you should totally come on man
duh okay girls spring him for like 24
hour of foods oh dang i'd even think
it'll be awesome yeah yeah i think it
should be like i don't know i think it
should be like a crater sponsor thing
pressure hahaha i use all my my major
crater income dollars and i'll buy us
some air there you go Julie breathing it
well mdg said that they were gonna help
sponsor any way they can so yeah true
true true so I hear it here here's the
thing go fill out this form if you need
a team say you need a teammate right and
then just say yes I'm I want to go to a
meetup group and if you don't have a
meetup group yet around you
just just tell them that in the bottom
of the form right so I know Cincinnati's
gonna have one sounds like Chicago it's
gonna have one I'm sure like most of the
major cities are gonna have one I've
seen you know the media club slack
chatroom the captains are all abuzz with
this stuff and trying to figure it out
so yeah I think it'll be good yeah it
will be yep and that's exactly I was
gonna say like first up like sign up
there first and then second like go to
meetup com and see what's close by to
you yeah it might be a little bit of a
drive but it's worth it third tweet us
and tell us you're gonna compete against
us and we will turn it will have you
know what we should we should come up
with a hashtag right good like we're
here well meteor hacks is already taken
right so let's do something else so what
are Y team's gonna be called is gonna be
called miracle grow because like oh yeah
and what what's your team gonna be
called the shinies clean shaven the
Chinese clean shaven haha see it's
ironic cuz we all have beards but we
share them I don't get it all right how
about this we'll do like hashtag crater
hacks that sounds fun what do you think
I like it yeah alright so during the
competition you can do hashtag crater
hacks and well we'll do something fun
with that I don't we'll figure it out
mm-hmm we could do our own shots yeah
yeah we could do our own competition
with a prize mm I like the craziest like
like Twitter video or twitter twitter
photo that you send us during the
hackathon yeah the crater hacks yeah
will be the judges mm-hmm oh yes we'll
get we'll get will give away a meteor
toys pack how's that sound oh that's
awesome boom there you go Wow I'll
figure that out well it's up to your
dollars on the line yeah I'll throw down
on that I'm cool with that yeah I'm cool

and we'll find a shirt we'll find some I
don't know we'll find some sure to get
to you
