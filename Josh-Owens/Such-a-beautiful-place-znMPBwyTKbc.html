one of the things I love about traveling
is the fact that you can get out and run
in new places
crap I'm lost I know if we go that way
if I go that way I just came from that
way so I don't know I'm gonna try this
way I gotta hurry though I got a meeting
in like 20 minutes
so I just got back from my run it's hot
here it's really hot here got down to 80
is the low overnight which is crazy so
it was a good run like I thoroughly
enjoy running when I travel to a new
city I've been a Nashville before but I
actually don't think maybe I've done one
run here but did a little research found
this place called Shelby bottom had a
series of lake primitive trails and bike
trails and they are all connected and if
Roy's so I went out there but you know I
totally didn't estimate correctly ran
too far now I'm late for a meeting so I
gotta like wrap this up and do this
meeting and then get over the apple
store so Wendy just texted me while I
was in the shower that she's gonna be
speaking on a panel and it starts in
like nineteen minutes so I gotta get out
of here I'm gonna go see if I can catch
a few minutes of that and then I gotta
head to the apple store
and then my fun fact is that I used to
be a competitive sensor my name is
Chelsea fine and I right yoga doll and
new adult and little great fiction and
fact about me i can't type without
looking at it please i never learned how
to type so even though i write books for
a living I never look at the screen so
my first dresser mess you would eat this
their mess my name is Wendy Owens I
wrote the sacred guardian series which
is no great it's five book series and a
fun fact about me i am a natural redhead
but i put henna on my hair to make it
brighter no way do I sleep in it and it
love that store Otis been broken
what is justice
nice name
so struck out at the apple store I
actually didn't really expect to get
much there yeah I think us bc is maybe
too new so now I'm gonna try like I've
got a breakout cord which gives me a
normal USB port so I'm gonna try best
buy and see if maybe they have a USB SD
card reader cuz that's that's what I
need to get this footage ah
I
twenty minutes later that's by found
this card reader and this will do it
looks like a will carburetor on the
front you want to be on the back to be
cable I got my breakout cable highly
complicated but hopefully we'll be able
to get videos off
thank you yeah so it's late again
tonight moving out for dinner with
channahon and some amazon reps and I
after running around all day like I got
half my video I today we got back from
dinner I edited the rest but then it
turns out that a macbook is a terrible
tool to use from creating video I'm
tired ready to your bed see if I can get
some work done tomorrow
all right so you're quitting yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
