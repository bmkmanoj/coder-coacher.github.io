downtown to OTR and Cincinnati
you
client down there they contacted me out
of the blue so they need some help as
they getting ready to launch the
production so I'm gonna go down there
and try to help them but then I have
back-to-back meetings so I'm gonna have
to try to steal a conference room
so I don't feel like running but I'm
gonna run cuz no excuses right gonna try
to get in three and a half miles today
let's see how we do
so I love this city I went downtown this
morning and worked with this client I
hadn't seen him in a while actually I
think this is the first time we work
together professionally I think I helped
him out I hope I did and then afterwards
I was craving some green juice was going
to walk to off the vine juice place and
ended up I finished my coffee as I was
walking by the coffee shop and ended up
walking in there instead and bumped into
three people that I've been meaning to
talk to so that was pretty amazing I
think don't underestimate the power of
like just showing up somewhere and being
present even though like I had pressure
to get some other work done I just I
took that 30 40 minutes and ended up
talking to people and it was very
energizing and so you know it's okay i
think is my thought here to like not
pressure myself all the time or for you
not to pressure yourself all the time to
just be work work work life can't be all
about making money or getting all the
things done sometimes it's just about
talking to people you haven't seen in a
while so
it is unnaturally quiet out to see me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
