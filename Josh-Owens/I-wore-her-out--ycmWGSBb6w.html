know and you can optimize your life to
be anything that you want on the way to
the swim pool so we can draw a penny off
say hi penny we're gonna do a quick walk
well pennies that swim team and then
kind of get back and got a crazy day
gonna write a bunch emails bunch of
meetings write some code crazy crazy
it's weed a bit of drama on the walk
apparently this this door knob right
here whoop it doesn't latch sometimes
when you go out like the the latch
sticks I gotta replace that and so the
door blew open from the wind and two out
of the three dogs we're not in cages cuz
we just let them lay out and they got
out and walked over luckily they didn't
get far they walked over the neighbor's
house and said hi
so what do you guys think was that like
the best mexican place yeah yeah you
liked it out of given them even though
you didn't like the taco Brandon yeah i
still liked it you still like that yeah
okay so every 100 to one I gave it to
100 all right so go for a run see my
running top we're gonna try to do two
miles today I took her four mile and a
half on Monday
so today I think he's been about
optimizing I realized or no excuses
maybe like a war out so I just I started
thinking like yesterday I was gonna give
up on my run cuz my phone died and you
know I really want to be able to listen
podcast while I run I thought you know
what that's that's a stupid excuse so I
just went sans headphones sans podcast
actually just had the Apple watch it did
an amazing job tracking things and just
ran and you know building on yesterday
like that I was feeling very refreshed
after running and not really having
listened to podcasts just had time to
think I've done a bunch of things to
optimize to give myself to run I've all
this fancy here like these wireless
headphones and my phone and I've got
this little pouch that holds my phone
it's almost like a fanny pack but it's
stretchy material and it stays under my
shirt but I even have a rubber wedding
ring because my fingers would swell and
my ring would feel tight so like I have
optimized everything towards making sure
I get out and run and so I'm glad I did
today I'm glad I got her out we got two
miles done like I wanted she seems one
out so she'll probably go to sleep
tonight over
she is worn out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
