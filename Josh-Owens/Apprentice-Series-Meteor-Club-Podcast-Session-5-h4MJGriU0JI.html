version of the doctors today I'm just
kidding the I don't know this is like
what our sixth or seventh recording for
the media club podcast apprentice series
yeah kinda like that and I've got my
trusty sidekick here colbycheeze with me
welcome pull we what is that yeah so I
you know it's funny like all this stuff
is just saved on my hard drive for the
longest time because I want to finish
this other YouTube and slating app so I
can all right yeah I got everything
you're waiting I would like me busy yeah
no no I've actually got one like all
ready to go but I it's annoying because
all I you know I i paid a guy to do all
the little end slate animations and
stuff and beginning animations and i
really like i don't know maybe this is
terrible but i want if people are gonna
watch I want them to either subscribe or
you know get on the mailing list or
something and somehow be in my gravity
pull we can just tell them like hey guys
yeah button yeah yeah okay yeah but yeah
I should be funny is they're gonna want
if anyone is watching this series and
they watched last episode and then they
watch this episode there's going to be a
big difference yeah yeah you're right
because like both of us trim Darby yeah
we're both would like gonna be like
y'all both lizabet yeah we bet we'd get
this series out quickly that one and I'm
gonna share my screen so something
awesome happen yesterday we were just
kind of talking and I was showing off
the deployed version so we're still
getting this weird air I this has
happened since the last time I try to
deploy on Heroku and I was getting some
kind of weird like HTTP forcible
redirect and the browser would like tell
you that the certificate was wrong
on and there's no way in the world I'm
gonna pay Heroku 20 bucks a month to
host this site well really it be like 35
bucks a month because good man or
whatever is kicking it over to ssl like
I'd have to get a true ssl cert as well
I mean there's just no point for this
site in my opinion this is all public
data um and so like I don't know like I
moved the thing to meteor com just to
see if it would fix the problems and
they've got like cname support as well
and so you can see like I put it over
there at podcast meteor jazz club and it
works but then some people are still
getting like this ssl cert air but if
you inspect it now it actually says like
you know the certificates wrong because
it's for meteor calm so it's like
they're pulling the right IP but for
some reason their browser wants to flip
it over to https and you know i was
looking through the code last night i
don't see anything about forcing to ssl
so I'm just kind of like stumped by this
um i was gonna deploy it on a digital
ocean the other day but then it turns
out that meteor up has broken their
support for ssh agent because i have a
passphrase key ssh key i can't i can't
use a key to deploy with muff anymore
whoa mom so go figure right yeah that's
kind of a bummer apparently i can roll
back to 097 so i may try that later
today just because the other thing is
like right before we started recording
you know I pulled up a podcast up meteor
just a club and like the thing just SAT
there and spun for I don't know
Minutemen and a half and then I hit hard
refresh in a sudden it started working
again so it's like that doesn't seem
like an awesome experience mmhmm yeah
and there's honestly there's probably a
lot of refactoring if you do in here
with like
template level subscriptions because a
lot of this stuff is static so we don't
need a spinner sitting there you know
for a couple minutes while it's loading
this data in the middle we could just
put a spinner over here that's 80 nepeta
right yeah um yeah so I guess where we
left off is that all this stuff kind of
works here you know you click this guy
it works and yesterday we were showing
it off and someone in the chat rooms
like oh I'd love if you had like you
know speed controls and 30 seconds skip
and all that kind of stuff in your
you're like native HTML player up here
and I'm like well it's just the html5
and the repos open source and I was just
kind of like half joking thing we might
get around to it at some point and then
like boom we gotta pull request from the
guy yeah open saw her yes yes that was
also great so first off I believe its
Robin so I want to say thank you Robin
for the pull request um and I just
thought we could look over the code here
and just kind of see what's going on
here and so he added a podcast player
dot style sheet here with a CSS and did
he refactor know okay so I think maybe
this is what this is all the stuff he
added so he did some styling to make it
look not crappy i'm guessing i guess
yeah all right yeah and then he's got oh
look here II factored into a podcast
player ah and then down here rather than
just using an audio tag he's calling the
podcast player mm-hmm open the template
yeah oh nice okay and so all he did was
basically just add some buttons ah to
kind of make
zone yeah because uh the other one was
using I guess like an iframe and we
couldn't control it for some reason yeah
I don't know if that why he did all this
I'm guessing well we were we if you
remember where we left off I know it's
been a while um we just had our audio
tag here because we couldn't get the
high we couldn't control the iframe
right and we write we wanted to have
this this button right here actually
triggered the playing of this episode of
top ah so that was the big reason for it
and so exactly yeah this actually looks
way more complex so he's got the rewind
the current time progress duration so
he's actually just created an entire set
up here mm-hmm like the UI here and he's
got the audio player is still there so
it's the same as it was before but I
think this is all just like over the
pocket the PCAST players overlaid on top
of it and then inside of here on
rendered it looks like he sets up a
bunch of variables okay sets of speed ok
that's the audio that we doing from
jQuery player yeah this interest and
where is he um it looked like there's a
link there i guess he faced with this
over like a oh yeah nice so i think the
only thing i'd say here is this would be
better uh how can we do that that would
be that'd be this so basically whenever
you're in a template you can say like
template dollar sign and it's gonna
scope that query to just inside the
template which I mean it's not like
crazy to just search the entire Dom
all right right so because he's using
dollar sign up you guys play rather than
write using the meteor template it's not
terrible i think so i'm thinking like
this or this context would be actually
that's probably not even true because
we're inside a track or autorun so we
lose that would be my guess so I don't
know we can probably play with that
after we accept it um so I know I've
never mess with a lot of pulling request
but whenever you take this request here
can you pull it into your own branch to
test it out and then merge it with your
master yeah I don't know I've never
figured that out myself either I've got
it I'm pretty sure I can look like this
is like well look at my work but yeah I
think because he's a fork of it I would
have to go pull his branch off his fork
so I'd have to like click through and
grab his as far as i know i'd have to
grab his um his uh his repo and pull in
that branch but i'll probably just yeah
let's let's do that actually let's see
it in action mm-hmm so that's a fail so
if we click view it should take us to
his yeah there we go now we'll just add
that as a remote so just add that there
and then i can do a git fetch or carter
and then get check out dashti or Carter
/ audio controls I believe it is there
we go and so that the dash T sets up
tracking branch show and pulls it from
his version yes if we look at the logs
you can see he's got the version and
they're his commits there at the top
cool now we do a meteor run I think
mostly what we want to do here is just
see it in action and make sure that all
the functionality is working the way we
want yeah exactly make sure it doesn't
completely blow up yeah hand test which
maybe he's a once we get through this
war oh did it again man I did this
earlier Tom drove such as the life you
know what we should we should do is
steal the code from like letterpress or
something like Sam wrote a little
snippet of code that throws an error
that if you try to start the app without
passing a settings file it like craps
out and gives you an error message mrs.
oh it tells you to actually run it with
ya oh yeah which i think is cleaner
right so the air you know what you just
got there was like an authentication
failure which isn't like super oh yeah
I'd like you know oh nice there we go
good that's a doesn't look bad at all I
mean come on was just actually the other
one looked kind of different depending
on which browser you and you might check
it out in Firefox but this might
actually look better in Firefox than the
other one days because the other one
looked kind of weird in Firefox so this
makes it more consistent that's great oh
yeah totally look at that because it's
using I think I noticed a lot of the
stuff is just coming from bootstrap
itself rather than our native audio
player okay doke hey so yeah a little
bit more like squared off but that's
fine it looks fine can you hear that no
no I don't hear your computer audio it
was the play button still work let's see
yeah totally works yeah the rewind
button is set to 30 seconds that works
if we set this 2x
hahaha it's you speaking at 2x that's
funny ah I can't listen to podcast
unless there's an audio speed control so
I'm glad you out of that well now you
can uh yeah so I think probably the only
thing i would change is you know it
might might be nice to see like when you
click here to have a drop down and when
you click here this is just a mute and
unmute uh I don't know what did we have
before did we have well dad just the
default volume control for the browser
which is fine it works but yeah so we're
thinking only thing we're missing is
just a volume slider yeah which show
right back at some point yeah it might
be something we can find and copy paste
in or something copy pasta yeah all
right I don't know I say ship it it's
good enough we we added some function
are we lost a little but i think the a
difunctional is good cool yeah we can
create a little issue for creating a
volume slider cuz that's if I thought we
will want to add yeah come on and just
zoom thing numbers in being it seems to
be in the right spot oh let's see okay
so we'll come back over here poor quests
urge firm issue new issue
oh yeah Rob yeah I guess he goes by rob
rob carter alright so that looks good
and so like I don't I haven't touched um
cucumber forever hmm but my thought was
maybe we could work on that a little bit
today wait um and so if we want to see
it in action we just do right now just
meteor deploy podcast not meteor jazz
club and then you can actually like i
said i love the way you can deploy with
this meteor deploy we say oh like that
because i'd be lovely i can just point
it at the settings file and i'll read it
and make sure it gets set as the
environment variable everybody should do
that why don't they I don't know I still
don't take the time to think about that
process I guess I think you can no mop
mop tells you to set it in his motto
JSON file hmm so I don't know everyone's
got their own best practices they stick
to it that's a pretty simple right there
let's see if we can see a hot code push
baby boom there goes ah look that lovely
awesome Oh yep there it is the thought
of my screen too yeah oh yeah awesome
sauce awesome alright so yeah my
thoughts are here well you know we did
talk about maybe doing an audit on the
packages that we have installed to
maybe we should start that real quick
before we add any more it's not playing
for me on big boy though oh really yeah
I don't think it seemed like when i
click the episode it's not playing for
sure it's working for me I'm good oh
that's weird we'll have to cross browser
test as well oh are you using Chrome no
I was trying to Firefox all right I
don't think I can't yeah I get that at
the seller on Chrome okay yeah it's not
working for me on firefox I can hear it
now on your and sorrow interesting oh I
don't think I can oh yeah I can use it
here okay sees 40 yeah okay it's working
in Safari so it's just not working in
firefox interesting okay so probably
just some kind of a cross-browser thing
we gonna all right cool nice submit that
was it still there's a new issue yeah
weird maybe we're missing like a WebKit
coal or something on the CSS I don't
know ought to look into it I guess I'm
gonna keep referencing him maybe he'll
fix it for us yeah snakey snakey
okay haha good stuff nah no no way all
right yeah so let's just look through
the packages real quick so dot meteors
packages so we're definitely using
stylist bootstrap 3 font awesome IRA
matter clearly we're using spin
CoffeeScript sure no we're not using
simple form anymore are we no because we
don't have any me performs I think we
took it out because of the little yeah
yeah how much forget the name of it and
yeah now that we're auto importing the
episodes 7 listen user accounts right we
don't we totally don't need user
accounts anymore either or accounts
password all the data is coming you're
right again yeah I'd here I see no
reason for that all right we should
build more apps this way hahaha no ye
third it's almost like a little like
we've created a micro service here right
like she's a micro service that consumes
a an API and show some data in a way and
like the main service lives over a
simple cast which I don't know maybe
gets expensive for me but whatever Oh
media removed josho and simple form yeah
but simple I guess symbol cats does a
lot of stuff for you automatically that
would be a pain to do on your own yeah
so you know the funny part is i've
written a code before right so i had a
previous podcasting platform that I
build nose open source and
and it was all done a meteor but mainly
it's like generating the RSS feeds and
handling file uploads and that kind of
stuff is what you're what you have to
deal with their okay which isn't
terrible but at the same time like I
don't know I think this is the way I'll
go forward with like adding podcasts um
mongols fine we don't need roles anymore
right a lame no role don't need roles
account password yeah alright so with
remove and add you can I don't know if
you knew this but you can actually
specify multiple packages you know I
don't ever do it by the command line I
just go to the file and just delete it
no listen trusting yeah here cuz we use
them it's fast yeah then the doctor then
typing it in that's true dddd so huh it
didn't like warned me to auto refresh
the file or anything that was sweet all
right meteor run oh and as a side note i
did send you the a simple code to add
tea mug spain resizing oh yeah oh yeah
look at you you asked me earlier how to
yeah i just did manually i don't know
how to do it the equally if there's one
so you just click the number here oh and
then if you want like to highlight a
section you just hit shift and okay
click the other number house so my face
yeah I lily I couldn't it's like it's
intuitive but it's not intuitive to you
realize that like clicking the number
does it like I think I degree when the
feature came out i think i read the blog
post or something but uh well there you
go yeah and so it's nice and basically
all it's doing is just adding the
hashtag up there with the line numbers
highlighted I'm
they picked that up down below your nap
great oh yeah nice okay so resize the
pain can you uh okay so basically you
just hold down shift and hit the down
arrow key like you'll just hit the arrow
key repeatedly till you get it the size
you want mm-hmm that's just a terrible
yeah that's not generate all right all
right so we audited those packages and
removed them and we broke some crap go
figure probably is the router and I'm
guessing oh we might have one of those
routes that redirects you yeah on before
this guy aha there you go and then on
problem we don't need new episode
anymore either do it I thought you had
to remove that in a pull request you not
busy haha okay maybe not yeah all right
we'll take those out still breaking
scrap oh yeah we don't need uh guess we
can just straight I love deleting code
man that's the best it's like I was
telling my sister I was like bleeding
code is like you go into room with like
a bunch of nice glass stuff that took a
long time to build and then just break
it yes it feels good the car Oh what did
we break here app server server Jess how
much get podcast why would that break oh
jeez I forgot to start it with the
settings game in this is killing me you
gotta you gotta do the up arrow
verified it yeah apparently once you
started from it takes it takes a while
that's weird there we go I hit the wrong
one uh good looks like a new page such
as life all right what's that a no call
of undefined why is that undefined
cannot call method call what point where
we calling call right fine HTTP called
medio de Chile HTTP package wait that's
not a backdated a package yeah it's a
package I don't think I deleted it uh
where we are wonder if we're getting it
because of something else uh uh oops top
meteor packages yeah we were getting it
because of something else just what
we'll use the Colby method yeah man it
works yeah someone asked me that the
other day uh like can you just edit that
file directly it's like yeah actually
you can there's no real downside because
when it starts it should detect so
normally when you do the meteor add it's
gonna download it right then but if you
just add it to this file it's gonna go
out and grab look through that file and
then grab anything it doesn't have any
way so mm-hmm um it's kind of nice all
right so we're back to running there we
go removed
some packages I'm feeling a little
better about that now we don't have to
punch a pai random stuff we don't need
ya price slim down the size to the flow
yeah Jess I thought someone post on I
don't know like the forums or reddit or
something about him being habla de may
be removed the jQuery dependency from
meteor so that was interesting yeah I
could be big one though I think by
default like when you run a meteor app
the minified size of the j s j s balla
code is like half a meg by default
without adding any other packages or
doing anything else no and so that's
kind of large it would be nice to maybe
get that a little smaller lot of things
happen in there for sure what is okay
and it's the removed all that code all
right what is that one fixes number 93
push it a guy up well what oh oh gosh
look at me look lovely totally in the
wrong spot get check out master get pull
oranje master and then BAM could check
out audio controls get log this is so
stupid I can't believe I did this so we
grabbed the show what I can do is go
back to master another we're up to date
and just to get cherry pick give up go
and it'll just pull that one coming over
for us
get push origin master what is
cherry-pick do I've seen that before but
it's just pulling one commits basically
okay okay just think of it as like you
know if you're going to cherry pick out
of a list of tickets to work on you're
just picking the one that you want to
work on right right it's kind of the
same thing there that's you know that's
actually what I did the other day we
were working on that that project
together and like your branch got behind
the merged like master version and so I
just went in cherry picked like your
three commits over instead life yeah it
can be like really simple or really
complicated depending on what yeah
totally agree totally agree um alright
so now we want to do you know what let's
uh no not want creator died o.o so like
I'm missing all those auto complete urls
now that I had to reset my browser
history that's annoying oh it slowly
building back up so annoy you see like I
type CR and it assumed craigslist like
who know their craigslist haha i know oh
boy actually uh I've had some good luck
using craigslist i sold my pc on there
oh my gosh we put up our couch the other
day i'm like i don't i don't even
understand how the scam works but this
is the second time we've put it up and
they contact you and they're like oh
well you know I I can't make it there
because I work on a construction site
and I can't get away it's like over a
two hour drive so I you know I'm gonna
I'll send you the the cash via paypal
and then I'll have a shipper come pick
it up and I'm like I don't I don't even
understand how this game works like are
they just gonna like try to refund
like issue like a refund through paypal
after they get the couch or I think they
can do that yeah I just talkin like but
whatever like no no cash in person yeah
exactly you don't don't take any
anything from out of towners on
craigslist no way he's stupid so I was
looking here I wanted to take a look at
this we talked about this on the last
podcast 64 and I just wanted to kind of
see it's been a while oh that that's a
CSS file right there 100 when I copy it
it's like black on black for what so I
add cucumber which should give us
everything we need yeah um there's Adam
it does it automatically I'd like
velocity though and all that I believe
it does I guess it'll tell you right now
yeah jun 11th sup dates from a couple
days ago oh I see so Sam's changed how
some of this is work that's why I'm
looking at this post rather than like my
own post cuz ya yet it oh you still
there oh boy downloading packages and I
think Kobe froze as a result
here we go get the packages hey uh yeah
my internet like random lady feed for a
second oh I thought it maybe it was me
so I just uh I switched to my wired
Ethernet what happened to the view oh
there there we go okay oh those word
zoom you're weird yeah yeah my my view
went from one monitor to the other
radiantly yeah how you do that yeah well
the little so like I I've got the main
monitor over here that I'm sharing with
you and then over here like I've got the
video of you and I talking back and
forth which I think overlays on the
recorded video um but it's like uh like
all of a sudden I disappeared out of
that all right bless you these eyes need
my head off hahaha what I was looking
this great i totally missed it that
would have been awesome then we watch
our video just for that yeah oh there it
is look we're talking about mistyping
meteor and the cameron i just did it oh
don't forget them setting oh god I did I
did it
uh goodness oh and I can't like it
wasn't an easy one to up enough don't
you love that like you get to the point
where you up arrow so much you didn't
really see many typing yeah that's why I
that's why I have to t splits on my team
ugh mmm one for the server and then the
one for everything else that way I want
to worry about that i can always up here
there we go so no matter how many get
stuff I do yeah yeah I so I was doing
that for a while but then I felt like
they were hard to read like having two
splits at the bottom hmm so I don't know
I'm still not so you know sometimes what
I'll do is like if I'm going to do some
get stuff like that is i'll i'll do i
can have a hockey to open a new split or
lame or not only or vertically so i'll
just do like control aah and it'll make
a horizontal split I'll do all the
command line stuff and then I'll close
that that pain so the way I did it
before is that hit ctrl z right here and
just do it in this window and then just
foreground the them again because that's
like kind of my big window so I don't
know like I'm I'm still I felt so I've
got a so i can do control aah and it
creates a new vim start a new team up
split and then i can do if i want to be
big I can do control AZ and it zoomed
the team up split and then I can do all
this stuff and then I can just do like
control a X and it closes at pain nice
so yeah I'd like a lot but it's really
simple one yeah I should remember all j
but like doing a new vertical splits
like aa double quotes that's like I
don't know yeah I got a lot of ideas
from up case they have a really good I
guess p Pope or some guy over there he's
got all kinds of cool videos that like
show you his his team buck setup and
kind of walks you through like some
really cool
ideas for commands so absolutely cool
idea is there any way that's random
talking sessions yeah you just can all
see I can't spell haha I use I use
spellcheck to fix it all before i posted
a man that's what technology for right I
guess makes me look like genius alright
so we got blasty installed it looks like
it's running um but does it not a little
oh yeah yeah it comes with all I met
baller cool yeah I remember last time I
try to use it with a big green dot yeah
well and then on top of that i'm pretty
sure they've they've made it I don't
know if it's movable Luhnow and put
green yeah well it's blue when it's
running it's green or red when it
finishes and so because I don't have any
tests course it's not yeah babe so I
just I had a simple tests you don't
hockey for that I'm sure there is right
stead of pushing it oh that's a terrible
hockey but it's ? okay so generally i
don't know if you know this if you go on
like into gmail or you go into like I
think github even does it like when you
do ? it pulls up the hockey window to
show you what the possible hotkeys our
anchor thing I don't know that that's
cool yeah so when you go and is like oh
god I can't even go to gmail yeah man
I'm in chrome they should they should
assume no man i need to send you an
invite inbox oh I yeah I've got inbox
but I was just showing you the do I'd be
what you think okay yeah
it's so cool but yeah I pulls up my my
hot Keith for VIN iam mmm I you I used
them for the browser oh nice yeah so yes
they did they did hockey but it's the
the ? so interesting so I would call a
hunter 3 matza I don't know if they'll
work my vinian would probably overwrite
it so i don't i don't know if i need to
do this or not um this makes me sad well
yeah we're not maybe we are getting
there let sugar browser console we are
lawfully refit a check air huh expected
string and God undefined the debt from
like default code that they added yeah
does it so I see check check well
obviously core I like that there's one
that's called maybe audit argument eggs
maybe we'll do it yeah we're up to it
alright so let's see what guy had it
into test maybe that'll help us fixtures
yeah I don't I don't think that's what
we're calling now or what's throwing the
air test cucumbers features simple
feature oh wow this is like a little
more in depth here keep an eye on my new
user let's all look like in our step
definitions so if you're not familiar
with how cucumber works you you define
English features on the left there in
your feature file and then on the right
these individual lines like the given
when thenns translate over to the steps
on the in the right hand javascript file
mm-hmm and so it uses some fancy regex
and to do the matching for you and it
will call the right method and so like
in this one given i'm a new user just
calls reset which in this case does
nothing um and then yeah give a nine a
viennese I'm like oh my god I gotta like
you reg ex for every single test no
actually you don't have to that's the
good thing so like if I well we probably
won't see it but if I comment that out
it'll actually say like hey we can't
find a matching step and it'll spit out
some regex based on the left hand you
know that the English over here it'll
spit out your reg ex for you and so
anything that's in quotes it will treat
is a variable um in your reg ex and then
okay well that people Astle Matt yeah I
think I think like the one time I like
to keep Kumar was like I'm not gonna say
here and do reg ex for everything no you
really don't have to so they are the
only time you'd have to really kind of
dig into it is if you don't like what
it's what its output in its ok fair
enough that's cool um I don't know I did
you like let's let's go look and see if
we can find this air
somewhere maybe there's a velocity issue
for it so it doesn't seem to go away
even after hmm yeah so I'm gonna maybe
we try restarting one more time so I'm
guessing it's trying to reset the
velocity results and somehow that didn't
work right so if if if you understand
how velocity works uh it's like it's got
its own collection that lives in the app
and people can report back like it'll
decide that hey here's some tests and
then it says like oh hey cucumber needs
to run this one it'll start a mirror
it'll run that and then cucumber reports
those results back and they get shoved
in the database and so I think maybe it
was having trouble for some reason
reporting back in for some reason it's
still not running our tests at all
though hmm so do i need to test cucumber
yeah MPM install right here it looks
like that happen automatically though
because that didn't actually do anything
huh let's see if it works look the
mirror and so mirrors just uh it's like
a separate version of our app that runs
and it's been instrumented with all the
velocity and cucumber stuff so it can
actually run the tests hmm well
I guess the next step is to check this
cucumber log and put that over here oh I
guess we don't need the cat already had
tail on it hey Cooper is running oh so
you did actually run that time yeah so
there you go there's the art see how it
spits the giddy of the pep you need yeah
so I guess the major shift here is that
this stuff used to spit out into the
main console and they're not doing that
anymore and I think maybe part of that
reason is because you get this this
funky Croft here on your like the time
stamp on the front of this yeah so it's
kind of Norah Lee to like copy and paste
yeah and so maybe maybe the better thing
is just to have like this running log
kind of off to the side somewhere and
the team looks so we can see what's
happening and so if I uncomment this guy
up top mm-hmm save again we should get
the actual failure we want given the
either there we go I am Santa panty so
the way that i would put this is given I
am a visitor Victor
told you I can't spell the other thing
here that's interesting is that by
default it's only going to run this dev
tag by default yeah so when you're in
dev mode you put the dev tag on what
you're working on and only run that test
and so it's running like all death ya
have it run the important one for the
toast but doesn't go flow right and so I
think I can say Duchess test here and it
may do the right thing and run all the
tests for us oh okay and same thing the
ignored tag will be completely ignored
got it so cucumber is a form of like in
to end testing correct yeah yeah so
we're able to basically it's going to
load up the cucumber I think but a full
it's using you can use things Ombey is
the default but I don't we're not using
zombie or maybe using um it's it's
something else what's a cold butts just
like a headless browser um github van
come right me II that's right ha
webdriver so in web web driver has a
version that works with phantom but you
could also switch it out for selenium or
sauce labs then I think there's maybe
more integration than that but you'd
have to look at webdriver to figure out
and so it's got a good API here that you
can take a look at and these are all the
calls that we kind of get access to all
right and this is the headless browser
api thing right okay yeah and so by
default like you said it's using phantom
under the covers and so this is all
being set up for us but yeah you can see
right here we can tell it to use chrome
instead if we want to do and it would
fire a chrome version and use that to
run that's cool yeah or cylindrical you
don't want to do that could that be flow
right yeah yeah yeah well I mean you can
and then the other cool thing is you can
use something like sauce labs and tell
it to load and ie you know and it'll
it'll should theoretically run the same
tests in that browser so there we go
nice so when I did the dash test test
you can see it actually ran all three
scenarios okay and that's kind of
expected so the first thing I'm gonna do
is let's get rid of honestly all these
can go away so do you like to personally
start with like doing a couple indian
test and then dive into like unit stuff
or how do yeah yeah so the way i always
approach it is you do Golden Path
testing and that's just like that's a
fancy way to say it's the best way to
describe this so if your CEO is going to
give a presentation he's pitching for
money what are gonna be the features
that he's going to show off during that
presentation on the live application and
that's the crap you want to test right
okay with your end to end because you
always want to make sure that works
before you deploy it oh yeah I'm sure
that's the main way I would think about
it for sure that's kind of how you will
do your test coverages you just it's
just like kind of logical like start
with the most important stuff first yeah
and then work your way down Bailey right
yeah okay let me that's fairly so I
think maybe the funky thing for us is
the fact that we have an external
dependency and so Sam gets all technical
and he calls it like a boundary and this
is where you want to draw a boundary
between like your
someone else's code basically or like a
dependency on the internet so like the
API code that you wrote we'd probably
want to write like uh basically what
amounts to like a fake or stub or
something but the good thing is I think
in looking at the time i'm guessing want
to do this next time um we're gonna
we're gonna have to like have it will
use the HTTP interceptor that's what
it's called to to grab that that data
and then we'll fake out the calls at
that point and we can return like one
piece of podcast data and then like
everything should function and we should
get a podcast on the page and then we
can start testing some stuff or we could
we could fake out too so that way we can
make sure the switching is working
correctly and all that kind of stuff
okay so i think the things we care about
are one the page is loading with the
data from the episode so we actually i
think we can do better than that we
don't have to fake it we can we can just
insert some fixtures like two episodes
into the database or something mm-hmm
and then we don't yeah I don't know I'm
kind of curious about all this now yeah
I played a lot of ways too so about it
well I'm wondering if this Synchron is
actually running as kind of what I was
thinking my head um right okay so
basically like in the mirror yeah
because the mirror doesn't it its own
days yeah yeah so what what you can do
to is just grab this URL here and load
this up and it'll work just like your
meteor app but it's just been okay with
the velocity stuff to make a loner of me
waiting for local host
you're right yeah it's started the proxy
but it's not fully running yeah there we
go now it's running there there we go
dang yeah so we actually already have
all the data but so the problem here
becomes if we write a test that looks
for learning and teaching all things
meteor right here like this top tag as
soon as I deploy a new version that
tests gonna start family so we want like
a you want to stop that outcome how
right or yeah yeah well honestly we
probably just want to stub it and not we
can either return the data that we want
or we could just tell it to just stop it
don't return anything and then just do
fixtures ourselves either I think either
way works fine but yeah that'll probably
be our next step and then so let's just
get we get like one stupid test working
maybe we can look for like this right
here okay justice just a self productive
yes just to have a passing test our
hello world 10 yes essentially so it's
an h1 tag so thought is work kind of
like a like a jquery type of thing or uh
sort of so you get this this client call
here that's available to us and that's
basically the webdriver object and so we
can say like we're saying wait for the
body something in the body to be visible
right so we have wait for visible
there's another one to act active may be
visible yeah I don't remember okay so I
see a comment is talking about it uses
some webdriver yeah ati two
chain into okay so I don't know where a
good title is coming from maybe that's a
webdriver call well yeah if it's
chaining its training from the webdriver
call right because a the way it was a
dot so Cindy tility wonder if there's a
dash documentation for web tremor oh
that would be awesome I need a I need to
get dash you know it's cool so recently
I added dash to them so like if I was
looking at what you were looking at I
can push spacebar d and it would it
would just go to the dash documentation
for what I was mouse over oh really yeah
and then if I want to like do whatever I
want I can do like base bar shift D and
then type in the word that I want to
look up and dash and it'll look it up
how does it know like dash just knows
you're a meteor or it just looks through
like all the different so it's just a
little simple plugin i installed in vim
and and i just signed the hockey that
says to call it just opens dash with the
right I guess safety i'll call or
whatever so are you specifying somehow
that it's meteor or web driver yeah like
it'll it'll use the file name i think so
like if I made a javascript file and I
hit spacebar d on a like you know map or
something like that it'll go look up map
for JavaScript basically and you know if
it didn't look up the right thing it's
literally just click it and change it
mm-hmm I don't know if you have used ash
before no i haven't i don't own it it's
only like okay so much really yeah i
like you can use it for free it's just
annoying because you got to wait like
six seconds well free Dora I guess I
should try yes I mean like you can try
and like you'll be like okay I want this
how to waiting
yeah it's useful like some i use it kind
of i'm still I'm still getting the hang
of it so I used to kind of half and half
you know sometimes I'll go look stuff up
in google but honestly dash actually has
a google search inside of it i just had
to get the hang of not just going to
google so i'm getting i'm using it more
and more lately anyway let's try bro so
the metra stuff seems to have changed a
little bit as well the mattress like the
that you're used to using our change
yeah like she's got that get title
should become which i think is some of
the promise stuff he's done and i don't
i don't think the kid title is part of
get title annum I don't think it's part
of a meeting webdriver selenium Oh thing
you have to do oh yeah it is okay good
time on it okay yeah so we can just do
get text do we need the callback it's
optional okay call back gets call when
the command finishes okay so based on
this we should just be able to say get
text just give it all this
now if we just target this right I think
we could just say H one right here
because realistically we should only
have one on the page so if that's not
true then I'm gonna fix that as well
because it's an SEO thing so this is all
right so give text so this is basically
like instead of using jquery this is
kind of like its own version of it
essentially yeah so i think under the
covers i use something like cross paths
selector or whatever but yeah it's just
it's just coming straight from webdriver
allowing us to do things yeah cuz it
looks the same as jquery just instead of
dollars on its get texts and there's
like there's there's more to it though I
felt guy you can target things in
different ways not just like jQuery
selector ways okay okay that make sense
I wonder if they really talk about that
in the temple example Phil selectors
here we go so you can do this CSS query
you can do you can see here you can do
like this is gonna work off link text
you could do that and then here is the
xpath stuff so you could use selectors
like this to 0 which is ugly and weird
and yeah I just yeah not my saying it
could be a little masochistic for that
one huh I guess okay all right so high
but I don't all kind of like a huge
bullet XD has no method j 0 should be so
i deleted the B unbe that's confusing
deleted the letter B off the word be
I'll still get a huge wall of text in it
what up now let's see
wow this is really big that's quite nice
honey bee of object is not a function Oh
what are we returning we go back get
text ah probably does not return what
we're expecting it to return so get
title huh get text looks like it should
also work similarly how are you using be
I should be this client wait for visible
get tix should oh you know what is it's
not sure dot bees it it's no no it
should be become i think is what it what
it's a diff oh we don't we'll get a diff
because we haven't rented that code hmm
i think it was become somehow like my
them messed it up that is that part of
cucumber all green uh yeah no I'm
guessing that's part of Sam's cucumber
like to become so I was trying to pull
this is like his his fork of it
essentially for meteor so I'm not going
to say for sure that that's the truth
but I think maybe that's the truth
because he's wrapped everything up to be
a look at that yeah so you can tell it
to run in like Firefox or Chrome or
whatever sweet I wonder huh he's gotta
have a cucumber she is
no there's cucumber and dash here so
what I'd like to figure out is uh maybe
not sauce labs but they've got ya this
Abbi um mm-hmm so this allows you to
like do device testing as well oh well
yeah so I'd like to figure out how to
get this working as well because then
you'd be able to test your Cordova
application and you can like I mean I
simulate all kinds of stuff which I
think would be crazy awesome to like
hook it up so that it's like generating
your Cordova half firing and a peon and
then like doing all this stuff that'd be
helpful for multiple read them yes I'm
which is enough Cordova yes you and I
are working on a project together for a
client that's using Cordova so that's
why we're interested yeah for anyone
wondering oh there's actually Cordova
for dash interesting oh nice yeah
there's a lot of thing they don't have
but you can add more but so did they
have the webdriver stuff they didn't
have webdriver I oh but okay I have to
look up there I think there's a way to
like add stuff I just don't know how it
works yet no I have to look that up
interesting vodka yeah all right um yeah
so like I I think this is good enough
for today right like we've got ya we
have our packing cat yeah and so then
we'll we'll dig in next time like I
think we've gotten over all this cruft
of like getting everything about so
we'll work on faking out the call the
Synchron call may be returning data we
care about I think to me that that at
least tests that particular path without
having to go right like normally I'd
write unit tests to make that work
um so yeah but we'll figure that out
next time and then we'll do tests to
make sure like the episodes are showing
and then if we get far enough maybe we
can like click the play button and make
sure that I don't know I don't know if
we have a test for like is audio playing
um right and then wow that's interesting
too because yeah I guess we would just
test for the existence of the audio
player ah because the file would be on
the internet still and I don't know that
I want to like put a file into our
fixtures right now well if that's super
interesting ah yeah because I mean we
just need to figure out a way to say hey
this thing is getting this data that it
needs like the most important thing is
that and you can click it and it will it
will pull that that particular audio
file up into the player yeah up into the
top like loaded and the audio file yeah
mmhmm yeah so we'll probably just will
put will put one of the files and we'll
put like a sample file in public or
something I don't know we'll figure this
out there so cool alright sounds fun
like we get some stuff to think about
yeah and the other thing I'll do off
camera is probably hook this up to like
Travis CI and have it run our tests on
commit and then and then we'll have you
know like if the builds green we're
going to go and then like it'll start
doing the same thing on polar class so
as we start to build up a test suite we
start to do kind of pull request then
we'll know you know did ditch break
something you know on that kind of room
so nice that'd be good too alright
thanks for tuning in everyone and I'd
say we'll be back next week but you know
I don't know I we can't have a timeline
until I start up
these things that would be good we
should probably we should probably get
on that yeah all right well thanks for
tuning in we will have more I think this
is this has been a fun project so tune
in next time I guess this video has been
in space dojo production you can click
the learn more button to find out more
about us at space dojo com or inkless
the subscribe button to get notified
about new videos who put out each week
