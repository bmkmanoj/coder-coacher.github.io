remote cough given to a live audience in
February 2016 this video was made
possible by sponsors like modulus I oh
ok grow calm and space dojo calm if you
would like to find out more information
about upcoming conferences be sure to go
to conf crater on Io and put your email
in the form that pops up in the lower
left corner enjoy the video alright so
welcome back to the second day of Crater
cough super excited it was pretty
awesome yesterday had some great talks
if you haven't yet be sure to go back
and you can use those same links and
rewatch that the talks so the videos are
up pretty instantaneously afterwards for
rewatching and then just another piece
of housekeeping I just wanted to say
thank you to modulus and ok grow they
sponsored space camp and you know they I
just like their sponsors of this by
extension right like the the idea for
this came out of the idea for Space Camp
and I do plan on having a Space Camp
2016 and I'll be announcing that later
but you know I just big thanks to them
they support a lot of my work so check
them out modulus die oh and okay crow
calm i believe so without further ado I
think everybody knows this guy Aaron Oda
ah he's going to be giving a talk on
graph ql if you're not familiar he runs
a company called Khedira and if you're
seriously not familiar with that like
there's probably something wrong with
you welcome era nada okay thanks for
having me yeah yeah yeah
right so how do you start like you can I
start you yeah just have at it you can
share your screen and yeah yeah let me
share my screen okay right okay how
about now lights can you see the screen
now there it's coming in okay all right
we see it okay cool like source so I was
actually thinking about a name for this
talk so I think something graphically
the culture is something that good with
install so basically I'm not trying to
teach you graph key well with this talk
like I'm trying to share my experience
with graph cool and how I get into graph
ql and how our team's reaction when i
introduced draft able to Khedira so so
there's the whole thing behind the store
and then ow ow experience sharing and
then at the end I'm talking about free
active gras ql so that's something that
mdg is working on right now so let's get
started okay right so okay i will talk
about that so so this is something i
actually i shared like around seven
months back so actually this is when
like Facebook release the graph quail
spec and then I share on Carter like say
create graphical seems like an overly
complex solution so this is me talking
right and then because at the time I
really don't like Rockwell because I
think that's because it just expect so
there's no tutorial look kind of thing
and then the Slav actually are asking
you so Carrie elaborate now you say like
that and actually I gave some optional
answers as well so you can check this
link I actually does sure Google graph
to a cracker and then you can see this
quick and the reason that I hate craft
you back then as i said earlier because
so there is no good tutorial i think
there's a reason and the time md this is
looking at graph we will as well so they
are really like interest about crackly
well and I now we really know like that
MGD is doing with graph girl so so
that's this thing okay then now so
sometimes when I started like that but I
really don't know how so when it when it
happens I think it's when the Brock will
actually to clear release a the
graphical J's library facebook I think
that's the same time they announced
relay aspect so that's the reason I
think I started looking at roughly well
I tried to see so plus this new thing so
that's my language that's the place I
think I started liking so then I created
some apps so they're basically server
side abs less I to create some craft
google schemas and then try to call it
from HTTP servers then try to cause a
long bout bullets just playing around
the graph cool and trying to see but
these monsters like and I really really
like that the schema definition and the
self documentation sir there are a lot
of cool stuff in graphical gives even
though it's so mad I like so you have to
write your own type and this is very
happy life is feel like very icky it's
not something very simple like very cool
with right media but i still like that
because so there are it's really cool
like this reason the day now so i'll
talk about like something wrong and so
then I I realized like so the there's
one thing actually graphically
dismissing this is because graphical is
a very cool technology but so the
learning like guides and the tutorials
are not very I think they are not quite
good so that's not quite good mean like
they become comprehensive there are a
lot of things but they are not alike
actually like so you need to go to very
hard details and so on so I try to
create learn graphic aware so this is
online course that available today you
can learn crafts where and this is so
basically i created to teach my own
don't like my they can learn about graft
well and so on then i put it to our
these web apps then everyone can learn
and actually it was a really good model
I because there are I think are right
now there are more than 10,000 people I
will not talk with to this course and I
think I think that's really good so then
so then I have a good like little dot
graph cool then I I teach everyone else
so company to like go through this one
Nana and try to do stuff okay then so
then we try to then I'm going to try to
use graph will at Madeira I won't like
API down I wanted to a PSN saw so before
going into that then let me talk about
up Sajida the API because so that's the
cheap this talk and actually there is no
public API at graph khedira and so
there's a one API actually that talks
with the kuvira client side and then the
back end so this problem on meteor so
this based on DDP so its focus on the QA
component and there is no like kind of
API kind of thing is totally is some
meteor method so we try to get data and
so and the thing is our some of the
microscope zeiss i use in this 80s well
so just kind of bad design because we
don't have a centralized API but so we
don't need to rework stuff that's why we
use this this meteor UI as the our API
as well and it works at some point but
then it started to lie lie started not
to work because the hair is like you
might have seen like Carol L system is
broken like there are some false
positive
kind of thing that's because of this
level then I was going down the UI app
is going down a whole whole whole other
stack also going down because that's not
something actually they need to have
them you are thinking about way to like
use something amount an area so that's
the time actually be actually work with
graft where and then trying to mix that
with our API so let's see how how we do
that so so none of the problem is
casillas API is based on GDP the problem
is there is no documentation because he
just be been that for the UI and we
don't want it to document that this I
don't know the reason because we don't
want to maintain a separate
documentation for that so so it's very
poorly documented and it's based on DDP
so you need a state put connection any
and it's based on Jason because so the
reason is Jason there is no straight
schema so that's that's one of the
problem we have with our API so then so
we try to think about how to use cadre
povs graph giver and then thing is so
it's self documented so the graph giver
we can have self document read like a PS
you can see about this the screen so
here's our the graphical ID so then we
have documentation right inside our like
that's inside our schema because this
documentation is is built into the code
so you don't need two writers writers
documentation our own and then it has a
schema like we have like everything here
like so so very simple like so
everything is here like it's very easy
to use and sometimes it's very hard to
like write the types and this ski mask
but after you have done in so everything
is very simple very easy and then so the
one of the key idea of a graph ql is
efficient data fishing but actually we
are not using graph google for that
purpose because you're using web sockets
and then the
the claim that graph girl is trying to
do with efficient data Beijing is it's
not very true biggest so it may observe
good why you can fetch you can call
anytime you want and you can get the get
up on the circuit and there is no
overhead when medical then using
multiple HTTP connection because you
have a secure connection with the server
and so you don't really care about that
so we don't want that actually it's not
a feature they're looking at so the
thing actually they are looking at
graphical is is self documentation and
the schema so that's very powerful and
that's what we use it out of our a ba
Cali and then so we didn't wanted to
like like like convert everything in
Khedira as the like as a graph whole
graphic web project and actually they
don't have resources for that so it's a
small team and becomes spend too much
time on like R&amp;amp;D projects like this
right so then so so we wanted to like
change or alert system this is freely
broken so then you need to fix that so
then we thought like okay let's build
the subset of our API that this the
alert system as a craft will API so then
we pick some of our sub set up ap is
subset of like a PS staff from the saga
you either i have imagined here yeah and
then we convert that into the graph
google api so to pick a simple wrap way
around our existing code and we didn't
like work too hard on not on making it
so finish ship the our API and it was
really great and then I have work with
some of our members at Khedira to build
this one and the thing is everyone liked
it because so so creating scheme ice
sometime very kind of hard but once you
creating the creators team is very proud
because the the reason by everyone loved
graph UL is not just the schema the
documentation no no no that's not
because they like graph
you because of this ID is a graphical so
because this graphical is like all
online ID prograf to L so you can
actually connect with your own API as
well so that's the reason everyone like
started to like graph Yogi's so that's
really amazing that I can show you two
let's have them all right ok all right
ok ok ok now we had like cuddle so so
don't read oh this URL right because you
can't even even though it's online then
you can access that right this is our
appt since this is something like I'm
trying to access also let's say let's
clear this one so I need to get some
information about our uh trap so let me
toast coffee DFID this is how are you
ready then I need to get some
information about my app so there's a
email is a field goal media pinto put
that pirates auto completing right and
then I need to get to release ok release
and just spread click black today okay
okay the reason it so it okay there's
something I need to provide like this is
something you know API and see you don't
need to worry about that then I can get
the the release version of the app so
then I need to get the whole the
packages and I have to get the name so
you can see so I can get those stuff as
well because so in order to get these
information in order to use this API I
didn't want it to lie look at any
documentation so because it's already
they out of completed and it's very very
powerful and let's say I need to let's
try something else let's try get the CP
juices that Khedira okay okay I'm not a
question or collects is CPU maybe system
matrix
is the metric type is I think its CPU
okay yeah at CBU and then it's quite
okay see like I can get the old cpu say
that khedira this is the time in dolls
so you can see why it's very very easy
to use like so then our team actually
created this API so they can simply
create the API they don't need to test
it with the first lip let us try to use
it this graphical ID and writers is
working and then after that yeah driving
tests so that's really important but
because that this is very visual I we
can see what's going on that and the
next thing is documentation so we can
attach documentation to eat this this
field is these parameters and everything
in graft where so for an example now i'm
looking at the so let's go back this is
our schema so we have root query kolkata
api and then go to app info so stills
but this app improve these f info
contains operations and package versions
and slop and then get other arguments
app ID host start time and trouble stop
and this this ! tip that app ID is
required so everything is there so i
don't need to like read any
documentation it's there so after we
have like go through this graphical ID
then i can copy the scoring and then I I
can use it our app so that's it just the
just coolest thing like the development
experience in graph here and that's
really valuable ok let's come back to
the slides ok right so that's the reason
actually really like graph giggle okay
and then the next thing is now we have
some of our AP is is working with
graphical and working very well for us
and we shipped alert system and it's
working pretty well right now and there
are some features need to build back the
as the stabling stability like
looking pretty weather so we don't need
to worry about right now and then now we
are working on a new project called card
rajini sky like up the support system
working with like automated tools that's
that means that we are watching you or
your app at Khedira over twenty-four
seven and then we try to see the any
anything goes wrong yeah and then when
something goes wrong then we actually
have humans like up be self we actually
look at that and try to see a problem
sir try to the user is actually a
problem or not and then we try to like
fix them so that's cuz there Janie and
to do that you try to use shut up flight
data modeling data crunching and so on
I'm sorry and in order to do this you
say aim JW is lambda lambda functions so
that means them you need to use our
whole API so inside inside awh lambda so
that means like this is really good time
to convert our whole graph to a whole
other API into craftier and then they
start up that phone and everyone really
everyone really liked that project
because the fighting graphical schema
and trying to see it with graphical is
very very nice and then then that's the
time we introduced the approach angle
and local project is a like it's like
like simple client to access graph ql
data so it is compatible with you all
the transport layer comes with relay and
the old stuff introduced by Facebook and
it will loves you too Cory and the graph
ql AP is using very simple JavaScript by
pre you can use it on the server client
react native and everywhere it's not
very fancy you don't have very the cool
stuff like really have but you can still
you can still access and use it so Muse
lakay inside AWS lambda true to get the
chorus to get laid upon on our central
API hosted here
we're not considered is not publicly
available yet so we are trying to give
that as well ok so that's loca and that
that's how we create at that one that's
the reason for that and then the next
thing is so then we think about like so
now we have a API so our API all the
all the stuff that we have implemented
on the meteor API on DD b and then so
let's try to convert like wow of Khedira
you I to use this this new API graph
your labia so it was all so we try that
line we try that so it was a very big
project because there are a lot of
graphs in kenai you I and then we need
to like you to write in a lot of hours
on that and then the real question is do
we really need to do that is our UI is
working pretty well really like our
clothes it's working pretty well and
it's not buggies were written and so
there is no reason to like the rewrite
it using graph you were so then the
desired line even though we have so
there are two version of the API so they
don't need to rewrite it because it's
working like if something is working
fine then I don't think you need to
change it so that's the thing like so
that's then these are not to change the
cadre you I excusing the old stuff
what's working and all the new stuff
will be on graph here and that come
through the third rajini you I this code
Regina you are is the like we are trying
to like in the interface with the odd
rajini and then for that we are
considering is easy to graph will of
course we are using Dracula but they're
not sure which version it is like so are
we going to wait for reactive graph ql
of course we can't wait because it feel
like it will we'll talk about like six
month or maybe here to get the good
question and of course we don't want to
use freely and maybe we're using like
loca with the our media graphical
application project so that that's the
way how we can last
and after that we can of course move
into reactor graph given when it's
coming like when is working well to us
so that's our way of thinking how to use
like so you try to use when you're
working like when you are converting our
API is thinner to be used to use graph
do you try to see likes try to do a very
incremental approach so you don't want
it to like make a really big project
like trying to convert everything to
graph the f1's like we try to do at step
by step if something is working and we
don't really want it to change it just
keep it as it's like like that so when
you start try to use graphical and
that's that's the point and I think if
you're using a meteor app I think you
need to use crafty well sooner or later
because the with the reactive graphical
project that I'm gonna talk running in a
moment like so you so so it seems like
me tia is like trying to replace the
current staff DD be stacked with this
vector grass grow so so it won't be like
like p will be we will have growl DDP
maybe another 23 years but as compatible
a kind of thing and but the slight blaze
react kind of thing and actually the
reactive graphical is is built by a
midget s difference okay so so how are
we going to like directly jump into the
reactor graphical stuff or try to answer
some questions so of this cone over we
can we can do the craft ql stuff if you
want okay okay and then we enjoy some
crushed answer some question yeah but
there's there's quite a few questions if
you want to start with those I think we
cannot go with some questions and then
try to come back into the reactor
graphical okay so um
yeah that sounds good um been asked how
does graph ql interface with the
database yeah then you have to actually
there is no so you can actually use any
kind of NP module to interact with your
database there is no like restriction on
that so it's yeah you can use it any any
any any database any data source you
have well how do you like hook that up
to make it work right okay uh so shall I
show you some example yeah if you want
yeah I think let's go to Minecraft you
get I'm of course yeah you gotta share
your screen again oh ok sorry I closed
it ok ok right I don't know yep ok ok ok
so here's a question excusing drop ok
this one all right so like give me a
second I need to log into the this one
oh ok i right ok it's an example like so
mutations ok it is one so here like
they're trying to create a like cool
authors field line they trying to get
authors in this query and in order a
good it does the integrator resolve
function inside this resource function
we can use any kind of API like it
doesn't need to be like direct data base
connection it could be anything you need
to return some data so here I'm trying
to access the author's collection is a
MongoDB collection and I'm trying to
find some some data and then and make it
to array and I get Devon the data and
return is like well you can actually you
can actually a
use any kind of maybe it's the rest api
maybe it's a SQL database or anything so
you can use it any kind of data source
and simply return it so that's how graft
wheelies and there are and I if you
don't really understood this one try to
use this cause and I think to get an
idea how do you how to interact with any
kind of data source okay I think it's
clear okay um yeah that was good answer
what what are the use cases where a
graph ql would make the most sense ah so
grab your like and at right now so
graphically release is good for like if
you it's really good for everything
lights there is so if you need to like
make a lego creator some get some data
from the server you can actually use
graph ql to create an unlike interface
still like to let go wrong tribute to
your client at the server and make some
interface and you can get some data but
right now you if you want to do like
reactive stuff do you want like like to
do this thing that we meet the work with
them meteor so that's not something you
want to do right now because the
reactivation of graphical is not
available even there is the Facebook
casually some blog posts about how to do
subscription in graft um and it's
totally different from the writer the
substitution we have today so even
though so it's just love for there is no
solid implementation on that so I think
so if you want to get some data and
write some stuff to the data so you can
use graphical right now it's very really
good but if you want to like make your
application reactive and you need to
wait a bit so
okay oh all right we'll take a one from
David here okay so I'm gonna change a
little bit i'm gonna say you know you
showed us a slide where you said you
know you posted on critter and you said
this this looks over complicated too
hard like what was the hardest part for
you about learning or actually starting
to use graph 200k a dupatta spot for me
to like on the raft will query syntax is
fine this is fine the hardest part is to
trying to try to create the schema so
creating scheme is really complex
because if so so with meteor like you
can simply publish a cursor and it will
be available to the client but in order
to use crafty well you need to really to
depend some type on the server and it's
not simple like see you have to do
something and I think that's the kind of
barrier we are having right now and
there are some projects like you can use
like there are some there are some there
are some way to use access mongooses
schemas so the Mongoose is a ORM for
mongodb so you can use Mongoose schemas
you can convert them into like
intergraph ql schema right away and
there are some other projects to do that
wait like there's another one cause
equalizer I think there's a another no
JJ ORM so there are some projects out
there so they're not much stable so
there they were look like and then
they're not using so it's not widely
used and yeah that's thing so there are
some ways and i hope with with reactive
graphical for mdg and they are planning
to work on something very simple to use
yeah i think nice yeah me too I hope
they I mean they always put out a good
API for something so I've strong hopes
for that I am MLS switchbacks so people
can see us
alright another one from David is
killing it on the votes today when
moving from straight mongo queries to
graph ql what has been the biggest
improvement as far as data architecture
structure of your abs yeah okay I can
answer this thanks i really ask this
question because so right now so when
you're working with meteors like so the
server-side and client-side code i hold
these stays the same like you write your
methods the database code on the most
server and the client so actually when
Grant we can graph ql there is a clear
separation between the server and the
client so that means server-side
developers can and can work on the back
end they can do anything with the back
end so it's right now our how happy is
easy MongoDB and then later they get you
something else so then it's simply like
trying to also plug that into the schema
and they don't need to talk to the event
talk to the client side developers as
well so clients are apps stay the same
and they can change the back end and
then the same thing we can change the
client-side app to use anything and you
don't need to worry about the back end
and that's the the benefit we are
getting with graphically well it's not
like a it's like a benefit graph to it
has like it's not something but it it
forced us to do that so that's that's
real cool thing about graphing right
yeah I mean it's really interesting
right like I think that was actually a
goal of DDP but they maybe didn't like
it's been too closely tied to Mongo when
they were getting started and and so it
didn't didn't quite come out that way
yeah I didn't the problem with DD
reasons the not a problem like in DDP is
not there is no schema like so this is
just a protocol like so the protocol and
schema is two different things that's
the thing yeah yeah good point
alright so Elijah asks for meteor
minimal Viable products that's a
mouthful apps that are fairly small
scale would you recommend migrating to
using graph ql instead of meteor methods
or does graft you I'll make more sense
for large-scale apps okay it's sleeping
like it's depend on how you how you
define MVP so if you're trying to do a
prototype trying to try to build your
app within like within a day and graph
ql may not be the solution but if you
are trying to win the MVP that that's
like trying to like i'll try to make it
solid i'm trying to make it a future
hope that you are trying to improve it
working it and I think graphical is a
good choice but still we don't have
reactive graphic evaluation like it's
not cool kind of like this reactor graph
law and that that's a that's the thing
you need to like I think it is safe to
wait another six month until the image
is working with the they complete the
diversion topographical right now yeah
so if you're not not comfortable with it
graphically right now and try to use it
with the MVP especially with the like
apt like this special clients aware and
I don't recommend to use it if you're
not comfortable bit okay yeah i mean i
would i would probably echo those
sentiments as well right like if you're
building an MVP a chances are you're
trying to find product market fit and
you shouldn't waste time on you know
just try and trying to learn something
new and implementing it feels like you
almost have to implement that like
you're implementing that schema right
which is you have to have a bunch of how
this voting is going crazy you have to
implement a bunch of extra queries maybe
a little extra boilerplate yeah nah yeah
i think i need to talk on that because
the friday schema it's not not much
complex like
if you know how to do it like the
villain it correctly like Pride riding a
scheme i snort whicker's so so then you
talk about it like we don't have a lie
how very be back in like so you don't
now travel up like a couple of types
couple of streamers and working on that
one lying around like two hours maybe
few days is do something okay like but
the problem with big graph kill right
now Miss then you need to use relay or
maybe some kind of HTTP stop so there is
no like data binding stuff there is no
good I reactive stub there is no way so
working with mutation the trailer is
hard so there are some problems in that
it's not about rewinding the schema how
to use it with the client-side app so
that's that's the thing i have i want to
take yeah all right um what Wow okay
everybody's very on this one I
don't know I feel like someone's hacked
the voting system perhaps we'll take
will take Dennis question here this may
be the answer later in the talk or on
learn graph cure calm but is the idea
that graph ql replaces meteor methods
and subscribing to collection cursors
for example using the quick example you
showed querying answers what I wrap that
call and a meteor publish on a server
and return the results so I think maybe
this is alluding to the fact that
reactive graph ql will hopefully answer
a lot of these questions yeah then I I
think it's time to work when do you get
rigged up cool I'd like not oh momma
nice nice right then I we can come back
to this question up there okay all right
um so I I had a quick question like do
you implement an authorization at the
graph ql level then I yes ah 20 ABI like
you don't have a graph ql level
authorization because it's a simple HTTP
basically for the authentication to this
one and so and then there are very
simple way to do that so let me let me
share a link that you can learn our
graph us stuff graphical authentications
really fairly simply simple so it's
something similar to what we do with
making mistakes he could have me do give
me a minute sure yeah so if any one
watch Pete's talk yesterday he showed
how you know you can't like the
publication is where a lot of security
happens in media right now and I think
whenever you're publishing data you need
to think about who has access to that
data and that's why I kind of asked that
question look at in our so I'm going to
come into this this question and okay
this the simply paste the URL you can
you can go there and see how to do water
rushes and with graph ql so it is
something okay okay so it's very simple
like there are some examples there's a
blog post then you can refer to the left
whoa which I don't see the link where'd
you put it ah to the put a shadow some
no it's totally chat like is 20 quick a
comic I say come in okay yeah make sense
here we'll put it here to there you go
okay then let's go back to the
presentation jelly okay yeah okay
raclette mission screen
okay can you see the vision doesn't so
this is reactive Raphael so the
basically the reactive so let me let me
is so make this bit okay it's not
working so reactive graphical is
basically so here we have two clients
client a and client be and the client
they actually are is creating a graph
theory and then me he actually I asked
for some data to that query from a
server and this is a simple blog post
and we can get that block pose and see
comments and then another client and he
had a comment so we call it a mutation
and then that command automatically
appeared on this this graph given in
this blog post then I don't have to
write any any code to get that code
specifically so that's reactive graph to
the gesture the version we have right
now with meteor like that will graph
well then you can use any kind of data
source you can use like MongoDB maybe a
REST API may be a sequel you can
actually use any kind of data so you
want and there is no restriction so that
is reactive graph it's very powerful and
I wrote a blog post you can learn mom
know about this and there's a like like
specification kind of thing on the
meatiest data repository and then you
can read about these things very very in
a clear manner so so so then it's come
to deploying the reactive graph to your
server and it's very interesting and the
thing is I'm not going to to talk about
too much details here so you have a data
well it's called app server so app
server is simply exposing a graphically
where graph to a schema so it may be a
simple node.js application that there is
some some special drivers that you need
to access to you need to use to get data
and actually you can use all your now
there is also as well then then you need
to do some simple things to do Dells are
12 some notifications from stuff
just sort of simple like it's not like
riding a like driver like to them big
error right now in a locator like
database driver to dt right now it's is
a very very context are and we really
have to do not providing our database
driver to this reactive rock gilding is
very simple so that's that's the tester
there's a cool thing about this epsilon
so it simply stateless like that means
you can can simply scale these this app
app server without worrying about
interconnection and so on the so this is
really simple and this another cell we
call it in validation server validation
sure that's this sir actually uh it's
kind of like a joke human cracker so if
we keep track of the current version of
the document and so on and then this
this and that that version is already
available on the client as well so that
means client actually asking this energy
relation itself every time so it's my
version of the document updated or not
these are the same if that immolated
Jason's ever say this is your document
has been updated and then I I can fetch
the document again from the my app
server so just how things happen so
there is no cash in the inside your
application application server that mean
I mean the cash in right now with meteor
all the data available on your every
client on on your app is cash on you on
yourself as well but with this one you
don't need to make a cash you don't need
to have a matchbook kind of thing so
it's totally of the client side
client-driven stuff it's very cool and
then the cool thing is this inner
edition service is you don't really need
to care with this as well so let's say
so then you're developing this one so
you can have an enviable version up in a
relation server so that means that comes
with the media tool and generally
deploying this one actually galaxy can
offer
straight version opinionation' server so
that means you don't need to worry about
this intelligencer so anymore and then
the thing is if you need to work is just
create your scheme us this scaling the
reactive graph google apps will be very
simple so that gets a very cool thing to
see right this is the stuff like the
whole stuff with the reactive
graphically well i'll just copy this
diagram from the mdgs like suspect so
here we have like slits there are few
parts so this this the red and the green
area is the server side part and this
blue and the orange part is the client
side path so they're using a relay as
well so there's an internal you relate
to do the some caching storage and kind
of thing in your home on the client side
and the same thing this this graph
creative graphic oil is is is like me
you'll away independent you will be able
to use this creative graphic Wilmoth and
you will react place or something else
so it's so very cool it right now relay
is very very closely tied to react so we
can't really use with any other stuff
but with reactive graphical you could
use it anything and now so you can we
use any any kind of router maybe is
react router or maybe it will a router
you can use this law router so that's
very good and here you can see that's
this floor out racism so block is a dark
area the reason for that one is because
mdgs trying to like this implements our
website rendering a component to as well
so that means they are really thinking
about like community like like allow
other things are how we talk and these
days because so we really want as I was
I didn't ring and now in these is
thinking about that vessel and that's
really good approach and I really like
that and on the server side we have the
app server here then sorry gives it in
eldon sir these nap so as you can see is
except express graph ql here is an NPM
module and there are some other stuff
and you can use anything esquivel Mongo
ap is ending that's it so this is the
interactive graph here and I really
think this will be a game changer and
this would be not only for media app
developers you can use with react native
you can use with any kind of JavaScript
app I hope there will be projects to use
this one with the native apps as well I
think that's just the goal with the mdg
maybe later on yeah ok ok men let's come
back let's come back to the questions
can you hear questions there we go my
mic was meted alright so what kind of
Avadh assess what kind of infrastructure
is recommended for optimal graphical
performance for structure I think so end
of the day like the graph new lease is
simply a not so so if you can host nor
days on epsilon writing nearly anywhere
so there is no recommended kind of like
infrastructure it's you can host
anywhere yeah and I mean you know that
the interesting thing is you see people
like Mongoose or rethink t be like
implementing graph ql so that it'll work
like out of the box like you'll be able
to use manga or something like that
right yeah I think about reading baby
yeah I think that's not going to happen
so they all right I think they did yeah
you try to like they wanted to use like
they want to expose the the API to the
client apps so that means road you don't
want to like work with this other side
you can simply connect your client
tablet the reactor using the mediator
basis and then there was thinking to use
graph G well but then then they later
realized like
well this is too simple for them like
they have much complex stuff to do like
I'm in the APA why is this so fitting
name is very very complex with the APA I
mean not complex with complex than other
likes they have developed beaches and
then graph google is not a API for that
one so that's so they I think they won't
work with that to implement graph cure
support way into the breathing baby uh
so pick or a hacker extraordinaire asked
from my limited knowledge of graph ql
I'm worried about opening up the door to
creating really inefficient queries
repeated n plus 1 queries etc is that a
real problem or other ways of dealing
with that Oh what do you mean my
inefficient scores so okay I well so
based on what I saw you should like you
you're writing the resolver right like
the schema part of it so I would imagine
that that's really on the developer that
maybe be careful right okay I think
that's the decimal one with the light dt
as well so though I think it's really
very easy to write the that means a
resolver ok lighting pity share in some
some example on the chat let's wait ok
we are each o'the is another query got
it ok ok that means he's trying to ok
open like that means yeah nothing of
nesting yeah I think I so that's the
thing actually we need to have like some
kind of database private to do implement
caching and some of the stock and
there's a project Koehler data loaded
from facebook and that do some caching
stuff and of course this is where
actually application performance
monitoring comes in then actually
we can tell you some stuff and how to
how deceased show you that now rather
tour is actually not working well and
then you can optimize and they're the
cool thing is Umbridge is working or
trying to like implement like
performance API get into the reactor
graph you then you can actually see how
what other problems in your you know
Tories and then you can simply fix that
and you don't need to use quadra for
that and maybe we will have some tools
but then it will be available into the
into the tech to graphical as well i
think that's that's the answer right now
i think ok all right so Robert asks you
know of any bad parts of graph ql tell
us all the mud in dirt ok the bad part
of grass graphically right now is these
mutations and trying to create a
mutation and I mean to live triangular
do optimistic updates and its really
kind of hard to do right now because you
need to you need to do plus with
optimistic update then and that mongodb
right now he has it's a very simple ice
I mean see police howdy for us it's very
simple whole hardest part is done by the
the minimum go and they will the stuff
in client side and in mutations with
graph UL is with optimistic our place
and that's kind of not very cool and I
hope that is also going to fix with the
reactive graphical project form mgg and
I hope that will fix but right now the
mutation is a really bad part give
anything can relate so you have to write
not up go to do that and then the last
question is which you recommend using
graph ql with event sourcing it looks
like a very good time
met a sort of see QRS architecture
actually I'm not family with the wind
setting and see urs so by Willie card
balance that but I think it's something
into reactive programming right I'm
quite not sure yeah I don't I I haven't
looked at it either I I just first heard
of it a couple days ago they were
talking about it in the media or mentor
chat room why he go someone looking link
to a martin fowler post how many
responsibilities segregation i think i
did think that's public am I need to see
cigarette I have seen this term before I
have an accurate actually go through
that one unfortunately I can't answer
this one I'm sorry yeah no it's good
it's good all right oh well we'll call
it a day there um and we'll take a quick
break and we'll come back in about nine
minutes and we'll start with Karl's talk
so i'll post a link in and you guys in a
few minutes thanks for the talk araneta
like oh I'll give you okay we clapping
since we can't hear one else's clap all
right okay thank you thank you guys
