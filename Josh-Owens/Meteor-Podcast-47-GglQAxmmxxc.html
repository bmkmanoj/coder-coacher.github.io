2015 welcome meteor fans i'm your host
Josh Owens one with my co-host rye
Walker welcome rye what's up ya got
working mics and computer and all that
good stuff this week yeah magic we are
on the ball so to speak alright so this
week we actually have a longer list than
usual bonus for you guys listeners in
Watchers if you're watching YouTube live
so we're going to talk about meteor 103
i'm going to talk about user cycle why
is going to take the the cover off user
cycle here in canto minute magellan yo
forge a driver for meteor reactive SVG's
github feature requests and want meteor
alright and just real quick i'm going to
do start doing pre-roll ads we got a
sponsor modulus has a great despond surf
or the year so who goes home angeles
they love our content they love us so we
love them yeah yeah i don't so i've
already started buying like better audio
equipment since they sponsored to like
it's another room but i got a nice news
to be a headphones i got to bring in
here guys yep um yeah so if I've we'll
just we'll do a quick add here and then
i'll do the pre-roll in the major
podcast but i've searched a galaxy high
and low for the best meter your hosting
platform and i think its modulus than I
yo we guess check them out what do you
think right I don't host my meteor apps
anywhere but modulus yeah that's an only
place in the galaxy you host your
meteors that's it modulus done until
another galaxy exists that's the only
one I know about all right uh yeah so
first up meteor 1031
we're getting into the good old Ruby
pada rails pattern here I guess we're
patch release comes out immediately
after a regular release yeah that's a
sign that people are watching or not
enough people are RC testing again I
didn't RZ tested you I did not but I did
see some people on that the one mailing
list they said some stuff about testing
on apps so feel like if they said it I
didn't need to yeah but I did you know
it's funny test like I spent all week
working on quite a bit of testing did a
test in class and i'm working on tests
for my client so I think having tests in
place could help with upgrades right
yeah off it into an upgrades so it looks
like the big things that they did here
you know they revamped meteor show to
actually spit out the read meas now and
they've added the e JSON flag to the
media show command so you can get json
spit out from that so now you can come a
script that thing if you wanted to which
is is getting kind of interesting um
usually have you ever used I've never
used meteor show or meteor search I I
haven't but you know I think I might now
especially with the read means being in
here because I mean there's just times
where i go to atmosphere and it's like
it doesn't work like you want so yeah um
yeah so they supported to read meas now
you can use velocity on packages so when
you run the test packages you can tell
it to use velocity instead of their tiny
test stuff which is awesome I still
haven't tried that yet myself but I
think anything would be better than like
tiny test is ok but I think mocha and
jasmine can be a lot a lot stronger for
people yeah there's just there's a
there's a lot of smaller changes in here
trying to see if there's anything that
looks particularly crazy to me not
really they did they operated jquery oh
they did okay well there is something
yeah yeah jquery went from one 11 12 or
no I went to 1 11 two from 1 11 0 so
it's tiny yeah an attorney uh yeah other
none just looks like a lot of bug fixes
only a few new things here yeah that's
good should be easy for you you should
be upgraded are you waiting get it done
all right uh my up yeah all right cool
so yes I we've been working on user
cycle for about 11 weeks now and one of
the things I wanted to make sure we did
was make it easy for me to your apps to
use it because it's designed for user
retention you know like basically doesn
t the heart of your online businesses
will people stick around on whatever you
built right and so everyone should be
measuring this nobody is it's hard or
the tools are expensive and user cycle
is a free tool that we made it look
really dead easy to set up with with
meteor if you're using iron-router which
most people are using iron-router you
can add our meteor events package and it
will automatically send all route hits
two segments night the SEC two segments
and from segments you can send it
anywhere you want I also think you
should use segments too because it gives
you flexibility for to let like your
non-technical people choose what they're
going on with that you all that day
that's coming out of your website so so
sense of the segment for us it goes to
key man from kina coast user cycle
there's this chain chain of things but
it's really easy to do it's like I mean
literally I say I'm setting it up for
crater actually I used crater in the
demo videos it's not live with crater
because I'm waiting for the new version
of Crater to come out um no pressure
Nick no pressure no pressure neck we're
waiting though but no it's like so easy
to get a pretty cool chart on just like
how your users are sticking around on
your app for any me to your app this is
trivial it's pretty much free if you
don't have a lot of traffic
segments free teen is free and these are
cycles free so no excuses other than
that take some time you know yeah nice
though but this is uh this is tracking
like post sign up right yeah so like
once you sign up like I think there's a
ton of tools like your post you did last
week was cool but it was about the
funnel pre sign up right and like if you
have a SAS product especially a freemium
product this is where it really matters
is you want to make sure you're building
something that people stick around and
use it also helps you figure out like
are you getting the right kind of sign
ups you know this source is retained
better than that source you know so yeah
well I think that intelligence is
important when you're building that
because then you know like hey let's go
dump less money in facebook because
those guys only stick around for you
know two weeks and never pay us versus
all these people on Twitter amazing
payers and you know their their
lifecycle value or their their lifetime
value customer value is you know $400
like of course it's no brainer that go
pay two dollars a user of Twitter yeah
yeah so like the interesting thing is a
lot of apps when they launched that they
go down to zero retention will approach
zero as timing goes on like we see this
with a system even one of the products
we've made or we see clients make it
doesn't it's a matter of time before
that cohort goes to zero you know and
that's and that's that's like basis says
like until you fix that problem don't do
anything else other than get like have a
product at least one at a hundred people
will stick around for on average mmm so
it's good that's what we're trying to do
we're trying to help help people like
get through that first hump and it's
hard because like how do you get people
how do you build something people want
well that's the magic question right you
know like yeah has to be the right
product to the right price all these
kinds of things but anyway user cycle
helps you keep track of all that and
then talks to us in so like I can pick a
little behind the curtain here too
because I was there when you guys were
getting started with it you know this
was a rails app right and it's no longer
a rails app no it's meteor app the rails
app still exists at classic thought user
cycle calm but we're shutting that down
any day now it's like shutting things
down is so such a pain in the ass you
know you have to set an email you
have to like make sure people have time
to do whatever and yeah so we it's like
it needs to be shut down but we're just
we're just procrastinating yeah alright
next legit excuse me Magellan you good
Magellan yeah it's funny you gave me
this one cuz this is a competing meteor
dash blog uh yeah so it's got the same
title but it's not actually competing
right like this is a whole app versus a
package no I think it's awesome there's
it at someone I don't know Alan
alejandro gomez looks like don't know
him from the meteor world yet so you
know we're going to keep getting more
and more people jumping in saw I need to
have a blog package she was inspired by
the discover meteor site and built built
something with meteor to make it happen
so that's awesome I think it's uh so I
think he said the meteor he said a
different book it was like getting
started with meteor or something the one
David Turnbull oh I believe oh he said
he was inspired by the patterns in there
well he said by the meteor book and I
click it goes to discover meteor but oh
ok maybe I misread it then yeah yeah
good cool yep yep so I don't know maybe
here's the wrong link in there either
way it's inspired by something and it's
it's a meteor app that is a blog so well
to me like the greatest thing like the
the best way for people to learn is uh
to read code and I love like every time
we see an open source app get posted
like I love that I want to see some
people start it start using it play
around with it like contribute back to
it you're gonna make the community
stronger and it's gonna be easier for
new people to come into the community
you know so I mean even it's it's been
what a month since I started working on
88 days of meteor and you know I felt
like I didn't have enough open source
examples i only had like four maybe and
I feel like I kept pointing the same
ones and now like in the last like we've
doubled in the last month so it's
awesome yep what is I love it keep it up
guys yes all right neo4j so if you're
not familiar
neo4j I believe is a graphing database
have you guys used neo for channel I've
never used neo4j yeah so this this is
the link that was on crater pointed to
the neo4j com website and they have
announced that there is now a driver
available I have not used it I do not
know the status of it but they do have a
pseudo reactive driver they called it
and a connector so it looks like there
there's probably enough here to get
started with it so yeah I've recommended
neo4j to people like hey I need a craft
database oh my god neo4j is the one I
don't know anything about it but um it's
what people seem to like well yeah but
uh you know I think David's working on a
project with Instagram right like yeah
neo4j would probably make sense right
there I know it's funny you say that
because I'm literally copy and setting
it to him right now yeah nice yeah i
wish i would have had this like you know
i was trying to do this with postgres
and i think i settled on Redis and doing
like overlap queries using Redis um but
Mike neo4j would have been awesome thank
you yeah so quick quick digression on
that cuz you mentioned David so David's
David Pierce he's a designer who is
learning meteor and he's like you would
be really proud of him Josh she's like
going all the way back to to the depths
of he's working on a product called Fame
hub by himself you know so he's doing
the whole media wrapped himself which is
ground but he was like super proud
yesterday because he's like I got red us
working you know he actually like is
using the node Redis driver to do it to
use Q and he's like all the way back
into that stuff to do jobs to make his
jobs more efficient yeah it's funny like
I give a talk like my year with meteor
and one of my I think most awesome
moments and coming to meteor is the fact
that like David just was able to jump in
like he'd felt totally lost with rails
and Ruby and oh you know when he came in
a mediator like he immediately
understood it took ownership like he ran
the boilerplate for the longest time and
now yeah now Nick Nick wenta jizz take
it over and he's more of a classic
designer as well so it's funny like the
people maintaining the boilerplate or
designers so yeah yeah I mean if you're
if you're it may be because they start
so many projects that actually could be
it you know like they they have the
concept and they gotta like get it
started so um yeah cuz I haven't started
with a boilerplate in a long time now
okay so cool right side side trip ended
yeah reactive SVG's is our next topic so
this is a little meteor pad that we
found on crater ah this is Dean gold key
yeah Chicago grooves well I mean he's
gonna be so happy we mentioned his name
on the podcast he's insane what could I
come back on the podcast well you're
kind of on the podcast right now Dean
nowish um we should call him in but
anyway this SVG oh it's a real simple
little meteor pad where he's um he's got
some controls that you can move around
and click to change the SVG and it's all
reactive of course because it's all the
variables are pumping through blaze and
javascript is reactive to when the data
changes and so you couldn't change I
don't know what he uses this for but
it's a good demo of again reactivity of
meteor well SVG can be anything right
like you can you can draw anything on
canvas with SVG mmm so that's that's
pretty pretty awesome like I love that
we have that that kind of meteor pad
tutorial there which do you ever use
when you're proud I never used me to
your pad either like this uh so I've
started to and it's funny you should
mention that because like the the
februari meteor club QA is with Mike
rissie who who made meteor pad and you
know I kind of want to focus the QA that
way but yeah I've started using it for
funnily enough eight days a meteor as
well because I wanted a way to share
code with people um but not like github
like I have to permission people to get
access to it and
it didn't seem quite right either so
meteor pads get the features I need and
so I've been playing with it it's a cool
way to do it to share a little demo on
it it's like yeah I mean you could have
you can give them the code and you can
give them a link to a working demo but
this actually gives you editable code
with the working demo so this is funny
maybe a little bit more work to share
but I like it yeah and it's awesome to
because MDGs like fully thrown their
support behind it they pay for all the
hosting costs that are associated with
it's also officially sanctioned well
alright I am going to quickly open mic
you a and I will say if you are watching
live feel free to start popping in some
questions when they take one or two at
the end um now's your chance if you want
to know what we call our pink cat then
alright so next up feature requests are
now in a loud thing in in the meteor
github repo which is an amazing thing I
think um you know I I have been paying
attention to meteor discussions and the
conversations that have gone on there
and i don't know like it just felt like
i'm glad they took the initiative but at
the same time like some of the
conversations made me a little
uncomfortable that they were being had
kind of outside of the Nona watchful eye
of meteor I don't know like I like for
them to give their input from time to
time on things you know like you know
I've had a conversation with glasser
about the whole like meteor methods
versus allow deny rules you know and and
that stuff's valuable I think and I'd
love to see more of that happen in a
slightly more public place not some
random like one-off repo and and I I
think I even met emailed um well I can't
take this lava gosh wow totally blew out
of my mind there um i emailed slava
about the
that like they were talking about maybe
forking meteor in this discussion board
and it just didn't feel right and so um
you know he said I you know people want
a fork it for Kip but um you know that
maybe that's a good thing maybe that's a
bad thing I don't know but I I do think
that there was some influence of that
kind of coming to play here in the fact
that now you know you're able to send in
feature requests and it looks like they
will respond to it and I you know that's
the hardest part for me like as a guy
who wants to see something a meteor will
my poll requests get merged or will it
be you know just completely denied and
they're going to tell me to go make a
package and I mean that's not a bad
response but at the same time like I
could have just gone and made the
package rather than send them a pull
request so yeah um I think this is
awesome yeah I think so too i mean i see
that i'm looking at like the pool
requests and they are they've there's 48
open pool request an 860 closed pull
request that's pretty good they're not
leaving people hanging too much yeah and
there are pull requests from non non
meteor people here in the code and you
know the issues are pretty clean to like
2300 closed ones and 300 open issues so
i think i'm glad that they're doing this
i think you know they basically said we
would be lying to you if we told you we
would pay attention to that until after
one point oh well it's after one point
oh and now they're falling through on
their promise to watch the issues so i
think i said well to be fair i mean they
were they were glasser was put in charge
of the issues and triaging them and that
was part of this pretty one point on
that was part of his uh his job there
yeah so I think maybe like four more for
bugs you know yeah maybe but anyway yeah
so it's it's good i mean i haven't put
anything in there but i like i like that
they've made that statement did they
actually make that statement or did
someone just discovered it on someone
like founded in the readme uh yeah i was
added to the readme mom and the readme
says as of j
uary 2015 we do use github to track
feature requests from our community yeah
feature request issues get the feature
label as well as the label corresponding
the meteor sub-project that they're
apart yeah so yeah a little add that
they're hiring too by the way oh yeah
yeah the day they say that in there too
don't they yeah that's right yeah yeah
when we're hiring core developers then
yeah cool all right you all right uh
let's see so the last one you pop this
in here why meteor a link to the Y
meteor meteor pedia page yeah well yeah
so literally today we were on a call
with a prospect that should you know has
an app that's perfect for meteor but
they the call was great everything is
good but the question is like why why
should we choose meteor-like send me
some resources about that and so of
course you know we've done some stuff on
the differential site you know why we
like meteor all that but I was looking
for like third-party references and like
hey I stumbled across the meteor PDF
page why meteor and like why was like
holy crap this thing as dense it's like
super super long now mmm and it's got a
lot of really good stuff in there and so
I would encourage everybody you know if
you have some wide meteor content drop
it in here let's make this the best page
because I actually think it popped up
first when I searched from my meteor as
well did it really that would be
surprising to me no it's up its number
one at least for mine you know Google
yeah it totally is and then my blog post
is number two yeah I know yes but yeah
so in again it's got I'm sure a lot of
our listeners are trying to defend the
decision to try to move forward meteor
so if you don't know about this page
make make use of it yeah definitely good
stuff so questions anyone anyone bueller
so I will say if you want to support the
podcast we've made even more progress
getting the next podcast off the ground
go to patreon.com / meteor club we've
picked up two more people actually
logged in ahead of time so I'd have
these names available and i looked up
one name ahead of time as well so yay oh
yes that was that was one that was a
little tricky for me and then Darryl F
are the two to New Media Club patrons
patrons patrians I don't know patrones
now the channel Jones you got patron now
but yeah so you know every week we're
getting more and more people into the
the slack chat room and then fun stuff
going on in there as a matter of fact uh
been the guy with the pink cat question
last week what a guest blog post and
we'll probably talk about it next week
on here so fun stuff alright I don't
have anything else this was a good one
yeah good stuff alright we'll see you
guys next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
