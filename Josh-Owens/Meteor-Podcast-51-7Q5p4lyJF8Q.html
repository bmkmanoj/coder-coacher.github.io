2015 welcome meteor fans i'm your host
Josh owns along with my special guest
host Rishi welcome the show hi um we
wanted to have uh am I saying that right
by the way Russia yeah that's that's
correct okay awesome got one right we I
decided to invite Richie on the show
this week because I wanted to talk about
this weekend meteor found that very
interesting when you posted that last
Friday I'd already made the show notes
so didn't didn't really talk a whole lot
about it but really wanted to get into
it this week a lot of good stuff in
there so you know I guess tell people
you know what this week in meteor is so
this week in meteor was started because
of an internal thing we started at
differential so for Thursday meetings I
decided to I do some research and give
some insight on what's going on in the
meteor universe and so I I got a lot of
good feedback internally and turned into
a public thing and now it's this week in
meteor for everyone thanks yeah and
that's awesome and you guys you actually
slept together a quick polymer website
and just signs people up to MailChimp
right it actually using polymer it's a
materialized CSS oh nice very nice yeah
it looked like polymer interesting all
right uh yeah so this week we're going
to talk a little bit about the some of
the topics from this week in meteor and
then we're going to talk about let me
look my list we're gonna talk about mon
goal and then wanted to talk about react
in blaze so get some opinions on some of
that stuff
uh yeah so I've got this weekend meteor
to version two pulled up and click on
the first issue too I just thought we
kind of scan and look at some of the
interesting things so the you know the
interesting one to me I actually heard
about this from someone else before you
posted it was the otha backlog did you
look at that a whole lot I looked at it
a little bit but I wasn't I I don't have
too much information about it I have
like a general understanding of why it
was implemented yeah so basically a blog
is kind of a double-edged sword in that
it can help you easily scale to multiple
processes processes however you want to
say that but it allows you to run
multiple media apps and rather than
running the Poland diff which takes a
lot of computing power looking for
changes you can subscribe you can
basically act like a Mongo replica and
tell it you need the OP log and it's a
special collection that it you know it
streams changes out of and so your your
meteor app can listen to that and get
that like automatically right and so
that's great because we don't have to do
the poland if and so i can really reduce
cpu and we could start scaling out to a
lot more boxes and they're all going to
get their updates nice and zippy but the
problem comes in when you're shoving a
lot of data down through your Mongo like
let's say you're doing thousands of
Rights a second or something you know if
you think about something like deira hey
Aaron Oda he is dealing with thousands
and thousands of performance analytics
coming in every every few seconds right
and the issue there is each meteor app
is going to have to process all that
huge backlog of data and there's no way
to say like I only care about this
portion of data being updated from up
log because it's really just there to
make sure replication happen smoothly
between
multiple Mongo server so what the oblong
backlog allows you to do is you can
specify like how far behind the backlog
can get before it's gonna just flush the
backlog and I think when it flushes the
backlog it'll like forcibly run a pull
excuse me a poll query maybe yeah so
there's like a too far behind
environment variable you can set yeah
interesting stuff you know they're
they're trying to figure things out so
all right did you what what did you find
interesting in year one thing I found
interesting was the MongoDB upgrade
because I with the driver that they
upgraded it to we might be able to
actually use Mongo Mongo three point 0
which has a lot of performance
improvements from two especially with
the new storage engine that they're
using wired tiger yeah yeah yeah so it's
interesting what they did is they
updated the the node Mongo driver to a
version that supported 2.6 but they were
able to go they just grabbed a version
that also supports 3.0 as well so I
agree this is uh this going to be huge
because you know no one's no one's
really tested 30 yet that I've seen but
my guess is you know with with the wired
tiger the Mongo team is touting it as
spectacular so my guess is we're going
to see good things awesome we talked
about some of these before like the each
inhale / and the template level
description or subscriptions and that
kind of thing yeah we definitely talked
about some of these other meteor
community type topics so
the other thing that I saw that was
interesting was the I didn't read the
blaze to proposal but it's on my to-read
list now you said it was quite huge yeah
i definitely recommend reading it
there's a lot of interesting stuff in
there and loads of discussion from
different community members yeah yeah so
I'm gonna have to read that but and then
also the stream based tool bill tool
that's lava is kind of you know working
on a looks like a hack pad for that
looked interesting to me but again I
haven't I don't read that one and then
the probably the more interesting one is
you said you you put this under the
updates in the mediator community but
using react components and blaze the the
really interesting thing to me is that
this is a package from avital and if you
go look like there's actually a project
that they have it installed in its
called like squares or something like
that and it looks like they're
experimenting with this idea of using
react components inside a blaze probably
idea rectangles they repository yeah so
I don't know that's uh that's exciting
to me that they're there they're playing
around with that and they're putting out
packages right so you know sashko put
out a package the other day that had a
little functionality and in it now like
avital is putting out a package it's
interesting to see them kind of playing
around with the framework in a in a
different way like it's not part of core
yeah I think that's a good way to help
improve the project itself so you get a
good comparison of how other projects
are doing it or even a allow people to
just use react in their product in
meteor projects as well yeah yeah
because I mean there's no like we've in
in blaze land i guess in immediately and
we have packages
and you could theoretically build a web
component that way but you know it might
be here comes a train it might be really
interesting to you know be able to tap
into like a true react web component and
use that because all of a sudden you
open yourself up to a huge library of
available content that you can piggyback
off of which is always a win you know
mm-hmm all right was there anything else
interesting in the issue to you wanted
to highlight or talk about oh I guess
the one of the things I really found
interesting was the multi-core support
in the meteor cluster package that are
no de and the meteor hacks team they are
working on so I there's there's all
these strides and scalability coming and
i think that's that's really big uh yeah
so I mean it was interesting to me I I
like that like he he actually posted it
it's just a screenshot on crater and
there's some decent discussion going on
in there you know but the old guy said
it was like a pointless pointless
screenshot and I said I wouldn't call it
pointless but you know we need more
information and so he said you know he's
got four cores on it's a digital ocean a
gigabyte machine he just used one
machine and he had four cluster workers
and he had two or four passenger
processes and basically you know this
graph looks almost identical between the
two so I mean that's excuse me that's
awesome but I mean seems like what I
mean what are we gaining here overusing
passenger because engine X kind of does
a lot of this stuff for us so I would
love to hear his thoughts on what we're
gaining by using cluster instead of
passenger you should get them out in the
next podcast
maybe talk about it maybe I'll invite
him to blog about it first um yeah so
it's all good stuff so I would I would
again like I would HIGHLY highly
recommend you subscribe to this weekend
meteor it's this week in meteor calm
right yep yeah so definitely worth
paying attention to for me like I see a
lot of the community stuff anyway and
crater but like all the combing through
the commits is hugely valuable and
understanding what the media teams
working on I think is awesome like they
might be hating life right now because
you're doing this but at the same time
like exposing a lot of these
conversations to the outside world i
think is a is a very valuable thing to
have happen so yeah it's helping me get
a better understanding of the direction
that meteor is taking yeah yeah and
there they definitely don't like they
talk about it but it's not you know it's
not like publicly exposed anywhere very
well so you know it's quite interesting
all right ahh real quick if you have any
questions for us we'll maybe take a
question or two at the end you can use
the Q&amp;amp;A app I absolutely have no idea
how that works so I think you can leave
a comment on the page I don't know if
that doesn't do it then I'll pay
attention to the comments as well on the
Google+ page also the sponsors this week
or modulus I oh and composed a oh if you
listen to the podcast version of this
you'll you would have heard that in the
in the bumpers but if you're interested
with modulus you can use the coupon code
met podcast and get a $25 credit we
don't have one of those for compose you
should ask them for one but they're
awesome for for doing hosting and all
that kind of like production stuff so I
definitely check them out
and then the next story is a Mongol did
you did you take a look at this at all I
saw it but I haven't had a chance to
play around with it just yet yeah I
haven't installed in a nap yet either
I'm kind of excited though to to put
this into one of the apps I'm working on
but basically it's just like this this
little i was i was literally talking to
someone in the media club slack chat
about like having a tool that would help
you maybe be a little more security
conscious and this basically exposes
your mini Mongo collection like whatever
is in your in your mini Mongo memory it
exposes it in this this nice little
package that sits in the corner of your
application and so you can click on it
and bring it up and like you know the
the demo version it shows you that
you've got a account list and two dues
in there and so you can click on that
and kind of browse through the data
that's actually there and you can
actually even do changes from the
console so really interesting stuff you
can remove stuff duplicate records like
all kinds of mongo ish things but you
know for me like having this their shows
you like what data you're exposing
through publications and through you
know fine calls and all that it's pretty
awesome yeah I think it's going to
really help speed up the development
process by actually using the package
and yeah I figured it out quickly yeah
and you know the other awesome part is
it uses the DPO debug only flag and
keeps it out of production for you so it
only shows up in your your development
environment and then the they've got
like hockey activation and all that kind
of stuff which is cool and then uh you
know what I would love to see is like
did you see Sasha's post
about like template outlining uh oh yes
yeah that was really cool yeah so I'd
love to see that integrated here and you
can hit it hot key and just like turn on
that the template level outlining which
basically shows you like puts a border
around every template and then when you
hover over it it tells you what template
is rendering that data which is pretty
friggin awesome and then he's even got
like it flashes and shows you a count to
show you like when a template sorry
rendering so you can kind of tell if
your rear end during a template too
often or something so I could see that
being a real handy addition and Mongol
as well that could even be a separate
package in its own could be yeah yeah
maybe just hockey um but seems like you
know they've they've done a lot of heavy
lifting here do alright so definitely
check that out if you want to see it
it's just at MongoDB eircom pretty
awesome and then the last one I I guess
we technically talked about which is the
the reactant blaze you know again it's
just it's super interesting to me to
watch the meteor team building packages
instead of building things in the core
so guess that was kind of a lame update
since I'd already mentioned it during
the earlier segment um alright so now
it's time for fewer questions been said
yo it works bro that was all we got
thanks man appreciate that so have you
been working on anything interesting or
exciting other than this week in meteor
recently uh not too much only because
I've been bogged down with school and
then this week in meteor took some time
this week is very long one uh yeah
nothing too interesting right now nice
yeah so what are you going to school for
uh I go to school for basically computer
science nice nice but you're getting all
your education from the meteor community
anyway exactly that's funny um yeah
that's awesome so uh for me this week I
was working on eight days of meteor calm
trying to get that wrapped up like a
eight days of lessons delivered to your
inbox that step you through how to build
an app from nothing using meteor and the
great part is like I've tried to turn it
into a guided journey where people are
learning you know I highlight code and
like open source code they can look at
that kind of accomplishes the same thing
that they've done so they can learn to
read other people's code and then I also
point out like whether they should be
reading in the docs to kind of learn
more about this particular piece that
we're working on and then I give them
like two or three goals for actually
building this functionality for this app
and at the end of the eight days they
should be able to have a functional kind
of UX functional application for
inviting people to parties so it's been
fun but it's been my focus for yesterday
and today that's awesome yeah all right
still no questions so I guess we'll wrap
it up so thanks for for coming on Richie
and I leave for wouldn't we yeah yeah I
look forward to more this week a meteor
stuff so keep it up don't don't drop the
ball don't pull an era nota even I don't
mind to yeah he was doing this for a
while but the give plates pretty full so
it's awesome to see someone else kind of
taking up the mantle and seems like
you're digging even deeper than Arenado
was though super awesome alright well
thanks for watching guys tune in next
week to the live show we do whatever
friday have 330 or you can check out
media podcast com you can subscribe
there you can search for meteor podcast
in iTunes and I actually started up just
today we did a little apprentice session
where we're working on a new media
podcast website too so building that a
meteor and hopefully we can get
everything transitioned off of podbean
without any interruption so that'll be
probably in the next two weeks as well
so alright thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
