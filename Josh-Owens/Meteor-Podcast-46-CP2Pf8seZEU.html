2015 local meteor fans i'm your host
Josh Goins along with my co-host rye
Walker welcome rye so you're rocking
your vintage meteor shirt to that I am I
am it went and i'm rockin vintage honey
all right looks like the streaming is
getting started and auto kicked on on my
page there so if you're watching
remotely live then be sure to know that
we can take some questions at the end
that's always fun just use the Q&amp;amp;A app
that they have there and this week we
are talking about we don't have any
sponsors just if you want to help
sponsor the show individually you sure
to check out you got it there but i
think i'm alright hmm well i just got
done running be sure to check out
patreon.com / meteor club um lots of
awesome stuff their prizes like prizes
what do you call Kickstarter levels i
guess just the wards rewards there we go
what's a reward options there alright so
this week we're going to talk about
meteor security essentials building an
email digest and content aggregator with
telescope what type of impact does I ojs
have on meteor flow for meteor and
Google Analytics and events for meteor
as well all right ah the first one was
actually a talk by Ryan Glover I believe
he gave it up at the Chicago meet up our
good friend Dean helps run that up there
we shout out the Dean hand to Ryan so if
you follow the link in the show notes
its talk stop the meteor chef calm /
meteor dash securities dash
Jules but anyway he's got some slides up
and he walks you through kind of the ins
and outs of security for your meteor app
and he's got he's got a whole bunch of
stuff in here and i think it's it's
really awesome i'm actually looking at
his slides right now for the first time
there's some good stuff in here like I
mean obviously you know remove auto
publish and insecure those are big ones
talks a little bit about allowing deny
rules which I'm still kind of up near
about myself haha and always got quite a
few slides about allow deny publication
pub and sub so I think your publications
are a big source of security potential
security leaks you got to be careful
about that and then he talks a little
bit about check in audit argument check
which can be a good thing it's it's for
for checking the inputs on your meteor
methods so it's always important anyway
I would highly recommend going through
this and hopefully he recorded this talk
to you I think can be a real treat for
people to be able to kind of watch it
watch him talk through it all as well I
don't know there's there's a lot of ways
to screw up meteor security
unfortunately mm-hmm you know the system
doesn't warn you when you deploy with
insecure and auto publish be nice if you
got an email said are you sure like that
but that doesn't happen so yeah look
like a Vinay the guy that did the the
scanning of all the meteor apps when he
did the scan in his initial post he said
like over half the sites he found still
had auto publish in them yeah so yeah
you know and I even me like I was
working on a production great app and
you know I wrote about it because I
found insecure was still installed in
the application so yeah kind of crazy
I've heard of those things as soon as
you think you have something that you
want other people to use yeah it's funny
is I saw a post the other day I forget
who posted it it was like original
Braithwaite maybe something like that
and it was all about like death to
password committers people that put like
keys or passwords into the repo and
there's a tip in here to use settings
JSON and that's absolutely like key to
not committing your private keys or
anything like that yeah oh good stuff
yeah it's cool next topic is email
digest and content aggregation with
telescope so this is another great post
by Sasha and using we need to say his
last name anymore do we we know who are
talking about here but I've been
practicing those its grave quiet oh geez
well and you can say it but I think it's
really cool he's basically presenting
telescope as I mean it's basically a
news aggregator and an email digest well
content aggregator and you know a lot of
people don't realize that that's part of
it that's an important part of the
feature set actually you know early on
inspiration for for building a thing in
the first place was that email digest
mm-hmm so again like you are meteor fan
and you're not getting the crater IO
email digest daily you're missing out
because it picks the top links from each
day puts them all into one email and
it's cool feature a lot of people are
like hiring developers to build these
sorts of systems and you just grab grab
a telescope and customize it to get that
thing built for your company's no yeah
yeah and this is this is actually a
two-parter right like you get down to
the end and he talks about crunch on
which he put up and he's got another
post on crunch hut uh hunt that's a my
brain doesn't want to say that right oh
yeah yeah that end gets me
but yeah he talks about like how he got
that set up as well and I thought that
was really interesting because he talked
about this kimono scraper that turns any
website into an API and that was
interesting as well so 22 really good
reads there from Sasha as always he said
that you know it was an easy five minute
set up for him to get this going yeah
I'll say maybe that's like half the time
a normal person might take right but
even at 10 minutes it's worth the effort
yeah I think that I think it's really
important to mention about this is the
fact that you can subscribe to RSS for
content to basically feed content into
the system so it's not only
user-supplied content you could you can
subscribe to some someone else's if they
were providing RSS you can feed it
straight in and let that be the basis
for the inbound content articles people
comment on so yeah I've actually been
kicking around an idea around meteor and
like auto populating links interesting
links for the day kind of like sidebar
yeah but driving it off of an RSS source
I was thinking what if you used like
Reddit meteor as the source but then
you're posting back to it does it is it
an indefinite loop that be a question
I'd be curious to see you know I bet you
can find a way I'm treated by track if I
checks to make sure the link has not
even post i'm pretty sure does that yeah
I think you're right don't stop it right
there but its way for you to scrape
everything it wasn't you know everything
from reddit and I don't know if there's
an RSS for that blackberries yeah but
let you get everything that wasn't
posted my career back into crater I'd be
kind of cool anyway um little side
project 10 minutes all it takes actually
probably less than that we already have
crater up so you just alike quiet so
that's warm ya feel anyway um funny cool
alright so you weren't here you were I
think out of town or something giving
your talk and Chris Nelson filled in in
the big news that week was I ojs coming
out or
oh just just being announced I mean it
wasn't but now it's out and our good
buddy Eric Elias uh what's the name of
his startup it's like Lagoon lagoon
that's it uh so he's working on an
application and he's been kicking around
the idea of using meteor and um yeah so
you know he posted he was curious this
discussion on crater and I'd love to see
more people jump in like please do jump
in and I'd love to hear other people's
opinions I gave mine but I think the I
think that I ojs can have a pretty big
impact overall and the like in the life
span of meteor because I i we see it
like right now it's just they've just
turned on like yes six support and a
couple of smaller things which you know
I mean you could always get es6 support
into meteor using the build tool that
they had but III think that down the
road this this could have a much bigger
impact right because mdg has a couple
choices they could either decide to
switch to I ojs and move forward with
that in which case I think you're going
to have some people that are unhappy and
you may see a community fork of media at
that point that stays on node or they
ignore I ojs which conversely could make
people unhappy and someone's going to
fork and start building in I ojs
features into meteor or they try to
write some kind of compatibility layer
right and try to support both which I
think could be a very painful thing in
the long run so definitely feels like a
double-edged sword here I don't know
what are you folks with well I think I
think it's like for exceptions you know
inception everything that depends on
node has to decide they want support
them both and if you make the wrong
decision I think the worst thing that
could happen is that like
half the people like IO and half the
people like node because now you
literally have a fragmented community at
that point yeah you know I don't know
too much about the backstory of law I
mean I understand like I understand the
basic concept the i/o guys think the
Giants not doing a good job or move too
slow or was not making the right
decisions but I'd love to see it all
come back together obviously because
it's a easier that way like back when
rails was kind of splintering between or
when through the Ruby community was
splintered between rails and verb what
was it murder but he now like yeah that
was that was kind of tough but then they
figured out a way to put it all back
together which I thought was really good
so um but but it was painful that's a
bit I assume he was super painful it was
better you know it was progress so yeah
well you know again that night I one's
gonna agree with that but I if it was
what it was so yeah so I think that
that's fine when my phone when I got a
message i'm on my phone because my
stupid computer microphone would work
but it's got a text like vibrates my
phone like this little hover spot here
nice nation that locket there we go all
right so yeah i think i think that uh i
hope it all goes away that's my that's
my read yeah I kind of agree with you
because it feels like a lot of the lot
of the the smarter people in the room
kind of walked out and went to the I ojs
camp you know when you look at a
company's like strong loop I don't know
like I've heard some people say like
this is just a marketing ploy and it all
worked out in the end I don't know
hopefully it gets better for us down at
the bottom of the hill yeah yeah yeah
well so let's go the next topic and this
is like a situation where I'm like
totally busted you assigned me this flow
for meteor did you watch the video i
mean i know what it is there's a new
router that Erica's working on but have
you tried it and we tried oh no no i
totally assigned it to you okay i know
that um rag from your front you looked
at it he said he thinks it looks pretty
cool but man how brave is that to try to
make a router like
why would you why would you do that to
yourself but now i'm sure some things he
wants to try to do but that's a hard
topic you know it is but at the same
time like I think it's a really
important topic because there's not
there's not very many people um
exploring that topic right and I you've
got Chris and like everybody and their
brother relies on his iron-router
package and you know that's that's a lot
of excuse me support work like yeah we
should call we should all pitch in and
give him some money to hire an assistant
help out with my runner know so I bet
you Chris is saying go go go like be
tired router yeah so the one thing that
I will say someone did make some
comments which gave me a little context
here is that the flow routes they're not
reactive so it makes you rethink the
structured app a little bit but it's
more predictable is what the comment
said so I don't know yeah yeah so this
again that's like watching a video it's
a 12-minute video could have something
to do with the future of meteor in there
you should check it out maybe we'll talk
about some more next week after we've
had some time to digest it but think
that video just came out a couple days
ago I have not a chance jumping yeah but
is he goes you know it isn't gonna
happen so three days ago yeah honestly
like I love Aaron Oda but the biggest
problem I have with deciding to put an
entire app on this thing would be you
know what what is the long-term support
of this thing look like because you know
I remember writing a like a chapter and
getting done like getting fifty percent
of the way through it and then emailing
Aaron Oda and he said oh that's
deprecated and I'm not gonna update
leica anymore it's like oh yeah yeah is
this an experiment or is this something
for real yes yes it's the only time will
tell on that a lot of ways that we just
did a package we have a package called
meteor workers that we're deprecating
like it's had like a four-week life you
know because it was it was what we
needed at the time you know it's
basically a very deals with just doing
background work for king
meteor process and then keeping track
with all in Malcolm 0 and Q in Mongo
it's kind of cool it's nice but we're
finding that as we're as our apps are
scaling and we really need to jump to
read us and using q no now the question
is do we do we just make that thing more
complex or we actually decide like chop
the Apple panel slightly different
patterns so hmm and you know like really
long ones using probably maybe there's a
third person out there in the world
using it but you know like we're not
playing on supporting it it's tough
thing and you know when we started we
thought maybe it could be a package that
will have a long life but maybe it will
you know but it's uh we have a different
architecture idea we're gonna kill that
one and go with the new idea so yeah
yeah we're be wary of new packages you
know you guys should take a look at the
node like there's a velocity has a
project called like long-running child
process or something like that and it's
all about spawning the velocity process
basically in a way that stays in sync
with the meteor parent process okay okay
could could be interesting to see where
that is long-running child process you
think oh yeah I think so I'll find a
link to it wait you know that this does
all bring up an interesting point you
know like we've never officially said
that we've deprecated account century
but in essence like nobody is really
paying attention I think it just hits my
inbox and I delete like I may read a
little bit of an issue but I basically I
don't have the time of the bandwidth to
keep up with it and I know you guys
don't really either and honestly you
know frankly a splendid doe however you
say his name Luka he's he's done an
amazing job with user accounts you know
he took he took the initial work that
you and I did rye and broke it out and
decided to build you know something that
was UI framework agnostic in the core
and then you just bolt on the piece that
you care about so yeah yeah I agree like
it was a great refactoring you know it's
yeah I'd say cap centuries i'm
officially deprecated right now but
we in we have like the to do to
officially deprecated Hader I had no
anyone wants to do that that's just like
wow it's like thankless work to
deprecate a package so yeah yeah and
plus it's kind of a huge thing what's on
the border of us of you but I think that
none of us are using it i mean i'm not
using with new projects in fact the
project you know like so i think i hope
it's in our boiler plate right now the
count century is still in there may not
even know i think well in though it is
in the main branch but not in the 10
branch okay anyone a gradual margin soon
so yeah yeah so anyway that's what's
called deprecated sufficient outs on the
podcast so it happens even more needs to
be done yes and watch the flow video
yeah alright so before i do the last one
real quick if you do have questions feel
free to cue those up because we'll be
there in four or five minutes alright so
the last post is about google analytics
and events for meteor i actually wrote
this I thought it was interesting
because now that we have this I don't
know like I guess it's been around for a
while but the idea of like a single page
app especially like you know I've got
multiple routes in this meteor app for
meteor jas club but I don't you know the
page in particular excuse me is one long
sales page and I wasn't sure how far
down people were reading you know and um
and so I love the you know after I got
it all implement and let it run for a
week or two you can see down to the
bottom I actually have a funnel and it
shows like four hundred and seventeen
people hit the top of the funnel and
like five people hit the bottom of the
funnel and though and all the drop-off
happens right at the very end of the
funnel like when they hit the bottom of
the page they just all go away and so
you know that that is a problem right
like that to me indicates that either
there's a problem with pricing like in
particular this class is 899
or there's a problem with the sales copy
or something but I loved it because I
was able to reactively just track where
they were by scrolling you know catching
the scroll event and then doing some
math and every time you hit a quarter
percent mark then I just fired off an
event to Google Analytics no you see the
meteor helped make this easier for you
or could you have done this at a yeah
just uh I would actually say you could
do this in any app with the the same
kind of code I wrote here yeah if
anything else it kind of sucks because
you can't really catch window events
very easily on like in a in a template I
had to wrap this in a meteor start up
and then do you know dollar sign IDs
jquery and catch the scroll event and do
the right thing but I was able to just
set a session variable and so this code
which lives in one spot fires on
multiple different pages so I can
actually track the scrolling percentage
on any page that I want yeah so that was
kind of nice yeah I think it's really
cool I mean obviously figuring out your
call to action as something that's not
going to scare away everybody is it's
always hard especially you know what you
ask for money and you don't a lot but
it's definitely asking the right
questions point you you know it's nice
to know that they are getting down to
that which you didn't know that before
for sure yes yeah it's cool funny it's
like when I saw your post I was like wow
this is like close to the kind of post
I'm doing next week around these are
cycle you know like I thought you'd like
this guy now you do you knew that it was
like you're printing me are you trying
to tear down these are still not getting
it is totally different use case like
this is for pre user narges all post
user greater sign up so right so yeah we
might actually use this because we're
gonna we're getting ready to change our
homepage to have a lot more content and
it would be kind of neat to know how far
down they get I try different ideas with
that so can you you can obviously slice
this for time to write so if you change
the design you can say show me things
only past this day yeah yeah absolutely
I could
so you can compare the funnel from
design a design be pretty easily yeah or
you can use their they've got a
analytics a be testing bit in there that
you can use as well so you could compare
like different calls to action and how
well those are converting that kind of
thing yeah yeah cool yeah that's great
yes Orton though you know I mean like
when you're building an app or we're
building a sales page are really
building anything like you should always
put these analytics in here because I
talked about I gave a different use case
in the beginning paragraph I think um
you know I had a client at having me add
what essentially was a blank slate modal
popup like when you were the first one
to come into something like a modal
would pop and they wanted to see how
many people were just dismissing that
modal or actually interacting with it
and so you know just firing two
different events into will they use
segments and I think most people should
use segment I posted this on boots
trappers da I oh I think it was and
someone said the I would totally use
segments and look into Mixpanel because
they don't require you to hack up fake
page views to get the fun of the work
properly so yeah well I mean even with
just testing scrolling you're saying
that somehow you're going to magically
get that know if they scrolled halfway
down or do you think they misunderstood
some aspect of your post well no they
they totally understood it the problem
is though at the bottom in order to get
the funnel to work you can't use events
you can't build a funnel off events you
have to decide to change those to be a
like a fake page view so now when I look
at that site I'm getting like anyone
that hits that page if they scroll all
the way the bottom it's looking like
four or five page views okay i see i see
it now yeah yeah alright gotcha so but
mixpanel you don't have to do that you
can just send the events and create your
own funnel that way and yeah kind of a
weird google analytics thing but yeah
yeah cool hack anyway yeah
yeah any did we get any questions from
the lives we audience did not
disappointed audience another setting up
one you should have made up a question
ah so Aaron nota asks okay yes yes why
did you watch a video yeah why didn't
you watch my video you jerks no no real
questions this time um but we did I got
another patreon patron we are getting
closer we're at seventy five dollars a
month Wow at 250 I'm gonna start another
podcast gonna be more of a round table
style podcast so we're getting closer
and closer and the shout out this week
gosh patreon sucks for like navigating
this thing uh I really don't want to
screw up this name either hey it was a
hard name don't y'all probably screwed
up anyway but yeah patreon oh hey we got
a question oh wow you see it uh-uh okay
now what is it if it's from Ben haha
he's a he's gonna be in my class next
week but if you had a pink kitty what
would you name your pet dog rye pink
kitty what would you name your hot dog
pizza pinky pets her actual dog's name
is less yeah the pink kitten is
irrelevant to that question so is
alright then go wash you guys level of
the audience we've got so I you know
it's funny he brought that up because we
totally regretted the other day like we
thought about it after the fact we
bought a chubby weiner dog right another
one no no the first one but thinking
back like we totally should have named
her Jabba the Hutt you know
yep all right good good talk Josh I'll
talk to you next week yeah alright
sounds good guys thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
