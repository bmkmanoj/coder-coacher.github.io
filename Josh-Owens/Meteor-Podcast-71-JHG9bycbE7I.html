twenty-first 2015 welcome meteor fans
i'm your host josh owens along with my
special co-host been Strahan playing a
musical co-hosts musical co-host oh
that's right we're jumping around yeah
right hasn't been on awhile maybe we'll
have him on that yeah yeah but shout out
to our recent meteor Club podcast they
had right that's right I'm not only on
it yeah that was an awesome one yeah we
can talk about that a little bit too cuz
we'll talk about astronomer yeah yeah
woot alright so this week we're gonna
talk about post brass and meteor meteor
react and ionic it's quite interesting
updates meteor and react tutorial
starting to see a lot more react stuff
popping up on crater this is so reactive
yeah and the AMA was Slava what cool he
quit today's his last day yeah that's
right this week I blew the whole story
that's it go home man yeah cool let's
kick this off yeah definitely postgres
postgres and meteor so i'm like i was so
excited when I saw this pop up because I
feel like I've actually been working on
a blog post it's gonna go up on air pear
and it's all about like how extensible
or like plug and play meteor actually is
under the covers and the one place that
we don't have a good story yet is the
database and you know I've been talking
to check corcos and he's been working on
that any DB stuff and kind of hitting
some snags and you know he put in a
ticket on the github issues and outlined
some of the things that he thinks needs
to change because there's some tight
kind of mongo integration into the
account login stuff and that's like not
good so
he needed to see that changed and so
like seeing that even as an experiment
actually Slava said he proposed working
on postgres as like his last project
working there and um you know I green
light yeah he got the green light to
spend two weeks on that and I can't even
say like they're working hard on this
like they are updating like all day
every day on this thing working around
the clock it looks like sashko and Slava
or kicking some butt on it and you know
just been kind of watching the commit
logs and like they're they're definitely
moving along at a good clip here in 10
minutes ago yeah here you go yeah 17
hours ago there was a commit message
just said make PG live query more usable
from the package so like I think they're
really honing in on finishing this up
and my guess is uh as a result will see
like some changes to the user account
stuff as well and like a little bit of
DDP stuff might be tweaked a little bit
but I'm super excited about this because
I feel like there's been you know
besides a little bit of maybe lip
service and some blog posts I feel like
no one's actually been working on this
and so to see this like all of a sudden
kind of crop up publicly like very
exciting so I'm stoked yes and I you
know I gotta say like these are smart
guys right like publicly this thing's
only been up for about a week let me go
back to older seven days ago they
started 10 days ago with an initial
commit and like I feel like they're
getting getting much much closer so cos
da ya then flawless Slava leaves other
other than Slav is leaving like it's
okay like I'm happy they're working on
and I'm sad that it took him leaving for
it to happen yeah right right
I don't know I had projects that i
really liked was trying to get done
before i left 20 your old job yeah and
didn't touch those projects again hmm no
yeah I don't think that's gonna be the
case but who knows like I don't know
what his his schedules gonna be like MIT
well I mean sashko is working with him
on it so I think there's some like it's
not like all the knowledge is
necessarily leaving you know and uh like
you can you can see actually think
sashko has a lot more commits overall in
the last couple days I'm just like being
evil right now yeah what my opinion yeah
it's it's never well I don't know maybe
it's a good time to take on an open
source project when you're leaving a
company that was paying you to do it
yeah maybe he'll continue to work on it
I wonder if he has any downtime like I
don't know and waiting yeah between
leaving for school and now yeah cuz I
just sent my kids off to school yeah I
think colleges tend to start a little
bit later though um I don't know like my
niece just started she's in san jose
going to college so she's already
started yeah hmm anywho Slava is gonna
be on east coast east coast what what I
he'll probably hate me for saying this
but we had a conversation it was kind of
funny we're going back and forth about
like when to do the AMA and uh like I
was like so does like 10 a.m. PDT work
for you and he's like how about ten a.m.
san francisco time I'm like that's the
same thing man good too funny uh what
what did he call MIT remember that blog
post I don't remember he's like MIT this
is an American College American
secondary institution or so
anyway funny ugly man we do uh September
ninth so yeah there must be some down
time I just I just looked that up on the
fly cool so I expect based on that him
having some down time I assume we'll
have finished postgres within a week oh
yeah totally yeah he's not allowed to go
on vacation or buy furniture for for his
new place I mean school if all right all
right let's move on you gotta you gotta
tight tight timeline yellow meteor plus
react plus ionic what actually this is
like an amazing amazing set of a blog
post on medium like Sam Sam corcos yes
doing he is a killing it holy cow and by
the way I'm love it that's chess brother
I don't know if you knew that yeah
they're actually related yeah I learned
from an earlier blog post i think or
earlier podcast i was i was on with you
yeah yeah so gosh like I'm super
impressed with these guys when I first I
saw this I'm like Mike ionic and then I
was reading through and I saw that they
were bringing in meteoric but and I
think you sent me a link of like part
6.4 so I went all way back to part 1 i'm
like what package are they bringing in
and the guy who made meteoric neck and a
bunch other like cool people they did a
smart job and they broke up new york
into blaze templates and then they had
the SAS separate from the blaze
components so Sam is just bringing in
the SAS oh okay and and so there is no
blaze complies uh templates coming in
mmm that's interesting yeah so don't get
thrown off by like meteoric like this is
like there's no funky react blaze kind
of stuff going on like this is a legit
react tutorial yeah yeah and super long
so I haven't gone through it but man i'm
going to put on my short list probably
this weekend yeah yeah I come on a walk
through it too cuz I didn't realize like
I
think he said it and maybe the post and
seeing part 1 did he say react was
involved yeah yeah okay yeah I don't
know why I didn't look at this I think
I've just been avoiding react but based
on what I'm seeing on crater I should
probably stop avoiding it I don't know I
think we should like sit down and had
like a psychological discussion tell me
what you really think about react let's
find that underlying issues here John
what what do you feel that way I've been
tell me more about your father it's
really all comes back to your mother
doesn't Yeah right oh goodness yeah I
don't know I think you know the thing
for me ah I don't we had a conversation
in the chatroom privately were we
talking about like I think I was talking
to you where we were talking about like
the fact that react spiked around the
time the react conference happened like
when you look at google trends like it
there's like a sharp spike upward and
like it's just kind of like stayed there
and I think you know we were was that
you i was talking to I remember
something along those lines yeah and
then so I started looking in like the
YouTube videos actually don't have a ton
of views on them so I'm not sure that's
necessarily true I don't know what like
around februari or January leg into
January like what caused that big spike
to happen but I definitely think that
react is is quickly gaining ground and
it's probably worth paying attention to
at this point well I mean we have blazed
we have angular we have react if you
want to become a more marketable
developer I would like right away like
use blaze if you want to like get things
out the door but more more market share
you want to have your knowledge really
grow like you got angular and react okay
so that's the conversation right there
mm-hmm and I going into the future like
where where would you want to
like what would you want to use angular
1 or react you know say you're like
coming at it straight gosh no qualms
about either one sounds like we're
talking about your other podcast now i
don't know if that that questions gonna
come up on haha well time the first law
growing a dev career um yeah i don't
know like i would probably just lean
towards react i've i've personally tried
angular wasn't super happy or excited
about using it didn't didn't feel right
to me right so yeah like I i would
probably lean that way just probably the
same opinion as you yeah so there you
into like an angular bootcamp didn't you
I did yeah ya did it on me um yeah I was
10 say anything but yeah it was cool is
on st. Louis oh it's more like a
traditional school experience for you
where you were skipping the real today
and what what is just kidding just
kidding alright know what I do not even
keep my yearbooks in this house my kids
coming across them and what was written
in it who's this guy did who is this
yeah who wrote this what it just yeah
anywho those were wild years what are
they talking about smoking grass what
just kidding that's like my parents term
for it yeah right holy geez goodness see
way everyone yo back factor what we're
doing yeah all right boo media react
ionic totally check out this this uh
these whole series of blog posts on
medium definitely yeah rocking cool
Sam's awesome me he's the he's the
brother that likes to document Chet not
so much
we love them both yes they're both doing
awesome or meteor community and another
guy that we love Rai Walker rye Walker
sometimes I love him sometimes not just
kidding he's a geek ha it is a good guy
mm-hmm uh no so yeah like I think you
know for a while there I was doing the
user cycle thing and then you know if
you listen to the we just did the meteor
club podcast with him this week and I
actually need to fix it the tweet was
wrong it pointed to the I think the
gaming why did it yeah and I didn't
catch it yes I have an assistant that
handles that stuff for me now and oops
yeah so rise making video games now yeah
ok ah so that's I i think if you want to
know like what they're working on that's
a good podcast to listen to but he you
know he's always been a big proponent of
blogging and him and i had numerous
conversations about it when i worked at
differential with him and you know he
kind of convinced me like I I had a sour
experience with bloggy at my first job
like my first real professional job and
got in trouble for talking about how I
felt about my workplace publicly um so
kind of turned me off but you know he
believes that serendipity and like good
things can come from publicly talking
about the things that you're working on
I tend to agree with that now um I wish
I have more time to do it personally but
so this post is just all about like what
astronomer is and what they're working
on and you know how they're they're
trying to get into customer driven
development or I think maybe a different
way to say it would be like data-driven
decision I think that's a smart way to
put it as well like they have some
automatic instrumentation if you're
using a meteor app and all that and then
they can ship that data to other places
and systems can your listeners by the
way if you want to like hear from
eyes own mouth like all the awesome
stuff that they're doing listen to our
podcast it just came out podcast meteor
jazz club mm-hmm that one yes that's
right anywho okay I just stole your
thunder oh yeah I lost my train of
thoughts gone it's done no um I think
yeah I think they're doing some smart
things and he's gonna try to blog like
every week I don't know if this is fun
outing this or not but they got accepted
into angel Pat I believe and so they're
they're gonna be heading off for that
soon in New York City who dead is
awesome yeah so they're pretty excited
about that yeah I think I think that's
gonna be good stuff for them absolutely
I was really stoked or I wrote an
article when they got back from New York
and I'm that experience and man it
sounded like legit yeah yeah that's
awesome super proud boom that's great
yep yep Big Apple yep definitely and
like I said he's gonna keep blogging
about it on medium so follow him if you
want to get that stuff in your inbox
mm-hmm gotta follow him right now yeah
already was I'm just a fan now we dope
in Ben's not know I'm following them I
thought good okay next next more we act
too many tabs man Oh what react coming
up again what yeah what yeah yo meteor
and react tutorial a youtube video with
just about 40 minutes long by our boy
Ryan swap in the chat room yeah yeah
shout out to Ryan super smart guy yes
this is like the third or fourth kind of
posts on crater that's coming out of the
chat room this week pretty pretty proud
of that happening I think it's awesome
to see everyone kind of contributing

slack chat room yeah get a little hit
patreon.com media club right sign up a
join 10 bucks a month and killer what
how many people were up to you right now
Shh too many to count yeah is it like
close to 150 170 163 yeah so and man I
am impressed yeah but I mean they're not
like everyone doesn't pay to get in
there like I make sure that there's
experts in there as well so yeah experts
don't have ten dollars to blow ya know
that that made out of money anywho Ryan
put together this this awesome tutorial
using react and this was actually my
go-to tutorial to get myself up to speed
and watch their two times now and I
gotta say it's one of my favorite ones
so far and I want to go through the
other blog series that we just talked
about earlier so he knows they might be
battling for the type top spot but after
watching Ryan's video like I don't know
the gear start going you start thinking
how you can make your appt how to
architect it all the power that you can
do with react components and and your
meteor mixin
fun stuff yeah i mean i am pretty stoked
so anyway yeah just like good reviews
for this thing man yeah i only watched
watch about three three-and-a-half
minutes when i was getting a link to put
it on here and i'm definitely gonna sit
down and and finish it maybe this
weekend we'll see cuz I'm just um
everyone's like peaked my interest now
so well I really hope that Ryan does a
few more yeah well he just did one today
um and maybe we'll talk about it next
week but it was like meteor and cucumber
so he he took the training class from
Sam and I and I think it's awesome to
like see him like feeling comfortable
enough to put out a video on it so
that's awesome too yeah oops playing his
video now hope you guys can I hear that
I might have to pay him like the
grademark fuse or something oh yeah I
can't hear that you know because he's a
lawyer or he's training to be a lawyer
then that's something man someone should
become friends with like a startup
founders should become friends with him
early a developer was also going to have
is a his lawyers a bar whatever what's
it called a JD so my dad juris something
dress my well I'm not smart ok
jurisdiction is always trying to sell
know it's like lawyers they get like a
degree and it's like you know like how
there's MBA designation the yeah there's
like a JD designation for lawyers I
forgot what it stands for someone know
that anywho I learn don't have the story
so yo check out that tutorial super
awesome Brian you're awesome keep it up
in nice yeah thanks Ryan definitely
appreciate that all right so last story
of the day ah the AMA was Slava yeah I
definitely wanted to like say
a thank you to Slava like I I just
emailed him because we had talked about
maybe in August he would do the AMA I
asked him back in May they could have
sashko did his and I said why don't you
do one in June and he said I it's too
soon like there's not gonna be enough
interesting stuff to talk about cuz
lovett there's sashko talked about oh
okay he said 10 gmail me in August I
feel like he knew he knew uh so I him
held him out of the blue like it just
like popped in my mind like oh hey we're
supposed to do that with Slava so send
me mail get a response back he's like
yeah we'll do this day at this time I'm
like alright awesome and then like he
sends me an email a day later like well
this is gonna be loud sorry got my
window know what he probably watched
that driver probably watches your
podcast yeah and he knows exactly what
house you are now yeah definitely like
he passed look I don't hear it going now
are you can't hear now well I hear that
I hear the train I don't hear the siren
early yeah well he's only got a blow as
he comes by the the intersection oh
you're closely intersections okay who
knows is down okay well in my mind I'm
just gonna think he's trying to get you
out to get us that's what it sounds like
well I thought I commute but I was
talking and not you so when I take the
train down to Chicago sometimes it rains
like the inbound and outbound trains
like go side by side on the tracks and
they blow their horn at each other I
swear the train that's coming by just
like wait until boom it's like right
next to like where my ear is or whatever
and like just honks it again there's
always people on the train jumping out
of there since the little loud nice only
like a foot away from you yeah yeah so
Slava emailed me like a day later like
hey didn't put up the post yet I really
wanted to add something to it I'm like
all right so I got the post up and he's
like here I'm done with meteor next
week's one last week so can you can you
add this to it and I was like oh this is
terrible don't leave please like just
just stay around
we all look I know what you're really
thinking what's that you're thinking oh
hell yeah I just scored it am a what's
with Slava and he's leaving and this is
gonna make my AMA sins popular so much
more popular no that's really not
twisting nope not at all mmmmmm I know
you what is a marketing well as he said
it I thought well maybe he'll be more
honest with his answers yes okay that
can admit it I did think that but yeah i
don't i don't know if that's true they
were still lien honestly like he's as
far as i know like he's never pulled any
punches or anything like that so yeah
he's always been pretty blunt and
straightforward he's an authentic guy
yes definitely yeah rock and roll well
he's good is because any questions and
answers that really stood out to you um
yeah I'm just kind of like looking over
trying to refresh my memory here a lot
of questions about like why is he
leaving oh this one was good David
Sakura I hope I said that right a prize
said that terribly wrong asked him what
was the most fun thing that he worked on
and he said the mongodb observed driver
was really fun redis and rethink and
sequel observed driver experiments that
he did internally and then some of the
features he did for blaze which still
haven't shipped like the LED stuff and
all that and the indexing yep that's the
one I stood out to me as well yeah
definitely um and it was great to like
see the community just like supporting
him that's that's a lot of what I saw
just like people I congratulating him uh
you know being behind I'm saying hey you
did a great job like a lot of like a
huge like pat on the back I'm like
everyone and there it's like an awesome
you know joining an open source project
like that's like your dream kind of
like when you when you made it it's like
everyone loved them what you did so hats
off next time not gonna take my head off
I got a horrible haircut oh no I know oh
I went to an old-school barber for the
first thing I walked in there and the
barbers like oh who did your hair cut
before this is horrible so my wife did
my hair cut so right off the bat boom
they had experienced and he's like I'll
fix it don't worry he gave me a 50 year
old haircut I'm not gonna take my head
off haha well you could just have this
haircut dude I mean that's easy that's
the easy life right there yeah you know
sometimes I cut myself like I gotta cut
back here shaving it get so much money I
spent on this haircut cuz I got it
downtown Chicago ooh thirty dollars yes
at a barbershop yeah that's crazy dude
yes I could see like here paying like 15
bucks to go to a barber shop or
something but remember paying like when
I was a kid like seven or eight dollars
to go down to the barber shop and just
get a buzz like a flattop yes yes that
was all the rage that is what I had the
flat top back in the day Pam oh my gosh
were so old dude oh look there was a
comment in here about like we all know
like this guy said we all know you're
quitting cuz you're going full-time
starcraft pro yeah that was a good
morning like oh yeah i'm terrible at
starcraft he's like I try but 20 I'm
already has been like all the real
players are 16 to 17 I'm like oh my god
warm you so crazy I'm not finished guys
I'm done yeah yeah yeah what am i man
I'm just fried yeah I'm the burnt bacon
that no one wants to eat another
interesting thing he said is that so
he's waiting on two features to drop and
rethink d be some changes and they're
supposed to make it into 2.2 and
he he said he does want to like get that
published as soon as that's done and I
think that would be a pretty big win for
the meteor community as well especially
I mean I really like that and it's cool
to hear that he has and I think I knew
this before but he's in their slack
group the reasonable yeah yeah and that
he is the era era of the founder / CEO
or whatever's titles which is also his
name Slava as well well its distal of
the club I know right right off the bat
it's like they gotta listen to each
other so but good things to expect from
that so yes yeah yeah there was some
good comments to about like react and
blaze blaze to like and he pointed out
he thinks that there's some funkiness
and blaze that's left around because
they use handlebars and so he thinks if
they do a place to be like backwards
incompatible maybe some breaking changes
which is oppressing to maybe tonight yep
that was interesting his critical
viewpoints of his own code and yeah well
he pointed out like he still feels like
no matter what like Lay's will always be
faster to write an application out of
the box than any other any other way and
that's just because I think angular and
react probably encourage a little more
structure than then blaze does
necessarily so yeah i agree with that
which isn't a bad thing I mean you guys
measure what what you're trying to
accomplish yep yeah so all right dude
will thing coming on the show Oh filling
in a woman shop Dean's lame actually
Deen is out in Toronto is he in toronto
right now that's gone on it I think he

grow right yeah so the ask Abby and Ben
show we're going to take four questions

people aspiring to be developers and
we're going to just like answer them
super fast nice a lot of enthusiasm and
hopefully we're one hundred percent
right I don't know so I've got this
weird growth oh no that's not the type
of question you're talking about is it
