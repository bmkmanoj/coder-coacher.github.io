host josh owens along with a special
guest co-host today Chris alloy welcome
Chris hey how's it going good how are
you great yeah so um and then our guest
of honor today is Jen looper she is from
telerik and we're gonna talk a little
bit about native script welcome Jen
thank you very much I have to do a tiny
correction because we just unveiled are
rebranding no actually we're actually
I'm actually from progress oh yeah nice
yeah so I you know it's funny um I live
here in Cincinnati and they progress but
modulus yes hmm similarly on it right
after like the next quarter they bought
telerik so yeah they went on a little
buying binge Omega us and roll roll base
modulus and some other folks and I think
the M&amp;amp;A uh era is over so now it's a
question of like getting everybody on
the same page yes yeah pretty cool it's
exciting yeah um why don't you tell us a
little bit about native script and what
it is sure let me just introduce myself
my name is jen and i'm on the developer
relations team at at progress and i work
actually my specific role is working
with telerik products by progress so i'm
on that branch and I report out of the
wall fam office which is the old telerik
office telerik has roots in the.net
community but we've recently gotten very
much ingrained in the JavaScript midday
so I'm kind of on that side and
specifically within that role I'm
working on the mobile side so I was
hired as kind of like mobile person
because I have a large apps portfolio
really love mobile apps I have a
weakness on downloading the hell man and
so I'm evangelizing specifically for
telerik platform but I tend to talk a
lot about our newest product which is
made a script and native script is where
that you can write truly native apps
using javascript XML and CSS if you want
to you can also bring in angular 2
which is the unveil that we just did at
ng-conf we released meter script too
along with their unveil of angular 2 so
it's been a very very exciting couple
few weeks ahead progress and on the
telerik side so and native script is
kind of the branding looks a little bit
separate if you visit nitta script org
you'll see it's you know different
colors it's very blue there's not much
mention of progress or telerik but we're
all in the same happy family so that's
the story you know so I'm happy to
answer any question specifically about
native script you're looking to build
mobile apps it's a really nice solution
to help you along yeah so I guess um you
know it's funny like I hadn't heard of
native script before but I was talking
to Todd motto who works with you and we
were talking about doing an angular like
one versus two comparison and he's like
you may want to talk about native script
and so I started poking around and
looking at it and it actually looks it
looks pretty cool um you know I'm
putting on a conference in July which is
focused on building mobile apps with
JavaScript and so it really kind of
piqued my curiosity like what what kind
of like big success stories have you
seen people like they've built and
deployed something that's become popular
in the store have you yeah so I'm well
if you go to Niger script org and click
on the showcase this button you'll see
some apps two of those are actually mine
so I can't say that they're blockbusters
but there's like these things you just
build and release um our big the thing
about our client base tends to be a sort
of the enterprise so a lot of our stuff
is kind of walled behind you know
privately distributed walls but I big
success story which we talked about at
ng-conf this actually were working with
Kiva I don't know if you're familiar
with Cuba it's a way to do micro loans
to individuals or groups and it's just
loan so that they'll pay you back back
eventually but it's a charitable
organization and their new mobile app is
going to be built in native script and
our partner wrangle is working with us
and working with them to build this app
and they spun up an appt within four
weeks and native script to get sort of
the flow of the microfinance
you log in you look at your money that
you have in your basket or add money and
then you designate whoever you're going
to loan it to and then you can watch it
kind of filter back I love Cuba because
I I started donating to them with just a
hundred bucks and now i have like nine
hundred dollars worth of loans that have
come back and forth and back and what's
amazing like you could just watch your
your impact grow its really great
success story and it's really a pleasant
for me to to see a nap you know built in
native script you know for Kiva but
we're also working with some larger
companies um I don't know if I'm allowed
to say names but enterprise e-type
companies we have a small shop called
the app is called smart share and i
think the shop is called smart and it's
a social networking that's on this
showcase so that's something to look at
but if you want to take a look at how
NATO script feels as a nap if you go to
the App Store and download it's called
examples native script I think that's
what they called it and that is a great
app to just download and just feel the
lack of lagging us that you're going to
feel with the nature script app so
that's a nice a nice thing to play with
it shows you the charts and all of the
fun things that you can do with our UI
components that's really good yeah
understood how would like how would I as
a as a JavaScript developer come in and
start using something like native script
is it right currently my background any
of the development I've done it's been
primarily with meteor and deployment to
mobile has been through Cordova and you
know that that kind of that workflow and
it works but you know there's no he's
there's it's it's not it doesn't have
that native Native you I feel that you
get right iOS and Android using native
components yeah how would I used where
would I start do you strike well I
actually was involved in writing writing
the getting started guide for the native
script version for plain JavaScript so
this two ways of doing edge script one
is plain vanilla JavaScript with CSS and
all that and then there's the angular 2
flavor which has a whole different
integration but bottom line that the
hardest thing with native script I've
always found is the installation once
you get past that you can you can really
go to town and the trick with it is is
that you need to have xcode
an Android toolchain set up I've
actually maybe I'm just given up on the
Android tool chain and I just used a
motion it was buoyant on my mac i'm so
tired of dealing with it but there are
some new one line scripts such
especially windows users can use that
really simplifies the installation
process so that i actually need to spin
up my pc and see if i can just like
slamming the one line and see if that's
going to work so once you get past the
installation though you need to get your
workflow set up and on my mac i use
Visual Studio code uh-huh I don't know
what ideas you all are using i use Adam
okay Adams a lot yeah we're actually
working on getting snippets for native
script on Adam we are we already have
them for Visual Studio code so one of
our community members has has created
these awesome snippets we all do I think
they're available for sublime and then
if you're on PC the Visual Studio code
folks are well-served because we always
have good good relations with the the
Microsoft group so yeah get your
workflow set up get your tool chains
installed get the installation done and
then you can just start writing on with
vanilla version of NATO script you're
going to be right like hand coding a lot
of JavaScript and you have some
flexibility in how you organize your
code so like I tend to create folders
and put all of my code in folder folders
for each page of my mobile app if you're
using angular however your decisions are
simplified a little because you can just
follow the way the angular system wants
you to do things so if annular says I do
this I just continue down that line you
don't have enough to worry about so
that's kind of a simplification but once
you get down you know all of that those
initial setup tasks completed you can
really go to town and what's interesting
to me is that I would have thought that
a technology like this would be for more
advanced users who kind of maybe have
tried the Cordoba system maybe have you
know even tried a little of native
development but I'm seeing like kids at
universities jumping on board and just
like going straight today to script a
little my gosh really okay it's awesome
yeah so it's nice to see maybe I do
maybe I'm just like old and stupid and I
can like what but um yeah they're just
jumping on board like yeah we're getting
like spinning up mobile apps in new
scope and Java scripts awesome yeah yeah
that's in try
seemed to me because I think there's a
big difference between how like I look
at how my kids are growing up versus
like how I grew up right like I had
Natori 800 and then I had a 486 computer
and like you know I didn't have a phone
I could do those kinds of things but
like my kids first introduction to
technology is like an iPod or an iPad
and then Apple TV and you know they they
start to get into a computer but not
nearly as much as like I did when I
first got started so yeah it's very
interesting and it's moving incredibly
fast as you know like I have a sophomore
and a senior in high school and they are
literally two generations like my older
daughter uses Facebook my younger
daughter won't touch it they both use
snapchat but like my older daughter was
a later like jumped on to it later is
very interesting like and you have to
kind of understand like the nuances of
these communities and try to reach out
to them in different ways yeah yeah so
um back to the kind of like how to build
the app I'm kind of curious like you'd
mentioned you can just use CSS like what
what is designing an app look like when
you're using native script mmm um so
right now if you're going in and your
hand coding it on your local using the
CLI I'm you're responsible for the look
and feel we do have a library called
native scripts UI which is helping
that's a paid product that's one of the
ways we're monetizing the product but
sneak peek we're going to be launching
some nice skins and help helps to get
people to just not worry so much about
hand coding all the styles for there
because I think that is that's one of
the things that really made I onic take
off because you always could spin up
something that looked right no matter
what and that's been something that we
didn't do initially that we are going to
start spinning up because I think people
are really requesting it they really
like fuse tools for example another nice
solution they have their their apps
always look beautiful so I think that
that's you know your first touch point
with an app is to make it look great so
we're working very hard to spin up these
great skins and great solutions to make
your
right but in terms of the actual CSS
that you're writing your hand coding we
offer a subset of CSS you can always
change the colors and the the fonts we
support font awesome you can use animate
you can use actually keyframe animations
now it's kind of amazing better
translate to native but some parts of
CSS are not supported for example I like
sub selectors I think there are some
like the more esoteric elements of CSS
are not yet supported but if you go to
the docs you can see what's available
for the most part it'll get you where
you need to go yeah like I'm looking at
one of the showcase apps and it looks
like it's using material you I basically
as the kind of the design I mean that's
that's what it looks like to me so I'm
assuming that's that's maybe what it's
using yeah somebody are released some
styles actually someone released a redo
of the ionic style so you can make your
native script up look like an ionic and
we're working on getting the material
design sort it out with plugins and yeah
this is something that that you know the
world is your oyster it's all wide open
but some people prefer to have a little
bit more of a lockdown skin so we're
working on those things yeah that's nice
I think that's like to me the thing that
as like not a designer like I'm terrible
at it but like I look at react native
and think you know well I could build a
mobile app over here but I feel like you
know I it uses a smaller subset of CSS
but I can't really say like oh I want to
rely on bootstrap or a material design
so I can't really pull those in and in
full building something from the ground
up like I asked I need to be much better
at CSS so yeah jelly i think and and i'm
not the best designer either and it's
just like if you can bring something in
that will help you you know that would
be big money win yeah totally so the any
i'm just i'm looking through and reading
and so it you're writing in javascript
when it's actually running on the on the
device it's running at like in the
native environment so you
it's not like a few layer like a web
layer that's running on your phones that
right is a proper yeah you know it's
kind of weird to get your head around it
took me like ages um but it's a runtime
so it's not like xamarin titanium those
are cross compilers so there's some
magic going on as you're building react
native is a rapper Cordova runs in a
webview so that's a degree entirely on
but with us we're a runtime so it's
basically and getting into the width of
how that all works is a bit of a mess
but we have documentation and good
articles on how all this works but
basically you are writing in JavaScript
and then the runtime is translating what
you want to say draw me a is button draw
me an Android button in the runtimes
it's a different solution that's aiming
to solve the same problem everybody else
is solving which just get away from that
web via right right so what used a new
style just like an example of a button
how would you style that button if you
wanted that button to be a color you
styling that in CSS and that's getting
translated to the native exactly exactly
yes so there's a couple ways to style it
you can have external style sheets that
cover your entire app you can have
platform specific style sheets you can
do in line styling you could do in line
styling with platform specific so it
depends on how deep into the into the
customization you want to get but what I
like to do is have general styles out
the app level so I have appt CSS and
then I import platform CSS just for
those little tweaks that you need to
make and then within each folder like
for my login page I'll have log in XML
that's the presentation tier login jas
thats the code behind file and then a
log in CSS which has this little extra
bits that only pertain to the login page
that's kind of how I structure the code
base in a vanilla JavaScript sorry
native scripture app what is that what
is that XML that markup layer what do
you define in that in you know in that
example net login page in that file in
that folder what are you defining in
that XML file right so what you do is
your drawing out the modules so NATO
script abstracts away some of the native
code that you would otherwise be writing
an objective C or Java
if you need to write a button you're
just doing like Open bracket button
class equals my pretty button and then
put a tap function on its then that tap
function is handled in the code behind
file so you guys just I think it's a
little bit like zamel I'm not a samurai
developer but it's basically you just
designate the layouts and the elements
that you want on your page give it some
tap functions or some some onload
functions and all of that stuff is
handled in your code behind Oh
interesting you want to look at sample
code there's plenty uh I could find if
there's a chat I would like walk you
through but I can I can others a chat
yeah you can you can paste a link in the
chat or something okay but anyway wait
what do was a shout out so people can
walk walk through yeah definitely yeah
include that link in there and we can
put in the show notes sure um yeah I
thought that was kind of interesting to
lake when I was first looking at it like
it's it's all xml and it's one of those
things like you open it and you're like
you see xml I don't want to do XML but
like you look at it you realize like
html5 is really just XML under the car
so like it really isn't that different
um and like when you look at and the guy
I've looked at react native code as well
and it's like it's it's kind of the same
thing right like you're building
components and it looks a heck of a lot
like XML so are they using a look at
xmltype markup to I've never never uh
it's not XML but it is like you're
basically just building HTML components
but they're like they're different right
like they have like component like text
components and input components and
those kinds of things so okay yeah it's
just like at first glance they they can
look pretty pretty similar um I thought
that was interesting like you know my
gut reaction to XML is like ah yeah I
didn't Tina bad yeah and you don't have
to do the whole thing in XML like I have
a there's a game that i have in nato
script called this or that and that's
basically all it is is in the XML is
just a stack layout open and close and
then I do the entire develop
of the web view from the code-behind
file so you just like dynamically lay
out the images that you want so that's
another way if you need to listen for
taps on certain images that you
dynamically laying out you're going to
want to do that in the code behind file
so there's different ways to do it but
honestly once you get used to it it's
not so bad yeah yeah is that are you for
like the data layer is there I wanted to
you know just am I using that like the
native iOS data storage functions or how
would I you know how my storing data and
handling that type of those problems
right yeah so there's many ways to do it
depending on which solution soup but do
you jump on to I've done so telerik has
our own ever live date of data service
is basically sending is a REST API
service oh you're just sending out
queries and you're getting back
responses if you want we also handle
offline usage but a great plug-in that
one of our partners developed is for
couchbase so and they handle the offline
usage beautifully we can also use I've
done the sample groceries app I flipped
it to use firebase so that has that
beautiful real-time like you have the
two apps open your kids grocery list in
your grocery list and you can you know
see the items coming dynamically down
without a pult refresh so that's
beautiful in terms of storage we have
plugins for I know we have plugins for
local storage and we have plugins for
sequel light so you can have this sort
of stored locally lots of different ways
to handle depending on your use case and
how you want to to manage your app are
those kind of abstracted away from the
writing the native iOS format as well I
would define that in something like the
xml file or in the the J's file yeah you
would just bring it bring in the plugin
using a require and then you would use
the methods that the plugin has
designated that you should use like you
know store data render offline pull it
in bring back online that sort of thing
I haven't tinkered too much with a couch
base solution but I I'm going to give a
talk at dev teach for firebase and I
need to I need to get that working with
the angular integration so that'll be
really fun I think
cool my guess is like since it's just
JavaScript you could then just rely on
any of those tools for the external
dependencies like far away so one could
bring in like mini Mongo and DDP and
like connect to a meteor back end if
they wanted to yeah somebody is working
on an 80 script c'mon up meteor
integration right now it's gonna be real
interesting um I need to actually get
one of my apps off of parse I think I
think of it makes it kind of sick and I
think I'm gonna put it on Azure and yeah
we have a plug-in for azure so I think
that'll be really great because anytime
i need like a CDN type thing so the nice
thing about native script is that it's
all open source and there's a big
communities so if you don't want to
write a plug-in hop on slack I just got
somebody to write me up me a plug-in for
keep I'm like anybody want to write a
plug-in for me like nice yes interesting
so uh one of the other things that I
noticed is that you guys have a site
called native script snacks that's my
site yeah yeah I i thought i saw you
tweeting about it um what what is that
exactly um so yeah I seem to be obsessed
with food or at least the nato script
team is because it's either groceries or
snacks so yeah the idea behind a
discrete acts was that we my my manager
Burke started creating little four
minute videos on how to do like a login
screen or how to do a local storage or
that sort of thing or how to handle
observables and he made 10 videos and we
realized you know we really should spin
up a website to to handle this stuff so
it's been progressively growing I think
I have 30 videos and snippets right now
my goal is to have 70 by the end of the
year um and it's split into two so you
can either have short videos or even
longer videos or code snippets so what I
tried to do is give a little visual of
what's what this what we're building and
then have xml JavaScript and CSS
available for people to just grab and
paste in I'm trying to divide the
snippets and the videos by whether
they're for angular or not for angular
so that's the other option and I'm think
I'm gonna
hands the snippet so that you can just
download the whole thing as a bundle so
that'll be a nice thing for people just
like slapping your app and go everybody
likes to just copy PES let's face it
yeah yeah i still have rails apps that
are out there that have rails cast like
copy and pasted snippets oh absolutely
really yeah you know it's funny um I
actually picked up I love the name
native scripts tax because I I picked up
a similar name I picked up meteor snacks
it was thing Oh a similar thing but put
it can I put that on the shelf for now
but yeah I love that idea oh yeah i mean
the code it's all on my github so if you
want to just grab go ahead nice nice
awesome so I mean what's it I'm kind of
curious to like what's it like being a
dev relations person like what what's
your day-to-day job look like it's funny
because that's the question I asked when
I was being interviewed I asked my
colleague TJ was doing an interview like
TJ what's your day to day and he's like
oh my god I'm like what is it not right
um it kind of depends on the time of
year for some reason see we do a lot of
conferences so it seems like May was an
insane time for conferences and now it's
slowing down a little bit over the
summer and then it'll pick back up in
September so you have your travel
schedule kind of like smoothly rolling
over the year and you're getting ready
to give talks and work booth but I am
working a lot on an evangelizing
platform I'm supposed to be doing that
and I tend to get sucked into native
skipped a lot so I'm slack with the
community a lot because I really love to
do that so the great thing about being
Deverell is that you can kind of work to
your skills some people are great at
writing these blockbuster articles on
telerik developer network that got three
million views I was able to do that once
because i called it I call the article
JavaScript engines for idiots and people
just went ham so I if it's a click video
article apparently get a lot of clicks
but yes it's a lot of writing speaking
traveling schmoozing dealing with people
above dealing with the community and
trying not to
do stupid things on Twitter yeah what
are the is it the targets for her native
script just iOS and Android mainly yep
at the moment we're also we have a proof
of concept for Windows universal if
you're a Windows developer you might be
interested in that sort of thing with we
were looking at Windows Phone and that's
a little bit back-burnered yeah but as I
know nothing about Windows or Windows
development I yeah if I get lost there
is it is that so is that would you is
windows universal like a phone and a
tablet thing or whatever they call their
tablets I think it might be like it
would play well on the surface that sort
of surface that's it yeah yeah I think
so i feel like Google Google yeah persol
for those guys you're like guys like
enjoy yeah coming soon oh cool yeah
let's talk a little bit more about the
angular 2 integration like what what's
that look like and I mean that's angular
tues like almost ready to release right
yeah they at ng-conf they announced
release candidate they are working and
very hard on getting this to be released
completely and I think they're working
on the router at the moment so this is
this is something we're also waiting on
because we're heavily dependent on
whatever they do and we need to support
them so yeah we're just trying to you
know keep in line with a Google team and
we meet with them weekly so we've as
soon as they announced that angular 2
had decoupled Dom then we just jumped on
it cuz we're like oh my gosh angular 2
is no longer a framework it's a platform
at this point so we can really start
building on it and if you get away from
the time you can start building native
apps on it desktop apps so that's really
exciting um but yeah so we're just kind
of like following as best we can waiting
for waiting for that final release and
spinning up as many sample apps as we
can we're working on getting the size of
the app down and concomitant lay the the
load time right now there's a there's a
sample app that we released at ng-conf
really really fast a wind chimes appens
done in angular 2 it's
give a talk about using angle itude on
the web to create wind chimes and we
spun it up to a native script up like
with really really quickly people have
said some really late for a small app
it's a large app sighs and it loads slow
so those are the two things we're kind
of really working on we're using webpack
to get the size down but you don't need
to have you know the entire gigantic
angular framework you know bundled into
your app you can you know compress pick
and choose so those are kind of our
goals and if you know app is so big it's
going to take a while to load up so
that's something we definitely are
working on yeah chopper I know like
webpack can let you do like code
splitting and that kind of thing which
would would certainly help actually I
ran across something this week called
roll up j/s um the moment that looks
really interesting too because it talked
about tree shaking which I hadn't heard
before but it's the idea like they can
figure out pieces of the code that
you're actually using that you're
importing and relying on and pieces that
you aren't and they'll only include the
pieces from the files or the you know
the library you're relying on that you
need and like you can really slim down
that bundle size as well so that's
definitely something that we should be
looking at I'm looking at it now looks
great i'll pass this over to the team
they probably all over it but you know
just like just in case yeah yeah we got
like browser if I roll up jas webpack
they're all trying to solve this problem
of like gigantic ml to cut down yeah
that's I mean that's the biggest problem
I find especially with like a meteor app
is just the the size of the initial code
that you're sending down is just so
large like looking at cratered i/o which
I run it's like you're sending over
almost two Meg's of JavaScript to a
device and when you don't have phone
like that's it's just kind of a terrible
terrible experience because not only do
you have to like wait for it to download
but then you actually have to wait for
the phone to kind of process through and
load it all up so yeah I mean I look at
it as like essentially you're charging
your customer because you're asking
someone on their data plan
today you know download your thing and
I'm like oh that's just not nice so yeah
any there's also this concept of apps
inning mm-hmm and I'm not as I'm not a
hundred percent sure I understand
exactly what that is but I wonder if
that would work with this that's a on
iOS like were you isn't that where you
kind of strip out like if you're running
an iphone 6 you'll strip out the ipad
bits from your app i think yeah that
makes it what is it that's but i think
that's what it there's another concept
to called streaming which is like
sending them just the initial bits to
get everything loaded and then as they
need things like it's being sent down
from the app store as well so yeah the
idea right is that kind of what the
apple TV does with a lot of its apt it
seems like as it has a smaller yeah
maybe storage I don't know I'm not built
one for the Apple TV yeah actually
somebody did spend up native script for
Apple TV it seems like way early i was
like wow what do you guys do it that's
awesome because i think like that's one
of the things that almost annoyed me
when the apple TV came out is like it
doesn't have any kind of web view and
therefore like it can't be cordova
target at all so yes yeah you gotta
throw out what you feel is all that
knowledge that you had before and is now
is media or making use of a webview I
haven't done me I haven't touched me
here for ages uh yeah so they have they
do they use Cordova they have Cordova
integration so you can add a platform
like iOS and Android and then you can
run the build and it'll just build it
using Cordova and I think with 1.3 they
upgraded to the latest versions of
Cordova so like on iOS 8 9 you'll get
the WK web huge oh yeah nice hey that's
great nopes I always had I always have a
soft spot for media I just thought like
I remember when they first came out and
was it's just such a great way to just
spin up a quick web app and films it's
just really fun yeah yeah yeah it was
it's not anymore I was so we're back
home yeah well they went to a more paid
paid solution i guess uh well no they
have their hosting which is quite
um they're like it's it's weird because
they're they're moving to be more node
like I guess and so they're starting to
have kind of like a an actual
integration with NPM rather than through
their package system you can directly
pull NPM packages in now which is it's
nice but at the same time like you know
I think there's there's gonna be like
the next version of 1.4 doesn't look
like it adds a lot of features like
they're just really upgrading the latest
version of node latest version ampm it's
like you know I think there's gonna be a
little bit of pain as they transition to
be more like other note frameworks yeah
a lot of the magic kind of went away a
lot of the interesting magic that made
things work uh yeah I remember that's
simple stuff but it it makes sense
because that's how it needs to scale you
know you you don't want all that magic
when you're building something big you
know when you're doing small you know
demo or something like that is awesome
yeah I remember for hackathons a lot of
people were jumping out of fracas yeah
yeah that way back in the day is it is
there a company behind it yeah yeah
meteor development group but you know
for them they're also I think maybe it's
a realization that that was a small play
for them so they're shifting a lot of
their focus into graph ql and building
an implementation of graph ql that
eventually may allow you to do real-time
kind of data syncing through vacuo so
that's the big better i guess graph ql
is it targeting sort of games at all or
like it data viz uh no I think it's just
just a data solution so whatever
whatever you want to use it for and
they've got like on the client side
basically it's just gonna handle kind of
like the client-server communication
piece through the graph ql like
implementation and they'll use redox on
the client side to kind of hone all that
data store for you it looks like i mean
it looks like Redux like they're even
using the redux like if you want to do
angry
or something like that you can still use
redux oh yeah I see there's a there's a
whole thing on blaze angular reactant a
few who uses what there's a hole like a
discussion I don't know there's just so
many so many frameworks that people can
ya pick from and angular 2 is not the
same as angular 1 at all you know so
it's just like there's just a lot to
learn on the other hand we call that job
security so yeah exactly exactly like
JavaScript fatigue is really it is it is
all the other hand first real problems
right we're so lucky to be employed and
having fun yes exactly no for me like
it's it's great too because like I was
just talking to the creator of UJS and
hopefully he'll come on the show soon so
like we've had people talk about react I
know people talking about view angular
so like for me it's a great way to like
meet people and talk all this exciting
technology so well I think that the the
real benefit of all of this stuff is the
communities around it like I used to
evangelize for Corona SDK before I was
anywhere near telerik progress and the
community was just a super-g into indie
gamers indie game duh like just people
trying to create you know the fun cool
thing and and I see that with newsroom
to see this great community being
generated and that's that's that's
exciting and it was nice to see the same
thing at angular at ng-conf with the
angular community there's a great tweet
that said angular is dead and there's
like monster panorama of Angie cucas
singletrack conference of this 1500
people like you know with their eyes
glued onto the Kino angular's did like
now the community will always you know
if the community is awesome then I think
that the framework or the platform will
be a will be a win so yeah good fun
alright well I think that was that was
kind of all i had today oh did you have
any other questions Chris no no I that's
awesome it's something i want to check
outs tomorrow and it seems is that the
target kind of the larger corporate
enterprise type developers and is that
may be why it hasn't really been on my
radar because i'm kind of the opposite
of that i'm just a small guy you know
doing smaller things ah one of the
challenges that we've had of course is
that of course we're competing against a
facebook for um for you know market
share and on the other hand i think that
there are enough people who are looking
to solve this problem that i think we're
going to be picking up especially with
our integration with angular 2 i think
that's what's really going to make
native scripts start to be on people's
radar screens i think that yes yes we
are targeting the enterprise but we're
also targeting those small shops so
anybody who's interested in using this
you know they can use the open source
solution and will support you know from
bottom top to top whoever needs to use
to use native script for sure which is a
very vague answer to your question no
it's good but fair enough i know that's
that's probably good response right
because I remember like Twitter before
it was a thing like was just there was a
rail shop building oh do and then they
built this little twitter app using
rails and like nowadays it's not using
rails but at the same time like you want
people to feel comfortable using that
technology and diving in and creating
things cuz you never know what's gonna
stick to the wall so to speak yeah for
sure and I think that like what will
really make your and I saw this with
corona sdk what would really make your
framework or your platform stand out as
having that what we call a unicorn app
for Corona SDK was this kid who was 12
and he built a blockbuster came this is
green away early in the in the it was
called bubble ball and it just like was
huge because it was one of the only
things out there and he was it was a
great story was a kid building and
like made Corona SDK that was like that
was there unicorn for us i think our
unicorn is finally going to be keifa so
we're really excited about thats people
be able to i'll be able to use cuba
downloaded it'll have a lot of usage and
a lot of eyeballs are going to be seeing
you know how performing this this is so
once we get that in the app store money
nice coffin alright so now we've come to
that point of the show where we do our
picks and this this can be anything that
you know enhances your life it doesn't
have to be related to tech we I think I
think been my old co-hosts stole this
idea from JavaScript jabber so um yeah I
don't know who wants to go first I'll go
okay mm-hmm so um productivity tool I'm
using Wunderlist all the time do you
guys use Wunderlist I used to do issed
I've been trying to I don't Arawak time
yeah I have to at this point because i
have to do reports every month on what
I'm what I'm up to second thing that
somebody pointed me to at ng-conf
actually at the booth is mu mitts mo-om
like zoom but with em and it allows you
to position your windows on your screen
by just mousing over that green button
in the browser and it'll like tell you
which squares on the quadrant you just
wanted like automatically size your
windows too I don't know I just find
this incredibly helpful especially for
um for webinars or anytime have to share
my screen and I don't wanna look like a
complete fool nice ya know this is this
is cool layout yeah if ten bucks but I
think it's worth it you know I think
I've got something similar called better
snap tool um it's just got points like I
can drag something up to the top middle
of my screen and a full swing um so it's
similar but I actually think I like my
legs better yeah it's really helpful and
then the third completely useless thing
well not useless I actually I'm very
diligent is Nicolette sume have you
downloaded this app on the app store
it's a it's it's from Japan it's a cat
collector you
you feed them and you give them toys j5
thanks for the stairs like nakatsu yeah
that's what this app but it's one of
those things like my bosses Europe no I
wit all my gosh it was I'm actually
inspired by am I create something
similar um but my boss was so you know
when's the last time you downloaded a
mobile app and you really become
addicted to it not go ahead sir my
that's the one nice yeah i'll have to
check that out i think my my daughter at
loves apps on our phones apparently oh
I'll jump in next so I just I just redid
my office it's pretty thank you I like
my wife and I were finding like we
worked in the same office we both work
from home and it was just it was too
hard with me doing video calls and stuff
so she took over another room in the
house and like I got to inherit all this
great art right here and it's like all
the spaceships from sci-fi movies and TV
show so Wow I don't don't underestimate
the power of like having nice
decorations around you making making
your room feel great thanks cool I've
been so the last couple months I've been
playing with quadcopters or some people
call them drones yes I can slowly kind
of like really getting into it's a lot
of fun and it's amazing what you can get
for your money the one that I would
recommend on amazon is a syma x5c i
think i seen by x 5 x and it's just a
ton of fun and it's a great like
entry-level quadcopter and it's just go
to a big field and learn how to fly that
it's it's a lot of fun it's just a you
know it's it's it's pretty neat it's
amazing how fast and how you know
acrobatic these things are and it's
crazy it sistema x5c explorers with yes
hey okay camera yeah you can get that
the camera is you know it is what it is
it's a it's a fifty-dollar quadcopter
with a camera on it but the camera is
fun but it's not you know it's not the
not the greatest game in the world
definitely fun to see a picture you know
your roof or something okay gonna buy it
yeah it's totally like getting all right
now it's a good price right yeah it's
awesome and it's a good like entry-level
starter it's not too hard it's not too
easy it can go fast it can do crazy
flips and 90 degrees in your house and
it doesn't break it's awesome it's fun
yeah I'm kind of I'm gonna pair it drone
yeah is it go on sale yeah that was a
lot of fun I got that so I could start
playing with like controlling a via node
and that was a lot of fun too oh nice
but i found out that down that hole for
a little while i'm totally jealous of
like sometimes I watch Casey nice death
on youtube like he's got that phantom
man that thing is ridiculous it is it is
it's it I actually had one and I wound
up sending it back oh did you I couldn't
it it's so stressful having that up in
the air it's like fifteen dollars and
Mike it it's awesome but it's also
stressful and I just I don't know I
wasn't there yet I might might revisit
it in a couple months but you can't I
was looking into doing some aerial
photography as a commercial business but
I can't without a pilot's license right
now it's really had so really like a
real like sitting in a plane and be a
pilot so I don't know if I'm that into
it that I want to learn how to actually
be a pilot so I'm gonna wait on that
that struck late with the forty dollar
two boys for a little while yeah so fine
yeah that's but something I've been a
distraction for the last six months or
three months actually since it snow
melted here uh yeah so it's great yeah i
just bought it enjoy them cool the true
power of the recommendation yes yeah no
I mean the price is right right yes
definitely I might have to get it just
so my kids can play with it yeah yeah my
kids are five and they they want to but
it's it's hard to you know not quite
there yet it i think though there have
been watching and kind of learning what
i do and it's so easy to just you know
fly up to the ties it goes and then have
it disappear so ha nice alright well
