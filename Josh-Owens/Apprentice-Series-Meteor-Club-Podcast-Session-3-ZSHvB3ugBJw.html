apprentice series this is what session
number three for working on the meteor
club podcast website which if you've
been following along we've co-opted the
the new mediator podcast website and
we're changing it for our needs to be
the mediator club podcast so we have
somewhere where you can go and see the
the latest and greatest stuff about the
media podcast a lot of people like I'm
getting confusion on Twitter like if I
don't have itunes how do I listen to the
podcast and we've got an RSS feed but
like there's no good way to publish that
except for to put together website in my
opinion so true story yeah and so
Colby's joining me again welcome Colby
what's up alright so let's dive into it
we've got a pull request and then maybe
we can get into writing some code as
well so you share my screen stop one can
you see my screen all right I can it's a
one zoom in once at me for the viewers
may go there we go oh that's good yeah
okay be nice and clear about it and I
media zoom in on the code to is that
readable that is readable okay over
there we go nice eyes all right I think
we're ready to go turned off my
notification so I can be a good pair to
shut down slack so I don't drive colby
nuts with my notification haha yeah
alright um yeah so you actually paired
with josh from media club as well right
yeah we were playing around with my with
my other personal projects and i was
like hey you do you want to check out
this podcast up so we played around with
it right yes yeah so the pull request
yeah so you added a cron job to auto
answer
the latest episodes from the simple cast
API so we had kind of been talking about
that dancing around it and you guys went
ahead and worked on that hmm and so
there were a couple things that kind of
matter here one we're going to start
using a settings JSON file and that's
where you're storing securely storing
the API key which is awesome and that
means when we roll this to production we
can set an environment variable that has
that API key as well we don't have to
worry about checking that API key into
the code so mm-hmm you put that in the
get ignore which is good you added the
synced chron package right yeah i think
is a passable solution for what we're
doing here um see where's the sink cron
stuff let's clean to the server back yes
and I and I didn't move all of the
fixture stuff into the fixtures final
okay awesome yeah so here we've got uh
some meteor methods that are fetching
and you can see here we're using meteor
that settings that simple cast key which
is only going to be available in the
server environment so right it's an easy
way for us to get access to that and so
we're just kind of concatenated together
the API call and you're using the meteor
HTTP package to make these calls uh-huh
and it has a sink built in and stuff so
yeah a rapid succession thing yeah nice
okay so that part is if we're extending
it for another podcast site is a little
um I guess hard coded as far as the dark
because you can get the dark and the
light okay okay for now that for you
yeah we could we could move this to the
settings in probably like yeah that's
for the embedded player so it looks like
you call fetch an insert episodes and
then you fire up synchro
and every right now every one hour
you're calling fetch and insert episodes
as well and so that's just gonna take
the podcast idea if we have one in our
settings otherwise you're going to grab
the first ID mm-hmm from the API and
then you're going to call get episodes
with the podcast ID and that's going to
return all the episodes for that podcast
yeah it's gonna return an array of
podcast for that episode not for that
yeah okay and so then you're just using
underscore each you're looping over it
and then running a function here and the
function is just absurd each episode and
so initially there was some discussion
back and forth because you were doing
inserts and checking to see if this
episode ID already existed this is a key
that's coming from simple cast and I
said why don't you do an absurd instead
and it'll do the right thing it will
either one do the insert or to update
the episode and the side benefit of that
is that we're making it I guess there's
two side benefits were only made one
call and then also if someone were to go
in to the simple cast site and change
like the description or something then
every hour we're going to grab those and
do the the absurd and update anything
that may have changed so right I think
that's a nice side benefit there all
right so that all looks good um just
keep going here uh doesn't know bad yeah
yeah yeah that's a good point yeah we
did talk about that so we can look at
that again today on the hard-coded
itunes link so it looks like you did
some updating as well on the adding your
own episode so I don't know maybe I'll
maybe once I accept this we can show
that but basically you added
button to pull in the latest is that
code still here to pull in the latest um
I think we might have moved it out cuz
okay but basically since we're doing
automatically the the form you can go in
and add ID and it'll still update it
yeah yeah honestly I'm kind of wondering
do we need all all this jazz right like
can we just ditch the form now that
we're already operating we can ditch the
form if you want it's automatically done
so it's not really necessary and plus if
you remove the form you don't have to
now go back and build in like a link to
go to the form because right now we're
manually typing in the link to go
through right so you have like a sign in
that someone else would see it like what
is this for you yeah the only thing I
could see maybe being interesting is a
building out user profiles and
specifying people on the show and maybe
getting some nice like metadata around
each user and maybe even be able to
click on the user and like seeing what
episodes they've been on so like if you
clicked on my name you'd see that I've
been on all the episodes where as you
click on say you know if we have Paul
downman on again now we'll put him on
two shows you click on his name you see
those two episodes listed there that
kind of thing so maybe that becomes
interesting but I you know they probably
matter now like one of those down the
line features after lunch yeah mm-hmm
okay and so you've it looks like you've
commented out a lot of episode I can
explain that so basically the way your
fixtures work is they don't sort
properly by date right because of the
way there just to manually typed so in
order to get five things showing up on
the screen I just want to enter coming
at three of them a lot since we have to
pulling just sort of look right in our
testing environment okay okay you'll see
that when you start it up and it pulls
in you'll see that it puts the three
fixtures at the top okay incorrectly and
then it correctly sorts the the to
actual data
yeah all right um yeah and so this this
code was just code that you moved as
well from the server jash it makes more
sense it makes this it makes the server
follow cleaner and then the fixtures
does put it supposed to okay and then
down here at the end you just call
synced kranda start on service book yeah
so I do one call when you first start
the server so it pulls in all the data
initially that we like to wait an hour
and then and then after that i'll run
shower so all right so merge pull
request my shop thanks alright so let's
pull that code wah wah uh yeah I'd been
playing around with uh oh insert as well
but we can get he said servers fixtures
no kid check out servers fixtures there
we go thats settings thought JSON she
disappeared from my status oh why didn't
it disappear cuz I spelled it wrong what
two three T's all right set seems there
we go success and so over here you gotta
do the yeah that's that's settings
watching you ever running on another or
did you close down your other stuff hmm
oh I thought you had another thing using
three thousand lightning right yeah I
closed that window a cool yeah i was
looking at this really awesome package
yesterday with with a client and it's
called transactions and in track of the
history of a document in Mongo and let
you do like undies and reduce and that
kind of thing interesting
yeah it's kind of like its own little
get type of thing I know since almost
yeah yes uh he maybe wants to extend it
into this new interface like a time
machine like interface that shows you
history and so you could click on one
and say roll back here I'd be pretty
awesome yeah be good for writing
articles and stuff too yeah so here we
can see synced cron fired up and it said
the next time it's going to run is at 11
27 EDT which is like right now and so
I'm actually gonna do actually let's
kill this guy will do a media reset and
that's good and then we'll run again
take a look at it see what we get so you
look at the bottom two and you'll see
the actual stuff that was pulled in and
so that's where I was talk now this is
another thing that i mentioned to you
briefly was that we should probably play
with that title and remove the stem to
the dash okay yeah do some string the
nipple that yeah I wonder if we can grab
out we can probably do a regex here too
and grab this out and maybe or that
separately as like a subtitle or
something yeah I mean that you can
either regex that or you can just you
can just do the array index plus one or
the other way around yeah we got it yeah
if we get rid of these guys I think
we'll be all right mm-hmm all right all
right so we're looking good we're
pulling in data um so the question now
becomes what are our other high priority
issues this the admin of flag didn't we
CD the admin flag was the user roles
thing up it in yeah yeah yeah
which I guess is less important now that
we're not actually doing the form but
still it's good for later if we ever
want to have like a admin section we can
put that on let's fix MIT a data
pagination we don't need the
enhancements right now oh look we did
this one actually finishes by root n so
let's see the pagination will be good
after a couple more episodes yeah yeah I
think we'll have some time to get it up
there I don't want to do the itunes
thing probably have that not be
hard-coded yeah well let's get these RSS
feeds into the header and the hub yeah
the itunes stuff as well so right now
actually probably want to view source
hmm yes we need to insert that stuff in
a ladder
right layouts I think just what we want
this is a part I haven't really looked
up as to how it will work is how you
would subscribe RSS reader well
basically all we're doing is putting in
links into the head of the HTML document
hmm account settings I just exposed my
API key anyway oh it's all good you can
reset it I'm job loaded in yeah she's
funny yeah we bargain will be all
careful about it yeah so this is the guy
so yeah we want like this needs to be
put into the head tag okay there it goes
awesome awesome yeah so it's just a link
that goes in the head and it points to
the RSS feed that simple cast has okay
and so I'm pretty sure if we just do
this meteor actually picks this up and
like concatenates it all together okay
but let's define aight i'll go fast yeah
let's see if i'm right on that front
Hugh page source there it is link great
and that kind of awesome I mean I could
be easy I can put that in any any
template file that I want and it will
pick that up and shove it in there so to
me logically like I think it makes sense
to put it into the layout file um yeah I
think I hadn't done something similar I
have like a header file with just head
data
yeah I've got a head HTML and my client
folder and it's got all that stuff in
him I thought there was a way like maybe
that's not chrome set Safari maybe yeah
it's not even in a template the one that
I'm using it's literally just as a head
HTML yeah and it just knows yeah it's
just if it's in any HTML file to pick
the right yeah that's cool hasn't in a
way I thought when there was an RSS feed
on the page like it gave you like a like
with your browser Amy yeah I thought it
gave you like a feed reader browser
thing maybe I'm wrong mm to google it
nice his fees
so I mean I guess we'd have to use like
an RSS reader of sorts so whatever what
would be like that I think it's in there
so I think we're good mmhmm yeah the
actual date is there that we need for it
word yeah do we have a link somewhere
itunes twitter your club soundcloud
stitcher ah we could probably repurpose
soundcloud here or stitcher or something
to be like RSS yeah that would be good
just have a little RSS icon in there I'm
guessing that see some fun awesome seems
highly likely yeah that's a nice one
lessons yep let's see here we go i got
you a FA dash RSS yep I got it in so go
one step ahead what's good alright let's
put that link into um just client views
cuz i don't i don't have this stuff on
soundcloud and I don't I'm not real sure
if it's worth putting there yet okay I
haven't like figured out if that's a
worthy sometimes a cool embedded player
I like their little graphics that they
show on Arafat says not really never
element here yeah yeah you know it'd be
really interesting is if we take the mp3
file and hook in the soundcloud api and
like make it auto upload an episode to
soundcloud for us mmm we can probably do
that honestly if it's as long as they
have a api yeah
I mean I'm sure they something Sam Pao
developers so I'm going to take some
cloud will put it right here uploading
audio files oh yeah looks like you could
upload audio files just in a post
request / tracks with one of their sdk
is using the post Monday Ruby Python PHP
or javascript javascript that's exactly
what we need but this is but the
JavaScript SDK does not by itself have
access to the pala system so instead it
record some audio in the browser and
then uploads it interesting all right
that's the comment on their double
script sdk that's kind of weird oh I
guess because maybe they're assuming
it's gonna come from do they just have
like rest URLs that we can use um yeah
it says you sent a post request to slash
tracks in point okay all right but they
have like an SDK you can use anyways
that's for me looking at it for like a
minute so
that's interesting so each new episode
gets numbered with number one and the
previous one becomes number two so the
newest one is one on iTunes yeah let's
go okay yeah well but that's a that's a
common convention so anyone use itunes a
look I guess technically we used to
Berens yeah so how do i if i take this
guy out will it get there without the no
it's still so you're trying to get a
link straight to the correct episode
being highlighted oh right now just
trying to get the link straight to
itunes without an episode being
highlighted actually okay so he's you
know like surfer that can there we go
that's a link that works perfect yeah
I'm just changing this itunes link to be
decision denair yeah there and uh when
you're looking at the API did you notice
if you get like an itunes one for each
episode by chance i'm guessing not
because i think itunes consumes the RSS
feed and then they do their thing i have
to look the object that was returned but
i don't i don't know if that's stored on
simple cast is it that would be easy to
find out we can just do a console log
yeah let's do that real quick is the
server just do a meteor call and your
browser oh yeah good point um get
episodes is what i would need good
episodes and that returns the data so
you would just they'll give you an array
of all the episodes you can say from it
that would work though cuz from the
client we don't get the return oh you
know what we can do though media shell
time oops I call it wrong get episodes
what did that Miss OH we need the
podcast ID living awaiting boom there we
go so what do we get we get a global
unique identifier doesn't look like it
doesn't look like we get anything I
things related ok so the next question
becomes does itunes have an API ok I'm
sure it had something let's see there
you go ctrl-c to quit the rebel Oh still
used to like Ruby land with the ripple
mm-hmm all right you know what we should
make a package that makes exit work in
the ripple ha just just for people that
are used to Ruby yeah I don't know just
cleaner Search API I'm guessing that's
good luck I look up search all right so
let's get I'm gonna put in some of these
other links while you're looking at that
API mm-hmm so we want meteor club we
hear Jay esta club is the website add up
twitter which of 19 ties SS feed works
Twitter's working new clothes working
itunes works good stuff so how does
stitcher work actually yeah I don't even
know what that is Oh actually I've heard
of it so I'm guessing it's just a
medical there it's i think is a pod
catcher
don't look like they have a search
though look at the stitcher app yeah
isn't it just like a phone app for
getting podcast maybe I just use the
built-in podcast app that comes with oh
that thing is terrible man yeah it works
good but I hear you I use I use I'm
gonna say it wrong overcast over yes
it's tremendous if so it's free if you
want but then they've got a paid version
that gives you like it'll do look at all
the features right I'm pretty sure
there's like basically anytime there's a
gap like a silence gap it'll kind of
speed through it it'll speed up the okay
that's interesting I just wanna know
milady I just run my permanently at 1.5
or two nit picky details here he goes in
cover cellular seek acceleration remote
episode skip what's up do oh nice so
like I don't know if you can see that
but it allows turn on so you can use the
headphones to do like the 32nd skip hmm
you know like the little headphone
control right here ya got the what is it
when you just hit a button and all yeah
it'll fast-forward 30 seconds in that
settable as well seek back or forward by
X you'd set it to 7 15 30 45 and 60
seconds interesting to see a
notification
I thought there was more in here hmm
okay pro version I swear there's a way
to like link directly to your stitcher
episode Twitter I didn't work st i ch AR
stitcher that's the one
hi this is andre aboard Chad I'm trouble
sorry about that oh my goodness I
thought that was something I did also
gonna click what's going on here
stitching yeah see they've got this but
they have no way to find this page that
is crazy hmm there's the itunes podcast
just have like a podcast episode ID or
something like that I have no idea um
we've got a yeah we've got this ID here
okay I assume that's what we need yeah
it looks like the API is just like a
simple search api you just have like a
like a look up and then like that an ID
of the so essentially and then it gives
you an object with the data for that
episode so you can just pull it out the
no glee track view URL so okay I'm just
looking for they got an example for a
movie it's fine actual so if I just go
here let do the right thing it does it
does
stitchers leading mobile audio platform
encouraging users to discover the best
of news entertainment its words auto
distribution increase audience deep
listening metrics ah I think we'll have
to maybe I think I have to submit oh
it's not like an auto discovery yeah the
chemist I think media podcast might be
in here this is an immense keep hitting
listen it's not doing anything it's
right
that's awkward how would I do that if
plug-in that's messing with your links
us guest well it's like it's like a
JavaScript link yeah you go there it is
I've got a I've got vim IAM for a chrome
plugin i had to turn out sometimes on
what times what's that do for you makes
me able to browse websites with them
commands Oh though I can like I can hit
big hit a button and it brings up like
buttons on my keyboard I can press to
open a link and then i can hit like
shift j or shift k to go forward or
backwards and or just like Jillian Kay
to scroll up and down to Nelson it's
kind of cool nice it's real nerdy and
stuff there it is good stuff yeah so
that's a meteor podcast but well I don't
think oh yeah good but you have uniprot
being do that automatically right I
think it may I don't know or someone
submitted it ok um yeah meteor club yeah
mmm totally not in there alright well
that's um maybe figure out just know
where do I hide it yeah we'll hide it
for now yeah we can slowly get a 2 to
rap on how these things are done
automatically for us yeah I'm gonna hide
this guy for now too how's that look
it's probably look weird this guy's
gonna disappear
a little unbalanced maybe I'll move
meteor club above to the lab Ian
actually RSS feed probably makes more
sense there now this is more like that
will make the left how you consume your
feel on the right slight just other
stuff you may want change this there's a
prize like super boring stuff is a
programmatic stuff yeah yeah I don't say
I was like I have to do some editing on
this one we're just kind of looking up
how other guys work been oh no I think
it's interesting yeah that's how you
build stuff yeah they figure out things
yeah I just don't I don't think like
changing this or changing this stuff is
like very interesting to people mm-hmm
the UH so see what does book so what
would be the main things we need to get
done to have this launch a bowl let's
look at our list again so we've got this
one into the head let's commit that
actually sure to get a dash p so we got
the head there we don't want to put
those in yet a git commit RSS feed into
the loaf I'll fix is number three right
edward three push that up that guy is
done so number five but i think honestly
we could probably deploy this and then i
could go back and fix number five off
camera mmm because that'll be like i
said boring so we could do number four
and number nine that could be
interesting ok so for is the share it
link where people can just click it to
share on our Facebook and stuff like
that right yeah
oh i did email it's just so i did email
which we call it the simple cast guys
and they said that the only thing they
could think of to get the episode auto
or to play when you click a button
outside of the iframe would be to
basically emulate a click inside the
iframe so we would catch which i'm not
sure we can do we would catch this click
and then like basically tell it tell the
browser to click this guy interesting is
it possible to actually instead of doing
an iframe like pulling what would be an
iframe and post that on there cuz then
we can just do it normally we weren't
using an iframe but i don't know no
that's the only way I know how to do it
with the end okay yeah okay ah the other
option is we could just replicate this
to be a download link like that's not
super helpful but yeah let's see or take
it out completely because it's confusing
if it doesn't have the functionality
that we had expected to yeah but I
wonder like how obvious is this up here
that they should be clicking it and to
like listen to this episode down here
you know usability concerns definitely
um they are to not issue when I click
right there it opens at least for me on
the Mac it opens like a web browser with
a QuickTime Player or whatever yeah hey
most I think windows just the same see
if I'm looking at other peoples podcast
websites they got similar that seems to
be like your opponent a nice you another
podcast websites is you click on episode
it's got a download link and then it's
got the little player at the top so they
don't have an extra play button anywhere
they just have a download okay so you
see I'm just I'll just look through
her you know what uh then maybe we
change that button to be called download
instead I was gonna look at smart
passive income mm-hmm good that's good
one yeah now he's got a pretty big site
here yeah so he's got the little player
embedded down below what's this
full-size page look like oh that's funny
he's using the same exact player as
entrepreneur on fire where you click on
it and yeah that's like a component
that's shared between some people I
guess they must be using something to do
that I wanted to take a wordpress plugin
or something oh here is this that could
be possible i know they are so smart
track player Oh Pat Flynn made it that
makes sense smart passive income so I'm
guessing you pay for this you interest
me it's just a player vetted though hmm
okay hundred bucks here it's not
terrible she won't you like it nobody's
got all those chairs tough built and I
guess it's got the shares link in there
yeah download link patrol yeah I feel
like I'm I feel like we're already
getting all this you know yeah yeah with
these simple guys we have it kind of
built in the only thing I don't want to
see if it's there
oh oh yeah it does happen yeah so if the
Scarlets stuff you need other than those
share links which we can put in the
maida yeah okay so oh did you grab the
show notes too by the way that it should
be on long description and nice okay
awesome if that's if that's where you've
been show notes anyways yeah yeah that's
the idea I'll make ohmic then do
something more thing okay ah yes that's
gonna be hard coded till we get that
done yeah okay so I'm just thinking like
mmm hotel html5 audio player works no
five audio tag yeah that's the one where
you would just literally call audio play
so are you thinking of linking to that
as a player inside of your browser
instead of the we had I'm wondering if
this play button would be better if we
did something like that let's play with
that I just I want to learn something
new mm-hmm yes maybe total crap maybe we
get way off in the weeds but hey well
we'll find out soon enough yeah so
client views let's see featured episode
so that's the transcript
where is the lay but this guy here we go
and I will send you over the link for
the share this button decide what style
you amused oh no we're gonna use a
package oh is it package yes already
it's wonderful curettage package share
it is the name of the package I'll be
used to share this but no no oh my okay
when you say ensure other you're talking
about the actual share this the website
that you see on everyone's website yeah
oh oh gotcha you always see me your club
so I share it I'm guys did course you
gotta use your own stuff haha give me a
chance to test it out to your story
mm-hmm we can pull in the local version
alright so we just define yeah you just
do an audio tag with a source file so I
think what we want to do is break this
here
let's just put this in I can see what it
looks like controls source now we got to
tell it type 2 type equals audio MPEG I
guess hmm let me just give it the
download link rain she's gonna go Hayes
once that's pretty simple it's just a
little uh you put into the button I did
for now yeah all right whatever its
messing up the button yeah let's try
moving it out
I think my audio source is wrong or
something did you link it to the
download link er yeah the download link
stop chilling here do we have something
going on there sources download is a
context not route yeah we're looking at
the wrong episode yeah you gotta give it
the real episode okay I did that well
we've got a source now they're still not
playing why not maybe we've got the
mimetype wrong mmm possible let's see
type equals audio / mp3 right ah that is
not what I put up with MPEG let's try
yeah you need to do mp3 because I think
that's what it stored in let's try that
yeah in Vegas video click that guy no
still no love duh ahead um I don't know
maybe it isn't big let's see no i mean
this this site this random site on the
internet says you do audio / dyess
impact yeah for mp3 yeah okay so i did
have it right yeah so why you no worky
50 ml 5 i do a little time the easy
example blog defines URL if you paste in
that link that you are using does it
take you to the audio player does it
take me to the audio file you mean
mm-hmm
what's the same link right here yeah
yeah interesting okay ah one tech then
the runner fit an issue with the source
being a external link instead of that
yeah it's kinda what I was thinking mmm
tracing let's put this guy in here and
see if we get that I was looking at the
styling options for it oh let's get it
working before he styling yeah well yeah
I was looking for the artworks in common
now the URLs audio file possible values
in absolute URL which points to another
website or a relative URL which points
to a file within a website work totally
should work why not why you know work
hmm I you know the thing that's killing
me is I would think we would get like
some kind of air where you know what I
mean well it's just HTML so easily HTML
just works or it doesn't it's not doing
a javascript stuff there's our audio
controls
well take a look like that it seems
awkward that it doesn't want to it
seemed so simple it's like well yeah we
got to do something this website says
you need to say controls equals controls
are you what are using right now you
just using a basic example and just
audio controls equals controls Wow I
mean the basic example on w3schools
works fine with just having a source in
there yeah it's like Rick in that you
can put the source up in the audio tag
itself too well did you did you
originally have the controls as nothing
so yeah it just said controls okay
hmm let's see what happens hey that did
what just putting the source up at the
yeah that's weird i wonder if maybe oh
no i can't decipher why that works but
yeah that's a little weird alright so if
i do that though can it just be a self
closing tag or do i need to have like oh
no they still put this your browser does
not support audio tags and you get a
better browser noob alright well that's
simple enough at least i guess it was a
little complicated and weird wait is it
weird to have two players there you
think yeah you do yeah I think so hmm
okay seems like a little uh like which
one do i click on well either work right
so York ensure that by clicking yeah I'd
hey yeah this is awkward yeah but it's
simple so gives you a reference point
there some space around this guy
it'd be a good way to I mean if you
wanted to go back to what you were going
to do earlier instead of using the embed
code you could just do an html5 player
that you have custom tiled or whatever
and and then you can use a play button
which would which would run the
JavaScript play but a quite valid point
so what are we putting the embed player
was in the dining think it should be
part of this podcast play mmm under s
underscore episode maybe you can see
what I thought it would have been under
that's my third episode i think it's
just in home featured episode yeah there
it is okay yeah home is just so large it
started my meetings yeah all right uh to
move this guy over here oops see what
that looks like terrible hmm yeah you
just have to do the that's where we
figure out the styling options for it
and then add the little speed up
controls and you know we can make that
work they look at the command to
that's interesting what's up okay I
don't like auto kicked off the play for
some reason when i switch when you
switch the player yeah do you have auto
place that's true I didn't know I was
looting part alright so let's let's
bring back to play episode button will
get rid of this I'm gonna be horrible
just say style equals for now if you do
decide to do it this way you can
actually get rid of the API call for the
embed code which has to fire off for
each episode individually yeah yeah we
may do that cuz I this thing might be a
little more style bowl for us yeah yeah
that's one thing is you can play with it
with JavaScript and you can do custom
styling why is the width only hitting on
a percent cuz we've got a wrapper around
this guy mmm yeah cuz we use data
stallion bed one so if we ditch the this
guy what is the course down here ok
let's try teaching that you can actually
select it with just a simple jQuery
selector and then do you can do you know
you can do like viddy khals you know my
video or whatever for that element and I
just do good play that's all you have to
do mmm so the Rose constraining my wit
Oh
all right sorry i was looking at design
stuffs are you saying i can do like
audio okay so give it an ID or whatever
can that tell me your ID and then you'll
just two audio yeah that's good one oh
wait I'm probably gonna we're gonna say
like zero or something there we go
uh-huh okay but we gotta yeah that first
one like auto plays that's really weird
hmm have to look at that haha stop what
haha mystica what's to come in for stop
weight I pause pause okay so play pause
there we go nice ok so now and now we
can build something with this right yeah
exactly worst case tomorrow if we can't
figure out why it's playing on that if
we just have a button it's just cause
I'm keep looking that's true all right
well I'm gonna like we've been at it for
an hour here I think on the acid so what
I enter there um but we'll probably do
is I'll finish up this audio stuff I'm
gonna try to get the widths like some
styling done yeah full on there uh just
curious you were saying controls like
they're different controls we can use or
no kidding well yeah I'm sure there's
something where you can put in like a
little speed thing right so you look
it's gotta be like all kinds of control
options audio
just the audio controls here we go it
just says play cloth seating volume
under humble bed let me see yeah I think
that those are the only ones we get play
pause ticking in volume yeah how to
change that's fine though I mean it's
not horrible good i'm sure i'm sure we
can figure it out yeah yeah yeah we'll
get to it alright well thanks for tuning
in hopefully I wasn't too boring you
learned something definitely the code
review we're going to try to from now on
if we do pull requests and do code
reviews at the start will be making
notes in the pull request and then that
way like you can kind of see the history
of us talking back and forth as well
that might be interesting so but uh
thanks for tuning in and I think I think
maybe next time like I'm going to edit
some of this metadata tonight maybe and
we can off-screen and then we might be
able to at the start of the next one
maybe I don't I got a crazy week maybe
monday we can record one and like push
this up to Heroku or something and kind
of do a little bit of deploying overview
type of thing yeah make more yep alright
well again thanks for tuning guys and
we'll see you next week see Colby
