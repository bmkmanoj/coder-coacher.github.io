welcome media fans i'm your host jesse
owens all my co-hosts right Walker just
mess with you guys she listened to go
dad to XP to probably sounded really
weird there yeah I was wondering love
your voice I've been so I've been
playing with overcast because I listen
to like entre programmers it's just a
little long their episodes clock in it
like an hour and a half to two hours and
so you know I try to listen while I'm
running and getting an episode in means
I gotta run like four times a week or
something just a good thing but so I
started playing with like speeding up
podcast yeah I turned that button on
overcast yeah and then you can you can
tell it to do like the smart clipping to
to get rid of the UM are they palsies I
guess I just I you know I hired a guy so
if you listen to this he he cuts out all
the UM za's and awkward pauses um
animals yeah yeah um um he does he's
gonna kill me alright so this week we've
got some interesting news we're going to
talk about faster blades lazing blades
neo4j scaling down on reactivity the web
after tomorrow and percolate got
acquired this is like this is big news
today so we'll get into that as well uh
that one happened right as I was putting
this list together I had a different
story in there and took it out and put
this one answer Wow uh yeah so let's
let's talk about faster blaze it was
interesting so I saw a tweet you know
from air Noda I was like early morning
his time I think it was and you see this
tweet about like I'm working on the
experiment with meteor you know and you
know I'm just sitting here wondering
what could this be from Aaron oda and
then later that day he just post a link
and says experiment success you know and
it's a video that he shows off faster
blaze and there were two interesting
things in here so I haven't had a chance
to look at
at the bug yet but he shows a little bit
of that so that looked kind of
interesting and then on top of that
essentially what he's doing is caching
the template itself and so code that
runs in there uh gets gets cached as
well so basically he's got to show you
the difference he's got a page that
renders like 10 items in a list and he
loops over them puts them on the page
and it's not I don't it's not being
driven by a DDP subscription or anything
I think it might take a little bit of
work to get that done but I think with
subscription caching as well like these
two things could combine together and
get some real performance but in the
video it goes on to switch it to like
10,000 item page and you can see like it
takes a couple seconds at least to
render the page once it gets that large
and then he clicks into another page and
then clicks back to the main page and
it's gotta sit there and turn and
re-render the page and so instead he's
built this kasher I think it was called
in the in the video and you just tell it
what template you want it to load and my
guess is it's just like saving that
template in memory has already rendered
so when you come back it'll render it
for you pretty pretty fast um you know
he was able to once he turned it on he
was just able to go back and forth
between the links and it was just like
instant rendering so I it's it's smart
I'll give him that I'd be curious to see
like what's the memory usage before and
after on the client because the like a
blaze client is actually pretty thin
like you know nine ten megabytes so I'd
be curious to see that yeah I don't know
yeah I didn't play around with this or
even watch the video so I'm I tried to
but it was playing audio right over the
podcast here so do you uh do you guys
use a template or the
manager at all um I'm sure they are i'm
not i'm not using it in the projects
that I'm working on but I have something
guys a different fly yeah and yeah so I
you know it's along those same lines I
think where you're able to tell that the
template or the the DDP data probably
hasn't changed so you're like able to
reuse that subscription and not have to
reap all that stuff in a memory yeah and
so I it's basically the same idea just
for a template Joe yep cool all right
let's jump over to next article by CM
corcos yep meteor plus neo4j the idea
here is to connect meteor to a neo4j
database which is a graph database and
luckily his brother built a package
that's nice right yeah when you have
brothers building packages that you can
rely on it says seek seek or krause
neo4j yeah jet yeah jetpack it Chetta
corcos and you know he just kind of
talks through how to connect your app to
neo4j which is I'd say the leading
lightweight craft database if you need
that sort of functionality and your app
definitely beats out the performance of
traditional relational or no sequel
databases for that kind of application
so have you used have used neo4j Josh on
anything I haven't used the 0 for j but
you know it's one of those things that i
wish i would have known about or you
know i don't even know when neo4j kind
of hit hit a hit a wider audience but
back when i was creating something
similar with david's building where you
kind of analyze like you give me three
Twitter accounts and I would analyze
follows them and try to figure out that
uber lap you know and like literally
just building that that overlap graph
and that was probably the hardest thing
because if someone put in like CNN or
someone put in like my wife wanted to
find readers on Twitter and so she put
in JK Rowling you know and like that's a
huge account and even just storing a
million IDs in a table and then trying
to do some kind of like overlap graph
with a million IDs can be kind of tough
to do and so this was back in Indonesia
so the comparison would would get hard
to run because Ruby just couldn't handle
that much data in the memory and it
would like crash and fall over or it
would just consume enormous amounts of
memory on Heroku and then hiroko would
kill it and so yeah I think something
like neo4j would make a ton more sense
for figuring that kind of stuff out so
yeah just checking my searching my email
for it and the I asked I asked the
internet on Twitter in November and what
are the cool kids using for graph
databases and Josha one's responded
neo4j you remember that no i don't i
don't know that is this is not our first
neo4j interaction yes indeed so yeah I
haven't had any personal experience but
I will say this a.m is part of the
patrons and so we do an hour of coding
every month and this month we actually
this was like days after the article
come out I came out we did our pairing
and we did we wrote some tiny tests for
the package and so he he really wants to
see this thing grow and you know we had
a conversation that tests are a good way
to kind of indicate that you guys at
least care about the package long term
and so we did that and I don't know it's
it's a it's a pretty slim package
honestly after looking at it it's just
using HTTP under the covers so he's just
making HTTP calls to the neo4j database
so it's not reactive per se but I think
that's okay yeah it's kinda like a REST
API style interaction so yeah yeah if
you can always like aggregate that data
into mom
if you cared about it being reactive or
something in the front end and just run
it every couple minutes or something
yeah yeah cool right clever all right I
get back to the list here scaling down
ah let's see what's a full title scaling
down subscriptions and reactivity in
meteor so this is from our good buddy
max 7 mr. meteor toys himself and I
don't he said he's on this quest that
like live queries a bad thing and it's
gonna like kill meteor um I don't I
don't know that's true but he's
definitely like looking for ways to
eliminate live query from some parts of
your application and funnily enough I
think um you're going to talk about the
the next story the web after tomorrow
which talks a little bit about like
reactivity and pub/sub and they have a
good graph on that page and I think that
graph kind of is a good example of what
what max is trying to get at and that's
some parts of your page care about
real-time data and other parts of your
page maybe care about sometimes updated
data and then other parts of your page
are just static you know and i think the
the static pieces you know I've seen
people do this you know they they
created like a site copy collection or
they create some kind of like data
structure that's coming from Mongo and
it's being shipped over DDP so they can
control things through the database and
I you know you don't necessarily always
need that and so he's um he's created
this this fetcher which works with
meteors reactive dictionary and you're
able to kind of set data and let it come
across and it's not necessarily using
live query right like it's just it's one
time shipping across the wire rather
than like using live query which if you
don't know is it's got expensive
overhead to kind of keep track of that
data on the server and even if you turn
reactivity off you're still like that
memory is consumed on the server side
even
not on the client side yeah yeah I get
that not all the data needs to be real
time but life is simpler in a world
where you just interact with your
database in that way um i would agree
until maybe your site gets slower or you
wanna maybe squeeze out an extra bit of
performance it definitely seems like one
of those like I want to say edge case
but definitely like something that
you'll get at much later in your
development cycle yeah if it's part of
performance optimization I think I
wonder though is like is this a design
is this a performance optimal is it was
this driven because of a performance
issue or was just riveting because oven
just architectural opinion you know like
yeah I don't know that I've ever really
gotten to the core of what his issue is
with live query we've never had like a
deep talk about what like what made him
think it was really broken but you know
my guess is like honestly you look at a
blog right and like da flock back
pressure situation and how you deal with
and I think it's along those lines you
know like the server realistically can
only do so much before you kind of run
out of some kind of overhead CPU or
memory and it's better to minimize that
when you can yeah yeah so one strategy
to solve that would be what I like I
like the idea of like pushing the data
into a different database different long
though if necessary but like that's kind
of what kadir is doing removing the high
velocity data out of the primary apps
database and into something yes and I
like that that approach more than I like
this for example um but but I could see
how this is you know if there's just
like a you need a bandaid on something
that's just really breaking your
performance it's probably a pretty neat
solution yeah I mean you know there's
there's some stuff that I think you
could use this for like exactly uh he
shows like get menu for the burritos you
know and like the menu data it's not
gonna be it's not gonna be real time
like yeah right you don't necessarily
need someone to know that you add
did you know the fluff another burrito
to your menu right away like it's okay
if they'll see it on getting to your
store or you know something like that I
don't know yeah yep to dressing yeah I
agree it's like it but then it's a
premature optimization because it's not
causing a performance issue the way it
works now enough what's causing it is it
causing a user issue no because takes
the amount of time for the data to get
there they just like he just likes the
idea of not asking a server to do stupid
work you know which it is in this case
yeah just keep maintaining that for the
ever all these clients and you have
thousand clients and there's a thousand
copies of a menu that's never gonna
change that's or but you know the you
know for me I scale up to another server
in the short term so the DHH philosophy
of you know servers are more cheaper
than programmers so very true optimized
for programmer happiness and true yeah I
uh yeah I'm kind of curious to write
because this article is very much like
coming from a device standpoint rather
than like here's my experience and why I
did it standpoint so we'd be curious to
hear max what led to this yes follow up
post right uh next topic this one me is
wants me the web after tomorrow sounds
sounds like a movie a bad movie I think
women hall is gonna come after us yeah
the web after tomorrow so it's kind of
interesting a guy because at the end of
it he says I think this would be a good
thing for we can use cloture with what
he does he does mention meteor as well
saying yeah yeah in the middle he says
like meteors getting really close to
doing this but look going to the premise
he's basically the scrapping like a real
time web system very similar to meteor
and how you might approach building such
a thing what philosophy there and then
he finally realizes like meteors pretty
much there but I think again you know
people love using the tools that they
know so he envisions a way that he can
make this happen using closure and let's
see what the other other pieces I don't
date Tomic I don't even know if the
atomic is
data script so yeah it's a pretty cool
but the thing I enjoyed about this
article that was just kind of just to
hear someone thinking through the
problem that meteor is has solved in a
lot of ways I mean again it's not a
perfect solution but right yeah it's a
kind of fun like realization that other
people are starting to hone in on this
type of thing yeah yeah yeah absolutely
I think I mean you can look at action
cable and rails and what they're trying
to do right there they're trying to
figure out a way to approach this as
well and you know I the thing I like
about meteors even though they're
creating new standards they're there at
least adhering to standards right and
the problem is I think when you look at
some of the other solutions that are out
there there's no standard to them
necessarily it's just kind of like oh
hey look we've got web sockets let's
just figure out how we're gonna see
relies and DC relies on both sides of
the socket and maybe we'll do something
interesting with that and more and so
like it got murky to me when I was
watching the the rails keynote and DHA
she was talking about he's like well
sometimes will just ship data sometimes
will like ship HTML over the WebSocket
it's like that sounds terrible like how
am I supposed to know when to do what
yeah just like is it up to dhh to tell
me when I do a tour like I let's just
have a standard in we can get some nice
interoperability here between egg works
and that could be very very interesting
my opinion so that's that's one thing I
definitely applaud a meteor on is trying
to at least create something here I
think you know the question just becomes
and I've talked to Matt de Burgh Alice
about this before like you know he says
right here I can't find any information
about consistency or reliability
guarantees or how well server how well
the server pushes scale with number of
subscriptions you know some of that data
is dependent on the application itself
right so kadir is very different than
teleport or you know if I just go write
a hello world
app with no real data behind it like
scale to millions of users with server
you know like oh it doesn't matter so
you know I think I think the
conversation that needs to happen in the
media community is for a precise
measuring DDP performance and you know
what are the different ways we can scale
it up and in that kind of thing though
yeah well and obviously like rogue the
growing base of apps and and as they
become will mature will create pressure
for that that's what is that smell yeah
I think it's I think it's cool though
it's like meteors the grandpa now of
this whole movement I'm sure a lot of
people will be looking to it for
inspiration and went for the ideas that
pop out that we can bring back in the
meteor to sure sure yeah I mean you see
things happening in react and I don't
know there could be interesting things
that come back to blaze because of it so
yeah yeah cool and with that you know
one way that meteor can learn about what
needs to happen and get better is
through them actually now offering what
did they call meteor developer
subscription yes well equipped with your
pen yeah yeah yeah so I don't maybe
maybe not the best name I don't know but
um mmds that's not bad I guess I'm gonna
get the MDS from an MD gee this is so
basically they went and they hired
perkily and brought them folded them
into the team uh which is a very
interesting move I think it caught as
far as I could tell caught everyone off
guard I don't think anyone kind of knew
this was coming I guess maybe some
people did if you read the percolates
announcement maybe like Chris Mather and
and Sasha knew but um everyone else I've
talked to you was kind of like blown
away by this and and and definitely
intrigued and you know it i think it
puts an interesting wrinkle into the
developer community right the people
that are professionally making money off
of this because now number one like we
have a place to go if we have questions
and maybe we can get them
in a timely fashion which could be
interesting depending on the cost right
we don't know what that is and also you
know they now have people who I've said
this a couple of times I think the media
team doesn't really build meteor apps
they occasionally will take some time
off and do something but they don't
spend their days voting meteor apps they
spend their days building framework and
I think there's some slight disconnect
there because they'll put something out
and then you don't really catch all the
edge cases of my opinion because like
for instance I've been having some weird
problems with Xcode and and Cordova and
I think because they don't ever submit
anything to the App Store they probably
have no idea that these bugs exist you
know and yeah yeah yeah I think this
will be a good thing as well because
they'll have people that they're like
Tom and and zola actually be looking at
a wide variety of applications not just
even the floor that they may have
previously worked on as a small company
you know so yeah they're gonna get
basically the people who are going to
come to them are gonna be the hardest
problems most likely right because if
that's typically the case I think with
any any technology a few if you're
buying a support for a support pack from
the from the makers of the technology if
I means you're approaching enterprise
sighs you know you just need that level
of support so though I think it'll be
kind of cool if they're gonna have a
good visibility on the hardest problems
the people are facing in meteor and
being so close to the actual core team
the dev team yeah should should be I
think it should be a good thing i think
as meteor grows this type of service
needs to exist you know and for them to
allow just like with the community
handle it an unofficial way add fit in
them you know is probably not a good
thing you know they so i think big
companies learn here's an example we did
connect with a company that one of the
terms of the deal was introduced us to
meteor we want to we want to be able
to those people and like really there
was no one to introduce him to it's
going to be highly responsive you know
please no one that was no one's job
right I think so I think like in this
case lecture where you go and talk to
him as much as you want is usually
here's the deal on how you can have a
relationship with meteor where they have
resources available to take care of you
yeah yeah yeah yeah like to me I think
you have to go after the high-end client
like you mentioned because I mean you
can't you can't hire top level
developers and you know this is
officially their first product right so
there's there's probably gonna be a lot
of highballs on how many people are
hiring them and what kind of money's
coming out of that so I've got imagine
there's gonna be a at a higher price
point I don't know they didn't didn't
include that here so we're just kind of
speculating but yeah so my guess is yeah
it'll definitely be a lot higher end of
the market and you know they've they're
also you know to your point they've
grown from 19 people to 31 now according
this blog post so they've been expanding
rapidly and they they will continue to
expand rapidly I think in the coming
months you know you see I they hired the
vp of marketing and now I hear they're
there may be getting a new VP is
something else so what an interesting
stuff happening and the hope is though
they'll get more responsible on a lot of
these things as they offload Jeff and
and match plate hopefully to focus on
the core of meteor and other people
handle the new opportunities ok so but
the biggest question is what happens to
atmosphere oh yeah well now atmosphere
would be an internal product or project
of meteor so right right and for my
conversations and understanding is they
always plan to do some kind of
commercial thing with atmosphere either
through ads or through private package
hosting or something which is one of the
reasons it wasn't open source and so now
you know is that is that going to
continue to maybe be an offering on the
radar
or are we just going to see atmosphere
open sourced so that the community can
contribute and do something with it dun
duh to be continued we don't know we'll
see what happens with that well we set
it on a podcast now so they've got to do
something ports but this is either way I
think this is pretty exciting news so
kudos to both mdg and percolate I hope
it's exciting times for them certainly
seems like it from from our vantage
point yep I'm sure we'll know more as
the week's go on they will get one of
those guys on the podcast yeah maybe
maybe well uh maybe I'll have them on
the meteor club podcast or something too
so don't very in-depth conversation in
uh oh yeah so the end of our list isn't
it yes it is so I know you've been
working on astronomer are you gonna like
talk about the alpha or no oh yeah well
I mean basically out so so Greg Greg
knee has oh if you guys know him he he
kicked serious ass getting a lot of it
done we got we got to the point now
where we can test it with wide Meteor
apps so if anyone wants to reach out to
me riot astronomer Gotye Oh be part of
our private alpha we're basically saying
don't use it for production just yet but
we should be a few weeks away from that
big bottom line is it's it's a it's a
way to automatically instrument your app
for user analytics so not traditional
Google Analytics which is just you know
what pages are getting hit and where are
they coming from but more specifically
what are your users doing on your inside
of your app so um yeah so our package
basically in a very opinionated way
automatically instruments your app so
you don't have to sit down and think
through like what are all the things in
my apps doing and what what do those
events do i want to send off to
analytics so it's early you know we're
ready to get feedback on how to make
those event names better and you know
all the different techniques were using
to collect them but it's an open source
package too so anyone can contribute to
it
so yeah I'm sure I'll be bugging you
Josh and I'm sure a lot of you in the
community will hear from me in the next
few weeks nice nice blowjob in advance
but it's pretty cool yeah it's nice you
know it's interesting because uh that
stuff's always kind of like hard to
figure out you know and you and I had a
conversation offline it's like for me I
don't want to go figure out Mixpanel and
segments and all these other plethora of
tools that I have no idea what I'm doing
you know right and then even if even if
you do get segments set up you still
have to like go actually instrument a
lot of your code to say hey an event
happen and you know I spent a little bit
of time doing that in Google Analytics
with the mastering meteor training page
and in the end like I still don't like
the solution that I came up with and the
limitations that Google Analytics has
because I just don't I still don't think
I get all the data that I want or need
so yeah it would be it would be kind of
interesting to see how you guys have
that working yeah and we're basically
our philosophy is collect everything
that push you know get get all the data
points rather than just collecting a few
points and then you can decide later on
what was important but it's nice to have
the full history of everything someday
you're gonna you know you're gonna
realize i wish i would have recorded
that but you didn't you lost that data
yeah yeah but i mean the main thing is
we want to be as easy to set up user
analytics as it is to set up google
analytics so that's what we're doing
it's it's like very fast so for meteor
developers at least and then eventually
we might move outside of meteor but for
now we have to move to nail this one
very well so it's tricky honestly like
there's there's there's gotchas
especially due to the way meteor works
you know with with blaze and reactivity
and all that kind of stuff that a lot of
times the first time you set up
analytics like you kind of battling
meteor times to track the events the one
you think you should track them and so
all that stuff will be built in all the
solutions to those problems were built
into our our tracker nice cool help yep
swim yeah thanks for giving me a chance
talk about that yeah yeah thanks ask
what about oh we should talk about space
dojo last week and then i put it up on
crater on Monday and I god I got some
good yeah I got a nice amount of votes
and good about traffic i probably had
like five or six hundred people hit the
sides so i was pretty excited about that
and i think i had like six or seven
applications and a couple of those
filled out like I've got a type form
that you fill out after you apply or
join the list or whatever and I've had
three or four of those kind of respond
so just trying to filter down I took the
you know this is an interesting move I i
had the pricing on there ready to go for
launch and then a couple people convince
me to take it off so um I'm still kind
of feeling out what's the right price
point I kind of know it's somewhere
between 800 and 1200 so dollars per code
review like one day code review so why
don't ya I think by not having the price
there gives you a flexibility to to size
it to the problem you know like if it's
a if it's a really if it's a two year
old meteor app running 0.6 you come to
you you're gonna be like okay double
more than one day code you need a teen
up gray suit but someone just just
started in there like running a
telescope instance for example you know
like that's a lot simpler so yeah yes
yeah I haven't had anyone running
telescope yet but I'm getting a lot of
people that apply in there they have
like one or two developers according to
the type form so it's it's certainly
interesting and definitely like almost
like a competing offering with what what
they announced with meteor development
services right they said they do code
reviews as well so I don't know I i
think it's interesting and then you know
at the same time I showed this to Pete
Corey about a month ago and he's like oh
that's interesting I like that idea was
like yeah yeah and and then he came back
to me like a week ago and he's like oh I
liked your idea
I'm gonna do it for security but maybe a
little more personalized little less
productized and so he he actually
announced the same day he's doing
