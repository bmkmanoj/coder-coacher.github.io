welcome meteor fans i'm your host josh
owens along with my outdoor co-host by
Walker nice it looks so nice out man it
is nice out today it's like a perfect
temperature here in Cincinnati like I
know it's ready do we we just got like a
back patio area set up and I think I
might like go out there and enjoy the
the workspace that we have out there now
and making you jealous huh yeah
definitely I mean I guess you know I
could like I could hold this Mike out
there but then like the trains would be
horrible alright so this week we are
talking about 20 million dollars Oh
scaling meteor to 20,000 out of 20 s
yeah a model layer with 20 s no I'm just
kidding I blur and react and null chat
Oh Chad go Chad alright so if you
haven't heard yet I don't know what rock
you're hiding under but meteor just
announced that they got 20 million
dollars in funding hello if I do my math
right here the 131 million dollars so
far that they were taken in and funding
yeah that's a lot of cash very
impressive indeed one of the ways which
framework right yeah well is it says is
it just an open source framework you
know well yeah so that that's the
interesting thing right like the first
round of funding i think was maybe
gotten on the fact that it was an open
source framework and maybe they do
hosting and now i feel like this round
you know I I had a chance to talk with
Matt about it a little bit and he told a
story about like convincing andreessen
horowitz for the next round and they
went in and showed off their a mobile
local marketplace or whatever that they
did oh uh the the little demo app and
you know is only 500 lines of code and
it was like almost a full fledge like
supermarket social network where you
could share recipes and pictures and
follow people and all kinds of
fan I don't know like he said that was
like a huge selling point that they were
able to build that mobile app and 500
lines of code and it ran natively you
know on iOS or Android so I don't know I
say kudos to them you know yeah yes it's
pretty crazy to like I'm out talking to
like institutional speed investors right
now and still not many people they may
have heard of meteor but they don't know
what it is you know I'm talking about
talking about like yeah mobiles getting
really big so I'm like media does mobile
too in fact it's probably more mobile
apps are being built now with meteor now
than then non mobile apps I'm you know
probably guess to say that's a true
statement hmm I think that's a generally
true statement across apps but you know
just gonna take some time for people to
realize no one let's find out let's ask
our audience so you guys you guys tweet
at meteor podcast and tell us if you're
doing a web app a mobile app or both yep
yeah you can tweet your mobile web or
both yeah report next week yeah we'll do
a little pool yeah I bet you will be
surprised you know like did the both in
the mobile I think is gonna be higher
than originally thought yeah yeah I
think so we'll see we'll find out but uh
yeah I mean I've it's a it's it's the
start of the next chapter and I think
it's the start of what out you know the
scaling of meteor especially once
galaxies out and has a good story which
I you know have every faith these guys
are gonna build something that's pretty
awesome and noteworthy it'll it'll catch
some eyes and I think you know 2016 is
going to be a year where we really see
meteor start accumulating significant
market share yeah I don't agree I feel
like I mean where I think with crater
like I was just crater as my growth
metric betanian the forum coming out
kind of put a wrench in now it's back on
a growth path again
and I think I think that that is
directly because like I can see the
majority of traffic's coming off Google
like people searching and any ending up
on crater and you know that that tells
me that the the search traffic is
ratcheting up you know little by little
which tells me more people are
interested in talking about it so yep so
let's let's talk about the other 20,000
or we're 20 there's a 20 yeah yeah the
first 20 million now we're not to talk
about 20,000 now this is a blog post by
my buddy David woody at differentially
yeah it just tells the story of when we
launched this app called the brave app
which was pretty well traffic tap we got
to test media i should say modulus is
customer service responsiveness yet
again and of course they came through
with flying colors uh you cheated though
you cheated halide sheet yeah you like
texted someone didn't you no i think i
think i may have popped a support ticket
in i'll just go yeah those guys those
guys watch it the founders are on top of
it so nice but yeah yeah turns out we
didn't realize this but you can't go
more than 10 10 i knows without prior
permission yeah yeah how many did you
guys end up at did you know I was like
30 yeah I think we were at 30 at least
for some of the time and then basically
after that first day I didn't hear
anything about this project again which
is a good sign right like basically
turning up the Dinos killed the problems
at least to the point that I didn't hear
about them we also had some weird issues
with maybe maybe we can get woody to do
a post on that around gosh what was it
different versions of iOS like iOS four
and five and you know there's I'll or
what mistakes and we had issues with
different versions um that's interesting
yeah so I would say you know for people
that aren't familiar with the backstory
like number one go read this blog post
after you you wat watch or listen to
this but this is so I go to church at
crossroads and this was an app built for
crossroads which is a population of like
I don't know seventeen thousand twenty
thousand kind of members that come in
and they they go to church on Saturday
and Sunday and it spread out over five
services but really you guys had to deal
with like a concentrated block of like
people downloading and signing up all
within probably a 12 or 16 hour period
yeah so people could download and sign
up an advance but most didn't so yeah
yeah it was it was interesting I the the
issue with it was like a really weird
problem basically when you open up the
app and certain like iOS 5 on the older
iphone it would just crash and I'm like
you know what the hell's going on yeah
so I got to see the the flipside some of
the other challenges one that that
sunday we went to the ten o'clock
service and you know I I immediately
like I knew what this was you know so I
pull up the website and I immediately
get like unable to connect two instances
and I'm like hmm this is on modulus and
so then I text you like hey you might
need more dinos and then you're like
there's this servoz servoz servoz and
and so you're like oh hold on i'll text
woody and then like you know a couple
minutes later like everything seemed to
be smoothly running again um but you
know on the on the flip side like
watching like we were in a group at our
house and and seeing people trying to
interact with the technology I think you
know one of those people in our group
had an older iphone that couldn't
upgrade to like seven or eight yeah um
you know they were having significant
troubles and couldn't couldn't basically
get on and they were trying from their
iPad as well and having trouble and I
think ultimately she got on using the
web um yeah had trouble with IE as well
you know and yep I think it's something
to consider like you know even as
progressive as this church happens to be
that was such a large population of
people you're gonna have a diverse
technical I don't know what do you call
that install base yeah well yeah it's
interesting like the very first problem
was
that I free if it was the live site or
the or the version of the app that was
inside of the iOS app but basically we
had deployed a version of it without
polymers vulcanized happening which
meant that there was like a hundred HTTP
requests happening really really fast
and apparently I mean that you wouldn't
think that should crash an iOS app but
it does that fix it not solved part of
the problem and I think there are a few
other things but they will get ready to
tell that story once the pain is uh worn
off yeah it's done now right so like
yeah our last like we decided to have a
sixth meeting and we're doing that
tonight just grilling out and drinking
beer so yeah so it was pretty cool at
2.9 million records popped in the art
his uncle database that is awesome yeah
so it can scale the opposite but day
ones are never gonna be fun you don't
know what you what's wrong with the app
until you know the real question I would
have is like what does that look like as
far as the setup goes like is that one
compose you know a blog enabled instance
that you guys used for that yeah oh well
ask that question what are you listening
you owe us a blog post Oh keep talking
about it alright cool so uh next post
from a good buddy David Walden you know
I don't know if he listens to this show
I've never asked him he's like the
number two guy answering meteor
questions on stack overflow oh he said
it can never be number one apparently
it's it's just too hard number one uh
some other guy over in the UK but he's
got such a lead that he could never
catch out as long as that guy's doing it
every day no way uh so anyway um he
wrote about a monolayer and I thought
this was interesting and it's worth
talking about like he's talking about
transforms and that kind of thing and
then at the end he mentions collection
helpers as well and it's a good read
actually what he's written a similar
post as well about using transform and
how most people don't realize it's there
and so the idea is a you know with a
transform you can specify
it's not a prototype but I think it's
their functions that get run or
something and applied as the data comes
out of the database and so when you're
working with a collection when you get
an individual item out of that
collection like let's just call that a
model like I always call it a model so
when you're working with the individual
model like you can decorate function two
methods on top of that and so you can do
things like I don't know for me like I'm
were you ever a fan of fat model skinny
controllers yeah rails rails land yeah
jameis Jim's pluck wrote a post about
that a long time ago and it was about
encapsulating the the business logic
with the models not I tend to do that a
lot and I'm finding this pattern to be
quite enjoyable now you know basically
you know i'll write some helper methods
and i'll use this collection helpers to
apply them but you know what i need to
get to do some kind of calculations or
something my choices are either to write
a template helper or to go write a
collection helper and to me the
collection helper is ultimately a better
thing because it's reusable in more
spots i don't have to go write a global
helper and like template global helper
or i don't have to like rewrite that
code anywhere i'm just doing it in the
collection i think it belongs in the
collection you know for me if you're
outputting some kind of HTML that should
be a template helper or you're
rearranging so it looks nice in HTML
that's a template helper if you're just
taking some data and maybe combining
like first name and last name like i
would put that in a collection helper
and so that's that's kind of what this
blog post is talking about yeah and I
it's interesting to me like we've been
using models the concept of a model
since i started using meteor you know
it's like it's never ever never really
been a question so it's interesting that
because like you know if people aren't
you know people aren't coming from our
code base and our experience they have
to think about this kind of stuff yeah
that's true so I you know what I'd love
to see if someone's
sometime this should make a package and
this is what woody was alluding to in
his post and I you know David talks
about in his post like he's got some
finder methods and some connection
methods for like making like finding a
related author to a blog post or
something I'd love to see someone make
like a like a has many or like it
belongs to type connector and so we
could describe out when we have like a
post ID and an author ID on a very thing
we can make that like yr that
relationship so you get these methods
automatically between the two um you
know that would I think that would be
awesome yeah one thing we do I don't
know if you do this too but like there's
meteor methods related to a a given
collection will generally put those in
the same file mmhmm yeah yeah yeah
always look at my meteor method and try
to decide what data is it working on and
if it's working on like one specific
collection I'll put it in with the the
collection file itself yeah yeah we
actually need like model / method name
oh yeah it is to figure out like if you
see the method like where is that method
coming from well miss guess kind of kind
of a hack that you have to put that in a
string yeah no I like that idea actually
quite a bit yeah all right cool we're en
next topic that was a good one now
models use models indeed angular and
react react say is that wait is that
yeah that's you the order changed here
this is weird did it Tynan oh yeah you
don't know what drinking beer man with
cheese i'm just drinking coke zero all
right so great post and info world from
what day was this yesterday talking
about it's interesting like it's clearly
a story that was you know they problem
sure meteors with their announcement
funding announcements reaching out to
different media sources and talking
about what they're going for that the
angle here is that meteor
not competitive with angular react it's
actually compatible with it and I really
like this attitude of meteor that you
know we're not trying to build something
that's been excluded people it it'sit's
we want to be flexible so it just kind
of pretty short article but I think it's
interesting another note here is that
there looks like Yuri gold Shh goldstein
coach tinea old stain is has joined a
meteor indeed yeah I found that really
really interesting right so he's the guy
that was leading the way with meteor and
angular and I had no idea they had hired
him you know I'd love to see a similar
announcement with like them hiring been
green and bringing him in a part of the
team for more database support but I
love seeing this you know like yeah to
me so I think there's a couple
interesting things here number one that
this announcement came out and actually
didn't mention the funding so you know I
think we're maybe seeing the effects of
the new VP of Marketing they hire yeah
yeah interesting um and then also you
know for anyone that's paying attention
to the right signals I think you know
hearing about react and the fact that
they're interested in integrating is no
shocker to me if you look at like shush
up a little sashko and avital and David
Greenspan and like there's a number of
people that are playing three act and
then the other ben newman they're like
they're all trying to figure out a way
to smartly integrate react with meteor
and so it it's no shock to me that
they're doing that and i think bringing
uri onto the team is a smart smart move
you know he can certainly advise to
where they could make changes to make it
easier and maybe even advised whoever's
doing that the react worked to get it
done faster who knows
yeah i think that the interesting one of
the interesting angles here is that we
people some people want to say like
replace blaze with react and I don't
think meteors going to do that they're
not going to basically annoying to react
as the only as the framework that
everyone should use just I guess at
these have a different attitude about
this kind of stuff like they'll call a
they'll call a a winner a winner only
when it's like clearly ahead yeah like a
percent winner not yeah winner so no
Matt had an interesting quote about that
and he said if you took a look at the
kind of the JavaScript framework war
that happened early on you know it
looked like um what were some of them
there was mootools and then was jquery I
think mootools actually came first and
there was another one script oculus came
with rails and that kind of stuff and if
you looked at that stuff like you would
think maybe mootools was gonna be the
winner early on but then jquery came out
of nowhere and just kind of like blew
away the competition and it's the one
that's still around today like I'm sure
mood tools is maybe but nobody uses it I
know maybe they do just offended six
people Josh so I you know you're
absolutely right like how do you pick
that that winner you don't yeah let's
just maybe support the the big front
runners and make it easier well yeah I
mean I think the thing is there's no way
that there's not you know angular is not
going away neither is react so there is
not going to be a winner they're down
and of course meteor has its own things
it'll be really interesting to see
someone who's got like a react front end
with a postgres back end meteor app it's
gonna feel like not meteor right that's
like you're using like a third of what
meteor originally was maybe I mean I
think as long as you're using DDP and
like live postgres looks similar to live
live or mini Mongo mini postgres looks
like mini Mongo um I don't know I don't
I don't feel like it's gonna be too
crazy yeah
yeah it's exciting that so we got a lot
of what interesting things to happen in
the ecosystem so yeah I you know
honestly to me like anytime they're able
to take the modularity that already
exists with a meteor and like change out
the pieces and the players like I think
that's just gonna become a more
compelling story for people to kind of
come in and use it to me yeah yeah
someone uploaded a null chat that's why
the order changed up on me oh we totally
messed that up that's alright alright so
that's funny I shared the list with the
immediate club select chat room I'm
guessing so the guy that wrote note null
chat just joined the the media club chat
room as well uh i'm guessing made my he
hub footed it that's funny um let's talk
about that yes so uh no Chad this is
really like I don't know this is one of
those mind-blowing than one of those
mind-blowing weeks for me so last Friday
you know I was doing the the May fete
thing having the the fun out here and
then I came back we did the podcast and
then I did at an air pear and the guy
wanted to air pear on this like slack
clone well um and I didn't put two and
two together even after we had finished
the podcast that the slack Cloney was
working on was uh the impact project
that we had talked about last week and
he had taken the the version of that and
he had been playing around that trying
to add some features and so we added
some features we got like a private
messaging going and that kind of stuff
and then you know all of a sudden I
started hearing about space talk and it
turns out they renamed impact space talk
and so they've got a slack chat room as
well which is growing by leaps and
bounds and I got in there and started
talking to the the null check on it
turns out he spent like you know six
months every day just working on this no
chat project as annoying I level up his
meteor
experience Matt's his name and he he's
done a really interesting job so the UI
is completely his own I think he went
with semantics you I but he's replicated
quite a bit of slack functionality and
um you know he wasn't sure what to do
like what's the right thing for the
community and there's a bit of a
struggle and like she open source it
because now there's this this big kind
of movement around space talk and I told
him like he totally just open source
said posted on crater nope they're
interested you know maybe they'll jump
in and help if not I think the thing is
like he's got more knowledge than anyone
else about building a meteor chat
application so you know help guide the
community and maybe take some of his
source code and contributed to space
talk as well yeah and I don't know it's
an interesting conversation because he
would he would love credit for null chat
because he wants to get a job working
full-time with media oh you know which
which I think open source helps but
really I think it's just a signal that
you care enough to like research and do
great things on your own outside of just
being hired by a company you know yeah
well I think I think it's you do you do
yourself no service by keeping things
hidden even though you know there's
always the competitive fear and all that
but I love that open source did you know
post two forms hey look what I built
anyone need help building a meteor app
you know he's following the right path
to to getting this is this is a project
394 commits tells me he's he's got some
dedication to sticking with something
that's huge yeah I totally agree and I
think you know um we we had it was a
recent talk on the meteor club podcast
we were talking about like how to get a
job a meteor and certainly open sources
one good way and I'd say blogging is
another right like he should blog about
his experience building in the
challenges and all that kind of stuff
because that stuff like little by little
as you put out this blog post i think
it's going to build up a little mind
little knowledge about his name and then
when you potentially go in and and
someone wants to hire you like you know
when you when you talk to Colin over at
differential you know you can point them
at your blog and he's gonna be like oh
look at all these technical posts like
you're gonna look a little more
interesting to hire in my opinion yep
especially because for example I'm
differentials always looking for people
who are down to blog yeah we lost a we
lost a huge marketing person about a
year ago Bay true very true i recently
lost 12 oh wait no i haven't blogged in
like two months so i get it back on i
got a good one coming out though I'm
gonna do I got a meteor security
checklist and if you join the media club
mailing list you'll you'll get that in
your inbox a little PDF and then I'm
gonna put together like a mega security
kind of blog post roundup list together
in a couple of days as part of this so
got interesting cool that was that our
last topic it was by way of like I think
it messing up all our list anything else
new going on with you yeah just uh I
would say like that checklist has been a
focus and I'll have a personally I'll
have an interesting announcement pride
in the next week or two as well with the
kind of consulting type work she cannot
anything yeah to me yeah for me it's
just mostly working you know it's funny
we were talking about the mobile versus
web like I am absolutely full time on a
mobile app right now and nothing else so
see so you could tweet that to the
podcast cuz we want to count your vote
indeed I will I will no I've got a I've
got an assistant who works in Oregon and
I'll have her go through and kind of
tally out the knoll maybe we'll make a
nice pie chart or something but should
be should be interesting what about you
anything exciting or interesting oh yeah
always why not
gotta live right now we're actually i'm
just now actually working today on
astronomer I oh it's a new a new product
we're working on so oh nice is that the
thing that you you were looking for a
name on yeah and it was awesome the it's
I by the way if you're ever trying to
here's a little naming tip right come up
with ten crappy names of your own put it
on Lister IL which is and then invite
30-year smart friends to iterate on that
and like 22 hours later you you end up
with a great name nice we did that with
differential do you rember out when I do
yeah Gerard was the only came up with
differential I believe this time this
time Caleb who works at liquid tossed
out the astronomer IL and immediately I
got several emails like oh that's a
great name like okay yeah I agree
registries nice so yeah we chose a name
maybe I'll talk a little more about next
week i'm still like so deep into trying
to figure out how to talk about it yeah
nah sounds good yeah but it's forward to
it yep hi man alright guys thanks for
