fourth 2015 welcome crater fans how come
crater fans what is that voice man
that's my I'm sick and trying to
disguise a voice I'm your host Josh
Owens along with my co-host been Strahan
hello everybody sup Benny sup joshie poo
Benny crazy hair do you like how I a
major you're crazy hair image the you
tube image for the last video I didn't
see it yeah no you should go look okay
well it was partly it was one of the
three options so we do like that is
awesome we do like a 30 minute show and
like that's one of the images that
pulled out youtube did not fail us that
time the opposite of YouTube failure
it's awesome what are we talking on the
show today about ma'am you know i have
no idea i forgot i made the list on my
laptop if we split up over here so we're
gonna talk about graph ql a mango mango
structuring your react project galaxy
developer edition cool meteor dev shop
december i think that'll be a big book
yeah who's gonna react native and
meteors sittin in a tree k-i-s-s-i-n-g
and me strike yes alright so you missed
all my hand gestures if you weren't
watching the video on you out I wasn't
watching just now yeah we were ducking
I'm looking at the list I tried I tried
to punch you dang um let's get it right
well and mongodb tell us about that
ma'am yes so this to me is super
interesting because I'm starting to dive
more outside my comfort zone of meteor
land and trying to learn more about
graph ql and relay
and react and all that kind of stuff
because i think you know we'll get to it
a little bit later but obviously it's
it's coming whether you want it to or
not even if you use meteor and so i love
that this gap posted on crater it talks
about using graffiti and what exactly so
graffiti I kind of missed this part you
can use graffiti to add graph qln points
to your web server either you can use
schema generated by an adapter or you
can pass in your own and then they have
graffiti Mongoose that can generate the
graph ql schema from your database
schema deputy sits on your server side
yeah ok it's that's what it sounds like
and it hooks into work with mongoose and
so this is um you know if you're if
you're from meteor land which i'm sure a
lot of our listeners are they train um
yeah so I think you know if you if you
come from meteor land this is almost
akin to like just writing out your
simple schema but then you're getting
kind of like this graph ql interface in
here that you can you can start querying
against for your react app and you know
they're there they go on to talk about
how they're working on relay
compatibility which is kind of like a
back-end piece that a graph ql schema
would query against if that makes sense
mm-hmm and yeah so I don't know this is
like super interesting read I'm glad
people are working on things like this I
think that obviously like being able to
painlessly create your graph ql schema
is going to be something that's
important and you know if it's it makes
sense to kind of do it at the database
level to me anyway so you can just
create like that Mongoose
schema and then generate graph ql off of
it which is kind of cool I don't know
you're muted oh I just muted myself dude
I got these new headphones and there was
this guy out in the hallway like tap
dancing with his like banker shoes or
something like that you know those guys
that wear the shoes that like you hear
them walking down the hallway and you're
like oh that must be a girl in high
heels that's a guy that walks by any
dress shoes yeah yeah bet that was it
just was happening anyway when I was
muted I was talking about how graphic UL
is like the future man like this is how
we're going to be digesting data and
it's just like it's a really bright
future so um I would say like eat up
anything that's like graph ql and this
sound this just like rolling through it
I hit I didn't read it but I'm scrolling
through right now and it's like people
who are who are new to graph ql like
it's friendly for them so like you guys
can I can digest if I can digest that
you guys can digest it so go for it man
yeah let's do some digesting yeah so I
mean you're gross pin um if you if you
tuned in last week I'm pretty sure we
talked about like though the article
that covered graph ql a little bit um
but i think that i don't know maybe i'll
save some of these comments for later
there's also yes this is right learn
graph ql calm by Khedira yes by the air
anoda team they are no does team is cool
so but what can we do how can we build
an app with react once we we have a how
do we build it how do we structure it
how do we structure so from the same
website react Jas news com they got
another article that we're going to be
covering called how to structure a react
project I totally did not notice that
these were the same website look at
their oh I thought they were giving us
money sponsorship money for this
crap I gotta go ask for sponsorship
money though yeah seriously two in a row
man but that's that's cool man like that
they're putting out good content it's a
different writer though so I wonder
where they're grabbing this information
from but um no it's not it's not that
different it's just like a basic article
about structuring your app in in a way
that favors components and and it's just
modular code and I don't think it's
anything out of the ordinary you know
and I like how we wrote it though
because again people who aren't familiar
with this could come and read it and and
he has a little blurb on on building
something from an example site that
everything is in one file to an
enterprise app that's going to be having
components that are going to be digested
by multiple views and so they need to be
separate separated by there by those
concerns and so he walks through each
step and I don't know I mean what what
stood out to you that like interest you
about this article well i think you know
it's it's one of those things like I
think that a lot of our listeners that
are coming in maybe aren't fully aware
of react it may be how to work with it
and so I mean obviously if you come at
it from a meteor mindset I mean you you
you understand that you can build a
folder structure but this this one comes
with they've got a link to a web pack
configuration and they talk about you
know using CSS modules and all that kind
of stuff and so I found it interesting I
mean this is very very similar i wrote
an article like this for meteor as well
and how you might structure it and it
was similar in that you know you'd
create a view folder and kind of
structure based on your templates there
your tablet concerns and so I I liked it
one thing I'd like stood out in this
article that I really liked is is each
step each step of complexity he broke it
down so
not like he was trying to advocate just
one way of doing things right it was
like here's a way to get started here's
a way to go deeper mmhmm yeah I really
like it when people approach the problem
of how to tackle code or what library to
use or or how to structure stuff based
on the complexity of what you're trying
to accomplish yeah and that's how you
tackle this article and to me that's
always like a more intelligent way yeah
on how to teach and how to determine
what's best yeah I mean you're
definitely right like if you're going to
build an app that's maybe a hundred to
two hundred lines of code you probably
don't need like a huge folder structure
with a bunch of two liner files mmm
probably going to be really terrible
development experience for you actually
so yeah and a vast majority of the apps
out there in the world would be good
enough which is the components in their
own directories and you want to have to
be separating the views there's a vast
amount of apps like that and really if
you're like working with a big team and
a huge app that's that spans maybe
multiple groups working on it like I
could totally see then how you want to
break it out and like break out your
view separately but again it's like each
level is good only if you need it
because it does introduce another level
of complexity that you need to deal with
them yeah and he explained it perfectly
or he or she I'm sorry I didn't juho so
yeah I did a great job they oh yeah
Nephilim this is good like even with
meteor if you're just still doing plays
structuring your app it's the same one
like this how I structure my stuff right
now yeah i buy components essentially
mmm yeah yeah cool speaking of meteor
yeah we we had an announcement that
galaxy dev edition is out well it's not
out well yeah well yeah that was maybe
good that did get announced yeah it was
a little misleading I'm giving you a
hard time yeah when I saw it it was
um I actually thought it was out mm-hmm
seems weird have an announcement about
something yeah becoming available soon
but we did get pricing and so it looks
like it'll be about thirteen dollars per
container yep and you could and it's a
half a gig container their normal ones
right now are one gig over the dev
edition you have a half a gig and you
can get a maximum of five containers you
can start with one container at thirteen
bucks and scale up to five but you can't
scale past that now I think they're
going to like level you up to like the
five six hundred dollar-a-month program
we have to get ten one gig containers
from there so it's definitely like again
there's like this big gap you know you
get five containers you might not want
to jump up to 10 k 1 gig containers
right um but um you know it's just a
little nitpick thing I really celebrate
it like I tried to I signed up right
away I'm waiting for my invite I did too
I'm uh I'm still waiting for my invite
is good hey yo mdg you know you want
some free advertising hi yeah notice at
the top the list I guess I don't they do
they do come on I don't they don't uh
yeah so I to me the interesting thing
here is that you know there was a so
that the article i linked to was not
actually the announcement of galaxies
developer edition like coming out it was
talking about how the pricing is good
but then you know in typical fashion the
forums tend to devolve into a crazy
place on the cow I'm like reading the
title of this forum right now
there-there's 96 posts in this thread
and so that there's there was a little
bit of a kerfuffle here uh I say off the
forums my word of the day ya know much
drama I tend to avoid it when I can now
as well a holy cow I can't believe that
the title of this yeah developer edition
pricing is just absurd it feels like
hacker news
is but smaller right like you just get
all the bad comments and none of the
good I don't know there's something
there there could be some good stuff on
there but I think people just took some
of this energy that they have and do
something positive with it instead like
I'm sure about these comments the world
would be like a ten percent better place
at least I promise but max Hodges
pointed out apparently there was some
weirdness around the wording of lake we
don't recommend using developer edition
for production apps for a number of
reasons that there's less one of them
was less one of them was no critical
support because they only have like a
one-day SLA response time to me like
that's I think for most people that's
probably fine um and I I don't know why
but they've limited performance metrics
and monitoring so instead of 30 days you
get five minutes which is really crazy
too right there's probably gotta be some
happy meeting industry between 30 days
and I don't understand why they're doing
that though yeah only people right cause
them some storage ability right but uh
you know what it is you know I blog
doesn't scale very well so they just
decide not to not to deal with it top
blog I'm just kidding yeah um that's not
new to developer edition but oh I mean
on it on their actual app like they have
to store that data somewhere in Mongo oh
yeah yeah yeah like mmm
usually an app makes those limitations
like little silly limitations like that
just to upsell you to the next level
which usually isn't that huge of a jump
but in this case it is a massive jump
the upsell into the tent container yeah
so it's like why I started like five
hundred bucks and that's if you pay
yearly so why are people I what's up
with this like pettiness of like logs
and stuff and I don't I don't know again
I got just like in a there's an actual
support costs associated with keeping
that metric data so if you only got to
keep it for five minutes like flush it
out pretty quick okay anyway is what it
is I mean it's as pretty expensive
service so here's the interesting thing
if you click on the link i put in the
show notes matt the reg alice jumped in
here because mark trang bless his heart
he is a business guy and he was in there
trying to talk about how you shouldn't
use galaxy for production and you know
matt jumps in and says listen it's fine
for production right and like it's just
there's the different types of
containers and so it goes into how
they're using spot instances versus you
know regular AWS instances which means
like you know there there could
potentially be a little bit more down
time as their spot instance prices
aren't set quite right does that make
sense mmhmm yeah and so like they still
have a way to deal with that it's just
these spot instances are offered for a
fraction of the cost of other AWS
instances but that the difference is
like is someone outbid you on that cost
they're gonna shut your machine down and
they're gonna spin there's up since
they're paying a slightly higher rate
it's kind of like adsense for like AWS
whoever bids the most gets the box
so I don't understand so if I just have
one container is my appt going to be
going down and up and down and up
potentially right um just a penny I
don't have another container to like
just depends on what their what their
bids are and that kind of thing but I
you know I think behind the scenes uh
other hosting companies are doing a
similar thing if you look at modulus
which you know i'll just mention their
sponsor of the show full disclosure they
they have you know giant a digital ocean
and a bunch of other data centers that
they run on and so those have been up an
instance and deploy your app to it but
you know you could be on a server that
goes down Haruka's the same way yeah but
that's yeah but they have auto scaling
and yeah if you're on one server then
yeah like you can go down but how okay i
guess the question is like how often do
you get outbid if you're concerned well
I we don't know yet right I don't know
I'm not I've never dealt with spot
instances before so yeah yeah I don't
know like I don't I appreciate
everything that they're saying here but
for me like I look at this from a
standpoint of crater you know i don't i
don't really make any money with crater
I don't have ads on it I don't you know
I just I run it and try to do the best I
can with it because I love this
community love to figure out a way to
like make it faster but i don't know
like pour hundreds of dollars every
month into it and you know galaxy yeah
proclaim doesn't make any sense for me
no but and you don't need you don't need
that much power either well you know I
don't know I mean up at in there why I'm
at a two gig box on digital ocean so i
think i'm paying them like 20 bucks a
month right now or something and so for
two gigs for two boxes you'd have to get
four boxes then i'd almost be out of the
developer plane right i mean you'd have
four boxes have a gig each you know i
could see having multiple containers it
will it will be able withstand the spot
instance silliness oh yeah absolutely i
think if if uptime is a concern just
two instances you know yeah but like you
go to two instances it's one gig and
you're spending like 26 bucks a little
bit more than 26 bucks a month right but
you know at the same time like no now I
gotta look digitalocean that I have to
get my compose DB going so yeah but
already I'm approaching 40 bucks a month
i'm already at that you know yeah i'm
paying twenty bucks a month and then i'm
paying compose like 18 bucks a month
okay so like you're going to like tap on
10 more dollars to go to two containers
well that's half your size because you
got two gigs you'd only get one gig I'd
have to get four so that's 52 bucks plus
compose plus compose so 70 bucks vs. 38
bucks whoa but you also get you know the
one day SLA from a team that you know if
I if I email digital ocean and say my
media ain't working I don't know you
know I almost want to like I don't think
they have that many public-facing web
apps hosted on galaxy almost 1 i'd like
go host with them and turn on spider
bowl and then just be like spider-wolves
crashing my site and then let him fix it
well that marks gonna answer your
support call he's gonna be like go to
the pro edition ma'am yeah terrible kara
what we love you Mike sorry I have a
cheap shot okay right on right um man I
almost feel like I should go on the
forums just to like like b.o.b a
positive voice for mdg should i do that
I don't know yeah there yes man you go
ahead I don't know about yes man but
just like man summit I just fired this
up for the first time in like two weeks
and there's like some drama going on I
think it's been this way for a long time
though right but I haven't been on for
like two weeks and so yeah anywho so
next up dev shop shop December tell an F
shop of the year and whoops I just like
fire it up
accident don't want to do that um I
turned this on and I watched Jeff stock
was there talk before his mmm I don't
know I only turned it on when it was
time for Jeff's talk yeah I did too and
then I think I got through like two
lightning talks and I didn't listen to
the rest either so which was enough to
talk about like this is a big like so
customer day happened like two weeks ago
and and we we got we got the info and
shared it with you guys so move in
mm-hmm and now Jeff came out in this
December a deaf shop and that gave the
president same presentation that he gave
a customer day which was closed door so
that was great to like have it open up
into the community yeah yeah definitely
mm-hmm I think they've added a little
more like day they hadn't quite made
that commitment to graph ql right you're
right that was a pretty hard commitment
like he was talking about that was the
slide when he was talking about what's
to come in 2016 they had a really big
graph ql logo in there mm-hmm um
basically they had a lot of big facebook
library logos in there i don't know if
that meant anything i just think they're
doing a lot of cool i I don't I
don't know if it means I think the only
thing it means for me is like if I'm if
I'm gonna be using all those libraries
anyway because the the framework i was
using is relying on them then like I i
have a feeling like facebook's gonna do
something smart at some point and i
don't know oh okay I'm down with this
yeah I know we had that little
conversation we did we did we did it's
funny because like I just recorded the
Ben and Abby show and we're
experimenting we did like five shows all
at once recorded five shows all at once
we're gonna like spaced out to delivery
of them please yeah they're like short
shows by anyway the last show that we
did was going to be the end year show
and it was our predictions for 2016
yeah and so like now this is I hear you
say that it's kind of like yeah a wild
prediction yeah just like I don't think
it's a wild and out of the sky I don't
think it's a wild prediction I think
it's wild no I mean they're building
relay there they're building redux like
they're clearly implementing a lot of
this stuff inside of facebook and i
think that developers are valuable to
facebook and they want to figure out how
to tap into that if you look at like um
please just like they want to get
developers from facebook they want to
grill dinner team by grabbing face no no
I mean um no no okay it just sounded
like it I don't think that's what you
meant no yeah you're right that's not
what I meant so what I mean is if you
look at Twitter versus facebook nobody
runs Twitter ads and frankly I think you
know you see a lot of articles about how
twitter is dying and all this jazz and i
don't know like i was a developer that
was building a twitter app and i got
screwed and my appt got shut down
basically by their their rate limiting
policies and you know i was there in
early days and had a whitelist account
so i used to be able to make like a
million calls per hour but you know
Twitter kind of screwed with the
developer community and shut them down
and i think that they've suffered for it
um their platform just isn't what it
should be um isn't growing the way they
wanted to grow and people aren't buying
ads and that's how they make their
dollars right like follow the money like
you say right mm-hmm and so if you look
at facebook on the other hand like
clearly like I bought facebook ads my
facebook ads have you blocked facebook
ads absolutely yeah it is an amazing ad
platform because like narrow down and
target the people you want but I don't
think it's the fact that Twitter lacks
that data I think it's the fact that
they just don't have like the same
experience when you type in twitter com
it's not nearly this
when you type in facebook.com you know
like I think twitter has more savvy
users sure yeah absolutely that's what
it is but my parents aren't on Twitter
but what I'm trying to get out here is
the fact that I think that Facebook
cares for its developer community and
they build apps that make that a better
experience for everyone involved and
Twitter just doesn't really have that as
much you know and I think by extension
that if you have a bunch of developers
who use something like react and relay
and Redux and graph ql and all this kind
of stuff and they're familiar with it
and they understand how to work with
your api's like they're gonna build apps
or absolutely they're easier to hire as
well right if you get half the world
developing on all this stuff like that's
going to be easier for them to hire
people as well okay so your prediction
is I'm still not clear so you're saying
that they're gonna build work or a
platform or whatever you want to call it
they're going to come out with something
now you think that Facebook is going to
release an open-source version or they
just going to like provide a service
through course it'll be open source
really it's not going to be through
parts I don't think so but I you know I
could be wrong I mean like why they open
sourcing all the rest of the pieces so
what's the what's the backend gonna be
is gonna be PHP I doubt it the elixir oh
oh no inside joke yeah she's or in bed
inside the club joke to me you know this
this really goes back to like seeing
that slide it goes back to exactly what
we talked about before where you said
follow the money like meteor has to be a
hosting company so when you do the math
right let's let's just look at hosting
companies you have Heroku which open
source community are they building which
like open source platform are they
building they're not there to Salesforce
okay which is like totally closed first
wife their naughty
okay well what so let's let's go look at
modulus which which which open source
platform / they building there now no BB
do your eyes hey they actually are with
a salesforce competitor called progress
now mm-hmm so I think that you know you
just that you have an extra cost
structure bolted onto your hosting
company in the form of the meteor
platform it's going to be very very hard
for them to make dollars and turn a
profit when they have to pay for
infrastructure they have to pay for
support people they have to pay for a
sales staff and business development
people and they have to pay for
developers for their hosting platform
and developers for the open source
platform that's an extra cost that no
one else has and then it's going to be
hard for them to be competitive I don't
think so you know I what I probably
shouldn't chew gum I'll do it I guess
yeah um because right now they're making
the right moves I really I believe in
MTG in the direction of their going they
are slowly taking their responsibilities
and the liabilities that they have right
now in these packages that they made
like blaze and they are they are kind of
shifting it over to then some other open
source project to manage sure and then
that totally makes sense for mdg testing
was going to be a huge drain on their
resources it's a huge importance mdg was
candid enough to say we're not going to
pick that up they have a business plan
where it's like they're gonna they want
to have this like they just want to have
a happy path so to me that's kind of
like just a nice build tool with some
magic in between each of the packages
core packages and that's what they're
going to maintain I don't think that
they're going to have a lot past that
and if they do they're going to be
looking for an open source ah can
unity to like fill that cap eventually
so you're saying though you don't think
Facebook put together a small team to
build that build tool with a couple
pieces of glue in between oh I certainly
think they can but I don't think they
will mmm because again they react and
the things that are coming out of
facebook also satisfies also satisfies
Facebook's needs they're not developing
it just for the community itself they're
developing it for facebook first and
then they're taking those teams that are
developing those tools and say hey go
ahead and like open this up to the world
and a wider audience it's going to make
our tool better by doing that but
they're not going to make a whole
separate team to build something that's
never going to be integrated in facebook
how many new apps are they as facebook
coming out with yeah but I you know I
did I needed something to think that
they might not already be thinking about
this I mean it will get like Google and
some of the stuff that they've done with
big tables and all that kind of stuff
like or even go you know I mean it was
google is different and they're changing
to like they had a radical we're getting
way off topic but they had a radical
restructure when they had um Schmidt
Eric uh became alphabet you mean well no
even before that when they said Eric
you're not you're not gonna be CEO
anymore and before they would sit down
with their best engineers and their best
product guys and they would and girls
and they would say hey what interest you
do you have a project you want to make
great go off and do that don't worry
about money we'll figure out how to make
a problem if it grows big 10 at least
app that completely my point is like if
so it's it's this is a crazy thing to
think about like the size of Facebook
and the amount of stuff that it does
like saving one watt of power per server
can save them like millions of dollars
per year and so pursuing this kind of
thing like having a a better way to
write applications that will shave off
one developer / team like yeah I are not
developing new applications sure they
they're either developing them or
they're buying them right but not a
massive amount of them and not where
it's like painful it's like you know
they have other pain points they have
refactoring pain points so they're going
to they're going to and they also have
like all these different code bases and
stuff so they're going to be looking to
make general tools react as a general
tool graph ql is a general tool that
answers a lot of those problems that
they're having you see you I'm saying I
I see what you're saying but at the same
time like I'm telling you like as a
large company they look at their cost
centers and they try to figure out how
to reduce them and I'm yeah I'm not just
I I think that you know I don't think
we're done with less developers they're
probably gonna try to figure out a way
to do that yeah I don't know yeah I'm
glad that we disagree this is a good
conversation yeah it is oh don't be sad
because i won I'm not sad cuz he lost
I'm you know I mean here's you know what
you today hijacked my my topic 2 I did I
did I know I was too i thought about
some of this last night but at the end
of the day how many like you said
something someone said something about
was it you that said like I could see
mediator being a billion-dollar company
no they're not gonna be a unicorn yeah
was someone in the middle black Chad and
I'm like show me billion-dollar hosting
company there is not one out there no no
no and all of them exit somewhere so I
mean you know I do agree with you on
that like they are in it they don't exit
I'm glad that there I am glad that they
are minimizing their obligation to this
open source platform by like trying to
like like blaze is done they didn't take
on velocity I am happy and they didn't
integrate a router I am happy for that
because they need to be real scrappy in
the industry that they're in they picked
to be hosting that their industries
hosting that that's going to be their
revenue they have to be a real scrappy
company to survive yeah so
no they're not going to be a billion
dollars absolutely now all right let's
move on well dude okay so we got to talk
about this stuff really quick Jeff
talked go listen to the video oh yeah
meteor dev shop and then I really
thought it was interesting sash goes
talk about I did not catch that one oh
it's huge you should totally go see it I
did my i did go poke around the guy
that's there though I did see that I
really liked how he how he framed
everything on why they're doing this so
he was saying that there's these two
camps one camp says that hey meteor you
need to be more opinionated more
opinionated more opinionated there's the
other camps it says hey we like how you
are where you're like you're loosely
held to your positions and you give more
options to developer right and sashko
came in and said so this is a this is a
lot of the feedback that we're getting
and so here's an answer we're going to
do both and basically what they're
saying is they're going to have the
framework be onion pinion ated where you
can kind of like interpret it how you
want and build a how you want if you're
in if you're in advance situation or an
app that needs to break out of the norm
but they're going to have this meteor
guides which is guidelines not standards
and that's where the opinionated way of
doing things will be right so if you
choose to start off opinionated you got
somewhere to go to answer all that
they're not going to slap your hand or
throw errors if you don't do things the
way that you want they want you to do it
they are going to give you this guide
this guidance that you want on this
official path to take well that is
awesome this is awesome like this is
what enterprise wants they want a guided
way but then they also want to be able
to break out and the other interesting
thing is like you know we don't there's
really not much documentation around the
rate limiter and the security articles
out there it's not all the way done but
it's close and they've got like you know
they explained how and why you should
use the rate limiter mm-hmm and
previously the only other thing you
could find was on a blog post as far as
I was worried so yeah in the past they
kind of like post things all over the
place to like hack pad was popular for
their postings for a little bit and now
they just
equipe it's like how do we find these
things like we just like who's a random
google searches and like Rishi we just
rely on Richie I know it's like just
wild stuff and no one announces it or
official it's like yeah he would post
their sashko poster so I really am happy
to hear about guides and their support
for it Jeff mentioned that you guys is
important to them yeah well you know
that's I mean that's probably the
toughest piece right like its you can
you can send to those to work on it now
and spend you know month month and a
half of half time on it and get
something out the door but things change
all the time you know like i'm now
sitting on a cache of blog post that
half of them are probably outdated in
some way and should be updated but i
don't necessarily make money off of that
and so therefore like there's just these
like posts languishing out there for the
community well that's maybe something
how they can grow their team maybe and
so like the people who are like kind of
laying the groundwork right now they'll
become team leads or whatnot and they
like hire their own team and it's it's
doable I can see it organically growing
hopefully if they meet their growth
goals anyway dude like guys go check out
the dev shop it was worth it especially
those two talks yeah and then wiccan was
was pretty awesome it's the Trello knock
off so that was a pretty awesome
lightning talk anyway that's as far as I
got like yeah that was like an extended
lightning talk it was well deserved man
it was it was awesome yeah all right
good stuff what's up next man we got on
a huge Segway we did sorry Oh react
native and a meteor together due to two
holding hands it's lovely singing songs
so it's a super short article Patrick I
think it's Patrick about the author you
know it doesn't say his name p mutants
uh yeah i don't know i'm pretty sure
it's patrick so everybody
you should put your full name down at
the bottom of your post but uh what here
will click through to the github commits
Philip wow I totally missed that one so
Philip wrote this post about building a
small app called friends and it's just a
react native app it looks like they're
working on both the iOS and the Android
I see build for both um but I'm not sure
if the Android one is working yet let's
see yeah cuz the raid me was two days
ago in the build check in was two days
ago so but basically it's a repo and
well that's a blog post that connects
you to the repo and it's just got a
couple pictures but the repos the
interesting part it's got a meteor app
and it's got the react native app in it
and it's not super crazy like I I like
that it's just a small amount of code so
you can kind of figure out what's going
on here um there's only one collection
for friends I think maybe the thing that
was interesting to me is that even
though it was small I totally punted on
like authentication and stuff so that
seemed like the tough thing to do but at
the same time differential put an
article out about that yeah so but the
good part is you know you look at the
iOS JS file it's like 100 and 105 lines
of code and there's like one Cole that's
like four or five lines to get the DDP
stuff kind of set up it's about six
lines total and then like it's just
updating a ListView I mean it again it's
it's super super simple but yeah so they
just have a DDP client package in there
and they're just bringing in the feed
and they have it and this is all
based off of the good stuff that um
what's his name Harrison Harnish firmus
fondly he got um uh WebSocket support in
the reaction oh really yeah while ago
mmm yeah we were chant about this like
what a day or two ago or yesterday yeah
and I was doing some research about it I
was like his website and supporting
react native you have a horrible time
like I'm having all not horrible but i'm
having a tough time with some cordova
stuff right now mm-hmm and so it has me
like looking for another mistress or
something like that you know what's out
there what's going on you know yeah and
so I was like man react native is like
looking good um we should probably touch
on this little bit also uh meteoric um
is closed down done yeah you should add
a link to the show notes buddy which is
ablaze a port of ionic yeah yeah which
then goes right into cordova so that's
closed down and so now our choices are
basically look down it's just not all
actively maintained any I'm wording it
wrong yes totally I deserve that but you
got the you got the regular ionic with
angular you got react with with react
and those both are going over Cordova
what do you really want to do that and
then you got react native and react
native and this is a great example of
how you can get reactivity ah natively
and it's not that hard it is not that
hard like Josh was saying like it's
pretty simple example that anyone could
follow and that's what makes it so great
yeah so um yeah I think you know the
difference I think for a lot of people
is going to be the react native like
styling so if you something like react
or ionic or any of that stuff like it's
just CSS at the end of the day oh you're
getting some some smart style sheets
that figure out what to
do on devices correctly whereas with
react native you you've kind of got like
this it's custom style sheet kind of
setup hey use flex box yeah it's not a
hue it's not like a whole new paradigm
right I guess flexbox is starting to get
popular but like I've used to perform in
the past so like it's not here's just I
think it's a little different not a lot
different yeah yeah there there's these
little hurdles um I read an awesome
article Oh Elijah posted on Twitter from
Space Camp I don't know your last name
you later you're awesome about like a
native iOS objective developer and his
biz dev guy came to him their consulting
firm and they wanted to build their next
project for discovery channel in react
native rather than him just building it
natively and he was like I'll
pooh-poohing about it at first of all
stuff and at the end he was like I'm not
going back yeah i'm a native i'm gonna
i'm an objective c or Swift developer
I'm not going back I'm going to be doing
react native going forward yeah because
he likes so much and it was a good
medium post maybe I should send you a
link yeah on why it's good but um wait
you know what you do you tweet it so if
you guys really want to see this article
you should be following been on Twitter
yeah i retweeted it so okay it's it to
my feet it's like that one of the top
recent five posts so anywho this is a
great example i'm glad that josh has
this to our list because it's simple
it's not that hard it's not like some
some endangered species that you gotta
go hunting for and and you're gonna like
yak shave it's not yeah it's not so you
don't already done it for you they've
shaved all the X give a yak free path
well you get a book you get a path full
of like bald yaks so for a while anyway
so like so like lick one on your way to
the mountain did your weird I don't that
that really went to a weird place all
right talk about your site did you
seriously picture licking a yak
nice you licking a yak yeah oh that's
weird meteor strike strike but up pop
but net now you got that stupid
McDonald's tune in my end great uh yes
so here's a new podcast in town yep good
friends down there in Charlotte marker
yeah wrap Shire and company mark is
awesome yes text Oh actually I don't
know who tech go is I'm sure i do i'm
sure i met him i will say I'm sorry for
that you're not coming to mind for those
of you who haven't known shrap or mark
he was on one of our recent meteor club
podcast oh yeah yeah we talked about
four episodes back paid packages yes
yeah yeah he is not new to podcasting no
not at all um but they're uh they're
kind of working on something new down
there called HP 5 and they're opening up
some co-working and part of that is you
know they just want to be more involved
in the community and so they put
together a quick podcast quick podcast
podcast that's a quick listen and you
know they are they 88 minutes and 50
seconds for the first one and 11 minutes
and 18 seconds for the second one so
roughly 10 minutes yeah which is great
this is the opposite of what this
episode is do just because I like
talking to you and what you're silent or
that Xperia respond uh but uh so they
just they focus on covering packages
meteor packages at least that's their
initial focus and they're just have a
little bite-sized episodes on meteor
packages and the first one they cover is
a browser policy I thought it was great
first one is
community makes us great yeah well the
first one that covers a package oh okay
yep all right so I guess guys so goes
