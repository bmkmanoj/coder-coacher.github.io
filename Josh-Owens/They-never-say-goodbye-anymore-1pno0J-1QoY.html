you
all right it's almost eight forty out
early writings that swim gonna try to
get an hour and I'm not sure that's
gonna happen
Oh
Oh
3.1 3 miles in almost 35 minutes Brayden
stayed the night with us for father's
day say hi bring I say bye bring back
see you later buddy we didn't really do
anything too exciting i just wanna bid
relax it's a lot like last sunday to be
honest cuz again whoever did it on
saturday so i've never really talked
about why i'm vlogging there were a
couple things that I was hoping to
accomplish with vlogging uh one was too
i I've been struggling with the right
format to get out thoughts about
development and like what's happening in
my day-to-day life or like things that
are relevant like I've been doing
software development for 10 years
thought about doing serious blog posts
about being a developer and like how I
got where I am or doing like I actually
picked up a domain name to do a podcast
I actually recorded like a 10 minute
video um but in the end this just felt
like the right format that was one
reason for doing this another one was I
wanted to get better at editing videos I
feel like it's not a strong suit of mine
right now like I i put a good bit of
stuff I've got like 170 videos up on
youtube or something like that now but I
wanted to to get better at editing
faster at it so I can produce more
technical content for my channel and
that this this helps me like doing this
every day helps me get faster I like the
idea of reflecting on my day and putting
together this footage like and thinking
about like being present in the moment
like I don't know um
like I'm always trying to think of a fun
shot now and the kids really get into it
and they seem to enjoy it and I feel
like I'm getting more of an eye for
interesting things that are happening
around me so there's certainly been a
number of times that I've missed great
shots and so I'm learning that I should
always have a camera on me as well but
it just gives me a new appreciation for
what exactly is going on in my day and
like how I can capture that in an
interesting way and like i'm not i'm not
a jet setter you know i don't i don't
travel around the world although I do
have a trip coming up it gets all
relative right like I have people say
something to me like i love your videos
they're so interesting and it looks like
your life is so fun from them and it's
like you know prior to starting this it
just felt like i was going through the
motions every day trying to get client
worked on and get out new content that
kind of thing but now it's a little more
exciting to me lunch at half day cafe
just got home from lunch and did some
pair we did poker planning actually and
then a little bit of pair programming
and while I was doing that penny and
Whitney ended up going to the pool say
hi penny
and now we're dropping penny off so we
had actually so I got picked up this
morning right she went to see her
grandma and now we're dropping penny off
to her the other grandparents so we're
gonna be kid free gonna go have a nice
meal somewhere sans children
you
winded up at Taft alehouse it's quite
delicious
I've been running a lot more so that was
another thing like i wanna i wanna make
sure I run every day so if you don't see
me run in a video call me how</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
