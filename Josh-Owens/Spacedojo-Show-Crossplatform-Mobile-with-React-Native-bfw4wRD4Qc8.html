host josh owens and today our panel
includes been do good welcome Ben okay
and our special guest today is Thomas
Goldenberg welcome hey Jess you prefer
tommer thomas uh tom only my immediate
family called me Thomas nice okay
awesome I'm a medium family now of
course um uh yeah so today I know we've
talked about it in the past like right
when the the show back in January
pivoted to kind of cover more JavaScript
topics we covered react native with
Bonnie husband and she did a good job
but I you know I just I feel like using
javascript for mobile is uh is pretty
important and I wanted to come back and
kind of cover the topic again and so um
I still have not used react native yet
but um I know I know tom has have you
been you react native no not yet I never
had the chance but I look forward to it
will then do awesome alright so once you
tell us a little bit about yourself
almond and what you've been working on
and how it relates sure i'm i'm pretty
new to the whole engineering software
engineering scene i I kind of had a
career switch about two years ago and
when I was investigating the the jungle
that is JavaScript frameworks at the
time I i really fell in love with react
and so I you know I invested pretty
early on and you know all the jobs that
I've gotten since then have involved
reactant a meteor as well which is how
we know each other but you know when I
had the opportunity from a meteor react
job to work with a company doing react
native I jumped on it and that was about
a year ago and since then I've been
involved in the community and just
recently published a tutorial for
building apps with react native
nice we talked about it a little bit on
the crater podcast not too long ago and
that's actually like how the
conversation got started and one of the
things that I found interesting in the
tutorial maybe less about react native
but was the the back-end service you're
using can you tell us a little bit about
deployed yeah sure so the way that the
tutorial came about was I had partnered
as a side project with a friend of mine
Nick Brown he's a product manager huge
which is you know just a lot of
consulting work for mobile apps and you
know we built an app with react native
for iOS and you know we came across so
many like so many obstacles because of
lack of documentation and and so that's
how we decide to get the idea to build
this tutorial and when we were building
tutorial we wanted to make the API part
of it as easy as possible and we just
kind of happened across deployed it
makes it really easy to to just spin up
an API really fast and they have a
graphical user interface so that you can
just type in the name of your
collections have kind of constraints on
the collections for what you know what
type of data can have and it's worked
fairly well
yeah that's that's nice that's always a
challenge I feel like I give a class
where we teach students how to build a
Cordova application using meteor and
react and I feel like a good portion of
the time is spent kind of showing off
the meteor back in um that's not
necessarily like the interesting part of
the class like it's probably good for
some people but if you're not familiar
with it like I just like shoot it at you
so fast i feel like people maybe get
confused so um I definitely like always
on the lookout for easier ways to ya in
the thing with meteor you know that the
whole DDP connection like it definitely
works well with with react native apps
but that's only for a situation where
you need that real-time connectivity and
I feel in the majority of cases people
just want to rest API endpoint for their
mobile app and so that's why we we
looked away from meteor we you know that
the actual tutorial the website for is
built with meteor because we love
building web apps with it but you know
for for a rest api they're definitely a
lot of other options you guys look into
graph q a little and other services like
reindex and i think there's another one
i'm forgetting the name that i offer
like graph ql backends as a service you
just think about that at all so at the
time we we started this it's been many
months in the making this tutorial and
so we we had the idea like 10 months ago
I want to stay after we initially
released our iOS app so graft well back
then wasn't really on my radar and in
the last two or three months after you
know watching a lot of tutorials and
talks and stuff I feel like it's
starting to get a lot more adoption um
so you know we decided to stick with
rest to fit like the majority of use
cases um but I myself from definitely
looking to graph you I find it extremely
interesting how about you Josh have you
done anything lagreca well uh I just
started a project for a client and like
I've actually got to do some graph cool
stuff for it like
tonight or tomorrow so um maybe ask me
again later um but no like it's it's
definitely interesting to me like it was
I think it's always a problem that I had
like when i worked at at outwrite a
company that got bought by godaddy like
they just didn't didn't have a good API
set up there wasn't any thought put into
it up front and like graph graph ql
definitely tends to just solve that
problem and foolish it a to build
something good up front and not have to
think about like what what's being sent
back and forth like as long as the
server knows how to resolve it like you
can serve it to the clients mackeir I I
mean I've been experimenting with it
lately and just the like I think it's
the Star Wars example that they have is
in a lot of degradation and it's it's
pretty freaking amazing um but you know
I I work for a company we use meteor and
react and you know II I feel like you
have to there has to be some time to
before you just make a big decision like
that and so I'm definitely investigating
graphic well for possibly bringing into
the company I work for now but uh you
know I some things you can't always be
in the cutting edge um so we I'm right
now I'm kind of in the exploration phase
and seeing how easy will be to
transition into that yeah I tend to like
sidestep that by green fielding a new
client and then telling them like oh hey
is it mission-critical cause like if
it's not mission-critical we can totally
try this new thing and it'll it'll make
sense for your business in the long run
and so like I just convinced someone
that they need it for their app and yeah
we're gonna give that a go cuz I think
like meteor would not have been a good
fit for this particular project cuz they
don't need any real time stuff you know
they're just kind of creating data and
getting it back and displaying some
graphs so whether you been have you done
anything with crappy well yeah i was on
a research team for this company called
ultimate software I in turn their last
summer and yeah we we built this app
that use graph ql so that the back one
is all
back end is all broken up into
microservices and we used event sourcing
see QRS which stands for command query
response segregation anyways it event
starts on the back end and then for the
the query model so all the views we just
use graph ql so the client can get
whatever it wanted it's pretty cool I
really really liked it yeah I'm a big
fan of craft you okay I was thinking
about this earlier and and like Redux is
kind of become standard procedure now um
but you know at a ghola where I work it
took I just wrote a blog post about this
of you know our migration from meteor
and react into you know bringing in
redux and you know it took several
months to really do the full research to
build a project and then to bring it to
the company and say hey you know this
could really give us value so I kind of
feel like I'm in the beginning stages of
that with graft well and uh that's yeah
yeah you know github just put out a good
article where they they kind of talked
about that similar process like just
picking a portion of their API that they
wanted to revamp with new functionality
and they built that with graph ql and
kind of force them to create
infrastructure and how it works and then
now they're able to just call it out to
the internet api so definitely makes
sense um you know I'm kind of curious
like when it comes to developing mobile
apps have you played with Cordova before
or progressive web apps or any other
form of like building a mobile app prior
to try and react native so like I said I
i I'm kind of a beginner on the scene I
like I said I only have two years of
experience in interest software
engineering in general and I just
naturally made the transition to react
native i mean i was using meteor to
build web apps and I i suppose i could
have utilize it to build mobile apps at
the time but the people that I talk to
you weren't that happy with how the real
results they were getting so while I
haven't I haven't used Cordova haven't
really i don't have first
an experience with you know the meteor
cordova integration going out like I
organizing the react native meet up in
NYC I get to talk to a lot of people who
have used these different technologies
and that's kind of forms from my
opinions yeah yeah i think you know to
me like react native is is super
interesting because um i think i just i
found the performance to be not quite
there with cordova um like it's I think
it's good enough but maybe it's not the
best depending on the app you're
building I guess you know like if I
think about um just kind of looking at
my phone if I think about like a podcast
player like maybe it's okay for a
podcast player to do Cordova right but
maybe maybe for something like uber it
probably wouldn't make sense to Cordova
um because we're we're like drawing
things on the screen and kind of using
animations in that I mean I think it
really depends where you are as a
company like I think Amazon's entire app
is still Cordova so I mean they're doing
plenty fine in terms of revenue and
everything so um but you know they also
built it several years ago and if they
if Amazon were to you know launch now or
whatever I think they would make
different decisions so I I definitely
don't recommend react native if you
already have built out something you
know and you're thinking of ditching
that and rebuilding the entire thing in
react native because you know if that
were the good thing to do Facebook would
be doing that and they're not um so I I
think it I think it meets a good use
case for new companies number one that
want to reach both the Android and iOS
markets because that's like increasingly
very very important and for companies
that are only on one platform and so
I've seen a lot of companies that are
either only on iOS or and they want to
expand to Android and they have a dev
team that knows JavaScript very well and
so they're building their android app
and react native that's what I've seen
very commonly
yeah that's super interesting i know
there was a talk from him react to
europe a couple years ago Jed Watson
talked about making a Cordova app and he
was talking about he was comparing
Cordova to react native and I found it
really interesting because its
previously to his talk I was always just
like react david native is just kind of
obviously superior to Cordova from I
guess a lot of performance reasons and
then I think once you stand it i think i
just think it makes more sense it's
running more natively um but he gave
this talk where he talked about Cordova
and was saying you really can develop
for mobile using web tech like if you
know what you're doing like if you and
and if you really know the internals and
if you really try to make the web app
that you're making the Cordova app that
you're making look like you know the
standard like iOS guidelines and Android
guidelines it is doable um and I think
they have their own so they're using
react still which is which is kind of
cool react in Cordova I think it's
called touchstone j/s now that was a
really interesting talk because up until
that point I was pretty much like react
native for all mobile apps like why
wouldn't I and I still think you know if
i were to greenfield a project i would i
would use react native but it was an
interesting interesting topic yeah you
know that's a good point like um we we
did we used a meteoric for the last big
project i was on that was mobile and we
used cordova a meteor and all that kind
of stuff and I think some of the
performance issues we had was more
related to DDP itself's DDP batching
really would have helped a ton on this
particular project and like it's this
not necessarily it didn't always come
down to like Cordova couldn't do the
thing we needed to do or couldn't do it
fast enough like we didn't run into some
memory issues I wonder if thats related
to Cordova but um outside of that like
that's a great point like it's not
necessarily Cordova versus reactive I
mean it really depends on like like I
said like what what's your team if your
team is all Cordova developers and they
have that experience is it going to
be worth it learning a new technology to
build a new I um I think all things
being equal if you know it's a
completely blank slate and you come in
and choose Cordova react native um I I
would go for react native and that you
know that's that's my bias because I've
usually heck native and I i feel like
the arguments that I've heard for the
performance are you know I get that did
the other difficulty with react native
is that some people complain about is
that the you know that it's been going
through a lot of changes and you know it
hasn't really a lot of people say it's
not stable there's been a lot some
breaking changes from release versions
and everything so building a tutorial
that was really interesting because we
would build you know these features and
everything and now you know we have to
change the code because one example was
react native had its own version of
react in the react native of module and
then they refactored it out so that
react native is there's only a soul
react repository the react native calls
upon so before your import react and
your elements from react native and you
have to go through your entire code and
change stuff uh that cause a lot of
complaints from people and since then I
feel like they're doing a good job at
like trying to be very incremental their
changes so those are some of the other
disadvantages I've heard they ship
really often don't they a new version of
react native every week yeah that's
crazy yeah yeah I mean that that's the
good thing that Facebook has a team
dedicated to this I'm unreacted reactant
ative and I think that's also kind of a
one reason to have some confidence and
how it's going to grow yeah it's
exciting
yeah one of the things that I was kind
of interested in and I don't know like
if your tutorial covers this or not but
like Bonnie's why spill covered it a
little bit but um like how much code
reuse are you seeing between creating
like the iOS app and the Android app and
you know what what's that like yeah sure
I'd love to talk about that so obviously
you know there's going to be some
platform specific stuff that you're
going to use what we're seeing is the
community has come forward and has
bridged that gap a little bit so before
for example you had an activity
indicator iOS and you have an activity
indicator only for Android and you know
the community has you know made that
native component work now just as
activity indicator for both platforms
but we actually had you know in the
react native NYC meet up we had a really
cool talk from delivery calm and and
they're an example of a large company
that experimented with react native on
iOS in there Cordova app actually so
they Brittany they did a small module
using rack native they liked it and then
they they built an entire Android app
and react native they got approval for
it and they gave a talk on reusing their
components across the platforms and I
really wish it was recorded because they
gave some great talks but I'm going to
talk to Jesse and Bruno so they can
republish some of that stuff how does
that work as for our sharing styling
because I know you don't want the
Android and iOS app to look exactly the
same and that's why you have these
different you know different native
components but like there are different
style guidelines for Android than there
are for iOS and so obviously you're not
reusing the styling correct there I mean
I think it depends i I just before this
podcast I checked out crater that I oh
and there was a blog post react native
is dead right actually put that one up
so it's pretty funny that you yeah I
mean I didn't write the post I didn't
write the post I just saw it and thought
it was really interesting so
I thought I was really interesting and
in Brent Brent vinay who was on the
react native team now he's with
exponents and in his discussion I really
respect Brent he's been an amazing
contributor and I think it's really
great stuff he's doing but he brings up
some good points which is you know
material material design is a great
thing but you just because you're doing
an Android app doesn't mean that you
have to leverage all of material design
I love material design and you know I
use the material you I package on meteor
and react for for styling but I I do
agree with that that even if you're
building an Android app like you you
don't have to do everything exactly by
that style guide what do you think Josh
I'm just kind of looking at this article
i love the the kind of the faux
conversation at the top or the
recruiters like why don't you want to
work at a company that uses cordova and
the guy was like I'm gonna top 100 apps
in the App Store none of those ab she's
cordova i want to build the best
possible apps i can so i don't use
cordova nor am i interested in learning
how to build cordova applications I you
know I don't I don't even know how you
know whether it use Accord over not um I
guess I've never died that deep but it's
interesting um i don't know i don't like
11 of the things he says in the blog
post is that while react native offers
this awesome functionality because it's
open-ended and not really highly
opinionated on how you should style it
that people end up making mobile apps
that look like web apps and totally true
I mean people that are getting into
react native for doing so is they don't
want to learn Swift they don't want to
have to code in Java to build the
Android app and so it's it's a great
thing to do as a side project if you're
a web developer yeah well I think even
even if you're comfortable with Swift
right let's say i decide i do want to
learn Swift lake you're right there's
one thing i don't want to do and that's
i don't i don't want to learn java just
so i can put out an android app and
that's where i think the beauty like
that code reviews kind of comes into
play um and I you know I'm almost
curious like how have you looked at
react web which is like react native but
it renders to web rather than like using
react itself you you can still write the
react native components and put out a
way yeah yeah I thought that was really
interesting when I saw that coming out
that piece of news and it kind of is
like against the react philosophy of you
know right learn once right anywhere and
it's more like right once and run every
everywhere but uh like people are doing
all kinds of crazy stuff with react
native and um so so yeah if that fits
someone's use case that's great I
haven't actually tried it myself
I I would love to see it react native
for like I watch I think that would be
really cool we haven't seen it yeah so I
you know I I don't know how easy that's
gonna be to pull off because like the
Apple I think the apple TV would maybe
be the better target there um or at
least more interesting to me like I'd
love to build a mobile or an app for the
TV that that's built using javascript
but uh like it's definitely I know like
a lot of people are thinking about those
types of things because they did
announce that react native runs for
it'll run on the xbox and like windows
and that kind of thing so yes super
interesting there's react native desktop
and I even heard there's a react native
VR which is pretty interesting and then
I keep seeing just all these various
react stuff and overreact sound is a is
a library for a web it's for normal
react but it just interfaces directly
with the the Web Audio API but you write
it in jsx which is kind of cool I'm just
stuff like that but it's it's really
interesting react native VR sounds crazy
alright so um one of the things you
mentioned is that you've started the
react native meet up in New York City
like what what has that experience been
like and um you know what's-what's
attendants been like that kind of thing
um so yeah so yeah the way that it
started I was working at sue which was a
start-up in New York City and we were at
the time like the only company that I
knew of in new york city using react
native and so me and a co worker harry
and also nick who worked with me on the
iOS app on the side we we just thought
that there there needed to be a specific
meet up for this technology because
there's a lot of react meetups and
they'll do kind of like you know getting
started with react native you know one
time every five or six five months or so
but we wanted to build this community so
that we
could kind of kind of share the
difficulties we were going through at
the time and it's it's really grown a
lot and we've had some some great talks
by people and and it's amazing to see
the interest in and not just startups
and small companies but large companies
are expressing interest and and starting
to use react native we're getting kind
of like you know like I think it was CNN
money and and like more larger company I
said you know delivery calm is of course
but that's been one of the the really
interesting things that you start to see
that people are trying to pay a lot more
attention in New York City um so yeah
it's been a great experience yeah i
think the the react native community is
really interesting because it's it's so
new and all of the people in the react
community kind of dove into the react
native community just headfirst when it
first got announced and it was just all
this excitement from oh like this is so
new and cool and i know that the
contributions to the react native
project are a lot higher than or sigma
tire but they're higher than the react
contributions which i think is really
cool and just the whole concept of react
native and react it's just like it's
very uh opinionated so you see all these
people coming together and just really
sharing how they solve certain problems
and I guess sharing their opinions in a
place where I typically react is very
unappealing from other people and see
how they're solving problems I mean
there's so many different redox and flux
implementations it's it's a cool yeah so
when one of the interesting things and
you know I I originally came from the
meteor community in New York and when we
started this this meetup I I really
tried to bring over the lot of a lot of
stuff that I i felt when i participated
in meetups in the meteor community
because meteor is such an awesome
framework and community because you know
you have the meteor forum and it's like
there's always someone there to kind of
guide you with whatever question you
have and if you go to an in-person event
like I did even if you don't know
anything there's it's not kind of this
elitist kind of culture of what you
don't know what you know this is or
redux or reflux or whatever it's like oh
ok let me show you what meteor is it's
you know let me help you build your
first hello world app and so that's kind
of what I want to bring to this this
meetup that we have in New York City
yeah that's that's awesome I would agree
like having run the Cincinnati meteor
meet up like that's definitely a good
feeling to try to foster and one that we
always strove to kind of get people into
the mindset of like come and share a
little bit and then have discussion time
and really just just hope each other
learn and level up and yeah that's
definitely good and I was just looking
like we don't have a Cincinnati react
native me though no weird it looks like
several meters there's there's only a
few of us so far there's one in San
Francisco and and there's a couple
internationally there's one in Tel Aviv
I'm pretty sure and so it's it's
starting to grow and we we kind of the
different organizers we talk to each
other and kind of exchange idea is in
and in kind of where our problems are
and try to solve them together maybe um
one thing I am kind of interested in is
like you know what what have you found
most interesting and most cool about
react native like what part of it was or
shocking right like something new you
kind of learned as you're building yeah
yeah so like I said my the first job
that I got when I went into web
development was with meteor and react
and so at the time I was I didn't have a
full-time position I just doing contract
and this startup said hey you know react
we're gonna do something react native um
you know do you think you could handle
it and and I was within two days I was
building out features you know and that
an amazing thing because by now most of
us in the meteor community we're using
react or we've tried react if we don't
like it but like a lot of people it has
widespread adoption and so the fact that
you can be efficient in mobile in such a
short amount of time is really powerful
yeah I I guess speaking to that one
thing that's that's maybe given me pause
every time I try to think about building
something like as a non designer how are
you finding the the whole like it's
basically got its own CSS subset system
that i use it for design and it's based
off flexbox like how have you found that
to be because like generally i use
something like ionic or meteoric or even
like bootstrap does a decent job if if
you push it hard enough of giving you a
mobile interface looking kind of design
like what what's that experience been
like so you're right I'm not a designer
I'm a developer and so I that was a
short coming that I ran into early when
I wanted to build an app that I felt was
professional looking and honestly that's
why I appeared with a product manager
because he had such a great knowledge of
flexbox and design and a new kind of the
things to look out for like you know one
thing that can get you in trouble is if
you design for one of the larger iphone
models and and then you see how it looks
and one of the the lower models and the
fonts too big and it's you know it's
overflowing and everything so like you
have to design from one of the smaller
models first so that when you you know
you try the other models and it works so
like things like that Nick was was
really good and he just has that I you
know it's like it's almost like you're
born with it like the right taste to
know what's a good design I will say
that there are some companies coming
forward and trying to build out more
opinionated you I kids to use with react
native so we have a company called shout
them and they're actually going to be
presenting at our next meetup in your
city and they offer kind of a you know
like choose from this UI kit of buttons
and you know all kinds of elements that
you can instead of having to create a
touch full opacity with a text element
inside of it and then design it
according to flexbox they've kind of
done all that for you but I think a lot
of people are coming forward to offer
some easier solutions for that so I know
that there's there's a react native
package manager which are RN p.m. but I
don't exactly know how that's different
from NPM yeah sure so r RM p.m. was so
what happens is that if you npm install
some of your dependencies it will
install them in the JavaScript bundle
but it will have asked sets or files
that need to be compiled in Xcode and so
you'd get these repos for like react
native video or react native image
picker and you'd npm install and they
wouldn't work because the repo and the
readme instructions they'd had you know
you have to go into Xcode and then you
have to you know compile this binary and
you know if the link it to your main
project and so our npm came along and
they just solve that problem and and and
so that's that's the main reason why it
exists so that you don't have to
manually configure xcode for all these
libraries okay that makes sense yeah cuz
yeah i mean i know there are still
components for react native just on NPM
that you could pull in and kind of you
know like like normal react and Lego
blocks and just configure them so what's
cool yeah you know that brings up a good
point to like xcode um how like how was
that transition for you like you went
from dealing with chrome the web
browsers your kind of the buggy to land
now like you're compiling for the phone
and you're dealing with Xcode and in
like there have been instances at least
with Cordova where I actually have to
dive into like Xcode and use it to debug
what's going on in the app like has it
was that like easy for you or fresh
what was that likely incredibly
frustrating um I mean like I said you
know like that now now when I do it and
in fact one of the request we had for
the tutorial is deployment and so the
past weekend i took the kind of it's a
meetup meetup clone that we build in the
react native tutorial and so i took it
and went through the process of going
through test flight and then submitting
the app for App Store and running on the
device and and now it's easy because
like I can go back to my notes and
everything but when I was doing the
first time it was a nightmare um you
know there's so many kind of like hard
to find little things and Xcode doesn't
always it's not it doesn't tell you do
this and then that it's just like it
just shouts at you this is not working
wait until you get something in the app
store and then your certificate expires
that was a terrible process do yeah so
so it's funny the first blog post I
wrote about react native was like 10
things that we learned and one of them
what what I actually did this is
embarrassing but it was a side project
and you know and react native there's
two ways of running the app there you
can run it locally with a note at you
know a note process running locally we
can create a bundle and and the bundle
is what you actually you know install on
an iOS device and I didn't know that so
I I just you know archive for my project
submitted to the app store I didn't do
test flag as I didn't know about test
flight and I waited a week and I get
back your app is a blank screen and I'm
like I'm using simulator and no I swear
it's not a blank screen so I submitted
it again waited another week got the
same error and and finally you know it
took me like reaching out a bunch of
react people who like okay this is what
you have to do and no one was like oh
you're so stupid like I can't believe
you did that like they were really nice
Lincoln the App Store is a terrible
process like I think in all honesty you
could probably write an entire book on
each app store deploy
process and still miss out you know
there's things like so I registered with
apple as an individual account and then
it shows my app and it's like Thomas
Goldenberg like that that doesn't sound
professional I want to make your
business account that is a I never did
it like I looked into how to do it and I
I like like looked on forums how you
would transfer from an individual to a
business account and it was like no
that's like that's way too much time um
so yeah I actually had to get on the
phone with an apple rep when this
certificate expired and they had to walk
me through like how to how to fix it and
it's like I feel bad like I I'm a
reasonably intelligent guy I should be
able to figure this out i googled around
for a couple hours and just finally gave
up a called apple like well guys i will
i will say that a couple months ago the
app that we had on our asteroid it's
actually called bhagavad-gita app
because um so I used to live in India
for nine years and used to teach the
bhagavad-gita in Sanskrit at university
so I've made my own translation and
that's the the app that we originally
made um and I wanted to pour it over to
Android and I prepped like a whole week
of like that deployment process and I
think it was like two hours and it was
up on the google play store I was like
yeah yeah mind blown yeah so that is
nice all right uh maybe the last
question then we'll get into our picks
our show pics what have you found the
kind of the the add-on library selection
to be so I know like with Cordova I can
easily say like you know npm install and
bring in like cordova packages that
allow me to access bluetooth or the
camera or anything like that like how is
that bit then as far as like how's it
work
I can what's it been like yeah I will
say that what I found was some of these
third-party libraries is around the time
that react native made some breaking
changes a lot of these libraries weren't
actively maintained and then you know I
had find that if I wanted to use the
latest rec- version I'd have to actually
go in their code and fork it and and and
get around those difficulties now it's
you know since that time since like I
wanted to say like two three months ago
it's been a lot easier and a lot of
these projects are really being actively
maintained so that that's my own
personal experience was when we were
building the tutorial things like I'm
trying to think um like Google Analytics
was really bad for a while another one
was trying to think off the top of my
head there were one or two prop one or
two repos that I had to fork and kind of
fix the bugs and then when I was redoing
the the tutorial about a month ago I
found that all those issues have been
solved so there probably was like a
rough period during some breaking
changes but now you know camera contacts
you know all this kind of stuff there's
very good support what about routing
because i know i've heard in the past
that routing is just like there's a lot
of routers to choose from where people
pop in the the slack chat on the crater
sock chat and are spaced I just like
chat and ask about this is that is that
solved is there a blessed you know a
blessed chosen router or how does that
work now not yet so I've used all three
I mean actually I'm aware of three major
ones and then there's other ones as well
but you know when react native first
came out the easiest to use was the
Navigator iOS and that's what we
actually used for the bhagavad-gita app
for our first iOS app it's just really
easy to use for simple simple apps it
has its own UI and everything and then
we heard that Facebook wasn't using that
they're switching to navigator and so
the tutorial is based off of navigator
a navigator is not opinionated as to you
I so you can have any kind of scene
transition and everything now the new
one is navigation experimental and I've
used that for the as I sink in the
Android app that I'd put out a couple
months ago and it's really nice I
actually like it it fits in with the the
model if you're especially if you're
using Redux to encapsulate your state
and this has been a problem I want to
say on the web as well of you know
finding a routing solution that works
within that framework of a single state
object and so I've I've used the
navigation experimental I really like it
but for the tutorial we use navigator
because that is is still like the most
stable one I feel at this point and
navigation experimental is like as the
name implies right so there are options
and I think for new people coming in
that can kind of confuse things a little
bit um if you're using redux I would
recommend navigation experimental if
you're if you're not using Redux and you
you know you you just want to you just
have experience with react i would say
navigator is the best way to go yeah
I've also heard about there's one that
has flux in the name have you played
with that at all that seems to be
popular yeah I I've seen a couple I now
there's like the new react router is
about to and now people are trying to
incorporate that and react native as
well I haven't had time to really sit
down with the other alternatives and and
compare them yeah awesome cool all right
ah so I forgot for the last episode but
this episode I want to make sure we do
it at the end of the show which sask
everybody on the show like what was
there what's their pick for the show and
it doesn't have to be related to tech it
can can really be anything just
something that's improved your life in
some way and we'd love to share this
stuff because it can can help other
people sometimes so let's let's go
around real quick and do that same we
want to go first
I can go first all right so Google a low
came out today which is pretty exciting
if if you haven't heard of that it's
kind of like Google's new messenger we
got yet another one but hopefully this
kills all the other ones because it's
it's kind of like all the messenger apps
are all converging they all look like
each other so this is kind of similar to
I message but then similar to slack in
the sense of you have like the Google
assistant bot there like in your chat so
you can you know you talking to somebody
and you can say hey like wanna do lunch
and then Google is like hey do you want
restaurant suggestions and you're like
sure and the bunch of cards pop-up
restaurants near you and that type of
stuff you can like Google search from
the from the chat app like with a group
or pretty interesting um I check that
out it's cool and it works on iOS and
Android yeah I you know I think maybe
that's a big problem is iOS was her
Apple was short-sighted and not putting
out an iMessage for like the android
platform I thought they might this last
three wdc and then you know but that's
the tough part right like as an all
Apple family having outside family
members that want to talk to my kids and
all they have is I message and I'm like
Anna I'm not gonna not gonna do anything
for you sir have you can text them I
guess yeah texting works get a phone and
then uh the other pic is I got a Yeti
kept my fiance got me a Yeti covers the
labels down there damn and it's like all
I drink out of its I put ice in it in
water and it stays cold for days and
it's fantastic so nice there you go
awesome should I go yeah go ahead if you
got one um so that the biggest thing in
my life in the past couple months I got
to go on a honeymoon with my wife Jess
and we went for three weeks to India and
was pretty awesome we went from the very
south and Kerala took the train to the
north and then went up in the Himalayas
like 12,000 feet I think yeah so is cool
all of them yeah
definitely so this is gonna sound weird
but I'm gonna say the IRS that's so
weird yeah so like I want to commend
them I got my 501 3c approval in exactly
a week so I just I my wife and I have
been working on starting a nonprofit to
teach kids how to code with a particular
focus on Lake involving gaming to to
draw their interest in and like we
applied on September I want to say
September's 7th baby and we got this
thing exactly one week later like the
approval and everyone's like oh it's
terrible it takes at least six months if
we do the regular form we were able to
do the short form and like they just
turned it around like everyone was
telling us this would be at least six
and they got it done in like a week so I
so kudos to them for being on the ball
with that good and what one thing I also
want to say is you know of course the
that the tutorial that I made is now
available and I wanted to just mail it
be known that we're offering a discount
for the critter listeners so if they
just put in the word crater as a promo
code you get you get a discount it's ad
build react native calm yeah I guess we
didn't mention it but it is it a book
that they're getting when they buy it
it's it's a case so it's it it's taking
me Bo so you read it on the website very
similar to the discover me dear how they
did the you know the plat the way of
learning meteor yeah yep awesome awesome
whoa alright well thank you guys and
it's been a real pleasure discussing
react native again and the community
certainly seems to left forward and I'm
kind of excited I'm hoping in the next
month i can put together a video
tutorial series on building a react
native app so I'm gonna give that out
right yes very cool well they nice
nicely thanks for having me and then
nice to meet you um just meet you all
right guys
all right talk to you later this video
