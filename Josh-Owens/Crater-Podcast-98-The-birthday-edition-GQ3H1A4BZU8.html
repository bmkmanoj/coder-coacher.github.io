it's my birthday I should've known that
I happy birthday episode this episode is
for friday april eighth 2016 welcome
crater fans i'm your host josh owens
along with a special guest today rui
Walker welcome ride 90th episode I
realized I almost time 100 episode
perfectly but didn't well we'll talk off
camera about that I think well no I'll
just say here if you're available in two
weeks I think we're talking about doing
a special edition so it was like you me
Ben maybe aa bhi party party show let's
do it yeah yeah I'm going to be fun for
the hundredth yes so how you been rise
to man building a startup it's a journey
a journey I know it's been fun really
I'm having a lot of fun it's different
right it's like I'd say it's either ten
or a hundred times harder than building
a services comfort okay I don't what the
right ratio is but um but you know like
we do hard things because it's a
challenge and helps you grow so yeah I'm
really really enjoying it you know we're
up to nine people now so Wow yeah it's
awesome yep alright so let's get into
the show sweet get my links here so this
week we're going to talk about now not
later now we're going to talk about
mastering meteor and redux react version
15 is out and the future is without apps
it's not title Dominus I saw the future
and there are no abs alright so yeah the
first one like this one kind of came out
of nowhere have you looked at now yet no
tell me about now
so it's an odd name but essentially it's
it's almost like doing a meteor deploy
or something or modulus deploy you just
kind of type it looks like you just
install it and you just type now and
basically it will deploy a version of
your project as long as it's a node
project that has a package.json file you
should be should be good to go there
like it deploys it to a URL and they
said think of it as like CDN for your
back-end or CDM for dynamic code what
was it so like air microservices your
backends that kind of thing I thought
that was really interesting yeah I
really like their web web web design we
checked out the website uh yeah I love
the little animated gif when you first
hit the page work you like the animated
gif it's like typing things and stuff
yeah now just a simple simple little you
I all black you know clearly developers
developed this I have but it's but it
has it has like good spacing too so yeah
the font a little bigger I'm getting old
right like a min 36 today and I need
glasses I think man command + + + that
we yeah totally you're in trouble when
you open your code editor and you have
to start hitting command + you know much
about who these guys are uh well it's
funny you should ask i was reading the
faq and i had not heard of yet i guess
it's i probably butchered that but um
okay right right yeah i don't know but
they made so they've been involved in
socket i/o and there was involved in
mongoose and they've been using node for
a very very long time yeah so the the
thing that i find maybe the most
interesting here is from what i can tell
there's no way to specify a URL
you do a deploy and it gives you a new
URL every time you do it boy that's
interesting yeah so like I don't like a
CDN for your dynamic code that would be
tough to like you know if you're
deploying a react native app right and
you're trying to hit the back end
somehow and URL changes like it's going
to be bad news yeah well you know I
think this is I think it's really cool
like the future you know the future of
apps is I think thinner back ends
obviously we're seeing that with react
and everything else but I love this you
know it's like back to the roots of like
this reminds me of like early modulus
and obviously early meteor i love i love
it when when projects are in their
simple phase you know before they before
things before there's three options for
every you know decision so this is a
pretty cool it's basically just knowed
though it's a way to deploy note in a
very agile streamlined way yeah yeah so
my guess is you know if you're if you're
using feathers or express or something
like that this is gonna work out a box
for you if you're using something like
meteor um or you know i don't know about
sales i should take a look at sales but
um you know I don't think this is gonna
work out of the box from what I can tell
um meteors getting there slowly but
until like meteor itself can be a
dependency in the NPM world like
probably not going to be the case so oh
we're probably six months away from that
yeah cool yeah now not the most us its
SEO friendly name for products we know
what they should do next is make a
queuing service that you can do and
they'll call that one later yeah that's
not bad yeah yeah there's a brand er um
cool fight go to the next one talk about
hobbies article yes yeah hobby yes so so
redux mastering meteor and redux a
syllabus so he's giving us a
a step-by-step plan to master redux
right yeah how to integrate Redux into
your meteor flow I guess yeah are you
using Redux in your projects at this
point no I don't have it so the the
meteor 13 and react project I just
wrapped up was probably just a little
too small for Redux like it definitely
felt some of the pain and thought it
might be worth trying but and I didn't
bother to go all the way down the rabbit
hole yeah so the interesting thing for
us at astronomer right now is we we are
literally doing no front end development
at all which is a really weird place for
me personally to be in in my world and
my career is you know I've been doing
front end stuff non-stop since 1995 and
all of a sudden we're just working a lot
of back end stuff so yeah we haven't
really messed around with even meteor 13
unfortunately now i know the greg has
spent a lot of time thinking about this
and staying up on all this stuff but
yeah we're just like we're in back end I
wouldn't call back end hell but because
it's actually really fun good stuff but
it's that we have enough strong with
Redux at all yet either maybe you want
the listeners I'm sure know exactly what
Redux is right make you want to give a
quick overview it's it's like a new
pattern that allows you to kind of
control the the logic flow into your
application yeah it's it's interesting
and I like that he's included so he's
already got the five porter that he did
before and he updated it to kind of be
more relevant in meteor 13 land and then
he included his crate a remote conf talk
which he talked about once and then it
looks like he's got the command pattern
done but then he's got a bunch more he's
got like eight post in total that he
wants to do going forward that kind of
really deep deep dives into everything
and I'm excited like I want to see the
easy to show you how to build them
minesweeper game with
active Redux so I think that that'll be
a fun post so yeah and so he
simultaneously with the syllabus with
the eight steps he also published the
first of the eight I don't called
lessons yeah command pattern and that's
a nice juicy post as well so um try see
the friends I have that have recommended
it looks like Spencer from differentials
all over this think he's using this
stuff too so yep redux you know I've
listened you know I listened pretty
avidly to the traitor podcast and I've
heard you guys talking about it over the
past few months but no personal
experience on it just yet yeah yeah I'm
kind of hoping to get Dan on Dan Abram
off on the space dojo show to maybe talk
about redox and react a little bit yeah
like that could be fun sweet yeah
looking forward to continuing to hear
about this stuff speaking of react
version 15 came out so you mentioned you
guys aren't doing a lot of friend I'm
work are you guys still use a blaze no
no no he's we've started like actually
what we've built on the front end is
like log in you know login logout forgot
password all of a three-act he may be
using redux I don't know for sure but I
don't think there's a lot of data stuff
happening yet so we might not have
gotten to that phase yeah we're
definitely going react yeah nice yeah
yeah so like this one's been coming for
a while I think we talked about it a
little bit on another show but it's
actually here today and so you know this
means certain things like ie8 support is
gone you know bye-bye as it should have
right I mean come on who the hell is
using ie8 yeah oh gosh remember the days
of like axing ie6 was a fun thing yeah
yep I'm thinking back to IE 552 like oh
that's really terrible we're so old
right I know I remember before that I
remember this thing called netscape
navigator
good um no more ie8 support what else is
big enough well so you know the thing
that I thought was interesting I hang
out in West bosses chat room and he said
that he was able to upgrade to version
15 no problem you know because his
course material just works in version 15
so I think the key thing here is i love
that they use the whole like deprecation
kind of pattern that they do so anything
that became deprecated gave you warning
starting with version 14 and then what
15 came out it's gone and so is your
version 14 app doesn't give you any
errors or warnings or anything you
should be good to go yeah it's nice it's
been nine months it sounds like since
since you would have been getting his
warning so yeah I think that's that
seems very very user-friendly yeah yeah
I like it so I'm other than that you
know they've I think that the biggest
change is that they've gotten rid of the
data react IDs that they were putting on
every every little Dom element and so
now they're just using document create
element which should also be it's gonna
make the Dom a little slimmer but also
they've got to the point where a create
element is actually faster to run then
they were doing it before so um should
be a little speed improvement well not
that react needs it but goodness what it
looks like beyond that it's a lot of a
lot of just seems like refactoring and
just under the chi or as improvements
like I like you know do we remove these
deprecation zwi now have new deprecation
Xand warnings and that's uh it sounds
like this is like a housekeeping sort of
release versus a big revolutionary thing
do you agree with that um yes yeah
probably i mean the fact that you know
we're getting the the spans and the the
react ids are going away that's what
those are probably the biggest two
things yeah and then SVG supports
getting better so yeah yeah probably
like there's nothing major
new yeah they're really kind of like 14
was probably a big change but it's hard
for me to say so I wasn't using their
team yes yeah we're meteors people are
newbies to the community right yeah I
loved I so I follow um dan Abramov on
Twitter and I watched him like iterating
over this blog post for the changelog
and like he was trying to figure out the
best way to do the changelog portion
because he's linking to the issue or the
pull request number plus the person's
name and I actually really like this
format that they've got going on so you
can kind of see like who worked on it
and like you can click and get the full
history of the issue and stuff so I see
kudos on a clean nice changelog too yeah
that's it's surprising how much effort
can go and something as simple as that
but yeah it makes it a lot more
consumable appreciate us comin
definitely yeah yep something to aspire
to Josh for us all yeah I don't do open
source anymore really nothing nothing at
all hey I still I think I own a couple
packages I just updated shared it the
other day well why why do you think that
is just because you're it's a lot of
effort man you know I'm putting out to
podcasts focusing a lot on the YouTube
channel and doing blog posts and like
that's just eaten up a lot of time is
there is there do you feel like there's
less to do now in the at least the
meteor ecosystem yeah yeah I would say
like the community and large really
stepped up you know like okay you and I
worked on accounts entry and that then
user accounts came out and like that guy
was doing a great job over there and in
Italy luca and he put out like you know
ten different you eyes to front the your
accounts package sir it was pretty
awesome and then now you know with
you've got like Tim but now user
accounts react user accounts
package so yeah I just uh I don't know I
and I don't want to own open source
projects right now I wonder too like
with the you know the blaze react split
makes it a lot harder to contribute you
get any of that to do like you know like
you know we did the blog you know
package which is the simpler time right
now if we if you're going to try to do
something similar now there's a lot more
concerns a lot a lot more you can talk
about yeah totally I mean you have to
look at like you know obviously like
iron-router was the thing back then but
if you're gonna do something like a blog
package you have to think about like
flow router oh yeah crowder you know and
like honestly I probably wouldn't build
anything on blaze anymore wouldn't
bother to do a package on blaze I've
actually seen firsthand the difference
between blaze and react on the same code
base yeah I've got like a super secret
URL for crater that's running react okay
and it's like fast what's that support
that URL I'll send it to you later yeah
it's cool so how that had that come out
his telescope have a rack react version
now yeah there's a there's a nova branch
that sasha has been working on and he's
done some good work with it and so i'm
trying to figure out how to pay for it
but my my designer gave me a quote to
make it look pretty oh and so we're
gonna try to like um that's that's a
goal for people are may from the innova
version of telescope deployed because it
comes with SSR and all kinds of giddy so
okay big win cool alright sounds good i
remember the the trip when crater was
born back to the reminiscing crap
totally like in that hotel room like you
were setting up email i'm setting up a
server a modulus like why are we
hustling to get that done so quickly you
remember we were we wanted to tell her
one at the vanguard about it oh yeah
we're the first Vanguard meeting so we
were like on our way to Vanguard we were
trying to build something so that we had
something fun to talk to them about
pretty much and then I wrote that
terrible blog post to about meteor
killing rails oh that was the best best
blog post that I air do you remember
yeah we do this although but I just
remember like Matt like like he saw that
like during Vanguard I think yeah I'll
show her that page of hacker names yeah
he can't looked over at us like me not
sure if I support this so much that's
kind of harsh words anyway all right
let's keep gone um my next article we'll
be about Apollo killing meteor Wow yeah
Apollo killing me dear hey it gets
possible uh well from a muhfucka like a
marketing and funding standpoint
probably but yeah all right I know we
have too much stuff to talk about let's
stay out focused on the news so story
number four here is the future is
without apps which again sounds really
scary for anyone who builds apps for a
living but I don't think we mean that
right we're talking about this is a blog
post by Donnie Reynolds easy name to
pronounce but yeah I like how I gave you
the easy name crap thanks dude a medium
post it's interesting and talking about
and you know I kind of scanned most this
but I get just of it that it is a pain
in the ass to get people to install your
app and to keep it installed right and
they even find your app is a big pain in
the butt so so theory here would be that
what if apps could stream to you on
demand as you need their functionality
which Google's played with and apples
kind of playing with to some degree yeah
I think I remember hear something about
like facebook Messenger having like apps
kind of like little mini apps or Hut
what they call it but built into that
you know so so it's an interesting idea
obviously they'd have to be really
really small to stream on demand because
gate is not free still right and
apps can be bulky but what's your
thought on on the feasibility of us
getting to this world well so I mean the
thing is HTML is not where it needs to
be to make this a reality right like we
can't go out and make an HTML app that
can tap into all the native
functionality on the phone you know
maybe that's our problem here maybe
maybe that's the right fix is like push
Safari further at the same time like I
didn't I should have submitted this
article to crater um they're like I I
saw a scary thing on show hacker news
and it was like all the things that they
can glean from your browser with
javascript turned on yeah there's some
scary stuff in there you know like they
can kick off some code that start
scanning your local network if you don't
realize it yeah and like they can check
to see if you're logged into all these
different services um you know it's it's
it's crazy and so it's maybe a little
scary to think that we might add more
capabilities to a web browser on a
mobile phone but that that's really what
we're lacking here you know like we
can't can't quite access like hardware
rendering very well like there's there's
certainly like WebGL type technology you
could play with but at the end of the
day like native apps gonna feel faster
than more than an actual HTML app so eat
like even if you're looking at a hybrid
like Cordova where they're cashing some
of the stuff locally then you know
you're still talking to a web app
somewhere and you're still really
loading web page like that still
presents challenges but on the flip side
we still have the challenge of like you
know how do we like it's not easy to
share content from a mobile app right
yep so like that's also a problem and
then you have the problem of like
dueling you know do i do I write a Java
app do I write a
swift Abdul I ran an objective-c app or
like do I go hybrid with Cordova do I
try to do react native like this is it's
all all these years later it still feels
like a big mess yeah it seems like there
needs to be something in between the two
current states like html5 you know
versus natively installed like you know
there's a graphic in this article saying
if someone shares a link with you two in
this case it's like a recipe or
something like that and yeah SMS you
know you probably experienced it where
it pops over to the App Store and once
you would install an app in order to get
to that content which is obviously a big
big barrier to the user experience but
and there's really no reason why the
final page needs to be heavier than what
it needs to be to render that page right
theoretically but but it's it's a tricky
I think that's pretty tricky problem and
and as app developers like it just feels
like instead of it being mobile you know
our native versus mobile or HTML
somewhere in between is is a weird thing
but I don't know our people starting to
build these little like micro native or
micro HTML apps for this kind of stuff
I'm not sure I don't know you know I
think to me this all boils down to trust
right like we trust that the App Store
is keeping us safe to some degree which
has turned out to be bogus in some
things this right like people code that
or not even realizing they're deploying
some library that's been hacked which is
certainly happen ganking passwords out
of apps um but you know that there's no
way to like if if they start to
relinquish control and allow the browser
HTML just start doing more stuff then
they they start to allow you to
circumvent that trust that they've built
and that's part of why the App Store
exists right won't happen to the cash
market as well
but yeah I don't know probably the thing
that I found most interesting was that
there's like a little paragraph in here
about Google and the fact that you know
places like India and China are just
coming online like there's a lot of
people just coming online for the first
time and it's as a mobile experience
which is you know different than how
people in the US are maybe used to
interacting with apps and stuff and so
like you can't Google is gonna run into
trouble because you can't just Google
everything anymore right like I can't
just go Google about that recipe
necessarily if it's sitting behind a
some kind of like wall to garden mobile
app yeah so you know they're they're
trying to figure this out and I think
it's like this is going to be a bigger
problem for them going forward because
places like Africa or South America
where maybe the technology isn't as
pervasive or you know it's more
expensive to get a mac or whatever like
hitting a mobile phone for a hundred
bucks or fifty bucks like that's going
to be how how people start interacting
with the world yeah there's another
alignment here near the end of the
article that says I'll read it on top of
it all what we really need is a platform
agnostic solution to apps dreaming it
truly overcomes content delivery
discoverability problems we want
something akin to Java applets on
browsers on mobile yes hikes there's
there's a eggs in there for a great
reason java applets weren't good but I
kind of see what they're saying they're
like it was a it was a novel idea I
don't know I just it's just a really se
it's making a really messy world for app
developers if there's something in
between a native app and a HTML app only
there was such a thing mmhmm yeah yeah
you know what's really interesting to me
is that I think Google faces this
problem more than anyone right like
we've mentioned that people are coming
online and their core businesses around
search like why are they creating
something like angular native you know
Oh google angular native yeah why can't
I build an angular app and have that be
a native app that gets compiled down and
run on a phone like they own half the
phone ecosystem here don't they yeah
yeah so you feel like why why is react
native beating them to this yeah so what
was it I'm trying to go back up to the
section on what Google built what was
theirs they've got AB streaming and apt
linking so you can basically instrument
your app a little bit and it'll know how
to go in and consume some content yeah
but again that only works for the apps
that are actually interesting your yeah
like following your code guidelines and
that's that's a purely native app to
that it's streaming out right it's not
it's not any sort of hybridity saying no
no yeah I think we have a lot I mean the
sort of pro here though for the you know
anyone who's getting bored with the
current state of app development is that
change might be coming and that's always
good because then everything gets to get
rewritten again yeah well honestly like
I'll give you my two cents here like
react native is gonna be it like I think
we'll see Cordova fall off at some point
I think we'll see other solutions die
off but you know in reality facebook is
killing it with react native and i think
that even if that you know even if they
move away from react i think this
technology here will stick around for a
long time and be like the release of
react native for a mac you know like
that that's a big thing like if i'm able
to share eighty percent of my code
between three code bases that's pretty
awesome yeah well it's just another
reason why javascript is so important in
the future of everything right so so
glad so glad we just we decided to start
doing JavaScript a few years ago
full-time Josh yes smart move all right
Jesus I know is like it was only us I
think we were the only people to ever
come up with that idea yeah so when
what's what's the next what's your next
class or thing that I can
pay you for great you have another
conference coming up some time is it
scheduled oh my gosh I do you totally
calling me out here I haven't gotten the
webpage up for yet but I've got like six
maybe six speakers lined up and I need
six more yeah so um I I have to find
time to sit down and get the all the
material together but it's it's gonna be
it was gonna be crater mobile com well
it turns out a lot of the talks are
about react native so maybe it's like
react native or remote home it's not a
bad choice yeah it'll be remote a remote
thing now yeah it'll be like like the UM
the last one I did in February yeah that
was pretty awesome and I like that
format too because it's easy to get the
videos up on YouTube yeah are you plan
on doing an in person thing again yeah
yeah we're doing a space camp 2 point 0
it'll be in the outer banks this year
wow we found a bigger place so I think
we need like 50 55 people um man that
was so much fun though just hanging out
with people that loved meteor and react
and all that kind of stuff and we you
know we did some business if we had some
talks but then a lot of beer and a lot
of gaming and yeah that's good at formed
pipe home to a much greater bond in that
community among those people so I which
I heard anything cool cool man I look
forward to hearing about all those
things and hope to rejoin the podcast
again sometime in the future yeah and to
yes that'd be awesome yeah i'm in i'm in
it'll be it'll be easy cuz like will
each have just like one story to do
right yeah yeah definitely all right all
right right thank you for coming on it
was awesome to have you back great to be
back yep I was just really feeling
nostalgic when I heard you the other day
and I had drank a few beers and I was
like oh I you know email happen and Here
I am so
