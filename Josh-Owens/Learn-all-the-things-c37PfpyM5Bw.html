myself with the help of this guy gonna
be quiet this morning everybody still
asleep um I'm not even up that early
everyone's just still in bed gonna take
river for a run and I know I'm gonna try
to push her a little further so I think
the biggest problem is she doesn't pace
herself and then gonna see my dad for
lunch and then we're gonna go see
Wendy's dad make me go golfing with him
she's 45 pounds of raw muscle like she's
pulling me along right now and we'll get
started running it was almost like a
sled dog effect right like she really
pulls hard like to the point where I'm
wondering if this leash is gonna hold at
some point like when I'm running my feet
and a lot of times are in the air right
and so if she's pulling well I'm in the
air or even just one foot on the ground
like she's pushing me faster than i
usually run and so the thing that I'm
gonna we'll see how it works like I'll
loop her leash around the front of her
chest and that seems to get her to stop
pulling
we did it we got two and a half miles in
it's a little hot we did we stopped
about two miles in and got her a drink
at the water fountain but she's still
way hot like as soon as we stopped shook
left in the grass the shade so was a
good run I'm proud of her we did two and
a half miles she pushed there were a
couple times when I was ahead of her but
the the front leash loop around her
shoulders seem to work wonders
going to brunch with my dad because I
just want to chill out tomorrow for
Father's Day so we're taking him out I'm
taking windies dad say hi to the golf
course I'm gonna do a little golfing
think we got him for free kind of
excited about that so we just had brunch
with my dad always a fun time he's a
Republican we're pretty liberal thought
he was giving us a hard time now we're
here at golf galaxy cuz windy doesn't
have a collared shirt but we only have
like 15 minutes and then we got to be
heading home to get to the golf course
on time so gotta have sole
it is nice out isn't it it's nice out of
it say hi Jerry I knew so texting and
driving with a woman all right so we did
the call it was good it was good it was
hard we sucked a checar so but it was
fun like we got we actually got to play
for free we're trying out the Wyoming
golf course first time they let us bring
windies pants with us so that was pretty
awesome yeah they didn't like it it's
just it's really long I don't we're all
exhausted now but of course Wendy wants
to push through and go to church so
we're heading there now and then when we
try have some dinner gresham grocery
shopping afterward
nobody wins
so you ordered a pop-tart and you didn't
like it didn't like it not at all it was
terrible where to go where to go in my
face in your face today's Father's Day
and I'm on my way to pick up brayden um
my old for today like yesterday we went
non-stop uh it was fun a little bummed I
didn't get my video out so try to get
the Friday video out today um yeah my
hope for today is just like I told the
girls like I just want a nice breakfast
I think that's that's the thing that
matters to me and I just want to relax
today that's why we went all out
yesterday i'm doing some church nice
nice dinner and little grocery shopping
and then met some friends for dessert so
it was fun little tired again when it
comes to my dad he's been around since I
was probably two or three my mom got
divorced and ended up getting remarried
when I was four and three and a half for
some around there my step dad raised me
pretty much my whole life we moved to
when I was five five-and-a-half we moved
back here to Cincinnati and he raised me
he's the one that taught me quite a few
things in my life I cat I shoot a
basketball or you know helped out with
golfing taught me try to teach me how to
drive I think that was a frustrating
process maybe just all kinds of things
and I'm grateful for that he definitely
helped me a lot growing up I alluded to
the fact that Wendy's dad
I'll teach me how to do quite a bit of
things too like my dad was never handy
growing up so um I mean he could do
things but but not like not like Wendy's
dad so when it came to like we bought a
house five years ago that was in
terrible shape we had a heck of a deal
on it and Wendy's dead helped us run of
ate the entire thing and so I I was not
handy I don't even think I owned many
tools so we ended up gutting the kitchen
like down to the studs was one of our
projects and like he hoped so
tremendously with that we got a night
IKEA kitchen and installed it I now know
how to change a light I know how to hook
up a sink you know I've installed
cabinets like all thats because Jerry
took the time to teach me that kind of
thing and I'm super grateful for that as
well like I've been very lucky in that
regard just having people who have been
good father figures even though like my
DNA dad wasn't really around much so I'm
grateful for that Father's Day breakfast
it's tasty
so we have this is like semi Hawaiian
pizza pineapple and salamia barbecue
this one's just salami yes I'm
gluten-free pizza crust free pizzas what
do we do push your project four wheels
and tomorrow I have just came of Thrones
time any predictions one guy gets it Oh
Ramsay Bolton you think he'll die I
think you'll live
hoey yanked me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
