that so we we got telescope installed
and made sure Xcode was installed and
then now we've done a meteor add
platform what's the next step
meteor run iOS
this should fire up a simulator so the
nice thing about the Cordova stuff is
that you can actually specify you want
Cordova packages so if you need to
access like file upload and you install
the Cordova you can install the court
Cordova package to handle like file
picking and uploading and that kind of
stuff and it'll do the right thing if
it's compiled for iOS or compiled for
Android or if it's for the web it'll use
the right API calls and so you can just
say like there's this syntax on that
it's similar to the NPM integration yeah
Cordova dot depends and then you give it
the the package that you want to use so
if you want to access like the camera so
like a webcam or your phone camera or
that kind of thing you just install this
package and then make the right kind of
calls in your HTML
Wow look at that so there's our
simulator
Wow is it really that easy we're done
alright thanks for coming guys
something's not right here
it seemed that scrolling first time
using simulator
the simulator simulator has simulators
what did it lose its sign-in and yeah
like randomly click the wrong thing as I
was
she's interesting all right yeah I mean
it looks like it worked right right
there 192 168 3 177 so I told it port
4000 but then it's also got a version
running on 49 565 sign in and let's do
this
all this responsive use not
that's weird
and another post here oh that makes me
really sad yeah no that should be I'm an
admin so the first user signup is an
admin so these are automatically
approved right oh yeah it shouldn't be a
problem
own if that's a problem with the not the
plug-in but actually the HTML did you
add one to see I don't see yours either
yeah well it could be a problem with the
way the apps running for Cordova right
and if we're getting any errors here
well this is interesting
started back up to iCloud please be
careful might be rejected if you store
too much data what if they actually
store like the last-known state on your
app automatically from Cordova well then
you so the question was how do you like
test an actual compiled version so let's
let's get a compiled version but I
believe this steps Android can probably
answer this better than me but the steps
as I know them are you need to eat a
developer account and then register your
device as a test device on your account
and then once that's done you'll be able
to send apps to your provision phone is
that did I cover that nice yeah so what
about Android is there any special crazy
shit you're gonna do that let me just oh
I don't have an Android just works funny
guy so where's the Ouija guide
well I thought we'd try actually
compiling it since where could we add a
Cordova package so what do we just say
meteor build here to get it to actually
compile yeah
in your build
you Namie he hosts 4,000 we need to put
it
hmm that's interesting so I wonder if I
just have meteor build and put crater as
the URL if it would pick that up and
start functioning or if there's
something that goes into the server-side
build as well that makes Cordova work
right so many questions well it's pretty
much the same codebase though right well
says you're supposed to give it the end
server URL so you're gonna be building
against a server other than localhost
generally all right so now my CPU is my
fan spinning up my CPU is getting hot
yeah a lemur
you ready doing that are you ready to do
now yeah I give a talk now so build in
the build so it spit out an iOS folder
in the build folder so I guess you just
open this in Xcode oh okay so that's the
server
so we can open this next code
I can run the simulator from here right
so let's just kill this other one
oh that's interesting don't put your
build folder in here because it tries to
parse it
more
are you open at
we are not a story now try adding a
story now we'll see for real-time
updates
I'm the real-time update something
broken with this thing I just did and
that's what we did
yeah well I just refreshed try it's one
else try
sourpuss you added one right I commented
out the the notifications block of the
migration well that was there to delete
the notifications how do you kick off a
simulator on here
Wow it's a lot of airs oh wait here's
where we go
against my local version
she loves ya I launched it from Mexico
this time to see what this horse this is
there like a file browser in here
somewhere
yeah this can this can classes mm-hmm
which one that H file by intra C mean
Greek just meteor build Greg meteor
build Android it seems like it's broken
you could but I think maybe the pain
point there would be like when you want
to later compile it again you're gonna
have to like merge that in with the new
generated project
right something you know it gets me most
of the way there yeah yeah yeah well and
the great thing is so the one thing we
haven't talked about is if I were to
deploy a new version they actually use
hot code push and they'll send the new
code down to the phone
it'll get stored on the hard drive and
the next time the app runs it uses so
the question righteous test is if you
use this setup and connect to in crater
yeah let's say we're doing crater and
you connect to it and you like close
down and then you pop it back open later
like it's been in the background is that
data stored locally in the database and
no sir
I just run from just the same leaves at
night some of that stuff like take care
of like if you and may do that I'm just
not sure where to go to figure that out
right like this document under if you
just write like cordova like data sync
package for telescope or something
well I don't even think you have to say
that because all the Cordova stuff is
isomorphic and it should work in client
server and Cordova situations well I
mean is there a downside to getting the
pub/sub data out and storing it in local
storage for a regular browser
does not have cash what is it it just
picked up on Oh for some reason yeah
this is the problem I've been having
with it this is what I was railing
against the other day
huh they don't say anything about phones
in here it's been updated since oh nine
442 people I've downloaded it into an
app let's figure that out it's a mostly
him you know it you go to the first
commit or no that was in there yeah it's
him this the same guy breaks and more
than icing yeah it's poorly configured
get greater yeah you get on the airplane
and then you want to be able to browse
through yeah but see I think you'd only
be able to browse around to the
publications that you had grabbed at the
time so like if you hadn't have
initiated like
and rotors pendants built-in that it
would know even a comment on a post
that's now gone
yeah ideally this would just layer into
your like collections and hook in and
just work right Matt magically well I
it's almost like pass through pass
through cashing right like I feel like
we have more questions than answers I'll
see I did get the view to new post right
here yeah well oh wait did I crash maybe
I crashed my site went down that's about
the same thing as you turn it off your
Wi-Fi right alright so we did have one
question which was I should be yeah
my question was if we build for iOS but
pointed at crater what does that look
like instead of pointing at our
localhost I just did building and yeah
when you do the build you just give it a
host and a port
or I can't do anything cuz you turn off
Wi-Fi oh gosh well only that worked I
pointed to that crater my guess would be
actually different versions of the code
because I'm not copying my Mongo string
on a recording no no no no there's
version differences I have an updated
crater yet 209 seven and this is
actually master - you could be like does
that I wonder if that actually adds
something to the server build or the
client build
ruined my night I'm gonna be playing
with this all night now
yeah it's really kind of a lame demo
isn't it cuz the real-time stuffs not
working I'm dressing okay so which one
you gonna comment in that didn't work Oh
cuz it thinks I'm on crater interesting
you gonna click the comments link yeah
that worked alright alright alright so
let's uh let's run this again cuz you
don't count that bad
still must started again with iOS which
should kick off a simulator
and we'll see if we get real-time
comment updating again
so you're gonna come in on this one this
one here all right nice awesome was that
someone else commented it's sorted by
comment time I think it's both in
comment time oh nice it redirected me
not long in voting people
woody I vote woody
damn go try
and check no questions and answers yet
if anyone has questions or comments feel
free to ask them we'll try to keep an
eye on it
it's totally working it's giant that's
interesting I wonder if you can control
which emulator it kicks on sound like I
don't remember oh wait hardware device
six class no I don't even know where I
am what am i guys oh I see okay with
that you're gonna actually build it to
get it yeah
they really need a way to exclude
folders from the meteor build process
yeah that's part of the problem with
velocity right now there's no way to
exclude like test packages or anything
they get bundled in yeah like days
before yeah let's just throw it in
there we go
gosh it really does kill my CPU nah
that's just compiling it me actually
compiling code usually I find when
something goes haywire it's like I'm
Auto publishing or something and yeah
like oh I'll want to load up and it'll
run fine but I'll leave it up in the tab
and then like if it's local and I've got
auto published turn on or something then
yeah like it might get wonky or CPU gets
out of control the other day I was doing
my training class and Google Chrome was
like out of control and I brought that
up and I was like chrome helper I was
like ah my machines so sluggish I'm just
gonna kill this it was actually the
Hangout and it killed it right in the
middle all right so compiled again open
it again so you you're thinking if we
open it here and run the simulator we
should be able to switch all right here
I see so we could do like a 5s
bill successful yeah that's the Apache
Cordova logo perhaps yeah so they were
saying an oh nine four they added a new
feature for this they've got a mobile
configuration file in oh nine four oh
look at this it's in the docs oh wait
maybe maybe there's more info in here
about this
it totally didn't drop us anywhere
you're right
haha yeah to talk about you need to have
a DDP connection even with appcache you
mean like did you need like a DDP cache
like just and ruin IRS so I think that's
a Cordova thing though right because if
they added if they had a Windows support
then you'd probably get it relatively
easy oh no I was wrong iOS Android
Blackberry Windows Phone palm bada and
Symbian that is a lot of support there
you see all this no meteor only supports
the two platforms so my guess is you're
not going to see you Windows support
though because you might need like
Windows specific tools to compile it
like Xcode is Mac specific right can you
run the Xcode on a Windows machine yeah
this is probably someone to that and
right now they're not supporting Windows
officially with me you know I would
doubt that it would come anytime soon
wonder what kind of oh there you go
Cordova plugins splash screen sorry
now you do like notification it's yeah
probably a hell of a lot more conveying
I would think
it seems to imply to say our ILS
but do we need something on the client
side like that package that we were just
looking at in order to get the push
notification to push to pop properly on
the iOS side order to register itself as
a push notification being capable app
that's proud of that package does you
think yeah I'm the server side yeah that
makes sense yeah
you don't know is like all this
installation stuff here what what's it
do oh here we go
you register some kind of handler
yeah I still think you'd have to use
something like this my guess is Jeff
handled some of this in that piggyback
project through a surfer yeah so Apple's
got their own servers and that's like
your server sends notifications their
server and their server handles pushing
it down to the phones yeah cuz they they
used to I don't know if they still do
but they used to batch them up to like
save on battery and then I don't know
rather like they just maybe security
implications around it
all right well I don't know maybe that
wasn't super interesting but thanks for
