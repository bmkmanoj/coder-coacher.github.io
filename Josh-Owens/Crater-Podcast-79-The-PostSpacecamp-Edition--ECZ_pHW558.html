thirtieth 2015 spooky welcome crater
fans i'm your host Josh alone with my
co-host been Strahan how's it going Josh
really awesome I am so like still riding
the high from Space Camp oh my gosh was
such a fun time it was it was epic epic
it was everything I was hoping it was
going to be when a bunch of meteor
developers come together and I'm just
stoked at it turned out that way
programming nerds uh yeah it was total
blast so we're gonna talk about Space
Camp Katie wrote her recap we'll go over
that we're talking about meteor weekly
why what medium and their tech stack
oops i just realized i didn't actually
look at that article though defining
methods and meteor 121 all right let's
get into it indeed so if you weren't
there you'll obviously you'll hear the
the live studio audience crater podcast
we did sadly it was my first run with
the audio equipment and I did not check
the sound levels and was way hot so the
audio editor did the best he could with
it but it wasn't it wasn't pretty so man
you mean we can't just like trash that
show and not like have anyone ever see
it well you know it's only half Ashok
has been needs these stories up front I
don't know if I want to like and sonam
history yeah he live yet oh just for the
record just for the record everyone i am
a lightweight at drinking and I I didn't
drink for I don't know what I think it
was like 15 years I haven't drank at all
yeah except for like
years ago I started drinking beer again
oh my and yeah it's all Karl's fault
Carl from ok grow is like the chillest
guy I know he is like he could be a spy
and no one knows it he's a guy that just
keeps pouring you little sips of hard
liquor when you're not paying attention
and it was yo he was like sitting in the
corner he's like sipping this thing it
looks like it's no big deal right I'm
like all right I'll have one nice no man
you thought it was a strawberry daiquiri
or something didn't you yeah right oh
gosh I thought it was like a kiddie
cocktail you know so i will just
apologize for the quality but i did want
to get something out because we did talk
about swiss day and i'll apologize for
myself because I shake oh but why did we
would definitely make sure we give been
all the stories ahead of time now oh
yeah that was hilarious and it was great
having having chat sit in my lap that
was just a wonderful moment it's
understandable everyone wants check
corcos sitting in a lab alright that was
Friday night right pretty uh what they
say Netflix and chill kind of night
that's a different 30 minutes from me
walking in the door and i'll send Chet
was in my lap I mean I didn't know that
the you were posting in the Space Camp
roopa on your way there like I need
someone sitting in my lap what no I'm
just kidding uh so everyone alright
let's let's get serious okay read this
article it's got some pictures in it not
of people sitting in men's lab Judah of
the venue which I think was pretty
friggin awesome III mean we looked a
long time to find an awesome place but I
was actually still blown away having
seen the pictures with the the view that
that deck had and it's just got a huge
wall of glass windows going up three
stories they kind of look out into the
in the mountains so well let me paint a
picture picture for people that weren't
there or if you don't know what we're
talking about like where have you been
come on
like this is the first ever meteor meet
up for for the whole community
conference yeah and it was like an
unconference for a whole weekend and
Tennessee Indian orange Tennessee owes
beautiful area our boy Josh here locked
down that's like mansion of a cabin how
many bedrooms was in that place 14 I
think gosh it was like awesome and we
sold out the whole event and just think
of so many meteor guys people that write
articles uh everyone that you know who
is someone in the community and and they
all came together and like pretty much
met for the first time face to face and
it was a blast it was it was a nope
don't miss the next one everyone yeah
really oh wait I gotta play in that
chute yeah you got to get a bigger place
now I think too I I do i do I mean so
we're looking at like more of a summer
camp style where you'll have cabins and
then you'll have like a central mess
hall area and then we'll like do the
talks in the gaming and all that kind of
stuff in the sides awesome I think
that'd be a lot of fun so what do we do
this the second day so well so that
night you know oh sorry did the podcast
and then we had games I brought 14 board
games so it wasn't quite as lively that
night I think a lot of people were
traveling and kind of tired but my wife
made some killer lasagna no and then you
know after the little bit before the
podcast some people were playing games
uh and then afterwards i saw i think
someone played ticket to ride so there's
a lot of fun games going on and then
saturday you know we got up my wife made
some tasty cast rolls and then we had we
had talks afterwards so it was kind of
like purposely unorganized you know we
just i had a piece of paper and people
came up and wrote the names down and I
kind of sordid that into a list of talks
and we ended up going up to the second
floor and it was a little crowded but
you know that's where the TV was and
where we could present and
you know there's a couple pictures of
that like it was definitely standing
room only there in the Blatt in the back
but we had a lot of great talks like
Paul talked about rested EDP and how
that stuff works and mahaan gave a talk
about switching from Java to meteor and
Chet talked about meteor in the opal j.d
juggled for us fascinating ya think I
know that was a fun talk that was so I'd
actually seen a previous version of that
talk and i like this version way better
so he did a great job yeah it's been
amazing I've been able to see him
iterate each time I think that was like
the fifth or sixth time he gave that
talk and you could tell like he really
spent some good time polishing it yeah
yeah I was up there is one of my
favorites um p Cory gave a good talk on
security why you should always check
your arguments check yourself before you
wreck yourself that should be the title
I says talk uh I co got up and gave an
impromptu talk about my slides are
important and he didn't have any slides
ironically funny he did a great job low
you know I think honestly Eric terpstra
I think that's how you say uh maybe gave
my my favorite a talk and it was the
deploy to windows ? and it was really
really interesting because he was
talking about trying to deploy to a
Windows environment and he talked about
all the frustrations involved and he's
got some code that's now been committed
into core and came out with a meteor one
to one so it was exciting yeah and it
was funny yeah yeah definitely it was
like it's like that the dry humor funny
you know that that's my favorite kind so
yeah kudos to him Ramsey talked about
web pack and reactive meteor and uh huh
maybe maybe a little fail during his
talk he's like trying to compare regular
meteor to web pack and how fast it
reloads and it's like they almost look
the same to me
hey you a serious about it everyone else
was like what yeah all right the old
time is like five seconds did he did
show it again later and it did you could
see it was much faster but I understand
what he's saying really like just that
little bit you want you wanna see your
results right away you don't want to be
pausing spirit yeah like a 15 second
pause this means that you're on reddit
like typing nasty you know troll
comments or something well it whatever
all the kids doing oh man then we had to
talk with a guy forgot to put his mic on
that was terrible terrible it's a Grammy
it was epic yeah it was you oh who is
the presenter that was supposed to be
like checking people or the host her
yeah well you know you want to know how
many people had to remind to put a mic
on none that's so bad too because I had
a pretty good presentation I did I liked
it you talked about making money bot and
I think it's funny because had that
presentation got up on the internet it
would be like what is this like he's
trying to sell us on some kind of thing
but you guys just like hacked on a
project on the way down and it's all
about currency trading so yeah yeah just
like over in a comic coming down and in
the our van 10 right 10 hour ride and
then you scalp for like another 10 hours
right overnight you should have seen
your face in the morning when you're
sitting there and then we get up and
you're sitting there still and it's like
oh my god you're so unamused like I
think you just like walked by just
shaking your head cuz you were like
smiling no less who's smiling I'm so
excited anyway are you like my wife my
wife won't let me say good morning did I
ever say that no tell you sorry she
won't let me say good morning first
thing in the morning like I am like
raring to go on like I'm alive yeah it's
another day I'm like good morning
sweetheart she's like you're not allowed
to say good morning your only contain
morning so i have to say morning from
now
anyway she the one that you have to put
the coffee in her hand before you can
speak anyway when I saw when I saw Hugh
and Wendy walking by that's what I
thought about like oh I better I'd say
good morning to him again like my punch
no it's just fun like we were really
tired we were up till like 3am cuz we
had a run to walmart to get more
groceries no you know we got a bit 7 to
start cooking again yeah that's when I
started on the project again was 330 I
forgot what we were talking about but
man time just flew yeah yeah yeah it was
so much fun uh they made another talk by
James baxley about making church modern
and how they've got like a multi-site
church and they're using meteor to kind
of change the game there what it what a
sleeper talker right like you I didn't
think this was going to be something
really big what oh man am i impressed
with their stack and like that was an
awesome like modern CTO talk on how to
be like agile mm-hmm small team and
produce a lot like right which she
wouldn't expect out of someone running a
church organization no it was it was a
really valuable talk yeah yeah
definitely and you know I didn't get
much of a chance to talk to him because
he didn't come back for for day 3 but
mmm we talked a little bit when I was
driving him to his car and you know the
church I go to crossroads there's
similar to that you know like they're
they're one of the other churches that I
know that's using meteor and now they're
playing with react native as well and
kind of building kind of an epic dev
team over there so that's awesome and
then as a special surprise like I I
asked Matt McClure to give just an
impromptu QA about being on shark tank
which I don't think a lot of people
realize had happened um you know we have
this this guy riding a meteor app and
they got on the shark tank with foot
cardigan and so we just didn't prompt to
Q&amp;amp;A so to be clear they're working on a
meteor app for the sock subscription
website but it's not quite released yet
so but it was interesting because I
think some of
wanted to hear like you know what's that
crushed traffic look like and he talked
about you know getting like 11,000
people a second or something onto their
site and then like he had a sharp drop
off but then you know they were still up
like two hundred percent over normal
daily traffic like day after day after
that so pretty pretty big amazing yeah
the biggest thing that shocked me was
like you're watching shark tank and it's
like a little ten-minute segment purpose
yeah and he was saying like uh when
you're there you're actually getting
grilled for an hour and a half to G yeah
yeah totally and the kicker is you know
he walks in and they they rip away their
pants should they stand there for like
an hour and a half just talking about
their business and their underway oh my
gosh I'd even think about that and then
and then he was saying like he had he
had like gone in and switched the the
opening on the front of the boxer shorts
he had stitch them closed and then they
were like double bagging and triple
bagging on the underwear to make sure
nothing was pretty funny oh I tell you
what if there's a slip up there they
probably want to get funding maybe they
wouldn't were wonderful mr. wonderful
would probably make him an offer kevin
O'Leary but uh yeah and so after that
like you know obviously we had like
pumpkin chili for lunch in between the
talks which pretty tasty and then how
what did she make for dinner that night
oh you remember now oh no I just came
down whenever it smelled really good
wasn't there pot pies dad yeah that was
it the hell guys yeah it was amazing
yeah that was we didn't quite plan the
pot pies out right we ran out and a
couple guys didn't get it but we left
over lasagna so I don't think they were
super set and then you know that's when
the gaming really kicked into high gear
uh it was it was pretty awesome i played
some pandemic I got to play king of
Tokyo I you guys kept playing coo yes
which I did not get a chance to try out
but it looked pretty fun so I never
played board games before except for
like monopoly
back in the day yeah and my brother
would always want me so like since then
I I just never played board games yeah
that night you're sold aren't you I kept
on winning coo yeah it's fun and I never
lied once hey hi cuz I can't lie nice
nice yeah and you played exploding
kittens right oh my gosh it's such a
gross game so Rose I did not you know
it's funny like I didn't even bring
either of those games but I was telling
someone like it was it was awesome
because there were some guys that came
there you know like Devin and Sam corcos
Devin Devin brought some of those games
kevin was awesome man people and like it
was so glad to have a lot of those
people there because I had no idea how
to play a half the games and they're
just like they'd crack it open and get
things going and it was a lot of fun oh
my god just a lot of fun and then sunday
we had the hackathon and we had about we
had 21 people sign up so i just broke
every one random teams of three and they
had about 10 out 10 ish hours to build
something and it was it was pretty
interesting to see what people came up
with you know yeah it was impressive 10
hours yeah we actually had stuff to demo
mmhmm yeah so the the winners third
place was a rear old Ramsey and Adam
Smith and Kendall Smith Adam and kindle
no relation just have the same last name
but it was about like making up your own
rules and tracking what those are and
being able to share them with people
which was you know kind of fun given the
context uh and then you know randomness
through together three designers Dave
Bascombe and Devin Patel and Jesse floor
egg and it turned out like they just
decided to hack on a CMS called sauce
CMS and it's like this package you can
install now and it was kind of awesome
to watch him because they were just
doing like this in inline editor type of
setup and you're able to just hook it up
and like control that the
the content that's on the page just you
know if you're an admin it just kind of
works when you click on it yeah pretty
cool it is and then um I go and Mitch
and Matt McClure they work together on
something called once upon a tweet and
it's the idea that you tell a story one
tweet at a time but it's you know you
just have to include the hashtag in at
all you know it'll put that tweet in
there and then there's like retweeting
for upvoting essentially yeah for which
parts of the story like and it starts
the day by grabbing a mash-up of like to
trending topics on Twitter so kind of
fun did you see the demo of that because
I was like kind of disappointed that
they hit the twitter api limit yeah yeah
definitely I didn't get a chance
throughout the weekend to see a trip I
see a demo of that yeah I really wanted
to I don't think I did either but
hopefully they'll get it fixed and
publish it so yeah I was impressive uh
oh yeah they did actually publish it
it's linked in this article that's
awesome it's very cool it was an awesome
awesome show indeed happened it was a it
was exhausting like I definitely on
Sunday I was glad for the hackathon
because I was like so tired we made two
trips to walmart we cooked all that food
and just like organizing everything just
wiped me out man I was you and Wendy did
a great job poster like through the roof
you guys are awesome thanks yeah and you
guys are always doubt running somewhere
getting something for us always was
right there to like I don't think we
ever had a shortage of anything yeah
except for pie pie yeah man I love
Duncan pie but I'm man I miss some that
fruit pie mmm yeah that don't that I
can't talk don't make the MM sound if I
didn't get the heaven II know is it was
pecan pie actually that's right that's
what I'm not good silk pie but the main
attraction was definitely the pumpkin
and we had three of him in like the
other stuff went first so
we know like pecan and chocolate so fire
away more prettier am an amazing you
guys it it was just amazing so I will
say we we kind of nailed it on the
alcohol we only came back home with like
six bottles and like maybe three
quarters of a bottle of rum so I learned
that no one actually likes from when
they ran out of the other hard liquors I
started shrink in the room um but we we
were pretty spot-on with the beers so I
was pretty happy with that yeah we went
through quite a bit I bet we went
through at least 30 cases of beer fun
well it was a really good time
friendships formed and other friendships
i already had got a lot cheaper so it
was a real blast yep yeah which everyone
lived closer yep definitely what do we
got next man meat eater weekly awesome
birthed wallets face camp actually it
was yeah so this is a rebirth rebirth
rebirth yeah of this week in meteor has
transitioned over to meteor weekly or I
would say it's like a fork of it yeah no
creator yeah we she follows it and so
Rishi is going to be the curator of
meteor weekly our boy Carl from ok grow
made the logo mm-hmm you guys are
working together and Rishi is just like
the cornerstone of it because out of
every out of everyone that like reports
news on meteor Rishi like takes a unique
take on it like he's different than
everyone else like oh it feels like
whores to like a search stuff and it's
really really amazing yeah this is the
one newsletter that that all serious
meteor developers really take a pause
and try and really digest it sometimes
go through it twice or three times
because of how dense it is yeah so it's
really valuable and so I guess like I
don't know I'll just like do a PSA right
now like for all the meteor debs that
that are just hearing about meteor
weekly now you guys should go to meteor
weekly calm
and sign up yeah whatever yeah and you
won't regret it like this is the type of
information that you need he does deep
dives into a core updates as well as
like the best of the best content that
has come out that we yeah it's on meteor
yeah and you know the core stuff I
always find that interesting right like
I said I see all the other stuff posted
on crater but he does like a deep dive
into like the quip docks that they're
putting up and looking at all the
commits and kind of summarizing the
interesting thing so it's definitely
worth going to meteor weekly calm and
signing up sadly you know I think is a
little bit of a disservice to the
community that he wasn't allowed to take
those email addresses that had already
signed up for this week of meteor
because I think a lot of those people
they're really there for what's now
meteor weekly and not for what this week
in meteor is likely going to become
whatever it is well I mean I I'm really
good friends with Rishi he's from
Chicago just like I am and um I really
like the guy yeah and yeah it was an
interesting situation that happened
between this week in meteor and now
meteor weekly I mean I got the first
email from this week in meteor today
they published the first one today oh
did they yeah I i was i was a little
disappointed cuz that that morning
sunday morning i got like an email that
was just a recap of all the previous
work that rich yet done and I was like
well that's not great yeah so I mean I
got the email today the newsletter today
for this week in meteor and it was
decent it was decent so I mean another
piece of content I would I would still
be subscribed to it I found value in it
but um you know I don't think that
there's any reason to compare the two
because I would assume Rishi's
newsletter is just going to be like much
more pertinent on what I'm looking for
yeah dear type stuff so i would agree
like I'm looking over
the the one that went out and it mostly
looks like just a collection of links
not um not not really like Rishi tends
to give his own take on it why it's
important that's a great job like
abbreviating it right mmhmm yeah yeah I
appreciate that too so definitely unlike
us we do a terrible job at a pregame I
guess I think it's me like you do a
pretty good job I need to work on it man
all right yeah yes I don't know like
I've I feel like I could probably put
out this week in meteor just using
craters uh uploaded most about its toys
the week or something well like I said
I'm gonna stay subscribed to it for a
little bit longer but really right now I
see it as uh they're serving two
different it feels like a filter like a
weekly filtered version of the crater
daily email right yep night you know
it's probably valuable to some but I
look at every post that comes in the
crater so you know right um yeah sign up
if you're not already signed up by now
because like you talked for like five
minutes it's like what's up so I'm gonna
give you a second warning media weekly
calm definitely know if you're not on
there and you listen to this show
regularly you just suck just stop
sucking this sign up I'm just kidding
it's brand new so don't feel bad if next
week you're not on it that that's on you
not on me I want people know how good it
is come on it is it is yep all right so
um next up is a post on medium a post on
medium about mediums tech stack that's
um yeah when I started eating no I me
you know I I just think this is a good
read right because scaling a nap is so
different than building a nap in my
opinion um so they even there's a dig in
here
oh here it is for a site seemingly as
simple as medium it may be surprising
how much complexity is behind the scenes
it's just a blog right you could
probably knock something out in rails in
a couple of days I love that quote right
I mean it's totally a dig on the fact
that you know the 15-minute blog thing
that the H did forever ago well so I
like that little nod of humor but you
know they talk about using ansible and
Amazon's VPC virtual private cloud and
using cloud front and just all this
stuff that's involved in their
application I think once you like you
know you you've got an app that you
build here and you spend you know a
couple weeks or a couple months like
perfecting that and it's all written in
one language and then like you know you
start to get some traction and some
users and you realize like oh my god in
order to scale we're gonna have to do
something different yeah you know you
really start pushing the envelope on
what what something can do I mean
they're using node but then they had
trouble with the database pretty early
on and they they went with DynamoDB for
the public launch um so it was a little
bit of neo4j for relationships yeah yeah
I heard of Amazon Aurora so i wonda i'll
click that link for later all right
afflict I'm gonna read that later
where's that one that they have a
database section okay yeah so they're
using Amazon redshift for the data
warehouse you know so I mean it's just
listen I geek out on this stuff like
this is scaling apps is definitely one
of my favorite things like I used to run
a podcast called web pulp TV and it was
all about the guts of the web oh no and
I definitely like try to find those
shows and getting back up there but um
you know they just talk about all the
different things that were involved in
getting this thing out the door and how
it operates and that kind of stuff so go
read it yeah I find it fascinating um
that you can get so much done with some
of the frameworks out there right now
especially like meteor to get an MVP
going and it's like legit MVPs like
they're pretty salad
oh my gosh you are really hitting
engineering walls when you're when
you're trying to scale oh yeah but
effect breaking out little chunks have
multiple different databases on your
engineering team just explodes because
of all these specialized units they need
and it just it's shocking the effort
that it takes just to get more users oh
yeah it still blows my mind so yeah well
you know i'm awesome article i got to be
around like and I knew some people that
worked at Twitter when they were dealing
with scaling issues and you know it's
it's really interesting to watch that
stuff because they they're they're
basically trying to figure out how to
like segment and and mitigate like
scaling issues by pulling the app apart
in two different pieces that they can
then scale in a different way you know
and using things like Cassandra or like
using murder for deployment which is
like BitTorrent ah deployments deploys
which is it you know that stuff super
interesting me yeah um and they you know
they said something in here like they do
automated deployments continuous
deployments they deploy sometime around
of five times a day sometimes it'll pick
up to ten and they eat awesome they
monitor air rates and basically before
they fully deploy everything they deploy
it to like one or two servers and watch
the air rates on those servers if they
go up they'll flip those back and
they're just using like DNS to handle
all that so um there are medium is like
a great case study that people could
really start learning how it was
developed and everything Oh what is that
design company that ended up being
bought out by Facebook they were Quebec
or from Toronto but then they worked for
Leland thatch hmm or something like that
yeah anyway so they did it right up
because they were one of the they were
the first design firm the medium and so
working with teams distributed teams
multiple designers and multiple design
firms and they were headed up the whole
thing
they have an awesome medium post on that
nice slow and then the guy who made
bootstrap fat yeah yeah one of the guys
auto yeah yeah but the fat guy goes in
he works for medium now yeah he has an
amazing medium article about CSS in
structuring CSS for meeting and all
issues that they went on with that yeah
yeah yeah cuz he went in there like kind
of wrangled it and cleaned it up right
it was that article is like one of my
all times just one of my all times nice
and I love his writing style cuz that's
like mine we interject goofy nonsensical
but anyway like every day prevent be a
great case study or for just the web in
the modern web and the struggles of
scaling so this is just one more thing
to add to it it is an amazing article
I'm glad you included this yeah well you
know I mean it's no news it's it's not
media related but you know I think
trying to expand the horizons yeah yeah
absolutely all right next up defining
methods yeah yeah our boy David Weldon
Oh of Athena Athena yes so that's a
meteor app here so people what what you
don't know about meteor some people
might be listening and they don't know
what meteor is or they know they heard
of it but they haven't started a project
up with it not one of the cool features
of meteors latency compensation right so
how we kind of do that how they achieve
that is like faking out the client so so
if you want to run secure code on your
server typically you have to go and like
trigger that to happen you got to run it
on on your server and the whole time the
clients waiting spinning wheel the
server to come back with response
latency compensation is since we have
JavaScript on the client and and the
backend and we also have a database on
both sides we go ahead and step out that
change
and then the client sees it right away
while our server go go go's ahead and
like make sure it's legit and all that
stuff if it is they send it back and hey
the client doesn't change at all it's
like the legit stuff if it was incorrect
then it will erase what the client did
on the client side and it keeps
everything safe but at the same time the
client feels like the app is just
working constantly really fast always
connected almost like a desktop app so
that's methods and what David talked
about here is how they build methods in
a unique way and so this is for the
media people geek out a little bit um
one thing that really like josh about
this article is how he uses check for
his schema and they don't use simple
schema at all uh check as a little
package that everyone should use where
when you're passing arguments to a
publication or a method you check that
before you you execute your code whether
it's a string an object or whatnot Pete
Corey's talk is a lot about that Yeah
right so so Dave uses it for his schema
yeah I thought that was a really
interesting move like I I would have
never thought of that but it's totally
like you can say match optional date for
a creative at timestamp didn't make
sense yeah yeah absolutely and then he
does it a little bit differently he was
showing off his style for running server
side code and then the untrusted client
code mm-hmm and how and was he talking
he talks it he says it's a two-tier
method uh and so that was super
interesting I and I like I think i'm
going to start i think i'm gonna my next
project i'm gonna play around with this
yeah this way of writing it and I'm
gonna see what I like about it yeah it's
a it's a pattern and you know I think
the interesting thing is here that
testing becomes a little bit easier by
going this method as well which is a
nice benefit
um what else I like how he talks about
the user ID because it's different
between server and client yeah and a lot
of people get hung up on that like they
don't they don't understand the ins and
out of that um yeah yeah so I'm glad he
went a little bit of an extra mile to
explain that yeah the consistency could
be better but he's just wrapped it into
a method called tri user ID that has a
try-catch around it which is nice yeah
um yeah and he just talked about like I
mean using the check package instead of
simple schema for doing the kind of
schema so and just great read so it is
it's a it's a short read on people who
are have built media apps in the past
will I feel like they'll grasp it right
away and yeah and it's worth a try so
that's fine yeah definitely one of the
few articles that doesn't rely on
third-party packages you know he's just
talking about the stuff that's included
except where he does add the audit
checker the force autocheck Irwin said
Pakistan but that's not really a
third-party it's just know you're you're
checking arguments at runtime and then
pete pete has a version that checks to
that startup time too yeah there is
really interesting I'll time yes yes I
i'm going to rewatch all the the
unconference video talks when they come
out yeah yeah I got to get those up so
I'm going to start with the ones that
you know some people installed the
desktop wire presenter pro or whatever
and so I was able to get their slides on
automatically but I think there's like
two of those and then the other ones I
got to get slides for and can i
interject them in so people very cool
I'm kind of glad that you didn't record
mom well you're gonna have to give it
again though so I'm not sure if I'm
going to like there's time there's a
little bit of it there's a little bit of
a it's taken up a little bit of my spare
time too much you play so interesting
all sudden there's like a break boss
make money dude
Ben's got a get-rich-quick schemes I
love it I get to be so sarcastic all
right so last story we are talking about
meteor 121 coming out what what mm-hmm I
had no idea it was kind of a minor
release but I thought it was probably
worth mentioning I remember reading the
history like yesterday and I forgot
though it's pretty short um so it looks
like they made inserts faster for a
collection but they've moved to its
cryptographically insecure II that's
right so you know if you still need
something that's gonna be
cryptographically secure you should look
at random dot ID still but this is going
to be a little bit faster they renamed
the ECMO scripts collection package to
ECMO script run time and they've
included more polyfills and shims from
core j/s and so i was just looking at
that and it looks like they've got
symbol and map and set in there now so
that's good yeah yeah definitely and
just uh they changed a little bit how
allowed my work which hey you know that
that's a little weird for me to be in a
little patch release one to one yeah um
I don't know that I totally agree with
that but there's you know they've they
updated source map which I thought was
interesting in order to accommodate
webpack a little bit better so that was
kind of cool and um check now returns
instead of throwing errors internally
which should make things a little bit
faster um what might be you know again
might be a little weird if you're
relying on check thrown air you know
make sure your code still works and then
just a little bit of a workaround for
building for galaxy wall on a non I
guess what on a Windows machine
more than anything you know linux or mac
should be fine deploying but if you have
private packages that have binaries in
your own windows i guess that was a
little bit of a problem and then our
good friend eric is his pull request
that got in there was the port
environment variable can now take a
named pipe to better support deployment
on I is nice yeah so you know not not a
ton but what's interesting is I'm pretty
sure the insert speed up that they did
came out of knowledge employing stuff to
galaxy and so I think we're already
starting to see you know they're
speeding up the framework because
they're actually deploying an app that
they're supporting the galaxy and you
know I think as we get more and more
support requests in from galaxy
customers to we're just gonna we're
going to all reap the benefit of that so
yeah like now they have like money tied
to their performance and issues and so
whenever like galaxy comes up or galaxy
users come up and say hey yo this is
real issue for us mm-hmm money behind it
so that that's gonna get fixed right
away it's awesome it's awesome for the
whole community so you know what we
forgot to mention what's that are the
great sponsors of the unconference oh
yeah we had a ton yeah actually I'm
putting together an email i think i'm
gonna send out this weekend just kind of
like outlining again how it was awesome
to have all the sponsors we did not but
ok grow modulus were definitely the two
huge sponsors um they they came through
and really just kind of like some of the
burden off you know I had no idea if I
could sell tickets and like I they just
believed in me and said yeah sure like
do this no brainer like you always
deliver value to us yeah modulus I
haven't had a chance to talk to Paul and
F modulus or to email me and they're
like it was amazing barely i just i
deploy i deployed a money bot to modulus
this morning super easy right super easy
super
he uh I also really liked that they took
the time to have like a little forum
yeah it is like a little Q&amp;amp;A up there
with a like eight or nine people went up
there and they were yeah I was too
involved winning coo yeah yeah boy Rishi
up there and so he came down and filled
me in yeah um they are going to be
seriously looking at opening up a blog
on there yeah I've been telling them
that for months but I'm hoping they'd
listen so yeah but you know I mean
galaxy doesn't offer database support
yet so it's not like I mean no matter
what you got a shop that elsewhere if
you want a good perform at database yeah
yeah and I share some news wrote for
okay grow really quick yeah so I just
heard that we're going to be looking for
developers so you guys want to want to
work for a full-time meteor shop email
me is that road com is that remote okay
remote yep absolutely us okay us is okay
Canada is okay and if you are rock star
and you're really good at communicating
everything you're working on if your
international go for it man give it a
shot nice yeah yeah so give me a shout
out Bennett okay grow calm and we'll get
you going man we'll see we'll see how it
all rolls yeah definitely you should hit
up the media club select chat room too I
will yeah this is like number of people
in there that would probably like apply
yes yeah so that's cool yeah some of the
other sponsors were like discover meteor
Khedira astronomer compose this was
another big one um you know and Kenai oh
yes and um gosh max and uh me right boys
yeah that was pretty awesome so you know
they made everything possible like we
had beer you know I didn't put it up but
dispatch sent over some money to buy a
couple cases of beer
like you don't even have to mention us
we just want to contribute some beer
money for you guys cuz you're all sounds
awesome yeah so um you know it everybody
came together we were to make a stellar
event for that thing you know mm-hmm
food and booze and fellowship and you
know we even had raspberry PI's we're
gonna do the hackathon with that at
first and then we decided not to but
then we gave him away as prizes for the
hackathon winners mmm i will say i kept
one back for myself and my son's loving
it it's got scratch on it so have you
heard a scratch no I haven't yo your
kids might get into this so it's like
MIT programming language and it's all
kind of visual and you're just kind of
like drag-and-drop different methods on
there and you can Mike yes things in
there and like he's making cats like
jump all over the screens I think I saw
that on a meteor club podcast one of our
guests told us about it oh yeah yeah
yeah yeah totally Arrington and piranha
or whatever mm-hmm yes he did he did but
my son's totally digging it because it
comes installed with raspbian so he said
he's been playing with that for the last
couple days it's awesome yep very cool
all right man this was a long episode so
