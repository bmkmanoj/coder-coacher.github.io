remote cough given to a live audience in
February 2016 this video was made
possible by sponsors like modulus I oh
okay grow calm and space dojo calm if
you would like to find out more
information about upcoming conferences
be sure to go to conf crater on Io and
put your email in the form that pops up
in the lower left corner enjoy the video
welcome back to creator cough we'll call
this like day for i guess thanks for
tuning back in for the makeup sessions
so uh what the the first session we're
going to do today is going to be Sam
hatoum so Sam was working on velocity
and that's now transitioned over to
chimp and I think he also runs OVO which
is a consultancy that helps you I don't
know what do you help people do Sam so
we know companies deliver higher quality
features pasta we do so by consulting
and we also have a bunch of products
which you mentioned chimp is one of the
allows me to do that yeah nice all right
i'll let you take over from here okay
great hello everyone so i'm going to
talk to you about delivering high
quality features and how you can first
of all make them higher quality and then
how you go faster before we dive into
the how to go faster technique which you
which seems to be what most people are
interested in i just want to talk a
little bit about what quality actually
needs and so how do how do you have the
software get reduced you start off with
this idea and somebody will take this
idea and get it all the way to
production where you hopefully have
happy users now the process to go from
an idea to a happy user involves two
main activities
some business activities and then we get
some technical activities now the user
is going to see the sum of everything
that's coming through this line so that
means if I have an idea over here I have
to develop this idea so I might go and
create some wire frames I might go and
just write a document that I will go and
test that I deal with I'm I send an
email to somebody they might respond by
and so what happens if he goes through
this design process over here which is
pretty messy and kind of goes back and
forth back and forth and the density we
end up with something that comes out of
the business activities that looks like
what you want to actually create so over
here you have be asked like you know
what you're asking for when you have
that asked you then take that to the
development and you create a
specification now you may not do a
formal specification but you might send
it by email you might ride you on the
back of the napkin you might have a
conversation you might have a whiteboard
session you may have a use case you may
have a given when then scenario you
might have a user story there's a bunch
of different forms of specifications but
there's always a specification and it's
always based on some ask and that ask is
always a result of some idea and some
other activities that create that ask so
this is kind of the life cycle of an
idea going becoming code so the point
that you have this even if it's just
communication and conversation the
development class up the developer will
take this and now generate some code
that code will get deployed maybe to a
QA environment or staging environment
and then after that somebody looks at it
says
yes this is good to go and it gets
deployed to production so where is the
quality in others the quality is
everywhere the quality is in how much
research did you do the quality is and
how much research to do to do at this
point to make sure that the idea is good
one did you do some some of the lean
practices like customer development did
you do customer research did you test
your why friends with people these are
all quality functions that you'd be
applying at this stage when you get
further down the line when you when
you're asking for something how much
effort did you put into the
specification how much how well did you
specify did you just say for somebody
can you please build me a login screen
or did you you know give them
specifications that say when the user
enters this then I should see that and
user enters this and you know if the
enter about email address it should give
them the message so that's the quality
of the specifications or the quality of
the ask that's coming through as a
developer what quality practices do you
apply there do you say um i'm going to
write some tests so do some tests go and
development maybe you're doing some
acceptance test driven development and
you're not doing test any any test
testing at all you might have things
like lit those are those are considered
quality functions anything that you
apply at the development level that
helps you create better code is going to
be a quality function and especially
things that are validating that what
you're being asked for is being
delivered is a quality function quality
of florence in and by itself is a
quality function you're applying quality
consider the code that was created here
actually passes and even all the way
when it gets through production are you
checking that the production instance or
the application that's on production you
checking that that's bad are you seeing
that you know all the services are up at
the pages are so you can see quality
applies
across the entire life so here's an
insight about power in order to go
faster you need to have more quality
functions in your process the more
quality functions that you can put into
your process that you automate
especially with the alternation of
course then the faster you'll be able to
deliver so the lesson there is you look
off the quality functions and the speed
looks after itself let's start here with
the ask I will go beyond this point so
beyond this point is all the like
product market fit concern stuff you
might do the lean practices you might do
that's all yeah we actually have that
capability my one of my co-founders he
deals with this whole section which is
how do you make sure that you're
building the right product so little
comment there yes exactly like that
that's exactly what is so yeah at this
point is how you know what is it we want
now from this point onwards is how do we
make sure that we've got a valid loss
how we make sure that gets delivered
through it so the first point is to
understand what asks all about so we
said this is the business and that's the
tech in the business we have a business
domain if we're talking about for
example a car manufacturer we would look
at their business domain as they
obviously have models although that
looks like a boat is actually a cop so
they might they would haven't cause they
would have a dealer they would have a
another service shop
I would have what also they have a like
a maybe they might have some advanced
connected car sort of capability where
they can talk to your car so all of
these things are within the business
domain so let's just call them the
business donate and if we look at the
business domain purely without any
computer system without any IT
whatsoever um we would look at this as a
bunch of interactions so we would say
you have a customer a customer would go
to a dealer in order to purchase a
specific model I could operate this
business on a piece of paper I'd only
the computer to do that for me in fact
maybe when for was around the 19th hole
or whenever they came up with their
cards they probably didn't have a system
so they did this all on paper they
probably would not have connected
Colorado but you know when the customer
wants to go to get their car serviced
then they would go to the service shop
and maybe they want you know new things
like book an appointment you know okay
appointment so that's the business the
men and when we ask for something from
the tech guys was typically asking them
for something that is within the
business domain so understanding the
business domain first probably is an
activity that the business guys can do
that's very important before going into
development and a lot of times this is
actually completely missing it just in
skin people's heads but nobody knows
exactly what is that they're doing you
know they didn't put a name around the
same we're doing business domain
functions just like in a sec nobody says
we're writing a specification even
though there are things to be created to
their specifying what needs to be
created so to have a higher quality spec
your spec needs to be referencing your
business domain you need to start
creating a language that says this
a customer which is different to the
agent that is a dealer you know maybe
they even physical either this guy is a
customer you start to create this domain
language about the business and that the
main language you use it when you're
asking and so again this is something we
do instinctively but maybe not so
disciplined if you focus on a domain and
you have a conversation over the domain
and you have that conversation before
you go into development and you involve
three people three disciplines someone
from business some more from tech like
the development that's on multiple tests
so they call this technique the three
amigos when you get these three
disciplines somalia product owner a
developer and a tester or if you're a
smaller team the tester might be the
developer point is to get more eyes at
this point on the spec before we even
enters the system that in itself is a
quality function you're applying a
quality function that identifies defects
before they even enter your system so it
turns out crazy statistic fifty percent
of defects enter your development way
before your development even starts
which means fifty percent of your
defects actually are in the
specifications themselves and the less
disciplined your specs are the more like
you can have defects in them so you get
somebody from biz you get somebody from
tech you get somebody from test you put
together and you get them to talk about
the business domain and what it is
they're being asked for and a good
technique is called specification by
example this is where towards that
cucumber come in and we'll get to that
in a second but what you're really doing
is you're going through examples of the
business domain so you're saying sorry
what are we trying what is the ask what
do you want from the system and let's
say I am a person that bought cod so as
a customer
I want to book an appointment that says
I want to book an appointment so that I
can service my car so this you may be
familiar to you is the agile user story
narrative and it has three parts that
help you structure the context that
you're working within it says who this
is about so as a customer I want to book
an appointment so that I can serve as my
 so this is the feature that I want
and over here it's the benefit that I
will get from having this feature so
that sets the narrative and obviously
can you give me an example and we say
all right well let's say I've got a car
and I want to not just bought it and I
want to go and get it serviced so I book
an appointment and you know that the
mechanic will look at it and let me know
what's wrong with it and so somebody
from the test discipline will say what
are people that are under warranty that
is that included look what if somebody's
not under the warranty you my girl oh
yeah of course so now the scenario
changes from just a customer coming in
to service their car and it's a customer
that has they still under warranty so
you have a unification arguments and the
scenarios become things like customer
within warranty period and then you have
another scenario that is basically the
customer is not within the warranty
period in this spec that's forming here
is called specification by example so
we're taking the business domain we're
getting three people that understand the
business to me we're going and creating
examples of what might happen using this
domain language and then
we're using a structure that says oh
this is for what they want widely want
it and a bunch of scenarios that tell us
you know the different ways in which
they can achieve this value so then we
have customers in warranty given a
customer purchased a car at its toe and
so date when they book an appointment
then they are informed that their
appointment is free another scenario
customers out of warranty given are the
customer purchased their car three years
ago seven years ago when they book a
service appointment they are notified
that they will be charged two thousand
dollars and so now you can see how you
can go into very detailed given when
then scenarios that are completely about
the business domain they have no
reference to the user interface they
don't talk about you know how the value
is achieved they talk about what the
value is so a good specification that's
not telling how it's doing it it tells
you what it's about and then the how the
song is what happens over this side I
actually have to charge my battery yeah
excuse me all right so really quick
summary an idea forms want to take it to
production we have a specification that
gets formed when we know what we're
asking for we should go through the
domain will create a three amigos
session to highlight specific slices
within the domain that we want to
represent as scenarios give it a story
narrative and even though this hat
actually has no effect on any test
automation whatsoever is extremely
important in making sure love this set
of scenarios these set of scenarios are
coherent they're all about the same
business benefit they're all about the
same person they're all about the same
feature that's required and they ended
up creating slight differences between
slice with another day so we now have a
spec it's in the form of given when then
I'm just going to take a quick shortcut
and say that we've now created a my
specification so now the tech team has
got this spec and it's the result of the
tech team being involved in the first
place so they have full context of what
it is they're developing the business is
happy that they've gone through the
scenarios and things make sense and the
test team they don't exactly what to
expect when it hits them so the next
thing the tech team should do is create
a copy of this domain well that's the
business domain this now becomes the
domain model it's a model because it's a
subset of the real world and we're not
going to say how tall the agent is and
what color eyes the customers got but we
need enough information here just to
represent and even like replicate the
business process and allow that business
process to have it online set so this is
what the domain domain model looks like
relative to the business model you have
a class called customer you have a class
or domain entity actually is the right
thing call the service you have a domain
entity called like the animated
connected car you have a domain in
typical model you have their domain
entity called dealer and finally you
have agent and so you can see there's a
direct relation between the domain model
in the business model they're actually
identical and they should be identical
so now all we can do is employed
technique called modeling by exam
that is we take the example that we
created here be given one then when we
look at things inside like given the
customer purchased a car and so and so
they well customer that's a domain
entity purchased a car on some and so
date that means that they own a car so
we'll have that model as part of the
customer or a link to the customer
there's an attribute on when that car
was purchased so we get a domain model
that for being formed from the examples
and as we add new examples let's say
there's a missing you and you use
scenario that is about giving my service
my car then you know the connected car
should send the signal to the car fame
you into the service complete or maybe
send it to the person's phone take
service complete so if we've got this
new blue scenario there what we end up
doing is modeling this new clean
scenario hip and that's what modeling by
example me to is you taking
specification by example and you use it
to create your model so what you can
really call this section here the
modeling by example it's like a
simulation what's really happening is um
you're getting the simulation that's
going between the ask it's going through
the but others they go and test this
this new idea over here in the main and
then once they're happy with it they
will take it back to the business guys
and say hey look things have changed
slightly wrong a little coding we
discovered that we also need to add
so-and-so attribute and so the business
might say yes that makes sense or no
wait you've done something here that's
not quite right so you get this circle
this interaction very short feedback
loop that happens between the business
and the tech and this is what's called
domain discovery so notice how much
quality functions how many quality
functions were putting just on the
specification piece because so many
problems come from the specification
being incorrect well this is really
doing is allowing us to to fix those
mistakes very quickly without having to
build a UI on top and take care of
persistence and take care of you know
although all the framework and
infrastructure and everything else you
have to do this is just purely about the
domain so you go through this a few
times this iteration you go from asking
the specifications by example group of
people you take it on to the domain
model you start to test it with the
domain model make sure it works make
sure you've got the right entities make
sure you have the right attributes as
you do that you're slightly modifying
the spectrum making it closer to what it
you know what it should be you go back
to the business you do this a few times
and then finally what you end up with is
this stage here when you have very very
high confidence from skilling you have
ninety percent because I can say you got
in a really good man percent confidence
that this spec is spot-on you know it's
have everybody look at it we've gone
through a simulation we've gone through
examples it matches the domain model
we're using the right language which is
not terminology it fits in other minute
like you're pretty confident that this
specification is good so now from here
onwards you go and you build your UI you
go and you build your database
persistence layer and all that sort of
stuff which typically developers find
this quite easy link building and
building though you I you know putting
some some news on top of an existing
domain model is typically ways so this
is how you can massively reduce the
number of defects you've got and is that
even a really high-quality domain now as
you're right unit UI UI class noisy as
you write the persistence layers you
wrap all of these with unit tests so I
won't dive into unit testing is talk but
supposed to say that unit has really
protect you against say a specific
uicomponent not doing what he should do
so let's say I've got a arm this new
book appointment screen and it's mapping
directly to my novel so when I
a book an appointment for so-and-so time
it's supposed to behave in a way that
when I put the wrong value in when I put
a date in the past it says hey sorry
your day is in the past I don't really
need to take care of that domain level
that's a unit so then my unit tests will
be very good at highlighting any issues
I've got that so where does cucumber
fittings orders cucumber and the whole
behavior driven development philosophy
is actually this whole practice in turn
people think BBB is just is one tiny
just like unit testing but different
language it's actually not true unit
testing lives over here just highlighted
that here but b.ed your behavior driven
development is actually this entire
picture it's about starting off by
defining the behavior of your system in
terms of raw concerts at a domain model
level and specifying what the system
should do not how it does it so you
whereas unit tests validate how
something is being done typically the
behavior driven development is more
about defining what you want your
systems thing so when we start off with
something like this and start to create
examples from these examples look like
given when then scenarios what cucumber
allow us to do or any specification by
example tool there are actually a couple
of others it allows us to take aspect
and run domain simulations so you know
you see that blue one right there that's
a demain simulation right but let's say
I come up with another puppets in our
ears that do this then this would start
looking this way and I will have a
simulation of the business case in the
domain model and that's what cucumber is
meant to you that's what any
specification by example pool is meant
to do it runs a simulation against you
datamodel if so your domain model and it
validates that the the domain model is
correct that you're maintaining the
integrity of the domain model so let's
say for example I come up here and I say
you know I've got something that doesn't
what that is incompatible with its other
scenario so here I've got a service
should send notification to the user by
mobile phone and then somebody else
comes along and they want a new scenario
and they say we want it to to send only
send notifications to there by email for
some other reason and so the developer
comes along the start to do this and
they realize when they go through the
simulation that there is a contradiction
between the new scenario and the old
scenario and they can discover this
before writing a single piece of you I
or a single piece of a debate on top
take this to the other way of writing
software where people don't take care of
these things or typically happen is you
will only find this out after you've
built out your entire system and the
cost of correcting some mistake like
that is actually really quite high so
ultimately by having practices like this
you also end up developing software for
much cheaper it takes more of an
investment upfront to do this technique
but once you've got it once you've got
it now then it makes things cheaper down
the line and cucumber that helps you run
these simulations these simulations that
will save you money okay so that's
generally how we go about reducing the
cost of bugs way before they even enter
the system what I'm going to talk to you
about now is how to create a an
architecture that allows you to follow
this so you have any questions to post
them now hold comment or come an answer
here will save the Q&amp;amp;A for the end of it
all right I wish I am a button I can
just click and this thing will go away
so we spoke about the domain for the
main model the lessons call that the
domain call and so that the main core
put in what's called is X agonal
architecture so you may you may have
heard a lot about things like em d see I
think I think NBC is actually mostly a
broken concert it works up to a certain
point but after a certain point it stops
becoming maintainable as you softly get
super super complex actually becomes
harder to maintain i'm going to give you
an alternative and then i'll say
white-hot why it's easier to maintain
this way so this thing is called
hexagonal architecture you forget the
main core in the middle and all you have
is the concept of ports it's called X
saginaw actually it's as many sides as
you like so after the main core would
have persistence off the domain or we
might have breast arrest interface that
allows people outside to talk to it
after the main core we might have an
application there but then talks to a UI
so in this looks very similar to MVC and
that's that's when NBC that should
pretty good just a URI talked an
application talk to the main core it's
nicely layered in that way but what this
really does is it allows you to do all
things framework based like in media or
specifically you would have all things
are about collections and what have you
there would be able inside the
application or they may be inside the
infrastructure layer
so there's with this hexagonal
architecture what it allows you to do is
focus all your testing on the demesne
call you do your domain discovery on
here so you have even another port for
doing testing this is where you would do
something like you come up and that
allows you to exercise just as the main
all your business logic is good and then
you have separate concerns for the
infrastructure and for the application
being done outside so that's really the
key to being able to test your
applications to have a very good
separation of concerns principle
throughout by having a hexagonal
architecture that looks like this which
is basically the main is the court and
everything comes off its ports it really
allows you to centralize all your unit
testing on the paths that matter and
audio integration testing on the pastor
Martin so we look at cucumber tests
because they're taking lots of lots of
components together like this they're
actually doing a form of integration
testing and they're verifying the
integrity of your domain model and
therefore allowing you to change over
time add new business rules and make
sure that you're just focusing on
business rules so that separates out the
business rules from the rest of your app
once you have that then you know when
you have a UI for it that's typically
going to bring something like this again
a form let's say and you can have crazy
amounts of unit testing around that form
yeah reactor examples doing an amazing
job of giving custom tools for that at
the application layer you might have to
do things like to go to the
infrastructure pull out the user that's
currently logged in come back use that
user get up get up like the user account
and then run some domain logic on that
user account and then give it back to
the UI by doing these sorts of things
the end up going okay the responsibility
of the application app is just to take
data far they did send it to the domain
bring you back give it to view I that's
all nice and isolated I can unit tests
that the persistence you know maybe
you're just doing some like
founded Mongo stuff just writing
directives of database maybe you doing
something like see urs where you
separating the reads from the rights and
these are doing that all here is part of
your infrastructure in your persistence
and again you can unit test up and you
can you can run integration tests around
that so I like this diagram that the guy
who invented modeling by example created
which is this he says if your
application is like a tree fell and
basically you've got all these different
leaves sorry branches there like your
features and then on the branch it is
yeah well these little lead then the way
that your unit tests and so forth should
operate is that for each leaf you would
have a unit test and so you have unit
tests all around and then for the domain
domain part you actually just have a
bigger the big roots if you like and so
the really cool thing is that by
following the separation of concerns and
by following by using cucumber test your
domain an integration level what you get
for free is this you get the testing
triangle for free because every pot
every single part here has unit tests
you end up with thousands of unit tests
in your application every domain core
unit has unit ups every infrastructure
unit has unittest every single thing as
per unit costs so that's at the that's
at the union party and then for the
service level you start having hundreds
of unit tests because all the scenarios
for all these like main main big groups
they're all being tested at the domain
level you've got hundreds of them you
don't have as many as a unit test
because you're testing different
scenarios within the domain call maybe
you have a few tests as well integration
tests that sort of test in the
infrastructure at the systems together
so these are all counter
hundreds and then finally the really
cool thing is that when you have your
given when then scenarios and you're
using these to test your domain you can
actually repurpose the exact same
specification but instead of going
directly to the domain you can now get
them to go through the UI to talk to the
whole application so for example you
take given the customer bought this car
on so and so they you go straight to the
database and you put the car in there or
is in the domain you just created a car
within the domain when you're what
you're testing the entire act together
you can actually go and put something
directly in the database then you say
when they use a books an appointment and
at the main test you deliver to the main
hall but when you running before a full
end-to-end you say when the user books
an appointment then you go through the
UI to do it and then you say then they
should receive a confirmation and again
you would maybe instrument the email and
get it find out you know if the if the
notification will stem so it's actually
really call it the exact same
specifications that you used to do the
modeling by example you can reuse those
by creating new step definitions to then
go through the entire application and
instead of doing you end up with tens of
those because you can just choose a few
critical path ones let me want to test
so where is the domain you might have
you know 12 different scenarios for a
given feature when you're doing the
end-to-end test you just pick one of
those scenarios and you say this is a
critical path and so the critical path
one ends up being part of the UI tests
and automatically by using this
technique that I just showed you you end
up getting the perfect balance of the
testing trial so the original title of
the talk was how we deliver higher
quality features faster by going through
the domain and figuring out your domain
first making it match the business model
by separating your concerns by putting a
high amount of domain level testing for
your cucumber vests
by sticking unit tests everywhere using
an architecture that allows you to
separate concerns you'll end up with a
very high quality solution because
everybody's looked at it and you'll be
able to go faster because you've stuck
to the testing triangle which puts
thousands of tests here hundreds here
and ends here which means this will run
your sweet your test we will run very
very quickly and you've automated your
entire test suite so combine those two
things together and you get high quality
features faster all right I'll open it
up to questions all right my video is
not popping up I guess I'm not necessary
let's see so the first questions from
Robert how to avoid features creepin so
I think he's talking about like scope
creep maybe like what you know spec i'm
thinking maybe is what rubber means he
confirm in the comment come on ok so i
love that red things good question how
do you stop scoping well what you do arm
is one thing i didn't talk to your out
over here who's going to really just
keen on the tests is you you have a
hierarchy for your b specifications so
any business we're going to have
capabilities capabilities and within
those capabilities they'll have feature
sets and within those feature sets that
have teachers and then underneath here
you have scenarios so capabilities
feature set features scenarios feature
the scenarios these are the specs that
you end up having in like so at all or
cucumber you have all these scenarios
that you run through above here are the
business capabilities so for example in
the in the car manufacturer example
their capabilities would be servicing
sales marketing things like that
when you go to feature sets their cells
might be like you know used car sales or
brand new cars or cars me to order so
there's three different feature sets of
of the sales now within there you go to
a specific feature and you say this
feature for example is about you know
users can search their local market or
maybe a user can search and
international market for an exotic car
so these are like all features of the
feature sets and so the way that you
control scope creep is as a developer or
even just as anyone in the team you say
what capability we're trying to build it
if you're trying to put too many
capabilities into the one feature like
something that I want both something
both from sales and marketing to be in
this feature then it becomes easier to
split that out so this feature is about
one scenario so what you do is you ask
the person that's given you the feature
to set to give you an example and you
want to make that example as simple as
possible represent it in scenarios and
any other features any other scope creep
items that come in what you want to say
is ok looks like that belongs to a
different feature or it looks like that
belongs to a different feature set or
maybe even an entirely different
capability that aren't you a question
yeah I think so he said he clarified
saying something when the client is
asking for features all the time during
the dead process oh I see ok so what you
want to do is you want to get a lockdown
once you're working on a specific
scenario you want to keep that small and
so if it's small enough it means that
you know you lock down your your embark
you're excusing you lock down your own
your development so that you only ever
take a next requirement once you finish
the scenario that your current leader so
yes it's a couple of things it's making
the scenarios as small as possible and
then as a discipline for the team you
have to say I'm currently working on
this feature and so what you need to do
is get in the backlog and say
in scenario one is scenario two is
scenario three this is what's kind of
gameplay if you stop me doing this this
will be throw away and I can take
another one but you know if you give
them this backlog that they operate
within and you make it single file you
see I can only work on one thing at time
and this is the order that happen you
have to work with us and creating a
domain model and specs seems like a
time-consuming process how do they help
me deliver features faster so the
investment up front is definitely not as
quick as going straight into development
all right so when you first create the
space it is definitely an overhead but
actually the investment saves you time
in that it's reducing the amount of
defects you have to fix further down the
line so you create really high quality
specs you go through this process of
separating concerns and so forth when it
comes out the other side and the QA look
at this wall it goes to production the
number of defects that will come back as
a result will be much lower there is
actually a study that shows the people
that actually did domain moly they when
they reduce their bug count that gets to
QA from for by fifty percent so let's
say they used to get a hundred bucks
come to being pointed out I QA they
started using this process or the domain
modeling piece and they that number
huffed which is pretty awesome the other
thing is just to be in standard unit
testing is the same argument needham
unit testing in ads development time but
it saves you a lot of time going forward
because it captures regression bugs and
therefore reduces how much time you
actually spend dude oh yeah and that's
that's kind of way through the question
out there that seems like a common
argument against testing that I hear a
lot and frankly like it was a common
argument i had when i first started
developing like it seems stupid to write
all this testing code when i'm already
writing code in the first place and
seems like I'm doubling my efforts but
in the end I think you're right like
having those tests they give you
confidence later and I think it's likely
true as well with this you know domain
modeling probably gives you confidence
as you move code from idea to production
so it's exactly identical yeah it really
bites bites the problem in two parts you
know the typical defects are gonna enter
Eva Peter before the developments are
called during the development cycle for
a unit testing helps you is stuff that
enters during the development cycle this
domain modeling upfront hope she will
stuff that is before the bottle time
yeah and you know what's interesting too
is like the one place were really
committed to stuff like this that i
worked at was gas light and they even
committed to pair programming which i
think there's been some studies around
that it helps cut down on bugs as well
so yeah yes are approaching zero bugs in
your code and you know the other thing
that makes it quite difficult as always
that the business people that are the
ones that are driving the decisions
they're the ones with the money and
typically what they want to see is just
more features being delivered and if i
take this opportunity to tell me about a
little something we're working on what
you've really got is that over time you
have features being produced and maybe
that feature number is going up over
time sorry in the business is really
happy but then the number of defects
that's been that's occurring is taking
on this much time Tim so if you've got
testing then it levels out this number
because you catch them earlier if you
don't have testing as this number goes
up your ability to deliver features will
start to rapidly drop because you
there's only so much time their
developer can spin now that economy is
not very visible to to business people
because they only see today order order
devil today pretend it's a very gradual
creep for them so they don't tend to see
the cost over time now what
you could give the business a metric
like this but if you can give them a
metric that says is how much you spend
on bugs this week as much you spend on
both this week is how much you spend on
boats fishing when you start giving them
this number they start to go oh wait a
minute this is costing me a lot of money
so how do we fix that well you invest in
testing so we're actually we're actually
building a bunch of products that tell
you exactly this information coming soon
thanks thanks all right I love Robert
Robert awesome what is it good / good x
times the flash pass I'm organized stuff
on a very low level I'm sorry could you
repeat that yeah didn't let go what is a
good team size to deliver fast but keep
organized stuff on a very low level and
then also should the business guys be a
tech to be a part of the Deaf process
right so they should be available for
you at the domain discover instead of
the two questions are lost on backwards
should the business guys be the
debatable dev yes because you will
always have questions especially if
you're working in the middle in the
domains and at that point it can be
available to you because they were the
sooner they can give you a decision the
sooner you can continue that waffle mix
but I think it there the question also
said should there be a tech like a tech
person or someone for me although it's
my absolutely not that's the purpose of
the main discovery to have the what's
called three amigos all the three
discipline you want to put the all the
disciplines required unless there's
somebody from marketing somebody legal
if that's what it involved I mean if
you're doing something if you're
developing a legal based features and
you want somebody a domain expert to be
present so that you can take the domain
from their head and mobile so yeah
that's these these guys should be
involved at the domain discovery but you
know at the technical level 1s
unless what unless they are actually you
know the domain expert like for example
in our field why do under product owner
I'm also a technical person so that had
asked me to people but that's not
necessarily a luxury everybody else and
so the first question is was how're you
what is a good team size to do this so
our team is three people we do this we
do this and it saves us a lot of time
and it's only one marketing so I
strategy guide myself as a product of
non technical person or not and
technical co-founder so it's only us
three and so this technique works from
anywhere from two people up to it can
really scale it can really really scale
because you know when you have a
capability you can have entirely
different teams working on different
capabilities I'm actually pointing at me
know you know so what I was saying
before you have capabilities and
features that you can actually I have a
whole team working on one feature set
and another team working on another
feature set in this thinking scale so
it's from 2 200's so full stack depths
rules yes absolutely they do I mean also
using one technology across this all
these different parts something like me
tio only makes this process easier you
know if you have to have a feature being
delivered by one person doing your
back-end than one person doing your
front end it's possible it'll work
you've got the domains has to protect
you but you know it's it's a pain yeah
yeah so ah can an anchor and go Fabio
ass I saw your comment about space and
ddd how could a vent sourcing help us
deliver high quality features faster so
I rubbed out the middle the middle bar
but the arm anything with space or
actually it's not necessary space is the
space is addressing a specific part
which is a CQ rs.c QRS command query
means summer and what it does is it
separates your reads from you
right and so typically when you're when
you're doing the persistence or that's
where that's where you get what's called
infrastructure leakage that is your
you're writing your domain but then
you're taking pot care of the
persistence within your domain layer as
well and so your infrastructure has
leaked into your domain typically this
happens in something like you know
meteor where you want to be finished
processing a record and then you want a
collection object and you want to save
it so you know sometimes it's just
difficult to try and abstract that you
know you you want to try and keep that
any obligation there so you put in the
application there but it can still get
difficult especially if you have nested
or relational relationships within data
models so then you know your application
they are still in there saving this
object and saving that object and then
maybe go into that object and saving
some other thing insider so seek urs
gets rid of a lot of that hassle because
it's no longer based on a snapshot of
data it is just based on the events so
it converts or your domain events into
real it models them as real events you
know like for example customer purchase
or cut purchase as a car or iPads for
ten dollars from from Josh to me not the
other way because I than ten dollars
from Josh so you know if I transfer from
ten dollars am a hundred under dollars
from Josh to me then that's an event and
that event is what gets stored and over
time you get all these events and so in
order to no way and currently all you've
got to do start from zero and run
through all the events and then that's
where i'm at that's that's the current
state so within see qrs there's also
another mechanism to take snapshots
along the way so that you can fast
forward and then replay events from then
on so with your right model you no
longer have to worry about you know any
like transactions or anything like that
you just write fast and furious and then
it's war is correct because you're right
it's always a writing the current event
but then for your reads you end up with
what's called like eventually correct
eventually accurate come at the exact
terminology anyway in doing so it's
actually more complicated as at the main
model but
you know as you as your application
grows it means you no longer have to
worry about refactoring your data model
constantly what you've got is a history
of all the events that happened and
let's say you even want to
retrospectively go back and change the
way that the task for algorithm worked
you can actually go back in time on your
data and we play all those events so
your maintenance the maintainability of
your system actually increases by using
something like seek urs so initially it
will be hard but I'm talking about like
once you get to complex like once your
application is use six maybe two years
or onwards something like that a large
team has been working on it you know
having something like the separation
between reads and writes is another
level of separation of concerns which is
ultimately going to make your system on
a table nice product versus I think I
covered up but I hover yep all right
well thank you Sam Sam it's a great
target on thank you Cheers yeah all
right ah I put a link in there for the
next talk and click that like that
