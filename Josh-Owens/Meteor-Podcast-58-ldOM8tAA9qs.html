welcome to meet your fans i'm your host
Josh Owens along with my co-host ride
Walker welcome rye what's up it's just
neat huh just the two of us this week
I'm doing good doing get a little
hungover maybe just walk coach a lot of
beer was drunk last night officially
that's like officially drunk right not
just buzzed drunk drunk yeah definitely
yeah i don't know if i should say this
on there but i think i actually like hit
my toe and broke it so nice pretty
pretty drunk that bad yeah yeah so to
say i try to get doubled to join us for
this episode but he said now media
developer won't be showing up on a
podcast for you isn't it gonna be good
oh I'll keep working on him we'll give
you an A for effort yeah alright so this
week we're going to talk about scaling
mixmax ah the a developer's experience
my sequel server and conferences that's
alright so first up I love this article
I couldn't even find a date on it um I
don't know how do you feel about that
like blog dates on blogs I can't stand
it I always go down and try to look at
comments and see if I was a date on the
comment or something yeah it bothers me
I understand why people do it but and
then I'll view source you know and see
if there's something in the like
sometimes the blogging engine will have
a date in the end the meta information
oh that's interesting i've never never
really gone that far with it yeah i have
uh yes i just i don't i don't know when
it's posted ah but i was i was actually
talking back and forth with brad Vogel
over email about coming on and doing
like a meteor club QA because I think
people love asking questions about
scaling and hearing these stories and
Anna so he sent me a link to this blog
post and said like oh here you should
read this to it
probably of interest and I was like oh I
not read this yet and so i put it up on
crater but this this story is awesome
because they talked about how they were
having scaling issues that were using a
blog and i mean obviously they they were
the team that helped push through or
push mdg to have that i log back
pressure environment variable put in
because they were they were dealing with
issues around it but ultimately they
moved the contact stuff to be a micro
service and so like the contact and
porter stuff has its own Mongo database
excuse me and when it kicks off and like
starts importing the contacts that's all
happening elsewhere outside of the
context of their main kind of gmail
plug-in application and you know that's
that's kind of how they easily solved
there there are concerns there and I
don't know like just really goes really
really smart kind of use of breaking off
and I mean I've got to imagine you guys
have a similar architecture to this with
user cycle right yeah and even more
similar to this was was assistant i/o
which I literally had the exact same
problem syncing objects from google
contacts and me and meetings but
contacts was actually our pain point and
yeah it's like it's not just enough for
the for the OP log back pressure thing
to solve the problem like i we would
have been head in the same direction as
we're mixmax went with us like literally
moving into a separate database as a
blog for those heavy activity tables
were not mixed in to the app you don't
need them to be right so i don't know i
guess i guess maybe there's another way
to solve this and what if meteor said
like I don't have you seem possible
maybe because the way it works it'd be
great if you could say like don't
observe this table but a lot of what I
think that's a that's a Mongo thing
right like right now they're acting like
a like a Mongo replica server and
therefore they're just kidding
everything and so it would be nice if
you could just tell Mongo like these are
the only data sets I care about I've got
to imagine maybe something in there
sharding might allow that to happen
but you know I really honestly haven't
played with it but I just had me it's
hijacking replication so it'd be kind of
weird to tell Mongo like don't replicate
this one table let that really breaks
the idea what Mongo does so I I think
that this is the way to go though and I
just move it out it's really not that
hard to move something else not really a
hard to access something through it an
API I did they say what how they access
to contacts afterwards they did not and
that was the the number one source of
kind of comments on crater as well and i
plan to ask him so he's gonna be on May
seventh we're gonna do a media club QA
and so that I look up that'll probably
be the first question I asked him is
like you left out how you getting back
at those contacts now because like is he
just making a DDP connection and like
hoping that the that server will handle
everything better I don't know I'm
guessing he's just doing rest at that
because I think he said like this
separate database maybe didn't say it's
a like whether he's using node to
operate that other process I don't know
yeah yeah well yeah so you asked me
about the reason they're using q
actually is what he said Hugh manages
the work but then you still have what
servers well cute Q's node base so
imagine it's either they're either using
a meteor server or like you hooked in
the meteor or just straight up node and
Q yep we are literally in the final
stages of splitting user cycle into two
pieces as well the back end is straight
node using q were utilizing Redis
heavily as q requires that but we're
even putting some stuff somewhere custom
logic right into Redis via Lua scripts
and yeah it's a but we are still pushing
our data at the end of the day back into
our current Mongo database but we might
switch that too because there's there's
actually a call now people want an API
and the user cycles or like okay where
do we build the API we can build it in
the meteor app or we could just let it
operate separately um that's interesting
yeah so I didn't
on here it hasn't hit crater yet but uh
sashko is actually working on I don't
know if you saw this the yeah the rest
api kind of package that you'll be able
to drop in which he wants to take a
deeper he wants to like hook it directly
into pub/sub and methods because I you
know there to me they're totally
analogous to a rest api and i said this
a long time ago and sam and i started
working on rester but then we just kind
of didn't have enough time to work on it
but idea what kinda car pc like a remote
procedure calls if you just like hook
them straight into those methods you
know so like to me rest has a certain
URL structure but i know i saw his like
the pack pad for that and you basically
push givi meteor method a URL and as
long as you design those in a restful
way um it would be rest right yeah so
rested I don't know like I've been
thinking a lot about this this week been
thinking about writing like a rest
versus DDP type of article actually
because I feel like rest was created
because you know we had HTTP 1.0
specification and you know we've got
URLs and like this is the technology we
had at the time and like these URLs are
structured in a certain way but you know
to me DDP mate maybe makes a little more
sense because you've got the pub sub
side of things right and that's for
getting data out and then you've got the
method side and that's really for
getting data in and I actually like
maybe that those are separated in that
way mmm like you go I mean if you go
look at Twitter's docs you know you've
got all these different kinds of calls
and you got to go into it and see
whether it's a post or a you know put or
delete or you know whatever HTTP you
wear verb it is I don't know yeah yeah I
mean I think we're gonna do a user cycle
API and we're thinking when we present
it will present it as both rest and DDP
which will be sort of unique I mean
obviously the only one you could consume
that is for now of the meteor apps but
it's gonna just exposed be too that's
not entire
a true I I mean you could you could use
asteroid to consume it yeah actually an
iOS as well you know yeah yeah I mean
there are a lot of places you can
consume the DDP now yep that's true so
Herr Lang you can consume it and licks
yeah I think we saw that right yeah yeah
so yeah I think that that's it really
mean it some you know someone might
interpret this as Oh meteor can't scale
right but the reality is it's you know
any system that grows needs to be broken
on microservices you seen happening with
Khedira you see it happening with thanks
max and you know a monolithic platform
should never be isn't it never gonna be
the answer forever you know did you
watch dhh is a keynote talk this week no
but I heard I heard someone mention that
they felt like it looks like they're
he's moving towards me to your type
thinking what what were they saying that
they've got a new thing called action
cable which is like it's not DDP but it
is web sockets so you know of course
like we've we've got to always have this
not invented here syndrome when it comes
to rails but you know they're coming out
with turbo links 3 and action cable and
they're trying to encourage people to
move more towards like I guess
client-side heavier options that they
would have but I just you know honestly
like the world's moved on they've
already decided on ember or angular or
you know something other than that for
rails and it just feels like again it's
gonna be a bolt onto me but well I don't
he was talking a lot about like
monolithic versus microservices and I
feel like I don't know that I imma watch
the whole thing but I definitely got the
feel that he's more in favor of
monolithic and then Shopify like he was
talking about them as well like they're
more in favor of monolithic as well and
that's what a abandon Batman j/s I don't
know well well it's a money monolithic
is great until it doesn't work for you
yeah well that's that's the thing I like
you know with meteor like you can be
monolithic and then all of a sudden
we're all realizing oh holy crap this is
very easy for us to just kind of break
these pieces apart yeah service there's
always a trade-off so i put the trade
off with meteors you get awesome model
of the thing but but the trade-off is if
you happen to be doing some stuff on
back end services that are it's like
churning your database hard um you have
to deal with that you know like that's
that's the trade-off you know how to do
that because because we've kind of had
because it's kind of hacks Mongo all
right so anyway yeah well it does it
doesn't hack Mongo right like but if you
want it to be real time and reactive
that's where you run into trouble yeah
that's what hacks motto the sense that
it says the meteor tries to pretend to
be a replica set rapport them charred
you know that and it's not really that
so you know anyway all right let's move
on to the next story I just realize do
them we don't deep that one yeah we did
I i spelled experience wrong in our show
notes whoops i saw that i was able to
translate that all right yeah yes this
is a nice post on medium by miroslav
Hitler Hitler I'll show yesterday I love
you on purpose why do we try um but
basically he's a he's a server-side
developer and basically you know it
started out it was kind of guy think was
a great article I was reading I was ago
man this could be negative right first
half the first part he just describes um
see wondering what's his uh the daunting
subjects you know that you have to learn
if your server side guy coming into
client-side you learned by HTML and all
the JavaScript stuff and yeah he's got
like six points in here right yep yep
and I was ago man he's gonna be like
saying this is bullcrap right and so and
then building mobile UI all the stuff
but any kind of says like a meteor can't
answers these things and very elegant
ways for me so he went right back
through the same six points and then
finally ends up the article with with
some of the issues he'd ran into so I
actually thought it was a super balanced
article
great article if you're coming from
server side in a meteor check the show
notes on this and meteor jas a
server-side developers experience is the
name of the post yeah I you know I only
read i only got about halfway through i
was making the show notes and just kind
of got sucked into reading it but i like
this this is like a nice a nice long
article um yeah like he talks a little
bit about iron-router and like jquery
and how that stuff works as kind of
gotchas but yeah no no this is this is
good i'm wondering though like he's got
these ads all over this thing yeah i was
just looking to the tubes like what they
are these related but now he is they're
all like angular yeah i wonder if
they're automatic too so yeah that that
is the one weird part is somehow it
thinks it's articles about angular and
its bunch of angular ads throughout it
but not ignore that yeah but definitely
I think worth a read and I'm not like
I'm i'm on the edge of writing like a
jquery and meteor post myself and it's
it's funny to see it brought up here
again uh yeah he talks about how they
have to be carefully thought through and
i don't i don't know like maybe I've
just used jquery long enough that i know
what handlers are there like what events
i can connect on and that kind of thing
like i don't if you're truly new to it
though I mean it's pretty daunting when
you add all those concepts on top of
each other yeah yeah so this I mean this
this came up again the other day to on
reddit someone took it was funny they
actually took my my newsletter like when
you sign up for my my training class I
send you series of emails and one of
them is talking about like why you need
to learn jQuery event handlers and it
gives you a link to like all the
different kinds of events you can
connect off of and he's like well I
don't you know I don't know if I should
use meteor because I hear jquery is
bloated yeah I'm pretty sure maybe you
shouldn't use meteor because you're
worried about bloat
like I'm not saying meteors bloated but
I mean or jQuery jQuery is you know yeah
there are smaller JavaScript libraries
then I mean we're basically gluing a
crap ton of JavaScript together to get a
website going right I don't know I mean
maybe not the truest definition of bloat
but there's definitely the possibility
there and yeah alright so the next story
I thought this was interesting right my
sequel support so uh was it Ben Ben Ben
Ben Ben green num tell um pretty sure he
lives out there in San Francisco maybe
or maybe LA I don't know I've seen
pictures of him at work pop too I think
um but he so he's the one that got the
reactive my sequel working I think you
were were you actually on site for that
def shop I think so yeah yeah so I mean
that was really cool to watch in like
he's continued to work on this and I
don't you know the one thing you don't
think about it when you get away from
Mongo one of the niceties you have is
when you type you know meteor run your
your Monaco server starts for you whoa
and so now he's got a package here that
you install and it's actually hooking it
and firing up my sequel for you when you
start your server and you know it works
exactly like Mongo from the looks of it
I mean it just literally says started my
sequel and you can give it there's a
JSON file that you can use I actually
think maybe this goes deeper than Mongo
can you specify like a Mongo JSON file
for starting Mongo long oh yeah so that
but yeah yeah well you know I say kudos
to been like this is yeah this is
amazing can we just like put a big green
checkmark next to my sequel support now
yeah it's not really what
his my sequel stuff wasn't like reactive
though is like greed or something I
thought I thought the only thing I just
start why start his repo the G stars
repo did you at least do that I did now
all right good um to start right there
no it's a reactive my sequel for meteor
the main the main part and he's got a my
sequel live select mpm module that is
using to kind of make everything work uh
yeah something missing but maybe there
was something missing then that's been
put in now I don't know yeah anyway yeah
that's pretty cool i mean it's it's a
march goes on towards more database
support beyond Mongo yeah yeah so like
I'm glad that mdg hired Justin and you
know put out that fluff piece about how
they're they're gonna use that
technology or whatever and I don't know
they just hired him to work on galaxy um
like let's just let's hire been green
right I don't know why this still isn't
happening maybe he doesn't want to join
thought of maybe maybe but like anyone
to me that's going to sit down and write
a live query implementation on top of my
sequel and now like his work has
inspired someone to work on postgres
actually he did it um he's inspiring
himself yeah come on listen let's fund
this guy get the code reviewed by mdg
make it official and be done yeah not a
bad idea alright let's jump over to
conferences there has not been a meteor
conference yet so it's funny um like
what I mean you know right like I was I
was starting to work on one and I I
talked to Matt over at MDG and said hey
like I really want to do this and
they're like well we really want to do
it too like next year and I'm like well
that's wrong we need and until we were
going back and forth in
we just decided to put it on pause like
they're they're working on getting some
marketing people in and I think things
will maybe ramp up after that so
hopefully um but then like this this
post came out of nowhere like I really
wasn't expecting this someone posted on
crater-like hey I really want to go to a
media conference in 2015 it was like oh
huh the username is alternate Josh no I
know I would never out myself that way
website up if I'm gonna do it oh true
but uh yeah I don't know I thought it
was interesting uh John no mo jo Noah
yeah well i mean i agree there's
definitely a market for it now but if
meteor wants to do it they have a lot of
other like fish to fry like hmm i get
galaxy done i'm sure before they do that
like they're just priority priority wise
it's not at the top of their list like
everything I mean there's it's been that
way all this time with meteor like
there's 10 things we wish they could get
done right now but they can't you know
so it's a people problem right like know
where people working on stuff but then
you have communication problems that go
with thats all right yeah so so yeah I
mean our like lot of the JavaScript
conferences there will be a meteor talk
there but yeah you know I tried to get
one into guess comp and it got rejected
and I'm getting one of the other people
got rejected as well but I'm giving one
at oz con set the one that's the one
o'reilly puts on in portland yeah um in
July I think I'm gonna do my longer
tutorial where I build a like a mobile
mapping application yeah so I think
you're right you know like Robert sent
something out today to the mailing list
like hey if you're gonna give a talk
like here's some stuff you can work off
of and yep you know here's some of the
conference's people are speaking at so
yeah so I think I think that there I
mean again it's convenient because it
fits into their reach towards
constraints but I think I'd rather wait
for there to be like huge like bubbling
over demand for the conference before
pulling the trigger on it so it's fried
2016
I don't know I feel like it's there
today you know I did a quick poll and
just looking at Crater numbers right um
I think he's there today I think you
could do when I'm Tim let's just go and
sell it out yeah um I think a lot of
people fly in for it and I go yeah I
mean I did he look hoot no one was to
miss the first meteor conference if you
were serious about meteor right it's
totally agree totally agree yeah so I
don't know but instead what I've done is
I'm starting to put together well I had
tentatively dubbed at meteor camp but
then I got an email today someone
actually put the meteor camp and they're
building so now it's gonna be meteor
club camp yeah nice we'll see how that
flies ah but I'm uh I'm tentatively
thinking maybe in September will do
something in Indianapolis that's like
it's about a two-hour drive from here
they've got a nice airport people could
fly on 20 I found a place that's that's
got like a hundred acres I think it
could be a lot of fun so I'm gonna see
if I can get that yeah and Matt likes
the idea too so we're gonna see if maybe
we can get some meteor support its
stickers there that kind of thing cool
well that's the last topic so i think we
have for today yep alright so i'm just
gonna say like number one I'm blown away
by the patrons um we hit five hundred
dollars this week that was kind of crazy
I didn't had to happen so fast and
actually um well modulus signed on for a
year of sponsorship so they'll be around
til December but I'm not gonna that the
five hundred dollar reward was no ads so
I'm not going to put any ads on any of
my other content and um you know we're
just gonna I'm not going to seek any new
ads as well which I was actually gonna
do a couple weeks ago but you know now
that I've got the support from all you
guys that's pretty amazing and I just
want to say thank you it's been awesome
and the slack chat rooms been awesome as
well so uh yeah be sure to check out my
jealous because they are an awesome
sponsor modulus town I oh and if you
look into get in the slack chat room
it's just a patreon patr yo n-com /
meteor club so cool alright man I'll
talk to you next week yeah yep this
video has been a meteor club production
