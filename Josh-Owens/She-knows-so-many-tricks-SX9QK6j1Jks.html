the hoff any project 1 by night question
from Twitter robert lowe asked what kind
of razor and how much shaving cream do
you use so I'm gonna assume you don't
mean my face but maybe my head so I use
a head blade would recommend the six
blade version much much better and then
they they just make a shaving cream like
it's just it's like shaving your face
it's not a lot honestly and then I got
another question the other day on
Twitter about like how to make your head
shiny I actually don't do anything to
make my head shiny um so I don't know I
guess just be oily I don't think it's
shiny I don't know but they do make
headblade also makes like a lotion you
can put on afterwards to make it shiny
or you can get a lotion to make it not
shiny depending on what you want this is
hot again today and I'm out here again
late at night it's actually quite nice
now kind of cloudy no dog she's going to
do an easy run
