welcome meteor fans i'm your host josh
owens along with my co-host by walker
welcome back where I hey what's up dude
yeah you're in your vegas this week
weren't you yeah Sin City yeah we went I
went down to the strip for the first
time I had never been to Vegas and oh
yeah I've never been either yeah so we
were to tech conference though and old
Vegas and so I'm like it's like I should
at least walk around the real Las Vegas
you know for a couple of hours so i did
that went in and I dropped a $25 down on
black and roulette double money so I
doubled my money in Vegas at the
Bellagio you know I walked out with
money so 25 bucks hello yeah roulette is
a addicting when you're winning anyway
when you're winning yeah all right uh so
this week this is the the meteor club
edition so we were like I let I let the
slack chatroom put the list together and
and then we realized like everybody that
submitted these stories they're all in
this lack chat room as well so it's kind
of funny so we're going to talk about
mobile apps with meteor uh s alerts I
guess maybe s alerts wasn't one but um
ama with sashko file organization and
meteor security alright so let's get
into it the first story comes from
Stefan whole house I teased him
yesterday I'm yeah on the Q&amp;amp;A with his
name but uh so basically this article
walks you through how he made a magic
8-ball application and I mean he really
takes it in depth and he shows you the
CSS and he's got some animated gifts
showing you how he's trying to figure
out how to build things
yeah yeah actually this uh this one's in
the set Safari is that that's chrome
actually yeah yeah but he shows like how
he's playing with the circle sizes and
all that kind of stuff and and then he
installs the shake ad on so you can like
shake the phone it'll give you an answer
and then like this is the crazy part
right he starts going through like how
you prepare your app for distribution
and this is probably one of the more
frustrating pieces of getting a mobile
app out the door is like dealing with
all this cruft that you have to do in
Xcode and getting your keys and you know
getting your app approved like all this
crap like he's still I think right now
waiting I just loaded the link let's see
if it if he's got the link updated nope
he's still waiting for the App Store to
approve him so turning on google play
but essentially he's just built a meteor
app and you know he's used the cordova
stuff and he's built both the android
and the the iphone version and he just
walks you through like everything down
to like you know putting in the icons
and everything so mm-hmm it's a good
article very very deep yeah i love that
he goes into like the problems of
building and a half and dealing like
including the shake package which is you
know dealing with cordova you know using
some real cordova functionality so all
the way down to like building an app
that isn't just a hello world right cuz
that's pretty boring that section would
be really boring with just a hello world
so yeah gets into like you know the some
of the issues around that but but I i
agree with you there's half articles
about all the crap that happens after
you're done building the app which is
not very well documented out in the wild
as much yeah definitely I you know I
just like god I wish this article would
have been a week earlier cuz last last
Friday I was doing all this crap you
know like well blend ullin up for the
first time and send it on a
a ad hoc you know IPA file and trying to
figure out all this crap i had to call
Apple three times it was terrible
experience the answer yeah oh yeah they
totally answer they're really nice when
you call them and yeah I don't have to
be you're not on hold too long so smart
not horrible it's just more the fact
that you got a call you know you know
and uh you know he also shows some of
the icons stuff too I'm wondering if he
used some kind of Photoshop preset or
some kind of website to generate the
icons i used i found a website where you
just upload the icon and then it spits
out all the right sizes for you for
putting in itunes or into Xcode that was
uh that was annoying that felt like that
took an hour crazy anyway so I like if
you're thinking about doing this I would
highly recommend checking out this
article totally worth it you know
probably take you like 10-15 minutes
reads you should read it yeah and
probably only like an hour to go through
and and really learn this stuff if you
want to type type in actually build a
real project probably really help you
understand the mobile process I need to
do this yeah so alright cool let's let's
talk about s alert or simple alert okay
there's just called sis alert salur yeah
shop smart shop s alert so this is a
meteor package that lets you that gives
you like animated alerts like you know
things that pop in the bottom left
corner top right and then you know let's
say you pop another alert how they
interact with each other so he's got the
base package and then affect packages I
like this you know it's an example of
how to break your project up into lots
of little packages rather than one big
monolithic package it went along with
some good sample code on how to make it
happen and demos so yeah I think it uses
CSS animations to get those like
different effects too so like you get
the
like it'll wiggle up if you use jelly or
it looks like it pops out of a bottle if
you use the genie effect oh cool yeah
yeah so Josh and I were talking briefly
before this call that uh we were talking
about how like I'm using polymer so I
have this uh you know a little paper
alert thing happening automatically or
it's coming from polymer and just
interesting I'm like so used to using a
you know kind of a rich extra library
that I forget about the fact that you
know rom meteor you have to have these
kind of things yeah you get a lot of
components from polymer right yeah yeah
and so this is like maybe a different
route if you're not going with polymer I
think this package is a great example of
building a UI component that's reusable
in a lot of places and it's not even
like this one's not dependent on any
kind of library either you know you
don't have to have bootstrap installed
you get this guy so it's kind of
interesting I might I might give it a
try be curious to see what it looks like
on uh meteoric I guess that's where I've
been spending most of my time lately oh
gosh i guess and he's got alert so i
just haven't had to use him yet mmhmm
yeah i don't know i don't check that out
either like i said i bet i've been ever
since i started using polymer it's been
one project since then so I'm starting
to get done while all the new stuff yeah
yeah I don't know I I kind of feel the
same way like I've just been in media
worth land first yeah for five months
now so I haven't really looked at
anything else pick your poison right
yeah definitely I mean there's some so
many you know I mean even like you know
polymer react I mean there's so many
different ways you can go with this
stuff so yeah I don't know kind of kind
of waiting I don't know maybe that's a
good lead-in to this this story with
sashko uh you know if you if you missed
it but like that's that's a bummer but
you can go read it all now so it's the
first ever ask me anything on crater
Sasha
grave suggested that hey one or two try
doing like a mas on there that seems
like a perfect thing to do on on crater
I think the the experience could be a
little bit better with we found some
bugs particularly with the like the
scoring apparently if there's downvotes
that will drag something down below
something that's just been outvoted so
like the base score it was showing the
up vote instead of a base score which
the baseboards like the uploads and
downloads combined well we kind of
confusing because like Nick win tidge
had a highly uploaded post and it was
like in the middle of the pack um but
you know there were a lot of great
questions in this thing one theme that I
kept seeing over and over is you know
when are we going to see this thing
official or you know like what's the
next official database or can we
officially get more interchangeable
front-end you I so I think it looks like
I mean sashko did a great job another
one was router to there was a big debate
about the router like when are we gonna
see an official router um and so I think
he just he's got like the the top of
voted thing is talking about you know
what what's an official package mean and
um you know what what what can we do
like can we get like a seal of approval
from mdg and go through an audit process
and and maybe it's not official but it's
it's like officially approved right and
that's kind of interesting to me and
that's that seemed to be an interesting
theme going on um yeah I don't know I
there's just I mean there's so much in
here there's 129 comments to read I
would highly recommend people
interesting back in rails rails line
there was this obviously the post is
this is awesome for crater right this
was a cool thing I I didn't get to
participate in it because that was well
the days of the conference and I
I did get to see it like a day later
right through the entire thing some
awesome stuff in there yeah but um as
far as the official packages thing you
know which was a big topic on this thing
mmm I just think that the problem with
anyone anointing any package is that
that changes over time you know so i can
say today that I routers best right you
could say that's the most popularly used
but it's flowroute or better you know
like well you know what's interesting is
I think as meteors changed so like I've
I've specifically taken the mindset of
not using weight on and not using
iron-router for managing that stuff and
just using template level subscriptions
right I actually feel like it's it's
been a little bit better to create
everything and it's a little bit cleaner
and you know I find myself using
template helpers more rather than data
context and all that kind of stuff and I
just think overall it seems to be a
cleaner experience in my router file is
much much tinier and um yeah I don't
know so you know now that that people
have explored new ideas maybe
iron-router is not as interesting
anymore yeah well so like the
interesting like I'd remember there's a
site called Ruby toolbox and so Ruby
toolbox I just happen to click into that
again I remember it's like if you're
trying to figure out so i clicked into
rails comments like what is the one of
the most what's the best package for
rails comments right now and like the
number one choice says currently and i'm
currently unmaintained you know so it
obviously did well it's something called
juvia you know so then you know do you
go with that or do you go with something
down the chain you know so I think that
it's just such a liquid decision on
what's the best package for a given
thing especially is like the things
change if you said what used to be
routing now is broken down now you do do
subscriptions and templates you know and
I for one think that meteor is does not
need to keep annoying official packages
like just deal with the fact that you
have to do a little bit of research to
find the right thing for what you're
trying to do for the time you're doing
yeah I
I kind of get it with the router and
with the database stuff like these do
feel like pretty core concerns but at
the same time like if Slava puts out his
rethink TV package and it's not in core
I'll probably still play with it look at
rethink DB see if the the performance is
interesting and I don't know i mean like
he's played a lot with the he's worked a
lot on on the Mongo stuff so I what's
the difference it's just who it's
released under it's either part of the
meteor meteor repo as a package or it's
part of some other repo and released on
atmosphere instead so yeah the one thing
I think that could be better is if
atmosphere had categories and that's a
big ton of work for somebody to
categorize five thousand things I think
you know honestly though I think if you
provided at least high level categories
most of the people would self sort it
and I'll use Twitter as an example right
the interesting thing is if you go look
at Twitter lists you actually if like I
can I can pull all the lists at people
that put you in and I can figure out
just looking at similar words which one
is which ones apply to you and my guess
is like meteor or analytics or something
would be something that that would pop
up in your list and I think you know
package maintain errs would be the same
way they would they would take the time
to do it yeah yeah so you know and then
the other submit a pull request me yeah
its atmosphere oh yeah we do that no we
can't do that for the end of it what's
wrong I think wrong with atmosphere
right now too is that it just shows like
I searched for router and I routers
first it's got hundred thirty-eight
thousand downloads 339 stars like it'll
never get knocked off that block you
know uh maybe five years from now
something can come along and until you
get a hundred forty thousand downloads
you came and deal with this history so
probably need to have some sort of
recency in here say they do a little bit
so they look at the last time a release
happen and
I look at supposedly I mean again we
can't we can't look the code to
understand the formula but my
understanding was they look at like open
issues and that kind of thing for
waiting you know the different results
and maybe should show that score you
know and maybe explain how it works yeah
or yeah yeah like break it down right
like weird javascript land like give us
a handy tool tip that shows us like your
the different components and here's how
it's scored on those components and you
know yep maybe there'd be a lot of
transparent yeah I don't mean to I mean
obviously I think atmosphere is awesome
but I'm just trying to think through the
problem a better way of doing of solving
the problem vs mdg having to anoint some
of these five thousand packages as
official and then maintaining that over
time just seems like a help page thing
it feels Microsoft dish to me let's not
do that yeah I saw I saw a picture the
other day of Lake sashko holding up a
certificate and like a USB plug that
they got from Microsoft so they could
officially release meteor as a packet
like a sign package and I'm like
terrible terrible doggles for ya no
that's a bad idea yeah anyway let's go
next topic file organization with meteor
is a medium posed by vianney nick wrote
a lot of Seth you know say that name I
don't ace TMP maybe that's what he goes
by and slack that's what I know a really
good post on you know just on how to
organize your files with meteor you kind
of threw out three possible solutions
solution a is just keep it flat you know
like you get when you get in them a new
empty project if you have a small meteor
product you don't necessarily need to
create a whole lot of structure right
like you don't need to adopt the same
architecture for your code for a tiny
product is a big one so that's one of
the options the other option is to break
all your coat up into packages for
example the way telescope does
and and I've heard other media
developers even that are building
internal products they'll just like make
packages for every little feature which
is which can lead to some reusability
for yourself and then finally the third
option is just kind of keeping them in a
group called the heat it was calling it
module oriented so just keeping similar
you know creating a folder that's for
example like he has your bank I don't
know what that one bank will pain but a
folder that has all the functionality
it's similar to I guess a package which
is not actually in the package directory
problem with putting stuff in the
package of directories you actually have
to do a little bit of extra work you
know that include those files one of the
interesting things we were looking at
how we figure out this the answer this
one yet Josh you're talking about he's
totally right he's right okay so it even
so both Josh and I thought this that the
client directory and server directly was
just a top-level thing but really any
directory named client or server no
matter how far down in your hierarchy
only can include on the client service
those special directory names are
clickable through the whole chain right
and honestly so uh so publix a top-level
private is a top level well um client
compatibility doesn't say whether it's
top level but I'm guessing that's top
level and any any directory name test is
the same way I feel like they've changed
this maybe um but libs the same way so
anywhere you put a Lib directory it's
gonna also load first so another thing
to keep in mind there ah but the one the
one place this does not apply is in the
packages right so you actually have to
specify which files get loaded and which
environment they get loaded and it
doesn't matter what folder you put them
in I'm pretty sure that's still the way
it is yeah that's cool yeah but you know
it's interesting because the key
referenced my old article and he said um
you know at my argument was to follow
rails conventions
cuz I've used them for nine years well
and that wasn't a good enough convincing
argument for him I i think my argument
and maybe I failed at getting it across
is actually that I prefer um not modular
base but route based organization of
files so you know if my URL is going to
have that that prefix in it right so
logically like I prefix everything so
like I'm working like if I'm working on
a blog I'm gonna have like a blog prefix
on it if it's gonna live somewhere like
that and then I put all those files into
a folder called blog and his argument
was that you end up with too many
folders and too many files I think was
more the files like having to open up
all those different files to change
something and I don't to me that sounds
like an editor problem not a final
organization problem um I love them so I
don't you know it's just me on a
keyboard opening a file don't have tabs
cluttering up my view necessarily I just
look at code but you know I don't I
don't to get into an editor or um but no
and then the other point too is that I
should really read a post on this I've
really really been into writing
collection helpers and I feel like it
really mimics the whole fat models idea
that kind of came from rails and I think
that's cleaner to me rather than
necessarily writing a bunch of helpers
to do things for you you can just write
like template helpers you can write
collection helpers and they're reusable
in more spots right um and to me I have
some pretty crafty gross-looking data
structures and you know I've wrapped all
those behind collection helper methods
and with coffeescript like I've even
used the the ? operator to make sure
that I can drill down and I'm not gonna
throw any errors but you know he
mentioned like
go to three places to change something
if you do it in the collection helper
and you keep that in your collection
file that's just one place you go you
know same thing with the methods and all
that stuff like I try to keep all that
in one collection file that pertains to
that collection and I think that's a
little cleaner now say to like the other
thing I have a I mean one of my features
use multiple collections so I think you
might even have a time where it's give
its hard decision I'm where to stick the
collection forgiven feature you know or
which which which you know which Mongo
collections belong to a feature um you
know like and I know if there's some
edge cases there now I guess the
committee I just dies don't feel like
the features in collections map on top
of each other for me exactly yeah I tend
to agree but I just have a collections
folder and that's where all that stuff
goes yeah so I kind of like having
models outside so i guess i'm saying i
like the rail structure to and that's
right because i'm a rails previous rails
developers oh we train our brains a
certain ways but yeah it's a i think
either way you know it's like you have
to find code sometimes it's not where
you would like for it to be because like
this is like a cube of code it's not a
flat structure a code you know yeah so
yeah yeah I would agree i mean again I
think I said it at the end of my article
and he posted this in the media club /
chat room he's like sorry Josh I'm like
I you don't have to apologize like you
know the thing is like pick whatever
structure works for you document it
right that's the key piece here document
what you're doing in the readme and a
good developer because there's gonna be
some guy coming behind you or gal and
it's just it's not gonna be a pleasant
experience if they don't understand how
you've done things and if you document
it and you kind of follow some standard
it's gonna be easier in the long run
yeah that's a document and find at least
one other person in the world that
agrees with you or if you're the hiring
manager just you know clearly they want
to work with you right yeah true but
it's good to have like at least one more
person say oh yeah this is awesome I
would use this or I'm using
yeah before you know adopting for
yourself because you do want it to be
something that's intuitive for the next
guy behind you yeah all right last
article uh so this one's from Pete Corey
I don't know if he goes by Peter Peter
uh will go with feet um he's put out
some good stuff he just joined the the
meteor club / chat room the other day
too and he had an article a couple weeks
ago I think it was he the last week or a
couple weeks ago where he talked about
like um making sure you run meteor
checks on your params and how if you're
taking some parameter your Mongo queries
like that could be very very dangerous
because people could pass in instead of
a string that you're assuming they could
pass in an object that was a good
article and this is kind of along the
same lines so um you know he was he was
looking over an application for a new
client I'm assuming because he said you
know security in the wild this is like
when I was looking at at a client
project and there were just security
bugs abound and so funny the publication
was taking a user ID and then they were
checking to see if that user idea was an
admin and if so then delivering like
user records so if you can guess the
admin ID you can get any user record you
want well that seemed pretty bad um and
so you know he he pointed that out and
then on top of that he was using
Adrienne lanings meaty roles package and
it actually takes its own you can pass
either an ID or a user object and so he
showed an instance where you could have
a subscribe call and instead of passing
an ID he just passes an object that has
roles admin on
and boom you know you're in there well
and so he just shows you instead you
should rely on this dot user ID and your
publication so again like that
publication is the heart and soul your
application um you need to make sure
that that's where you're paying
attention to security yeah that's pretty
cool I'm reading that code right there
yeah yeah check the user IDs on the
server yes yeah yeah never never assume
things coming from the client or okay is
this I mean this is almost tantamount to
sequel injection I don't know well yeah
yeah if it's a you know i mean it that's
the tricky part about anything news like
this is this gonna be security risks and
i don't think we've shaken them all out
of meteor quite yet so yeah I'm I've
started working on a checklist actually
to like hope people run through like
what where you should look and what
steps you should take to make sure your
apps somewhat secure I think that'll be
a good tool to get out there for people
because i think you know just not a lot
of people think about this stuff well
and you should if you definitely be
careful yeah so uh i think next week
we're gonna have a crazy show um I I
haven't had a chance to watch the era
notas meteor hack show he did with
Justin but I hear like a lot of the
galaxy beans got spilled there so that
should be super interesting and just
today someone posted meteor has no
future I was talk about that next week
because Ben his name wrong the bin that
works i want to say Neuman ben newman
who works for mdg has been pulling out
futures and replacing the promises for
es6 and es7 and I think that'll be super
interesting to talk about as well once
we can digest it a little more yeah and
just an honorable mention Colby Colby
cheese from the chat room put up a
interesting article I'll put this in the
show notes as well and he talked about
publish and subscribe for for newbies is
what he called it and I kind of walks
through how publications working that
kind of thing so if you're new to meteor
I think this is a decent article to read
to kind of wrap your head around now it
works mmm yeah all right cool good talk
talk to you next week yeah definitely
all right thanks for tuning in guys and
again remember modulus denio sponsor
this week we did hit a new level but the
modulus has sponsor for the year so
they'll be the sponsor but no new
sponsors and if you want to join the
slack chatroom patreon PA Preon com such
media club and yeah it's awesome it's
growing so alright man talk to you next
week dry say man later this video has
been a meteor club production you can
