remote cough given to a live audience in
February 2016 this video was made
possible by sponsors like modulus I oh
okay grow calm and space dojo calm if
you would like to find out more
information about upcoming conferences
be sure to go to conf crater on Io and
put your email in the form that pops up
in the lower left corner enjoy the video
welcome back crater fans to the crater
podcast no we're not doing that today
but we do have my Creator podcast
co-host been Strahan welcome Ben we
can't hear you dude you broke your mic
this is funny one all right welcome
everybody my name is Ben Strahan today
we're going to be talking about
something amazing we're going to be
talking about finding the holy grail of
MVP stacks and this is a different kind
of presentation than the others the
others are more technically based and I
figured man you guys need a little break
up I need to get some excitement in your
life and all that stuff and so I'm here
to offer the excitement I'm going to
keep my shirt on I promise but uh I do a
lot of different things for those of you
who don't know my story I I've started
programming java script about a little
over two years ago and calm a pretty
long way I feel like and I've come that
far because I failed in the past and I'm
going to share with you guys some things
that I do whenever I take new projects
on and I carry this these stuff on in
life and I carry it on okay grow and I
carried on
with what I do it Josh for those of you
who think you're in the wrong conference
room you might be right because josh
didn't do the SEO correctly and there's
some nasty google searches if you go to
look for this show i'm not going to say
what the title the other one is but you
know if you guys are looking for that
then just let me know I could change up
my slide I I kind of kind of made a plan
B if you guys really wanted that so
anyway Who am I my name is Ben Strahan
I'm a developer designer okay grow if
you don't already know uh right now I'm
going to totally like take advantage of
this show and be like hey anyone who's
not following me on Twitter should
follow me right now yeah underscore
benster or I'm sorry Abby wants to call
underscore benster it's really low dash
benster that's what I that's what it is
anyway so what qualifies me to like talk
about this stuff in the past I did start
ups before I even was a programmer I did
startups and I would hire programmers
and have ideas and all stuffing I
learned a lot of tough lessons on all
the projects that failed and this little
methodology imma be sharing with you is
kind of like what I came to and and has
been pretty successful last year I've
also come from the corporate world I've
done plenty of internal MVPs and agile
projects in the corporate setting which
is very fun it's a whole nother area of
navigation and I work with starts every
day okay grow I love my job okay grow i
love the team I love the clients that we
have and I love that I get to be
involved in all the different aspects
not just the programming of the clients
that we work with and I believe that
everything should be an MVP everything
in life
everything and programming everything
even my experiments with like the shows
that I do and that's what I'm going to
get into next oh I have to give this
disclaimer if you guys haven't heard me
talk before you just got to know that if
I say awesome cool cool very cool um yo
man much love dude totally broski all
that stuff I am actually an excellent
speaker because this is all planned
carefully carefully planned out for you
guys so any or a or all I'm doing that
on purpose because I'm an expert just
want to let you guys know okay so a
shameless promotion so this is the cool
things I really like right now that I'm
part of and you guys should all figure
out what they are and go google them
after the show i am a developer okay
grow we do media consulting and we love
it we help startups and enterprise and
it's amazing it's a great team and we do
great stuff I help Josh on the crater
podcast and space dojo it is amazing
working with Josh he has been a mentor
in so many ways to me in the last two
years and a lot of people don't know
this but I got started in meteor
simultaneously with getting discovered
media from Sasha and doing mastering
meteor with Josh and the rest is history
i also have a new venture with sashko
stabilo from mdg we do a podcast called
transmission you guys should get on that
if you guys have it yet it's amazing
we're going to be airing or we're going
to be recording show number six in the
power after this show and it's going to
be sweet because now we're going to be
get an official mdg support i'll be
interviewing ben newman today of the
interviewed sashko of course and we have
Matt two burglars joining us as well and
I'm going to really figure out what's
going to go on with the open source
world and and how open meteor is going
to be in the future and you know how we
all can get a lot
and kumbaya and have fun hugs kisses
maybe not kisses that's awkward follow
me on Twitter again dude come on I'm
marketing like crazy let's get into this
show so what is an MVP what do I think
an MVP is MVP for me is kind of like a
mix uh I'm going to tell you what the
official definition is so like Eric Ries
does it pretty well he says the minimal
Viable Product is that version of a new
product which allows a team to collect a
maximum amount of validated learning
about customers with the least amount of
effort and that's cool there's a few
things that I differ from them and I
don't really care if I'm right or wrong
I just want to be productive that's the
bottom line so I he says in there for
new products and I think everything
should kind of be MVP or agile pretty
much I would use that stuff
interchangeably and you guys probably
might like yak why's this guy talking
those two things are totally different
but anyway I believe that they're the
same each iteration you should treat as
a minimal Viable Product you know each
features that you're going to be getting
out you should take the principles from
MVPs and your sprints and integrate it
all in your decision making and what
you're going to build and how you build
it how you execute and how you bounce
back from from mistakes or our lessons
learned so when I talk about MVP I'm
talking a little bit about a mix of
agile and MVP and it's for all things
forever you never stop making MVPs even
if it's like a really old project so why
am i given this talk I kind of like went
ahead and said I'm giving this talk
because I love it and I want to share
with you guys some of the success things
that I've kind of iterated on and what
is a proven strategy for me going
forward in all things life but the big
reason why I'm doing it is because I
work with startups every day and I see
the same mistakes happening over and
over
reading your comments I shouldn't read
your comments I can't multi-task anyway
I want to share with you guys like some
of those basic stuff and a lot of it
you'll know and I'll and I hopefully
there's like one or two tidbits that
you're really going to enjoy and you're
going to integrate in your life and
let's like go forward man let's do this
so minimal Viable Product a lot of
people think oh and MVP is like you know
get a piece of crap thing out there and
I got something to show for my time and
hey it's out there like hey I got a
landing page as my MVP that's not your
MVP a minimal Viable Product it covers
all these things but the minimal amount
of it so it needs to be delightful it
needs to be usable it needs to be
valuable and needs to be feasible and
you need to accomplish that and each
iteration you're going to be slicing off
another one of this I don't know what it
is looks like us bluesnap rag anyway so
what I want the bottom thing is is pick
a good stack so that you could do
limiting refactoring a lot of people and
Eric Ries has talked about MVPs and said
you know even like static HTML and CSS
websites that just like totally fake
what you're doing he would consider that
MVP and I think all of us on this call
wouldn't consider that an MVP at all our
MVPs would definitely be probably
incorporating meteor create and then
going from there and I would I would
agree with that I think it should be a
little bit more robust I don't want to
be completely refactoring or creating
new apps for each version of my MVP as
it like goes to next level so I i would
say you start your MVP you don't do a
crappy job you start it with a stack
that you're going to be iterating on
and growing but i'm going to give some
boundaries around it because you can go
totally crazy and it can mess you up
pretty bad a little disclaimer I'm still
figuring all the stuff out so most of
the stuff that I'm talking about is just
BS so I hope you enjoy the rest the show
well I talk about stuff that might not
be true so the goal the end goal is to
become a multi-discipline shrewd
developer so let's dive into it I want
to kind of share with you guys what that
means so who just talked for developers
that are making greenfield and useful
projects that's where i'll be talking to
you today if you're doing a tech startup
if you're doing a business app line of
business app if you're a consultant all
this stuff we're going to be talking
directly to you but the overarching
topics that we'll be talking about you
can actually apply to anything in life
and that's cool thing about this talk
multi-discipline developers are
exceptional developers and this is what
i mean by multiple discipline not only
do you need to be technical and be a
technical lead on the project if you
want to be that technically but you also
need to be a project manager you also
need to be a product manager and you
also need to be aware of marketing and
i'm going to dive into why all those
things are important and why you wanted
to try to be an exceptional developer
with all of those features or I don't
know definitions of yourself I can't
think of the word you guys are making me
so nervous I gotta stop here before step
one this is so hard this is so hard
because every show that i do i always
have feedback or talking to someone and
I'm talking to myself this is bogus I'm
never gonna do this again Josh just
kidding you're okay bad it's ok you can
I feel so much better with you chiming
in all right haha and this is this is a
great lead-in for step number one so the
thing that I'm gonna be sharing with you
guys right now is empathy
and you need to be an investigator of
people's opinions you need to live and
die by people's opinions and it's
perfect on what I what I was just
describing like I'm not getting any
feedback on this conversation and I'm
too bad with multitasking that I can't
read the comments on the side so it's
hard because I live off of feedback step
one is step one you don't even talk
about the stack you don't want to talk
about technical stuff that you're going
to do first thing you do is you
investigate people we're going to dive
into what that means you got to identify
who the stakeholders are this is
paramount and you got to treat each
person different so when you start a
project these you're going to have a
handful of these not all of them inside
or what you need to be aware of for the
project that you're coming on you have
yourself you have co-founders possibly
investors you definitely have customers
and users might be separate from
customers you have your team of
developers or consultants at your hiring
and you have your family you have your
spouse you know they they play a big
role and if I missed any then just fill
in the blank then it's so nervous I'm
not nervous I'm till like a cucumber
you're doing good whoops once cucumber
shoot i said cucumber okay you need to
identify these people because they each
want different things and you need to be
episodic to to each one when you're
planning out your MVP sprint MVP means
to me it means to deliver the minimal
acceptable features for each one of
those stakeholders in each sprint so how
are we going to do that we're going to
identify who belongs in each group and
you really need to identify that a lot
of people start a project without even
identifying who the stakeholders are and
I think it's paramount that's like it
your projects like almost
teetering on failure in step one if you
don't determine who these who these
people are get each group involved in
day one so what that means is you got to
pitch each group and note the feedback
if people are going to not like your
idea or they're not sold about it or
there they look hesitant about it you
need to ask them why why are they not
buying it and then go from there as you
iterate on your features as you're
building MVP you need to show these
groups what you're doing and take the
criticism and each one's going to be
different as you get the criticism you
need to then build your next iteration
on what the features are going to be
involved in that sprint and then ask
them how it should be prioritized you're
you're basically cutting yourself out of
planning the app and this is good like
you you have a vision but you need to
have other people tell you how to
execute it constantly be interested in
why they are thinking how how they're
thinking and this helps you build
empathy and what you you're building and
you get to then figure out the long-term
path of things if you guys are I'm
guessing that most of people who are
listening are aware of like mdg and and
meteor and in the relationship between
mdg and the community and you could
probably see this list and you could you
could identify like where maybe mdg
didn't do one of these things and you
can identify the feelings that it caused
and so this is why those feelings are
are in our community right now and the
reason why this is step one is because
it's tremendously important when picking
the tech stack to plan out what is right
what is really needed
um it's going to affect everything going
forward so that's why it's step one
really quick I want to go through some
examples investors what is it important
to investors well investors want to see
their money spent well one thing that
sets work pop apart from other startups
is that they develop stuff extremely
fast and high quality so that is awesome
for their investors it instills a lot of
confidence in the work pop team when
their investors are seeing everything
that's being kicked out and work pop
attributed a lot of the early success to
meteor and they are able to iterate and
build features quickly because the
meteor and that is awesome that's
something that your investors want the
investors also wants to see that you
really understand your problem and by
investigating these things then you know
that you're going to be on board and
investors going to understand when you
explain to them why you're making
certain decisions what's important to a
developer developers want to have cool
things to work with they want to be
challenged but not too much they want to
feel like they're accomplishing stuff so
they're different than the investor
investor wants to have things pop out
really quick high quality something to
show and be able to group traction
developers want to be challenged they
want to have fun they want to build
their resumes they want to work on an
awesome team and then what your users
and client want the clients want are
totally different than both of those
people and so you really need to be
taken each one into account and you have
a successful MVP or a sprint if your
accounting for every single one of them
so step to avoid vermin traps do not be
a yak cowboy you do not want to be a yak
shaver you do not want to be the X
shaver you keep that tent
you do not want to be a yak shaver no
look at those Cowboys do any of them
have a macbook they don't so don't be
one of them javascript fatigue guys it's
self-inflicted and unnecessary and I'll
tell you why because you guys are in
control of what you want to learn okay
we don't need to be building stuff with
akma script 2015 we don't need to be
building stuff with react we don't need
to be worrying about relay we don't need
to worry about that stuff we choose to
worry about that stuff and by first I by
first identifying that then all of a
sudden fatigue kind of goes away and
you're kind of in control of your own
destiny so there is no one telling you
that you need to build with the latest
stuff you know what you need to do you
need to have an exciting development
community and developers happy to work
on your project that's it for excitement
like if you achieve that you did it that
doesn't necessarily mean that you need
to have react you can work on blaze
that's plenty exciting you know you
could work on you could use flow router
reactor out or whatever it doesn't
matter as long as it's exciting to work
on JavaScript fatigue is just and it's
an empty word it's fake it's all in your
head don't burn me at the stake for
saying that it's so true so what to care
about as a developer these are things
that you should really care about when
you're picking your stack when your
developer pick an easy-to-understand API
pick something that you're familiar with
it's the fastest way to build features
that way developers will be happy your
investor will be happy get something
that has a robust package system so that
you could show progress you could show
features really quick and you didn't
have to build it hooray
you used an awesome package like I love
auto forms I love simple schema it takes
a little bit of time getting up to speed
with auto forms but once you do like man
things are kicking out like crazy now
I'm going to be sad to see it go I'm
going to totally build a replacement and
react if if father isn't one when they
get there and you guys can share in the
comments if there's something you need
to find something a stack that has
plenty of developers that are ready to
work I love meteor because it's
javascript-based there's plenty of
JavaScript developers and it's easy to
pick up you need to have something has a
clear path for all devices mobile
devices desktops and web obviously
something has baked in security so you
don't have to build it yourself Limited
startup boilerplate needed you don't
want a yak shave all day trying to get
webpack going who gives a about
that stuff you need a great community
with plenty of answers and training
specialized consultants experts
available decent documentation and the
possibility to scale the possibility
scale don't worry about scaling right
now okay just that there's a possibility
you can kind of do it so what to care
less about what not so much what not to
care about what what to care less about
mid to massive scaling who gives a crap
about your view layer just pick
something that that's fun but not too
much of a actually you don't worry about
perfection don't worry so much about the
database don't worry about your host
provider don't worry about SEO don't
worry about the future of a framework
that you pick and don't worry about
being technically relevant on the
cutting edge all right you guys don't
need to worry about that and a lot of
people are going to be like Oh Ben is
totally disconnected right now but I'm
not what you need to worry about is in
step one your investor
the people you're working with and your
customers and your users are going to
tell you what's most important to them
if one of these things fit in there then
that's great but basically what I'm
saying is all this stuff can be changed
as massive you could get into a lot of
yaks shaving things so pick one iterate
on it be happy work pop is a good mother
i'm going to use work pop as an example
they started with blaze they took blaze
as far as they could they did a lot of
innovative stuff with that and then they
move to react but they they have been
alive for a while they have venture
funding their MVP iterating validating
their idea they use blaze and that's
awesome I don't think reactors out
though when they started but nonetheless
they probably I wonder what obvi would
say Abby would you guys start with blaze
again if you guys started work up from
square one today I'm curious about that
step 3 stacks should enable you to be
even more shameless promoter so this
talk itself is an MVP I'd even finish
the slides for this one well what I'm
saying is when you pick a stack you need
to also be thinking as a marketer so not
only are you going to be a product
manager a project manager and a
technical lead but you also got to be
thinking about marketing react is a
buzzword that's going to be able to give
you some marketing cloud depending on
the industry that you're in meteor is a
buzzword anything that's JavaScript are
isomorphic or real-time is buzzwords is
that going to get you possibly on the
front page of some of the technical
blogs that are out there or or
promotions a poor like coming on shows
Abby does a great job promoting work pop
and he goes on shows he does talks and
he is able to do that because the
technology that they picked not so he's
not getting on to these talks on the
merit of work pop alone he's getting on
the talks because they picked a certain
stack and what he's doing is like pretty
interesting with that stack so then that
is a new for him now to promote what
work pop does so think is a marketer
when you're picking your stack as well
step 3 and this is and I do this a lot
on everything that I do so I do tons of
personal MVPs every week i'm testing new
things and i have to have an additional
value like a marketing value on top of
the goal that it's trying to achieve and
with that if you achieve if you do those
three steps you can pick a stack with me
or one hundred percent confidence you'll
understand so you'll understand
primarily what not to make you
understand what is important to each
stakeholder and you'll avoid as many
acts as you can and you're thinking of
ways to promote and have the stack help
you with that so free advertisement from
the stack I don't want to break it down
I talk too much 31 minutes but anyway
what I do want to say at the end is
let's get philosophical so the Holy
Grail MVP is not a universal mega stack
it is special MVP that lives inside of
each project side their heart you got to
get to know the project kind of become
significantly go out on a date yes but
I'm not promoting any single stack in
here I think the main thing that I want
to share with you guys is my process
that I must go through step one was like
the biggest importance and also I want
to kind of have people step away from
JavaScript fatigue
away from feeling like meteors of one
one size fit all technology and as a
developer I think it's really important
to get into with the problem that you're
trying to solve and not be chasing the
sunset of performance or multi-tenancy
or microservices or trying to learn
redox you know because you want to be
managing your client side state in some
advanced way bottom line is and I really
love it because this was a the
foundation and the mission of the bend
and hobby show when we are doing it is
to get stuff out the door I the thing is
you guys got to be testing things you
guys got to be getting it out there and
even on a personal level I love Aaron
Oda he does this excellent if you look
at how Aaron ohta structures his attack
on new technology it's exactly like this
where he'll write a blog post or hell
demo something or he'll make something
that can be marketed like a free
training site then he throws the code
out there and sees what the community
likes about it what they don't like
about it and he'll abandon something if
it's not achieving what he wants it to
achieve and he'll fully support it and
expand something if it is achieving it
and I think we need to take that
approach to everything that we do and
stop talking about JavaScript fatigue
and then start building cool stuff and
that is it that's a great so the first
question do you play the shia labeouf do
it video every day before you get sort
of work to do ya do it
would you say that's the essence of this
talk is just doing but I don't want to
be the shia labeouf of meteor but yes it
is it is I think it is but it is damn it
Dean I'm going to burn this thing now
all right so Prashant asks what are some
of the downsides of the meteors stack I
think the downsides of the meteor stack
right now is that it's immature it's
monolithic me like try to rank this in
importance I right now there's not a lot
of options to break things up and I
don't like that you can only use meteor
pretty much on on greenfield projects
it's hard it's near impossible to
integrate other databases and with that
then working with pre-existing backends
is really painful and so that really
limits everything on top of that there's
some really questionable situations
right now between mdg and the community
and I have confidence at all that's
going to be fixed and I put myself on
the front lines to try and like help
that happen but it's still up in the air
like like what is whether things going
to look like relationship wise by the
end of the year no one knows so that is
some big things right now currently that
you're concerning so some people are
saying they can't hear Ben if you can't
have been just reload the page and I
think that should fix the audio portion
if you haven't roll
I would I would agree with that i think
that media is doing some interesting
things to maybe address that right like
reactive graph ql is maybe a backdoor
into projects and then supporting react
on the front end is an interesting way
to maybe welcome react projects into the
community I think Ben took my advice
well there we go we got his video whoa
look at that everything everything is
breaking down I'm kind of worried about
my transmission show coming up ah no
it'll be fine it might be crowd cast who
knows but nine other people didn't have
a problem I don't open yeah alright so
the next question from of Aldous is how
to balance out minimal versus viable ah
that's interesting I would say you can't
have one without the other if you lean
one way or the other then if you do
minimal you're going to have a
product if you do viable uh are you even
going to release it because it's going
to be doing too much yeah so yeah so
it's uh it's 5050 like that is the whole
talk today was kind of like I would have
to frame it as it's a rebalancing to
people yeah I saw this great tweet the
other day and it was I forget who it was
but it was about launching is a war of
attrition right and like getting
something off the ground is way more
about cutting the crap out of the
original expectations than it is about
anything else so I would I would agree
with that right like you you if you just
shoot for viable like you're definitely
gonna have something that's you know
probably over the top you spent too much
time on you've missed the mark it's not
interesting to people you know
these are the things you have to worry
about mm-hmm yeah good yeah you've got
to constantly be cutting but you're not
the one that's going to be cutting mmm
you need step one is to like get buy-in
and then you can't move forward unless
you get buy-in so one an example for
that in that people can see publicly
with me everything that I do is with a
partner mm-hmm I don't do anything on my
own whether it's partnering to you or
sashko or avi or what the packages I
will never go out on my own because I
have plenty of ideas but I've shared
those ideas and people disagree and I
can't get buy-in and so then they end up
on the cutting room floor yeah no that's
interesting too because when i worked at
gaslight which the the next speaker is
from that company as well when i was
there we had this saying like we're
better together and like that was the
mantra almost of of the business because
like they are programmed on everything
and like you know if you wanted to do
something you had to at least get by him
from one other person I think you're
right like an idea only gets stronger
when you have at least one other person
involved hmm yeah sometimes we just have
terrible ideas we need someone to like
smack us and tell us it's a terrible
idea yeah and also like humble ourselves
too because some of the advice could
come from people that you at least
expect it so and I take that with like
how our relationship was like when I was
when I was like a super junior developer
and you were still asking me some
questions about a meteor club at the
time and I thought that was awesome that
like showed your character as as really
taking in advice from from the least of
these that went through your program oh
I thought you were just a good marketer
that's why I'd ask you questions
well that too yeah just can okay um all
right how do you go about gathering
feedback on an MVP do you do in person
or remote user testing how do you decide
what feedback to incorporate and what
feedback to just throw out the window so
I I will not even start an EVP unless I
have a passionate base so I start I did
the podcast with you Josh because there
was already a base there we have an awk
we have the best slack room in the world
that I'm part right now right so that's
our base and they give us instant
feedback I did trains transmission and I
told tosco like hey if if we don't
achieve these certain goals and one of
them was getting like passionate
feedback on Twitter and the forums then
I'm out because I'm not going to be the
one driving this bus you know the
community needs to be driving it and we
have that we have really passionate
feedback on it but an obby show we had
passionate feedback but not as much as I
wanted and I really miss Abby I want to
hang out with him but but the fact of
the matter is is like there's so much
time in in my day and I got to be honest
with with the rules that I put forward
so uh how to get feedback I wouldn't you
like maybe put it in a context instead
of like you know client like you know
when you build an MVP for a client you
do any kind of testing in person or
remote or use your testing calm or
anything like that hmm ok so I think on
the technical level if you're building
software project everyone kind of knows
what you need to do there and it kind of
depends on what you're building so if
you're building like a Content site and
it's like a no-brainer that you need to
do a be testing you need to be
testing your price point and all that
stuff will rack up technical debt you
know a developer needs to make all that
stuff you could totally bypass all that
if you have a passionate base at the
very beginning that got buy-in from you
and it could be like your mom that's not
technical at all but if they might be
one of the people that the target that
they might be a target audience we'll
get her on the site you know and do a
user test and watcher and just get her
feedback and there you go you don't have
to develop anything you don't need to do
advanced AV teste and all that stuff but
have people buy in have people have
ownership in it don't be the only owner
yeah I think I think that's the biggest
thing get other yeah i would i would say
like you know I've done user testing
before and it's like a super I opening
like I've done user testing com user
testing and like you just tell them to
go to a page and like look at some stuff
and they talking to them Mike as they
pull up the page and they're just like
giving their thoughts as they're
thinking them and that is also super
super helpful yeah I really like um for
that level of insight I like ha char mmm
yeah that's not a bad one I've enjoyed
looking at that too they offer you some
tools it's easy to implement and you
know so to me the difference like you
not have had this discussion before like
in private I think something like crazy
egg is sort of interesting but hot char
is way more interesting because you end
up getting like this recording that
traces the mouse around on the page and
then like I think you can learn a lot
more from that like seeing how they
scroll back and forth and move their
mouse around and all that kind of stuff
yeah but I
I want to say it a different way ha char
is cool but I wouldn't I wouldn't use
that as an excuse of like oh I got my
user testing down path okay good I feel
good i'm following Ben's rules you're
not you know you know what you're doing
you're interpreting tea leaves you don't
met all really what they're thinking
that's true you got to have partners you
got to have people that that want to see
you succeed but they're they're not
investors they're not technical they are
your user base but yet yet you're
intimately talking with them and that
user base needs to be cycling through
you need to be bringing new people in
and they need to be excited for the app
if you don't have a churning of your
user base that you're testing with and
you're talking to then you're just not
popular and there's a problem there if
I've been there done that yeah it
doesn't talk with tea leaves yes and
well in on the flip side right like you
need to make sure you're not just
relying on the partner either because
like I've been there I've had a partner
we thought we were doing the right thing
and we just we weren't able to convince
people that the thing we were building
was worth paying money for and sometimes
it happens um and that's where the
feedback I think can be valuable from
outside people as well yeah yeah I have
so many ideas and I bounce it off of a
minimum of four different people oh and
if I don't get approve one from all four
then I have to either iterate or drop it
mmm and that's kind of like do you go
back to the same four people after you
iterate oh it depends yeah because like
I would think someone be like Ben no
just drop it I know I I noise some
people when I'm like but what if I do
this and stay well and it depends on who
you talk to so uh if there's like a
mentorship thing going on uh like I like
with you or with Paul or Xabi all I keep
on coming back to you guys because you
guys are super wise you guys have a lot
of history to base your decisions off
and you're genuinely interested in in
what I'm doing so yeah I would totally
hit you guys up like crazy bio said
he'll give you a rubber stamp all right
i'll ask questions they're all 0 which
one looks interesting to you know I like
the first one how do you go about
resolving conflicts with with
stakeholders yeah this is super
important so like what if you have these
different people from different user
bases or stakeholders how that I use
that term and they're giving you
conflicting information of what you need
to work on so that that's pretty
interesting so that is where you need to
get a third opinion okay here's the
bottom line never trust your own opinion
never never trust it you you are too
involved you are too emotionally
connected and you cannot be the
tiebreaker so if there's a split then
this is why you need Mentors so like if
I would go to someone like Josh or
someone that could be brutally honest
with me and and Josh and I do that with
our own stuff like we share we ask each
other what we think about it and and we
value each other's opinion that's what I
would do with conflicting information if
there's too much conflicting information
then it could just be a crappy idea yeah
or I mean sometimes you just have to go
with your gut too I mean that's that's
okay too no you know what I hate my gut
because I i do investing and so like at
Space Camp I talked about investing I'm
either one hundred percent confident or
zero percent confident I'm never
something in the middle
positions and I think I'm with that in
life all the time I'm very black and
white no Fifty Shades of Grey for you
been ooh maybe I don't know do you guys
walk it to kick the grade let's do it
what is money box someone said what is
money by what is money are we out of
time elevator pitch quick quick quick
money bot is it is it experiment it's
another like MVP and it got launched at
Space Camp I want that was a perfect
example to like get people buy in and we
got some buy-in so we went to the next
level we iterated on it to a certain
point and we didn't get buy-in past that
so I'm kind of thinking if I'm going to
drop it or not keep it a personal
project but basically it's an automated
training trading bot for currency and it
uses my strategy where I don't lose any
money and I make about seventy percent a
year money making money people is gonna
camp we're in disbelief until after my
presentation than they were like how do
I get involved yeah so then i'll send
you can old Condrey of people around you
like feverishly writing code so the
people at Space Camp saw this formula at
work that this is the exact formula i
did for money up yeah nice i do
everything well thanks Ben thanks for
doing the talk appreciate it yes alright
nerd you guys can go back to like nerdy
talk this is you got yes so speaking of
that uh we did have a slight snafu in
the schedule Jeremy had a personal
crisis pop up and will not be giving the
next talk we will instead advance
forward to James talk he says everyone's
good so but he didn't have to go to the
hospital so yeah hopefully hopefully
everything turns out great but we will
try to schedule that you know I'll talk
to them as people maybe we do that next
week so we'll do sams talk and Jeremy's
talk sometime
next week but will do James talk next so
I'll link that up in the slack chat and
I train and i'll link it up here as well
wow that guy likes his horn we're going
to miss you guys this week on the crater
podcast make sure to listen in next week
