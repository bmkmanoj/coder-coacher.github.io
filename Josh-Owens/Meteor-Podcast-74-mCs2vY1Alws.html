2015 welcome meteor fans i'm your host
Josh Owens and I'm my co-host Oh Oh cut
it so yeah go ahead good do it my name
is Dean eous Dean Radcliffe I should I
should send you the the funny bit clip
to the to the media club podcast haha no
I am Ben Strahan everyone knows me come
on follow me on Twitter underscore
benster oh I look I loved the tweet we
got the other day like I tweeted about
like listening as Ben and I talked about
all the media news of the week and
someone's like don't you mean rye yeah
you're not listening to the current
episodes are ya yes seriously it's funny
yeah but then like a shout out like we
had a great guy coming join our group
and he was like talking praises about
about our podcast and everything so that
was all yet yeah yeah yeah this life
channel yeah couldn't figure out what
you meant by group sorry that's all
right all these words man it's a friday
yeah i'm playing i'm already drinking
some science I'm not allowed to drink
anymore I'm line like a 30-day no
drinking cycle yeah I might try to
extend it all the way up to like space
camp or something and then yes then from
crashing tail waggin good stuff yeah my
was like how many beers do you think
everyone a drink and I'm like oh I have
like 20 a day myself I don't know about
anyone else you're gonna have to like
hide them somewhere like in the basement
or so because otherwise are gonna be
like gone way too soon you're gonna have
yeah we gotta ease we gotta ration bro
other words we want to ride the weekend
that's what the hard liquor sport
alright alright so what do we do news
let's do this alright so this week we're
going to talk about nude version 4 from
zero dot 24 dot
uh 30 days to be here from dotnet nice
why me Tierney's a conference totally
why I don't know why why we'll find out
uh meteor plus react native kind of
curious to hear what you say about all
that and kadir debug got some updates
we're talking about a little bit so this
is I think this is officially the last
meteor podcast by the way well goodbye
everybody goodbye no we're not going
anywhere we're just renaming the podcast
it's decided to officially do it been
seen the new design I may take a week
off next week and spend the time instead
of working on that the new site and
getting it transferred over but we're
going to switch it to simple cast and
change everything over to be a meteor
app and frankly I feel like we're
talking about a lot more news than just
meteor all the time so if you've noticed
when it becomes a crater podcast you
know I changed the the tagline someone
called me out on it today a niall called
me out and said why didn't you put
angular in the the new tagline I was
like oh yeah i forgot about angular's
what was that again everybody forgets
about egg that's just a small thing it's
not not a lot of people are using it
yeah okay i think my mind likes to glaze
over it cuz i'm just not a dependency
injection kind of guy we're simple
people we're severe yeah we only know
one thing anyway just lays ya know so
anyway be on the lookout for that the
meteor podcast calm will still work but
it'll it'll redirect to podcast crater
down i oh once we get it done and
everything should hopefully be seamless
with the RSS feed and iTunes if using
that kind of stuff so can try to make a
painless yep yep so creator podcast here
we come oh yeah the next step the next
evolution was thinking about like a
tagline like where the meteor react
Odin angular news lands in your ear I
don't know what do you think it's creepy
yeah not good unlike anything landing in
my ear I'll keep thinking on it kind of
gross it's like a wet willy yeah yeah we
wait Willie of the JavaScript world yeah
maybe maybe that's the tagline that is
the what Lily's javascript or haha but
what Willie that you'll like yes yeah I
was recording with us and the wrong
configuration so if you're watching you
saw been really big oh that's awesome
yes alright so let's let's talk about it
node version for what what in the what
how did this happen yeah so if you
weren't following along in the node
world what's wrong with you no I'm just
kidding um you know there were those
those the whole split with I ojs and
node and they decided to go with
completely different numbering system
and then they were pushing out you know
like a new version every month basically
they went like 123 pretty fast streets
like just came out I swear to god we
were talking about like two weeks ago
not even and and then boom all of a
sudden here's four so I don't know what
all this means I'm I'm uh I'm spinning
from this I don't know I you know here's
the thing like I think the new version
has some new stuff in it you know
they're they're getting a bunch of es6
stuff in place and starting to take
advantage of that and they've upgraded
to like version 4.5 of the v8 engine and
a lot of different things like that and
so the other thing is too they now have
like full arm supports 00 you can run
this on 167 and the 64-bit ARM 8 chip so
that's awesome see stuff right internet
of things yeah definitely
running node and another things running
mode they also announced some LTS
support so if you're familiar with how
LTS works within boo too i think it's
similar to that in that you know they're
going to have a version that they'll
keep patching for a while and they'll
make sure that it's kind of relevant for
a long time so you don't necessarily
have to automatically upgrade to node 6
when it comes out next week you can stay
on node 4 for another month or two or
maybe a little longer I don't know maybe
the long term support means a year I
have no idea I actually didn't read the
LCS though so does this mean that we
don't need to add the ECMO script 6
package when we're like testing out one
point two oh you absolutely have to and
like the thing is I don't I don't know
when we'll see I mean I guess
technically today we're still the meteor
podcast so we can talk about it in that
context but um I think it's going to be
a while before we see known for support
drop in meteor and I think the reason
for that is because you know they're
relying on some things like no chip and
fibers and I don't you know they're
gonna be relying on either helping that
guy get those guys get the libraries
upgraded to work with node 4 or they're
gonna have to make a decision to ditch
it if they ditch it like that's gonna
actually be a pretty big thing in the
meteor community so yeah I don't know I
heard a version 12 or meteors coming out
well yeah they're gonna come out 1.2 and
then first two and three will be out you
know the week yes or in the week after
that yeah lot to cover this these
release cycles are crazy to me I don't
know awesome yeah can't wait for one
point one point two to drop oh this is
interesting I was actually just getting
down into the finer grain oats and it
looks like uh it comes with an updated
version
of no chip so I think maybe just have to
get fibers to work with this updated
version and then should be theoretically
good to upgrade I don't know cool yeah
awesome 30 days the meteor from dotnet I
thought dying that was the future you
know they open sourced it it's the past
present and future what your trippy man
so I thought this was like a pretty
thing that a meteor kind of pulled out
and said surprise and put it on their
blog so this guy from catapult in Toledo
Ohio closed Karen no no no that's like
saying southern Illinois is close to you
okay sorry about that but I thought it
was like I mean I didn't get into
specifics but um it was awesome to like
see a guy's perspective who's running a
dev shop consulting firm and uh he I
thought he did a great job of really
explaining from day one what they were
thinking and then walking through it and
sometimes when you're when I'm in the
mix this much then like I kinda like
forget about it mm-hmm some of the stuff
that I took for granted and the next
thing that I'll be talking about on the
podcast is also like taking things for
granted you know the react native thing
but we'll come back to that yeah but I
thought I thought it was awesome it was
good I do you remember the QA that you
did with Paul yeah and my question want
my question with Tim even though he's my
boss was like what made you like switch
from a rail shop to to a meteor shop and
I think this article here is kind of
like what I wanted to hear from him did
you email to be like this is how you
should have answered on the king yes no
but I mean like this is the
chronological thinking that that like I
needed you know
in Chicago you come across people I'm
talking to people all the time that have
different stacks and things that like I
want to know how to talk to people I
want to know how to communicate with
them and show them like how meteor would
be better and beneficial for them where
they are right now yeah like and so this
is this is the value of got out of this
article well right yeah that's I mean
that's a great point right because I
think at some point you get so
proficient that you're having much
different conversations than people who
are getting started and yes like it's
sometimes hard for people to be at a
high level using it everyday and then
like explain like I think in
conversation with people who say they
know meteor like you tend to assume
things that maybe they do or don't know
you know and there's no good way to
gauge that and yeah I think this is a
good article like he breaks it up by
weeks like here you know we did this on
week 1 week 2 week 3 wood for I love in
a week for title is no no turning back
like it was very much like I got 48
hours into my first app and I'm like shh
I don't want to do rails ever again it's
terrible yeah Dean was swearing like
crazy earlier this week because he had a
jump into a rails app yeah a little bit
it's like damn it how do ya so I did I
did about two months of work when i was
at differential on meteor apps and then
we had a rails client come along and
they're like we have our best rails guy
and they like shoved me on it I'm like I
want to shoot myself this is terrible
and it was like you know it was a legacy
rails app right like this thing was
years old and they'd bastardized it it
was terrible hmm that's wild anyway so
uh this thing I love the title to this
isn't your daddy's JavaScript I mean
technically this is the same JavaScript
that my dad did use yeah yes six maybe
oh sorry yes 2015 maybe uh maybe that's
not my dad's JavaScript but right
right no I I definitely think to me I
agree wholeheartedly with the bottom of
this thing when he says meteor is a game
changer um you know I didn't I've been
doing web development for 10 years now
and I've been on a Mac that entire time
as well like I remember my very first
job my remote job working for a spammer
in New York City know from my from my
house here in Cincinnati and like I went
out and got a mac mini just so I could
afford that like have a better rails
development environment and not be
concerned with Windows but I you know he
talks about like how their windows
support is pretty good and you know how
they can undercut competitors now
because they feel like they can build
great apps for half the cost and I
absolutely think you know that's what
brought me here and I think that's one
of the reasons I stick around is because
even long-term I feel like development
speed is still faster than other
platforms so yeah and it's still really
early like you and I are in it every day
we know where the pain points are we see
where things are heading to be improved
or what or what needs to happen to be
improved so like that that a speed
increase is just gonna like increase as
in the next 12 months yeah I would agree
I mean I you know again I've said it
before like I draw on my experience from
rails and like watching like I was there
pre one point 0 launch and all that kind
of stuff and kind of watching it again
like if i look at rails 1 1112 compared
to like rails 3 when they merged with
merb like that was that was huge like
i'm a rails three apps look nothing like
a rails one app they were completely
different and had a lot of different
ideas and things that that were
different to them I mean some things
stay the same right like you still have
to controller and all that kind of stuff
but things change yeah yeah I think they
did a good job outlining each week I
think I needed to kind of go into detail
with that uh
because of what they said at the end
that they saw fifty percent increase of
forty to fifty percent increase like if
they just do that number out ahead of
time girl 1 would be like bullshit but
then they walk through the details and I
think you know he kind of laid out the
evidence yeah so I would say like I
don't know if fifty percent has held up
for me but I definitely I think it's
somewhere in the range between 30 and 40
I'm interested to see like what what
they built but that's what you're
developing and you know if if it was
just like something boilerplate it's
just a web app I could see like being
super surprised at the increase but if
you're getting out to the fringes and
you got mobile going and you're trying
to tie in with a bunch of other things
and working with asynchronous data I
don't know you got some work to do there
so it's good stuff all right it's a
win-win for meteor hmm why meteor needs
a conference I think I know someone
who's doing that yeah do you yeah I
think so send him this article maybe
this is a good thing haha yeah so I
wrote a little article like I wanted to
talk about the thoughts on why I wanted
to throw a conference and and really
like why I was talking to em DG in the
first place and why I felt it was
important you know I think for me like
the camaraderie and the relationships
you build their the networking you get
like that is all great but I don't think
it should be like our primary like it's
not my primary motivation my primary
motivation is still to figure out a way
to spread like the meteor knowledge out
amongst like more people you know if you
look at the dev shop every month I think
they're they're trying to do that on a
small scale and we really need to have
that on a much larger scale and so yeah
have two good like 30 minute talks to
some QA um I want to have like eight
good 30 minute talks with some Q&amp;amp;A you
know like let's and let's showcase some
people that aren't necessarily living I
think I said maybe like the San
Francisco echo chamber you know like not
all of us are there like many many
developers are in other places so let's
have something somewhere else so yeah so
let's meet up in Tennessee why not why
not the smoky mountains are beautiful in
October so if you've never been it's
pretty amazing I'm hoping they're still
leaves on the trees I'm super stoked
yeah you guys are driving down that's an
awesome drive by the way yeah so I guess
this is an invite we're gonna be renting
a passenger van if anyone's having a
hard time finding flights in the
Knoxville aren't you fly into o'hare
yeah and then like truck it on down with
us we'll be there in time for dinner on
friday nice yeah exciting though yeah
speaking of dinner like that's the other
thing I pointed out on this like I for
my wife's birthday we tried out a little
test run recipe of a sourdough french
toast casserole and I put a picture of
that in there cuz everyone enjoyed it so
much I think we're gonna make it for the
for the event so one morning they'll be
sourdough french toast casserole very
cool that was for as for Wendy's uh
birthday yeah right yeah very cool was
that your invention uh no I cannot claim
that we were watching the Pioneer Woman
I think that was it on Food Network and
she made it and we're like oh that looks
really good but mine didn't turn out and
didn't look anything like hers I think I
let mine soak overnight so it became
more dense maybe um and she didn't hers
only soaked for like an hour so uh but I
my own invention is on the top there I
made a apple bourbon pecan topping for
it
gonna say it's pretty delicious man that
sounds good p cons are my weakness oh
nice good to know maybe my heart so uh
you know no matter what like I I feel
like I understand not everyone can
attend this event and can't make it and
we have a limited number of spots anyway
they're almost gone actually at this
point I think we've got like maybe ten
off-site tickets at this point and we
may actually cut a few off just because
we don't want it to get too crowded
we're kind of back and forth on how many
seats we have at the table and stuff but
you know I mean I we're gonna do our
best to get quality recordings of all
these talks and put them up on youtube
for everybody watch because I feel like
that is how we get the conversation
going you know if we have 10 people
giving a quality talk and everybody's
tweeting about it they're up on YouTube
and you know maybe we can start to
generate a little more buzz and people
can learn some stuff and you know it's
it's you everybody gets a benefit even
though you aren't able to attend you get
a tool can you get a talk boom boom yeah
I gots to figure out what I'm gonna be
talking about Oh No maybe something with
react Oh Dean took your spot meter Dean
took my spot I'm just kidding yeah
someone's gonna show up sick tell us
about react native been react native
what a segue good so yours was better
than mine i'm just saying she's playing
off you so meteor plus react native our
boys over at differential Spencer he
wrote this awesome post about uh just
the general things of using react native
so for those who don't know many people
use Cordova with meteor its built-in
support in the in the build script with
me here and I like it I use it every day
interacting with Cordova it's good stuff
I wish
performance was better I wish that I had
had access to native UI and native
animations and all that fun stuff right
so here comes react native it looks
really awesome whoo and you dive into it
right away and you're like oh wait a
minute here this is a new client we
don't get any of meteors client power we
have to like wired up all ourselves oh
man do I want to deal with that I don't
know and then also no Android so if you
do client work like myself then your
clients are gonna you know they want to
be everywhere my androids fifty percent
of the market well I think that's one of
the upsides right Cordova and meteor
like I can tell someone like oh hey
that'll take us 12 weeks or 15 weeks
that'll cost you 50 grand but you'll end
up with like a native app for both
platforms at the end of it and that's a
kind of a big win but like I'm a
designer and so performance um a good UX
like it's really hard to fake it it's
almost impossible to achieve it uh
completely in Cordova and so you know
this tricks they get around it but
ultimately it's like man like when do I
start playing with the big boys you know
when do I really get in and get the
power that I want and it's mainly like
for that it's for user experiences for
you I stop and there's trade-offs with
it now this article is a great grade
right up on the trade-offs and how to
work around it and it's something not to
be afraid of so and he lists out these
challenges how many are there 1 2 3 it
gives three challenges and I thought
they were great one is hey there's like
no user accounts on the client you know
that's one thing that we take for
granted was meteor it's like how great
the user accounts is and and the
security there's like just a few things
you got to watch out for for security
then you're good to go I but he walks do
it it's no big deal I'm glad that he
gives code
code examples no data reactivity and
walking through that and then the last
one was a data interaction so and that's
and that's the cool thing is like right
off the bat people are like hey I'm
gonna have to wire up DDP and then we're
good to go you know that that's
something people think of right away and
I really liked it because of how short
this article was it included a code
snippets and I think this is maybe is a
future of meteor mm-hmm like what are
you doing even like right now you're
doing something funky with uh with
having like static pages right and bring
in a DDP connection in no he or
something nothing about someone else huh
yeah not me I've just been doing the
Cordova and then um justjust little
other things here and there but the main
things at cordova I think interacting
with other clients and interjecting like
meteor as a back-end and hat and
figuring out just really quickly how to
how to use user account ID how to work
with reactivity and data from meteor and
plugging it into any kind of front-end
that you have is something that more
people should get familiar with and this
is a great article to like introduce
that and not have you be scared scared
about it and be excited because react
native is something exciting something
like I do want to try this the question
is you know are we going to see like
react native support for Android are we
gonna see react native support for a TV
OS anyway for Android I asked the same
question and there is like react native
for android com or something like that
and there's like a countdown somewhat
someone tweeted out something from the
react native team a long time ago and
they stand this someone started up a
countdown website for it so supposedly
it's like two weeks away or something
like that uh yeah I don't know
that's interesting I don't know but
somehow I doubt that ah with the new if
you look at the release log they are
mentioning some changes that they're
making so that it would work in both
Android and iOS or at least the
terminology is better understood yeah
you know so like you you kind of blew me
off there when I said TV OS but in
reality like no you gotta stop laughing
like seriously now that it's it's gonna
have an app store and I'm just thinking
of Google t EV well I've never used
google TV I'm sorry man exactly exactly
exactly I'm an apple TV guys so but I
mean you have to legitimately consider
this conversation because Netflix is
using react and I mean you know uh I
don't know if the stat was true but
Apple said that they own something like
sixty percent of the home streaming
market uh home TV streaming market I
think I think that that number skewed
because like I have multiple different
streaming boxes at my house do you more
than just an apple TV I do I have to
apple TV I have a roku 3 and I have um a
Google Play dongle google chromecast yes
yeah I've got a chromecast and then
everything else is uh is a Apple TV but
I mean honestly like that chromecast is
gonna get replaced as soon as I bought
my new apple TV did you sign up for the
developer I did not it says in there
that they're gonna preference people who
have apps already in the app store so
chances are i'm not gonna see one cuz
i'm gonna have in the app store yeah I
wonder what what they're gonna do with
that because like a wall cuz i don't
have apps under my name whatever have
apps in there like that i have like a
developer certificate under name and so
I wonder if i count that I hope to yeah
I know yeah cuz I've got like the
enterprise account that I'm under for my
email address and like that's another
question like I kind
held off because I didn't know like
where are they gonna get the credit card
info from do I put it in as I'm signing
up or I don't know I don't want to like
date yet for credit card oh I heard they
charge like a dollar and then if you get
in like though I signed up they didn't
ask for it they said that it was gonna
be charged a dollar well I that's my
worry it's gonna be whatever cards on
file for paying for your developer
account which I don't do so I don't want
my client to be like bro we got shot
from that DVD that what don't you have
um you have a you have an itunes account
with a credit card right mm-hmm you use
that same one for your developer account
yeah but they're gonna charge but I
don't it's like I don't have like I
don't have like a $99 developer account
you know what I mean yeah yeah I've
enter private yeah they just invited me
to their enterprise alone ok yeah so I
don't know I didn't know who would get
charged for it and it just felt awkward
so I didn't do it yeah I'll wait a
little extra no big deal Josh cannot
explain on a one-dollar charged yeah I
can explain or no charge it's what
happens if you get selected and there's
like that one hundred ninety nine
dollars shards and they're like no no
it's a dollar charge you get it for free
knew what you selected you gotta pay do
i yeah what up for ya I don't ya I
wasn't on my phone when I was like going
through it may be that was something
that was like a media query it just like
got out uh yeah so back to the sort of
hand like the react native stuff I think
it looks interesting to me right like I
mean I think react is it's gonna stick
around like I I plan to actually the app
that I wrote that got me in the meteor
worked with an apple TV and I'm thinking
about like redoing the entire thing with
microservices and react just to like
play around so off so I think react
native will work with Apple TV right out
of the gate be cuddly pretty awesome
because the apple TV is built on iOS
yeah
it always has been even right now it's
locked down you can unlock it right now
and install the apps on it yeah you did
no I've never know I mean here's the
thing like I can stream stuff to my
apple TV using airplay like that's
actually a pretty amazing protocol
they're like I just yeah issue a command
and keep a connection open and it'll
play a video for me it's pretty awesome
um so yeah like I know I I tried I spent
an entire day trying to figure out how
to get chromecast to do it I couldn't
gave up Apple wins oh cool of course I'm
biased uh so Khedira debug they released
an update have you used this before bed
I personally have not ah actually
actually I did yeah yeah yeah when the
future first came out so I the thing is
like you you can use this without having
to put it into production it'll work in
production if you want but you can just
use it locally as well which is kind of
cool so Khedira bug is Khedira bug
khedira debug is really interesting
because it's got like all the all the
kind of performance analysis tools like
it'll break down all the calls that
you're making forget what you call that
perf tools I guess you know so it's
almost like the proof tools that you
never had and it works with node and all
that kind of stuff and you can see
events that are firing off like
subscriptions and live updates on the
client which is really kind of
interesting like you can't quite with
kadir itself you can't quite dig into
this level easily you can turn on debug
and take some snapshots and see what's
going on but still not quite like this
but so now they've released an update
and they're giving you traces where you
can actually click through and pull up a
similar tray screen to what you see in
catia itself which is super helpful
because you can see like what is taking
long time like I actually want to try to
use this with crater because there's
there's some stuff going on in the front
end that I think is a little wonky and
needs to be fixed and I'm not saying
that's like any one person's fault it's
just stuff that needs to be looked at to
help speed it up all right um you know I
I think this is going to be a super
helpful tool and then they've also got
this DDP timeline so it'll kind of show
you where you're spending your time and
DDP and like it's it almost looks like a
Gantt chart so you can see where one DDP
subscription might be blocking the
others from finishing and that kind of
stuff so really super fantastic view for
trying to figure out like why things are
slow yeah and how to speed them up so I
was I was pretty excited by this this is
a pretty awesome yeah and as always like
the blog post has some animated gifts in
there gotta see what the features look
like so Khedira needed a win this is a
win yeah yeah yeah especially like was
it last week we're talking about the
Friday Night war yes yeah ah fun stuff I
was wrestling with uh with posting
errors on Coderre earlier this week too
yeah it's become an integral part of our
devstack so yeah it's really cool to see
the innovation keep on coming out and
Aaron Oda great job brother yeah I think
even honestly like invited to give him
one piece of advice I think he's missing
a payment level in between there like
I'm at the point where i think i'd
probably pay for crater but i don't want
to pay fifty dollars a month mm-hmm and
i don't think i need to pay fifty
dollars a month so same here yeah I'm
with you Aaron Oda need like a
ten-dollar playing again right right I
can help him out with that right Josh
