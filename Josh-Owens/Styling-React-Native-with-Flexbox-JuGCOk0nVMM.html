crater remote cough mobile edition this
talk focuses on building mobile apps
using JavaScript you can find out more
information about upcoming crater remote
coughs at cough crater io enjoy the talk
the second talk is from Scott Olinsky of
level up tutorials
he actually has a react native course so
if you're interested in in spending some
time learning some react native I would
highly recommend going over to a level
of tutorials and checking that out
so welcome Scott hey how's it going good
good Scott does not have a webcam so you
know will when we do the Q&amp;amp;A part you
won't be able to see him but he doesn't
Sharon and I think we're ready to go so
take it away Scott hey so uh my name is
Scott Olinsky I created level up
tutorials in 2012 just doing a whole
bunch of free tutorials on YouTube so
and it's grown and grown and by now I
have like 900 some free tutorials of
which topics from JavaScript stuff to
meteor to react native I have a giant
react native series basically stressing
all the fundamentals of picking up react
native and so you can always head to my
website level up tutorials calm to see
the video or on YouTube at level up
tutorials like I said there's like nine
hundred plus videos there's a ton of
content here if you are a video learner
you're more of a blog learner there's
not really any written content so if you
learn well over videos it's a good place
to pick some stuff up so that's a little
bit about me so I'm used to doing a lot
of video tutorial content in this talk I
wanted to talk a lot about basically
flex blocks flexbox layout and layout
and styles in general and react native
react native can be really confusing
styles wise if you're coming from a web
place
there's all sorts of caveats that you
run into and you'll find yourself
frequently wondering why things just
don't work right there there's the
situations where you try to apply let's
say a border to a specific object and
that object can't receive a border at
all but another object can't just based
on what type of component is so one
thing that also stresses when you're
working in react native having the docs
open literally 24/7 every time you got
it with everything you need to know just
to check if we say let's head out like a
hue component because a view component
takes different style props than a test
component or something like that so
always being sure of what exactly what
takes what making sure you hit a style
section of each individual props to
figure out what you're actually trying
to do is gonna save you a lot of time
but this talk is is really going to just
hope for some of those pitfalls and I
wanted to talk a little bit about the
flexbox layout to start no reckon ativ
does everything with flexbox and there
is some some stuff where we have
position what position relative and
position absolute like we do in CSS but
we don't have position fixed and some of
the way that we usually do positioning
on the web is going to be quite a bit
different so you're gonna have to really
learn how to in flexbox and think in
react native layout system for
everything in a way that's different
than from web so the first thing I
wanted to touch on was flexbox overall
now flexbox if you haven't used it
before is really just a replay or the
standard sort of like float in flow
model that was on CSS before where
you're floating things left-right taking
things out of the document flow and when
we're applying a flexbox
to a container the children of that
contain
then can flex throughout the entire
container and so it's gonna be good to
take some serious time to really learn
flexbox and flex is is easy to learn
once you get the hang of it but if
you've been doing CSS a long time it's
gonna take some time so there's three
key resources I'm gonna recommend for
learning flex bugs I'll make all of the
stuff in course notice but really we
have the CSS tricks page on a guide to
flex box is really the go-to for like
cheat sheet for flex box if I ever need
to look anything up on how to do
anything in Flex box this is the place
to do it but as you can see here we can
change the Flex direction from Row 2
column so that things flex vertically
rather than totally horizontally rather
than vertically we can have things this
flex property where we have where as it
flex grow where this item can take up a
ratio of two to one for each one of
these items so we can grow things a bit
more relative to each other
and then we have wrap where things can
go on to a new row there's all sorts of
stuff where you can actually do with
linemen and everything like that
so we have justify content where we can
either make things justify to the start
the end the center we can space them out
we can have space around them and if
you're already familiar with these
that's great we're actually gonna be
covering some of these over the course
of this chat here so CSS tricks this is
a great place if you need a cheat sheet
for flexbox
if you need to learn flex box entirely I
would recommend West bosses course what
the Flex box it's quick videos basically
just giving you everything you need to
know goes over some sort of key layouts
and you'll you'll feel pretty ready to
with this and next is flex box froggy
which is a little bit more interesting
this is less of like a this is less of a
here's how to use flexbox
and more of a hey here's the game we
need to get these frogs on to these lily
pads how do we do this we could do it
with justify intent and we could do that
as an I think it's just Center will do
this I'm used to writing react native
flexbox right here so as you can see
here now that I completed that task it's
taking me on to the next hardest one
this is a good way of like actual
practical but sort of not practical
examples on how to actually get flexbox
to do what you want it to do either way
flexbox froggy is a great way to test
your skills select what the Flex box of
flux box that io is a great way to learn
flexing and this CSS tricks is a great
way to just reconfirm what you know cool
so now that we have that underway I
wanted to talk about some initial
examples what I wanted to do over the
course of this was first do a quick
basic basic layout and I wanted to show
you some of my techniques for not
struggling with in flexbox so here I
have a really basic component and in
that basic component you open up my
simulator here you'll see there's
absolutely nothing that's first good
reason there but as you can see we have
basically a view with a style of styles
container and two views box 1 and box 2
and here as you can see clearly box 1
has the background color of blue and box
2 as a background color of red both of
which we're not seeing even though we
have this container with a flexbox
property of 1 now this might be
confusing you might be thinking hey
boxes we have a flex of 1 which in in
react native it's sort of a hybrid of
what display flex box as well as flex
grow you'll be using the Flex property
to extra
relatively make something grow and
shrink we'll show you that in a second
here but this flex one right here is
basically to make sure that the children
which is of course just box 1 and box 2
are going to be properly distributed
amongst this container now we might be
thinking well this isn't showing up but
let's actually give this a width of 50
this is boxed one and I can save this
you could see nothing and I can give
this a height of 50 and you can see we
do have this blue square now so your
children need dimensions here but they
don't need dimensions here what if we
want this blue box to take up 50% of
this height well all we need to do is
simply replace all of this stuff with a
flex of 1 and I have live reload on and
you'll notice that because the blue box
box 1 has flex of 1 it takes up the
whole area and box 2 takes up none so we
want to come down here and had a flex 1
property - box 2 and as you can see we
now have this blue and red so this is
really gonna touch on one of my favorite
techniques that I'm sure is nothing
original in fact I I picked this up from
a colleague Ben chef who have worked in
who actually started level up tutorials
with although he's no longer involved
however he basically has this semi
brilliant method of when you're having
layout troubles give everything ugly
primary colors just the the ugliest you
know default colors and you can see
exactly what your containers are it's it
it's a it's nothing mind-blowing here
but it's something I do so if you see
these really ugly colors through the
course of here I just want to make
everything really painfully obvious ok
so we now have box 1 and box 2 and there
there's no height or width
or anything given and this is great this
is really nice for us but what we want
to do here is we actually want a box one
to be let's say 75% of the height of
this container right we want a box one
to be 75% now one thing we could do is
we could set like and CSS you might be
you might be thinking like well we'll
just give this a height of 75% and this
is where react natives layout system can
get really frustrating because there's
no such thing as percentage based widths
or Heights and react native so having
something 75% height isn't super easy
and what you'll want to do is default to
flexbox
now one way we could think of this flex
property as a sort of a ratio so let's
say if we had 100 100% if we were to set
this 75 to 25 and save this you'll see
it's now 75% of the height and 25% of
the height for the red but that's not
really what we would want to do we don't
want to go around using this flex
property as a percentage you want to
think of it more like a ratio right so
if we were to have this be let's take
this one's going to take up 3 and this
one's going to take up 1 then we get the
same thing because if you think about it
we just the fraction here whatever 25
over weight the the fraction essentially
equates to the same thing right so you
want to be thinking of this flex
properties as sort of a ratio here so in
terms of using these flex properties as
percentages you're gonna have to be
thinking of more in terms of ratios
rather than percentages which can be
totally different for somebody coming
from
a a web background right you're used to
thinking in device or a viewport height
or even percentage based things okay
so as you can see here if we modify this
to two to three this just gets even more
so as we advance three to three is
obviously going to be the same ratio and
they're going to be one to one this is
going to be the same as one to one so
this is the the very most basic there is
four flex box and I would totally
recommend coming in here and making
something like like this with primary
colors and really just making different
layouts okay so this is as bare bones as
basic as it gets
let's check out something a little bit
resting
I thought Instagram was a nice place to
look because there's a few really nice
design elements within a program that
are reused throughout everywhere so I'm
going to fire up another example here
so before we get into this I'm going to
actually check out some layouts here so
Instagram has a couple of layouts with
this grid layout and we have this main
sort of login layout these are gonna be
two very common layouts to have
something like everything sort of
vertically centered here with some
inputs and log and obviously if you're
having a login system you want to make
that easily accessible right in the
center it's a great place to do that and
this is the first layout I wanted to
check out we're gonna do a really simple
version of this but something that you
should be able to see so I want to take
some time to sketch this out right so we
have our Instagram I'm just sketch here
and I typically do this on pen and paper
just to really get a handle on things to
essentially just sketch out the
different ways that should look so think
about it we had the logo we had a text
input
we had a text input actually me just
duplicate that and then we had a button
and then if you remember another
component was this don't have a count
basically everything's pushed to the
center here except for this language and
this don't have an account so let's
check out we also had essentially this
bottom section down here this doesn't
have to be perfect just a sketch here
but as you can see here this layout is
sort of generally what it looks like now
we might be interested to know that when
you initialize a new react native
project it essentially does half of this
for you when you initialize a new
project it basically has sets up a
container where everything is to the
center so let's head to the code here
and actually started coding so I have a
view with styles container inside of
that is a text that just says I'm a logo
and then we have two text inputs here
and
if as you can see it's all just hanging
out here to text inputs and I'm a logo
so let's actually get going with this by
first centering everything now to do
that hold on one second now to do that
we basically just need to head to our
container and we want to give the
container a flex property of one and
that's essentially just going to make
it's going to make the children allow
this to flex in here
now we're gonna want to give us a
aligned items so we're going to say
aligned items now keep in mind between
react native and CSS instead of using
hyphenated things you need to use camel
cased for your properties and when
you're using actual definitions here we
need to put everything in strings so
Center so line items Center and that's
just going to make sure our items within
the container are centered within the
container but what about the container
itself we want the container itself to
be centered so we're going to say
justify content and we're going to say
again center justify content if you
remember is the flex box property that
allows us to essentially take all of the
children and distribute them amongst the
container okay so as you can see here we
now have everything centered obviously
in the Instagram example things were
pushed in from the sides so we can go
ahead and give this some padding just
like in CSS and you'll notice we have
four padding we have basically a pixel
value but it's a device pixel values so
you don't use percentages you use
numerical values so here you have
padding okay so I'm a logo two inputs
with some padding it's a really super
good start now
one thing we want to do is we want to
add a button here we want to go ahead
and have a touchable highlight which is
silly what you use
or a button so I'm going to come in here
and actually I already have this code so
I'm just going to copy it so I don't
have to type it live and expand this and
as you can see here I have a touchable
highlight and inside of that is text now
some of the gotchas here are that a
touchable highlight you if you want to
style the text within a touchable
highlight you need to have text and you
need to have style on that text let's
say if you were to add a color to this
touchable highlight it would complain to
you because touchable highlight is
considered a view view doesn't have
color any time you're modifying the text
itself you're gonna have to have styles
on the text and I found that person it's
a little cumbersome and annoying but you
know you deal with it so we have
touchable highlight now which if we come
down here simply just has the background
color of blue since everything is
justified to the center our entire
layout adjusts accordingly and it's
entered even though we now have this
button in the middle now you'll that we
have this button text so font size
padding color font weight these are all
very these are CSS properties that
you're a hundred percent used to right
this is all the standard CSS property
stuff but what we don't have is we don't
have this taking up 100% of the width
here which is weird because these inputs
both take up a hundred percent of the
width this touchable highlight isn't
going to take up a hundred percent of
the width so how do we adjust that well
one thing we want to do is we want to go
ahead and give this a flexbox property
of aligned self so aligned self now
aligned self is going to basically allow
you to align obviously the particular
element but we can use a property called
stretch
so aligned self search to make this now
be the entire width of a layout and if
we wanted the things inside of here to
be centered obviously the button text
thing aligned to the the left is not
great what we want to go ahead and do is
say a line items and we'll say Center
and now it's centered now you might be
eating well why didn't you put the align
why don't you align the text using text
align on the center well to be honest
this text box here this button text is
only the entire width of the button so
or is only the entire width of the text
that you're seeing here so if we were to
give this a text align Center it would
anything and it would have remained in
in the far left so what we needed to
actually do with Center the component
that was button text with align items so
these are just some things that are
going to be very different from CSS that
are going to make you occasionally flip
over your desks chair when you're not
able to essentially get them going using
the same strategies that you would for
CSS so we now have this button we now
have this logo yeah and all these inputs
and everything like that but if you
remember they also had this component at
the bottom that we talked about the sort
of if you already have an account click
here box how would we go cheating that
if we want all of the stuff to always
stay centered now there's a few
strategies you could use but for this
particular example is a great time to
use the position:absolute that we're so
used to in CSS so if we scroll back up
let's go ahead and add this section here
I'm going to do so inside of my
container and underneath the touchable
highlight I'm just going to add simply a
view and it's just going to have styles
of as for details now if we scroll down
let me go ahead and add extra details in
here cuz right now this view isn't going
to be anything really no a knife having
is so off right now but uh let's have to
deal with it
okay so because our Styles are now
objective course you always want to make
sure you remember your commas here
that'll get you and now we're going to
give this a background color of ugly
blue and we're going to give this a
height of let's just say forty if we had
things in here we wouldn't need to worry
about this like icons and texts and
stuff like that but I just want to have
a high here exploring with just a
standard view and obviously we don't see
anything yet because this doesn't have a
width but we don't want to give it a
width what we want to do is we want to
give it a position and then again in a
string if you're coming from CSS again
you're gonna be typing the wrong things
over and over again properties without
strings non camelcase
but what we're gonna do is we're gonna
say make this be at the bottom and we're
gonna make this be at the left and we're
gonna make this be right zero by having
left and right at zero it's going to
make it 100% full width now if we come
here you can see that in our layout this
guy is officially positioned at the
bottom so the the good thing here is
that we have the position:absolute when
we need it we can take things out of the
sort of the flow by positioning in them
absolutely giving this width and we
could have done this with a couple of
different ways like we could have looked
at the viewport width and pulled that
value out and headed sit this way
however since we're using
position:absolute just having this left
and right
we don't actually have to calculate any
of that stuff and we're just left with
essentially what is this this view here
that takes up the entire width so as you
can see let's compare this to our out
it's obviously not the exact same it's
it's clearly not as pretty but what we
do have we have our centered bit we have
our inputs and if you were to have this
extra stuff this would all get centered
as well and we have this position
absolutely if we wanted to have this
thing up top here it might also be a
good case for position:absolute since
none of the stuff is scrolling here it's
all going to adjust to the viewport
width accordingly cool so this is
basically just the the standard layout
for a login nothing crazy at all
next I wanted to talk about a little bit
more complexify layout where we get to
do some coolers which would be something
like this now I'm not going to show you
all of these little details in here
because this is essentially just a view
of view of view in a flexed row space
part and inside of this container which
is inside of this container which is
also inside of this larger container
what we're gonna do is essentially treat
this whole top section as its own
section and then get into some of this
scroll part where we have both this
footer at the bottom we have these icons
here and we're able to scroll up and
down so I guess we can totally simply
sketch sketching this out because I just
went over it there but typically what I
would do is sort of look at this and say
okay this is a view is an image but for
this example I'm going to use a view
because I just don't want to distract
with images and how do we how do we get
this going here you'll notice that
there's three up images every single
time and they take up the full width of
this window so one thing that's gone
immediately is giving any sort of pixel
values for this widths of these items so
let's go ahead and check this out
let's see also you also want to keep in
mind that these are equal width and
height these are all squares right so we
want the the height to always be equal
to the width that's gonna be something
that's going to come up so let's head to
the curb or minimize that one and let's
fire up this next example also keep in
mind I'm just doing these on the iOS
simulator because essentially it's it's
essentially quicker to get up and going
the chin can occasionally be slow and
even then it's faster than the third one
but all of these examples should work on
either
okay so let's lay out from scratch I
have some things going here all right
baby now in here or nuts that said to
our emulator and as you can see here
what I already have going is is what's
this dark grey section would be
essentially the top layout this red view
right here is what's going to be one of
our images and we have this icon bar
which is remaining fixed at the bottom
here regardless of when we're scrolling
it now the first thing I want to talk
about is the container I essentially
have wrapping around everything a
container it's wrapping around the
scroll view it's wrapping around
everything now this is just a view and
all it has is a property flex of one now
the reason I'm doing that is so that we
have one item that's taking up this
entire height right next I have two
things I have a scroll view and another
view the scroll view is going to be the
entire scrolling portion which would be
the top section the profile all that
stuff as well as the grid of images now
we also have what would be the bottom
section here and it might be easy to
think this bottom section is similar to
the bottom section in the previous
layout so let's position:absolute it
let's throw it on the bottom and just
have it be there I mean the problem with
that is it's kind of unnecessary for
this layout but also there's a better
way for instance we have this container
we have the scroll view and we have view
which is the bottom and look what we're
doing essentially the scroll all that
has is a property flex of 1 now the
bottom section the icon bar that I'm
calling it because Instagram it's a
series of icons doesn't have a flex
property in the first video if two of
the children both have a Flex property
they're going to take up
equal height so if we apply a flex line
to this it's all of a sudden going to be
like hey I'm taking up the rest of this
equal height and then this thing's
getting squished and not good but we
don't define this a Flex property and we
do give us a height what's cool about
this is this layout the scroll view will
take up all of the height as possible
except for what it can't take up from
this and because it's a scroll view we
can scroll within this view and the
saikhan bar is always going to stay
stationary so again the Flex one is
going to make this take up all of the
height except for this little bit here
and we don't have to do anything to get
it to do that other than defining a
height on the bar itself now you'll be
wondering hey I didn't declare a width
ever for this icon bar how does it take
the whole thing
I'm not saying structure anything like
that what I am doing is by default the
align by default the property at which
children will grow is going to be a
stretch so by having this flex on of one
of the container this is going to take
up the full width likewise this top
section is going to take up the full
okay so next we have the top section
which has background color of 3 3 3 I
just did this to make it sort of just
fade away right this is just the top
section and we have an image grid which
doesn't have a house and an image the
image just has a background color of red
now I get a width of 40 and the height
of 40 and a margin bottom and a margin
right of 2 now it's going to be more
obvious when I add another image so just
by adding another image here you can see
inside of the scroll view I have the top
section with nothing in it the image
grid with now to it
and if we head here you can see that we
have two 40 by 40 boxes that are just
coming down here vertically so that's
that's cool but like this obviously
isn't anything we want the first thing
we want to do is we want this grid to go
in a row of from left to right if you
have studied flexbox you would know that
what we want is a flex direction we want
to apply that to the parent which is the
image grid we can come down here to
image grid and apply a flex direction do
you notice how I just type the - there
that's like my it's just drilled into my
fingers here can you type in flex
direction of row now obviously they're
going to be in a row that's great but
what we want them to do is we want them
to take up more right we want to take
that this whole thing one thing we could
say is flex of one like this and you'll
notice nothing going on here and we'll
want to go ahead and essentially start
setting the widths of these images now
there's a few ways we could do this
interesting way because we want these to
be perfect squares right we could always
come down here to these images and we
could give these images of property flex
of one and watch them fill up its entire
space but that's clearly not what we won
and not to mention the height and width
longer proportional so let's check out
what we can do now one thing we can do
can import dimensions dimensions is
react native that allows you to get the
viewport dimensions and go ahead and
let's scroll down here and I put this
down here by the styles just so we could
see it but especially what we're doing
is we're doing the variables height and
width two dimensions get window with
that we're now able to get the pixel
dimensions of width so the pixel
dimensions of
with Wikinews that you said variable in
our Styles here right I mean very
different from CSS or even you know CSS
with preprocessors but we can now use
this variable right so we can come in
here and say with its if this to the
viewport width now let's go ahead back
to our thing and you'll notice it's
taking up the whole width now we don't
want to take up the whole width what we
wanted to do is take up one third of the
width if you remember from this so we
could always say divided by three and
let's head to our emulator and you can
now see it's taking up one third now I'm
gonna do this outside in another
variable here so we can just say here it
is equal to and then width of 1/3 or 1/2
the current width divided by 3 so let's
grab this width here and decided to
width now if we save that just do the
same thing and again we wanted this to
be an even height so the height is now
going to be also set to grid if we set
that there and now the height is set to
1/3 of the width if we another image
here there we go let's go ahead and add
in another image because obviously
Instagram has a ton of images and you
can see this is where our current
solution break but if we scroll down
here we can see that we have four items
in here but what it's not happening is
is basically it's it's not going on to
the next line and since all of these
have a fixed width there's no room for
the last one so in the detainer we're
gonna want to go ahead and ask X rap so
flex rap and then that it's just going
to be a property of rap the options are
rap and no
he fell this note and now it's rapping
but we have this grid where if you
remember we had the issue of we said
that some margin right we said hey
margin two for each of these what we
really want is the width of each of
these to be one-third minus two to
accommodate margin so if we come in we
can just modify this a little bit here
and minus two and here we have our grid
now again we have some issues here with
some dirt let's go ahead and adjust that
and we can do that with a justified
content of space between don't beat flux
Gritty we can say hey give us some space
between and let's get rid of the margin
right cuz we no longer need it because
the width is correct and now what we
have is actually I think the math might
be a little bit wrong we have three
items here either way the spacing is not
entirely 100% but what we have here is
now a grid of images that will grow from
row to row always take up from width to
width
border to border and we add a hundred
more of them it's going to fill out this
scroll view so let's copy all these add
a whole bunch of them and let's scroll
down here and let's check out our layout
now so what's great about this layout is
that our icon bar is stuck at the bottom
here even though we have all those red
ones and as we scroll this takes up the
remaining space so what we have is a
scroll view you could scroll entirely
with it have all of these images as per
their grid and the icon bar here so I
what we have here is a pretty standard
layout right you have this great I mean
you could probably see this all over the
place an image grid you could have this
top section and you have something
sticking to the bottom and your
using your standard CSS tools so this is
certainly something that is going to
take you getting used to because by
default in the web you add something it
Scrolls right in here we need to make
sure we have this scroll view which is
essentially a container that allows for
scrolling everything inside of that will
just allow you to scroll and based on
the Flex properties it will take up the
height or width that it's supposed to
super cool so this are basically two
really key layouts because it covers a
lot of stuff right we get to use the
dimensions of the page in this a
Longworth flex box and you get to see
that you have access to doing actual
JavaScript in your styles that allow you
to essentially change the the properties
in in real time with whatever you're
doing so it's very powerful and there's
a lot to dig into but you're also going
to find a ton of situations where
something doesn't fill up or doesn't
show up and it's just simply a matter of
having the properties on it so basically
the main advice I can give you is if
stuff is not showing up just start
giving it primary colors and and give
after that give it a height and a width
if you see it is a height and a width a
primary color then you'll know that
something's weird about it in addition
you can also add just a a border a solid
border to views to see their boundaries
because sometimes you might think that
an item is taking up the entire width
when it's really the parent that's
taking up the entire width and the child
itself is not and that can also be
another sort of frequent gotcha
so basically basically what's going on
is that you're going to want to one nail
down your your your flexbox foundations
right you're gonna want to learn flexbox
now the problem with paying too close
attention or getting too wrapped up in
in flexbox here is that
different right we have display flex and
we have flex grow
we're in react native we just have flex
right
but for these stuff like flex Direction
rap justify content those things are
going to beat the things that you're
going to want to really ingrain and how
do you think about flex box okay so in a
so that's that's pretty much it right we
we have these layouts we have flex box
like I said you're going to want to make
sure you have your documentation open
constantly and one thing I have noticed
is that I think Doc's have recently
pointed this out that their
documentation there is starting to get a
little bit better but historically this
has all been pretty bad and pretty hard
to parse so I'm glad that they're there
now showing you some really key examples
and they're gonna be telling you about
some gotchas here right like the default
for flex box flex direction and CSS is
ro but in react native it's column so
just stuff like that so you're gonna
wanna dive into these Doc's you're going
to make sure you look at the style
properties that are available to you but
in the end you just want to want to
experiment with it and try to recreate
some of your favorite app layouts and
there's there's most likely going to be
tons of solutions to how you can fix
that layout how you can create that
layout and that doesn't mean that your
initial incarnation of that that layout
is going to be correct and be a great
experiment to just get you familiar with
the layout because if you're coming from
a CSS world it is going to be a
difficult somewhat difficult transition
to make sure everything is exactly how
you'd expect it to be cool so with that
said head to the local apps store here
is to store that level up tutorials I
have a nearly 10 our course on
react native and this basically teaches
you everything from getting set up to
even using in both iOS and Android right
so all of the examples are shown on both
iOS and Android I show you how you can
set up your emulator to correctly use
Google services which is something that
actually is way harder than it should be
but we also pull in information from an
API we do you work with layout we do
some foxing we work with a little local
database using run and then I get into
platform specific layouts and components
now that's talking a lot of serial
design and the human design guidelines
now I want to have a quick note on on
those as well so the react native human
design or is it I think it's human
design guidelines whatever the the Apple
design guidelines are as well as the
material design guidelines it takes care
of quite a bit of stuff for you like if
you're adding a switch
you know reckon ativ is going to use the
native component for that so the
guidelines should be there but if you're
creating a list item full of things
you'll want to make sure you actually be
human in today's human interface
guidelines here and you'll want to make
sure that you do understand the correct
spacing and the correct padding and to
be honest there's no great libraries to
do this stuff for you from what I found
I mean there's libraries but even with
the material design going to there's no
great libraries to do it for you in fact
most of the time I would almost
recommend Lane coding the the Styles
yourself for instance we have react
native material kit which is pretty much
the main react native material design
guidelines there's there's like four or
five of them and most of them aren't the
currently developed and even then most
of them are very incomplete so rather
than struggling with an incomplete
package it's not too difficult to code
these buttons yourself it's not going to
be too difficult to make this layout so
I would definitely encourage you for
when things that aren't like maybe like
a spinner but like an actual material
design based layout instead of using a
package to come in here and code a
with this chances are you'll because all
of these packages are different and
incomplete mostly you'll less trouble
with it but as you can see here this one
is X think react native material kit if
you're going to use one of them this is
probably the one to use as a handful of
components the other ones are mostly
mostly broken at this point but yeah so
make sure you're you're looking at these
design guidelines for both of the
interfaces and you know basically you
you should be set with either material
or human interface design guidelines
cool so I'll leave this last a little
bit open for questions if anybody has
any oh also sorry real quick I should
admit it and if you're interested in the
react native course that I have here I'm
gonna be having a coupon code of crater
I'll make that available directly
following this talk it's not if you try
to buy it right now with crater you
won't it won't work but I'll have it be
for 30 so if you want to take advantage
of that I'll post that in the sledge and
everything like that when it's up and
running and now brief word from our
sponsors before you see the rest of the
talk
Raygun spend more time building great
software and less time fighting it
Raygun helps keep a watchful eye on your
web and mobile applications and tells
you when problems arise you can learn
more at Raygun comm native script back
by telluric bye progress is an
open-source framework for building truly
native mobile apps with typescript and
angular to use your web skills to get
native UI and performance on ios and
android enjoy the rest of the talk
awesome
well thank you for the talk Scott it was
very informative appreciate that yeah
all right yeah it looks like we do have
quite a few questions here so we'll get
through as many as we can
are there any layout
debugging tools is from Ryan available
it is so powerful on the web to just be
able to right-click and inspect anything
and find out what's wrong
yeah that is something that I haven't I
haven't found there there the tool there
which is why I - essentially giving
things those properties if we use our
chrome debugger inside of here if we
like the bug the j/s remotely it only
allows us to debug the JavaScript right
there's no Dom there's no Dom there for
us to debug so you know we can't come in
here and adjust the styles which is both
frustrating and different not to say
that there isn't any tools I'm just not
aware of any of them so at this point I
pretty much just turn on the live
reloading and if I need to start
debugging things just start coding right
coding saving coding saving you'll
notice it's pretty fast if you wanted to
come in here and do it that way I'm the
life right reloading is or at least for
iOS androids not as fast but it's
probably getting there but as you can
see it's like the moment I hit save it's
it's up and running so it's pretty good
I closed your screen sorry oh yeah but
yeah so either way that's a suggestion I
have is heavier editor open have your
emulator open and code have hot
reloading on and it's going to update
pretty quickly
all right so Ryan asks do you regularly
do your dev work and Adam for react
native do you use any xcode for anything
other than the emulator i use adam for
everything personally
i do that because i i code for both
android and iOS and i don't want to get
it into the habit of relying on an Xcode
for something when I you know I don't
want to have Xcode and the was an
Android studio now I don't want to have
Xcode
Android studio opens though yeah Adam
does pretty good and there's some really
good stuff with the new glee at nuclei
what is the there's like a suite of
plugins that Facebook made I think it's
called new nuclei yeah those are really
really good that allow you to have like
you can run build commands and stuff
from that and react native nice
all right so Isaac had a question what
are some best practices for designing
layouts and react native without z-index
since it doesn't exist
yeah what's funny is that z-index kind
of does exist like if you use elevation
which gives it like a shadow on Android
that actually gives it the z-index so
it's occasionally necessary but really
the best practices you have to know with
stacking order of things is that if
something is below it in the code it's
going to be above it in the stacking
order so that might change how you think
about layouts a little bit for instance
if we were to have an image that was
like your profile image that maybe sits
up top I don't know if you want to show
my screen or something if you have okay
let's see yeah so let's say we we had an
image that hung out on top of all this
information there's an example that I
use in the course of like IMDB where you
have like a movie image that sort of
sits on top of everything that image
would have to be in the code below all
of these things it'd be below all of the
stuff that needs to be sitting on top of
and then you can position it relatively
or position it absolutely with your your
content and actually physically move it
on top of or above these other things so
that's that's the thing to think about
you write z-index
doesn't exist as the the same way we're
used to in web so you do have to think
about stacking order when you're you're
coding your components as far as but
yeah best practices go I'm sure their
stuff solver
young there's like a thousand new like
style libraries and stuff like that to
either help cascading or something like
that there's a there's a lot the the
platform is very young it's fully
featured right like it you can do
production apps with it but at the end
of the day it's still very young and
there's a lot of new stuff coming out so
I'm sure it's all going to change yeah
all right so Isaac asked is there an
equivalent to using media queries for
CSS and react native in order to handle
multiple device sizes that's a good
question I don't know to be honest I
like to go up to like a tablet layout
huh I mean you could honestly I don't
know if there's a pack of them sure
there's packages that people have made I
don't know if there's anything natively
built in it but you could always grab
the width and check if a width is
greater than a certain pixel dimension
then change the layout in different ways
you could use this and have an if
statement and have two totally different
style objects or set your styles
conditionally based on whether the
layout is super wide or super narrow
that's the one thing to think of off the
top of my head I haven't had to do any
different layouts for tablets yet okay
and then this one's kind of related Ryan
asks you're you size your squares based
on the screens dimension but what
happens if the user changes their phone
orientation with the Styles being route
processed automatically if not wouldn't
your blocks be the wrong size yeah let's
check it out
so we can take this and then rotate left
and as you can see here they're still
using one third right yeah so we would
want to check that orientation and have
that change to be whatever we want it to
be like what one-third of the height
there whatever as you can see though if
i refresh a ii so yeah there's some
there's some stuff in here that's a good
thing to look at but yeah these are
little things that you're gonna you're
gonna encounter it's different than CSS
hey yeah
and the last question is what from Ryan
what is noticeably missing from the
react native subset of CSS properties ah
you know a they did they did everything
for a reason so I'm not I'm not I don't
think if things are missing it's because
I'm not thinking in react native land
right if you're thinking in web land
position:fixed
is missing and and that's can change how
you do things but ultimately you don't
need it with this but I think that's
like sort of the biggest thing another
thing would be you can't add borders to
text you can add borders to views which
you have to wrap your text and views so
you sort of have to think a little bit
more of like the properties not every
property is available for every
component so for me that's maybe the
larger omission is that you can't use a
text component like you could a
paragraph or a heading in CSS you would
have to wrap it in what would be the
equivalent of a div using a view to be
able to apply all of those styles so
that's that's sort of the biggest
omission for me but I'm sure it's
obviously all for a reason right all
right um yeah I think we'll call it
there cuz we gotta get started on the
next talk and I just want to say thank
you Scott like that was very very
informative and if anyone has more
questions like feel free to hit Scott up
in the chatroom or check out his YouTube
channel you have a silver button right I
do have a silver button yeah I'm at a
hundred and forty thousand subscribers
so yeah yeah we'll see how that goes
yeah but yeah really appreciate it thank
you Scott thank you all right thanks for
