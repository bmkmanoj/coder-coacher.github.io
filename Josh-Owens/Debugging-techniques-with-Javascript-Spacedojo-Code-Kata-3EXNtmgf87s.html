ever space dojo code kata I am your host
for this session
Josh Owens if you're not familiar with
me I run crater IO I do the crater
podcast I do space dojo show and run
space dojo comm which is a site that's
all about building JavaScript
applications so this April Fool's I saw
or yesterday actually the day before
April Fool's I saw a tweet that I really
really liked from someone that suggested
instead of playing pranks on someone
use your time for good and so that's
what I wanted to do today I wanted to
try this out if you enjoy this this
video on debugging techniques with
JavaScript then please please do give me
a like if we hit 50 likes I'll probably
make another one of these and then of
course you can go to patreon.com/scishow
club and if you donate there I'm gonna
put up a new prize level whatever a goal
and when we hit 1500 I'll start making
these every week so again it's a patreon
patr yo n.com slash media club or hit
the like button if we have 50 likes I'll
make it at least one more yeah so today
I really wanted to dive into showing you
guys how to debug JavaScript
applications it's a question I get quite
a bit and people seem confused about all
the different ways it'll work because
there's a number of different techniques
and so we're gonna cover how to use the
chrome console to set some breakpoints
and we'll talk about using console.log
which is pretty basic and I'll show you
a little bit I'm gonna use meteor for
this because that's what telescopes
built on and we'll we'll look a little
bit at some react stuff as well and then
we'll look at the debugger keyword as
well so I think it covers quite a few
techniques
that can be handy and so let me get them
set up here okay I think we're good
and yeah so you can see I've downloaded
the the Nova branch of telescope because
I wanted to use react and I thought it
would be good showcase and you can see
here if we just go to inspect if you
have your developer tools turned on
it'll pull up this console window here
and we can go to sources and the way a
meteor app works is you know
everything's under this app here we can
scroll down you can see all the packages
that are being loaded telescope
generally loads everything via packages
so we can go into the nova base
components here and like we can see
routes JSX is a flow router a routes
file so if you're familiar with
something like react this is similar to
react router and we could see here on
line 11 where we're just catching the
base route and then where this action on
line 13 is what's actually going to be
performed code wise and so we can set
the breakpoint here on line 16 and
reload the page it takes a second but
you can see we get this nice little
paused and debugger here paused right
here and we can we can start inspecting
things so we can do query params that
actually hasn't been set oh yeah yeah
actually has it's being passed in and
then we're running we're checking to see
if it's empty if it is we're appending
new to it there on line 16 and then we
would we can we can actually step over
right we can go past that and it would
run this selector line next step over
there it is and you can see we pause
there so it's just gonna it's gonna move
one point at a time whenever we say step
over
so you can see here we get to line 19
where it's actually trying to mount the
component into the app container so it's
trying to create this list container and
then mount it into the application which
is basically how flow router works with
react mount er I believe is what it's
called and so if we hit continue one
thing that may be a little confusing
though is we are compiling this JSX down
to JavaScript so that the browser can do
something with it and sometimes the you
may try to set a breakpoint somewhere
and you can see it like flashes and that
moves the breakpoint up to line 13 it it
can't set it there and so it's going to
set it at the parent level and then you
you can get into the action and kind of
step through if you need to or there's a
way I think if you have source maps set
up correctly you could probably get to
the underlying JavaScript and figure out
how to set a breakpoint if you wanted
and then we'll explore setting hard
breakpoints which means you can put them
exactly where you want we'll get into
that at the end of the video so let's
take a look at now that we've we've set
the breakpoints and you can just click
them to clear them by the way so you can
see we just click here and it goes away
let's get into console dot log I think
that's a this is like probably the most
basic right this is like the printf if
you come from like an old school way of
coding you can just type console log and
now keep in mind this is universal
JavaScript right here this is being
loaded on the server to do server-side
rendering with telescope so we need to
be careful what we put here and so we
can do I don't know what we'll just do
query parameter
and save that and you'll see it's
rebuilding restarting and like I said
this is also being loaded on the server
so we're getting the node console.log
going on right here and then if we go
back over here and check the node and/or
the chrome inspector we can see that
we're getting the same output over here
and I think console.log is super basic
but console is actually pretty powerful
if you want to look at things so you
know III think maybe the the faster way
is to just put the breakpoint right here
or right after right let's say we want
to look at query prams you probably put
the breakpoint at line 18 and take a
look because you can control it right
here from chrome the problem is you have
to wait for the entire save cycle when
you put it into your code on line 17 and
everything has to restart basically
which can take a little bit of time the
other thing you can do with console is
it's got console table so you do posts
find fetch and you can see we get this
nicely laid out table the other thing
you can do is like console dot time and
that one's kind of fun so if you're
trying to do some kind of timing test
you can add the console time set it up
and then you can call consult at time
end somewhere and give it the same
handle name that you gave it right so we
just give it like my food time test and
it's gonna create one and then we just
call time end it's gonna do the same
thing and you can see that it took me
four point five seconds to type
everything in so console is super
powerful but one thing to keep in mind
is that you know this again this is
universal JavaScript so if I type
consult our table over here node has no
clue what that is and it's gonna throw
start throwing airs down here in the
bottom that says has no method table so
do keep that in mind if you are doing
universal JavaScript
all right I think one thing that I also
wanted to show off here is using react
can be pretty helpful as well there's a
react Chrome extension you can install
and you can see it's connecting in and
instrumenting all our containers and so
we can dive down into the different
containers so here's the list container
that we rendered in and you can see we
can come down here and do dollar sign R
and that's basically putting us into the
context of the list container you kind
of get the idea and you can do the same
thing up top here and you can see it
tells you it gives you a little reminder
like you can use dollar sign R in the
console but we can dive in to the
collection this way we can look at the
joins we can actually go deeper and you
can keep going down and down and down
until you get to where you need to be so
I you know I think this is great if
you're looking for a way to kind of see
how your apps being stitched together
and what's being passed to the different
components the react Chrome extension is
just it's amazing for that kind of stuff
so give it a give it a look debugging in
node is similar but different so we can
type meteor debug here
and essentially what's gonna happen is
it's gonna start note inspector and
we're gonna get a you can see here when
it when it spits it out we're gonna get
a new URL that we can connect to so we
can just copy this in and paste it into
our browser
it runs on localhost 8080 basically it's
instrumenting our node app with some
code and some communication can happen
back and forth between note inspector
and our actual running node app and the
first time you run it with meteor you
can see it just automatically pauses
here just hit continue resume and we can
kind of browse through and find that
same spot again this is loading things
we close this one
so we can open packages looks like it's
still loading so we're waiting for the
the nova base components to come over
now that we're mostly loaded you can see
we've got the nova base components and
here's the router JSX file and we can
just put a breakpoint here and next time
we load that code up somehow we should
get paused right at that point and so I
think we will just get this in the in
the browser we'll just get this waiting
for a local host but in reality what's
happened is we've paused on the node
side so it may not be apparent right
away and you can see here on the console
we get paused at you know blah blah blah
tells us exactly where we paused and now
we can we can take a look at the query
parameter
review new so it works exactly like the
the chrome debugger we can unset that
breakpoint we can hit resume come over
here the webpage finish loading there we
go so it's a it's a nifty way to be able
to to really kind of get into your node
code using node inspector and there's
other options too I think there's like
an iron debug for a node so there's a
lot of interesting things out there the
other thing you can do and this is what
I was talking about earlier is you can
set the debugger keyword into your code
and so I'll show you what that looks
like you just type debugger here and
save and that's a hard breakpoint and
that essentially means that if you have
a console open it's gonna stop at that
debugger key point until someone hits
continue like it we're not just setting
you know that that little tab in the
console we need to reconnect here
or paused at that point so we just gotta
wait until it pops up and we can bypass
it and so this is what I was talking
about by the way you know this is the
compiled JavaScript versus the you know
the JSX
and so you can see like we were trying
to set a breakpoint right here on line
like 2:00 to 3:00 and reality you know
it doesn't necessarily line up correctly
and so instead it'll come right up to
the action and try to set the breakpoint
there instead and you can see we've got
the debugger keyword it stopped at line
2:14 and you can see it says the same
thing in the console here and so we can
just hit play to get past that and then
we should hit the debugger here in the
JavaScript console as well
query grams and you can see it works
exactly the same the difference is you
know it's like automatically stopping in
the place that you wanted to and so if
you're having trouble placing your
breakpoint like this then you can use
the debugger as well it's kind of like a
last resort and the thing that you have
to be careful of with debugger is if you
get into a loop you know if you're let's
say we somehow got into the list
container and we were setting a
breakpoint on each list item being
rendered we'd go through that 5 times
which might get a little annoying
because we have to you know hit hit the
resume button 5 times the thing you can
do in that case let's say you got into a
list of 100 or something just close the
console here and it'll just bypass it
all and then you can go take it back out
and save and then you don't have to
worry about it again so super handy I
there's been a number of times like I
didn't know that at first and it was
like how do I get out of this and you
know you keep hitting play play play
play play and you know you get tired of
that so just close the console and you
should be all set so thank you for
