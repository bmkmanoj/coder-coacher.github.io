welcome meteor fans i'm your host josh
owens along with my dueling co-host
today who's first hey this is a Dean
Chicago grooves my Walker and cinnati
grooves cincinnati nice so yeah I just
thought uh we could have both people on
today's coast so soon yes you get it
spend on a bonus co-host and a bonus
story since we have three people so
we're doing six stories today hey so as
always you can find us on twitter
twitter.com slash meet your podcast
that's where we tweet about all things
related to this show also I think it's
just my retweet bot account or something
every tweet everything I find
interesting about meteor as well so uh
this week we're going to talk about fat
model skinny templates react and
material UI web assembly creating meteor
toys yes six and meteors up twenty eight
percent whew that's such a random and
interesting measurement but we'll get
into that but I think first you wanted
to say something Dean didn't you yeah
yeah the there's been a lot of events in
the news that have really been drawing
you know racial divides and talking
about privilege and and a lot of things
in our community about you know creating
zero-tolerance policies for conferences
and there's a lot of discussion going on
and I just want to reiterate for the
meteor community in every community that
I'm a part of that we do need to keep in
mind the human element of coding and
that there are people there with
feelings and if we even just exercise a
little bit more sensitivity and kindness
on pull requests and discussions that's
that's the minimum we need to do
um and yeah just want to commit that
this community is welcoming and
inclusive and if we ever mess up and say
anything that that puts make someone
feel like an outsider I want that that
person a let us know so that we can get
them back in the fold yeah for sure and
you know you can always i would say any
of us you know are approachable on
twitter if you can find our email
address like feel free to private
message us or email us and you know it
it's likely unintentional so you know
yeah we're here and we want to see the
community grow and i would
wholeheartedly agree with all that
alright so with that said uh we're we're
not judging anybody when we talk about
fat models and skinny templates fat
models they're my favorite uh yes so for
me like I wrote this post actually so
hola I'll take this story but um you
know coming from rails I definitely came
from a background of Lake this is all
based on skinny controller fat model
paradigm which gym is buck wrote about a
long time ago and you know the thing
I've written a couple articles about
missing a know where i am and i think
this is the reason why i'm missin or on
you know like being able to put business
logic into your models or as it were
like in our like thing in an immediate
lands a little weird like an individual
document from a collection right that's
what i'm actually referring to as a
model here you know being able to put
that business logic on that model i
think is a very smart thing and I've
seen it be very advantageous as I've
been moving towards that paradigm my
latest client project and in some of my
open source work as well so I referenced
you know I I did this for space talk and
I've also been doing it for the client
and I've been working on and it's just
it's been a cleaner experience so we're
able to take you know methods that you
would probably write a template helper
for push it into a collection helper
instead now it's available on both the
client and the server and
it's going to be available anywhere in
the client that you're using that that
kind of document individual document so
you know you can call it from one
template helper or another so you know
if you think about uh maybe the use case
is in the the mastering meteor class you
know I put some stuff on the tweets and
on the users so i can call like users
tweets or i can call tweet user or
something like that and it'll like call
a find and return the relevant
information to me so you know that i
think that's a very very strong paradigm
and i give some examples in here about
how like if the client comes to you and
says hey like you know let's let's
assume we're building like a support
ticket app and you want someone to view
the support tickets and we need to give
access to that well then you know
there's a if we use something like
adrian landing roles then you're going
to have this you know checking to see if
the user has the allowed role and that
kind of thing and so what if instead we
just push that straight into you know
the the checking straight into the users
class somehow we can just call support
tickets in it it'll check to see if the
user already is a support rep and if so
you know it'll allow that that data to
return and so now we get this nice kind
of interface that works the same in both
the client and the server for
publication and for you know showing the
data on the client and it's just it's
made for a better user experience and
then on top of that you know at the end
of the day when the client comes to me
and says oh hey we've got these
additional users that need access to
support tickets can you add them into
the like add their roles into the list
of people that can see these support
tickets like oh yeah sure like that's a
one-liner change in one file and we're
done yeah that's brilliant to me yeah so
would you call these are like client and
server mix this mix-ins of functionality
basically kind of but I you know they're
not really mix ins because they pertain
particularly to this data that we're
talking about right like so in the case
of the
the users were were directly working
with meteor users collection and so I
tend to save that office like capital
you users and then apply the helpers
there but yeah it's it's tightly scoped
to the data the document data that that
we're working with so and then you're
able to just call like when you call
this you're able to access that
documents data yeah so what are you
thinking Ryu just came into focus the
lighting was kind of keeping you in the
dark for a second why was actually using
some some of my powers to do that Oh
fact you know it's interesting like
rails was such an opinionated framework
right yet you still had to have this
post a similar post like this come out
in the rails community because you know
people can write spaghetti code in every
framework and so I think this is like a
strategy to avoiding spitting spaghetti
code or when you change something having
a change in a million spots you know I
like to put a lot of this kind of stuff
into like a services kind of a you know
if it's like this thing is happening to
these three objects I always have a
tough time to figure out like which
object does that that's a great yeah
sorry did you use concerns or modules to
do that or did you go right to services
I just yeah I all sometime just create a
slash services directory right right
just like if there's a process that does
like ten things you know do this thing
send an email you know send some
analytics all this kind of stuff like
it's hard for me to say that belongs in
the user class because get it can get
messy there but i think it's like it's
this all part of a continuum right like
i think this is the right way to go from
like pure spaghetti you know getting
stuff into the classes and so into the
effect of models but then you find it
maybe some something that that actually
breaks down so I remember like in rails
lands you have to have on your user
object like three hundred lines worth of
code right it's like well it's that's a
really fat object I'm that model
it was flipping fat yeah perhaps too fat
yeah so yeah but I think this is this is
definitely some
that is a step you want to take as your
that you're growing your app yeah I
agree and you know I I didn't really
talk about it either but if you notice
like the two helpers I made on the user
class I kind of follow the single
responsibility principle as well yep
trying to have functions that are only
running like one or two lines of code as
well yeah make things clean up this is
all way to grow yeah and you can
delegate to assert to another class you
know that does all that stuff so yeah
there's all kinds of stuff you can do
but yeah good post Josh good post
architecture architectural patterns are
emerging and keeping keeping them going
is awesome yeah yeah and then you know
the the great part is to like it's only
a 21-20 lines of code kind of package
that you install so it's really easy to
look over and make sure that it it
functions you know not much to it so all
right what's next well I I put this on
here for the material you I aspect so
first let's ask about that like do you
guys think material design is like the
new bootstrap I've had a little trouble
getting it going and followed back to
bootstrap a few times what are you guys
I think right has opinions on that oh
yeah yeah well I mean we're using
polymer so despite despite that you know
we've moved a polymer 1 point 0 like it
you know but it's not for everybody so
yeah we I don't know anything about what
you realize to be honest because it came
out after qualifier okay but it has that
Google flat material design look yep yep
basically what allowing our developer
Greg to design stuff that when we go out
and show it to show the apps to people
they're like man who's your designer
when I say Google and I what the hell
are you talking about so yeah we get a
lot of compliments on something that
we've built without any designer at all
cool I'm sure you get the same thing
with listen to t realize though use the
Tyrolese Josh I haven't used it know
we've been i've been on ionic actually
so ah which is angular derived right it
is but we're using
meteoric so it's a blaze wrapped version
of ionic ah ok wow so many choices and
Fran and stuff yeah well for us I mean
we're doing phone phone only so um you
know I've been building a court of
application for the last five months or
so so anionic that psionics use cases
for phone only yeah yeah yeah it doesn't
look very good in the browser so like if
they came to me and said hey we need a
browser version of this I'd probably
start packaging a lot of this stuff up
to be like mobile and browser packaging
and kind of separate that out cool and
does react have any kind of built in you
I opinions I CSS framework I don't think
so I'm aware of but yeah yeah I think
this is really this post is kind of like
the guy mashed together these things
yeah yeah we're here what a two babies
react for front-end components and
material UI for theming right so that's
that's a package that can work and who
wrote this post again I know this is my
topic but uh lee ji Miss Ellie alright
thanks Luigi from Italy great a lot of
good design in Italy I love my espresso
machines to look all beautiful like that
yeah well yeah so it looks like i'm
reading I didn't realize material UI is
basically the polymer look without the
actual web components architecture so
such as material design yeah so the
other day it's just like two different
paths to get the same sort of a look so
I imagine it's you know again web
components is is an interesting topic
it's a standard that I don't know will
win but we're using it so we know what
we're doing else and but I don't know if
the winds long-term because there's a
lot of hurdles to get over yeah you know
it is interesting i think actually i
talked to richie about this and i'm
pretty sure this week in meteor calm
is using the material CSS framework
rather than using polymer so oh but you
wouldn't be able to tell just by looking
at it right yeah yeah like because it's
all been minified and stuff I'm not sure
that it's necessarily easy so yeah there
is that that that color that kind of I
associate with material design just like
that color of blue I associate with
bootstrap oh yeah the default color iya
ya interesting alright you jump to the
next topic yes tell us a little bit
about web assembly yeah I just learned
about it because I got a scientist story
um I remember yeah I heard some of the
headlines about it but I hadn't did it
though very deeply into put basically
web assembly is an idea that um you know
it's been said that javascript is the
assembly code for the you know the front
end that you know a lot of people i
don't--there's maybe 200 different i did
a coffee script post where with some
researchers like 200 different languages
that compile down to javascript right oh
wow yes it's a crazy high number like
way higher than you expect yeah but I
think you know the reason that happens
is because it's such an interesting
target language right because it
literally runs everywhere like everybody
makes a version that runs on every
device so i mean that's that's why yeah
it's not terribly surprising but the
point of this web assembly thing is that
javascript is not assembly and it
doesn't perform like assembly so it's
kind of a bad a semi definitive yeah so
so they're visiting good enough assembly
i mean if its web assemblies trying to
get something like 20 times faster than
JavaScript so that would be big you know
honestly like either you still run
across apps that are slow but I mean in
the day of like Moore's Law and like us
getting kind of ridiculously fast with
computers do we care well our usage
right the environment the trees will be
happy if we get faster JavaScript move
think of the trees think of the trees
they went now I yeah baby but how about
this have a better battery power on your
device that might be an answer
what you're being by the trees on yeah
yeah yeah I think I think that I mean I
don't know too much again about this
thing I know this is not a reality right
now from what I can see but it says that
Mozilla Microsoft Google and Apple are
all working together on this I've also
heard the same thing you know said about
lots of standards that don't yeah well I
think the interesting thing here is like
if you go look at like shadow Dom versus
you know virtual Dom or something like
that like you know there's clearly
divides between Apple and Google on
which one should win but the fact that
they're all for working on a web
assembly project seems very very
interesting in the long run to me yeah I
just don't know is there a certain
company that's more behind us than
others like that's the case with with
with web components and and you know the
polymer stuff you know Google is way
more behind at the knees other companies
and so it's like if you let that win
your kind of helping google win and so I
don't know if there's some company
that's more behind this and others
there's a truly a you know all four
major browser guys are all working
together in a nice non-competitive way
you know like that's the tricky part
about this these are all big companies
too it's almost scary right like oh my
god all four of them are doing this what
mmhmm yeah so let's watch we'll see you
yeah I think it will be interesting
because i think you know you'll you'll
start to see compilers come out that'll
take your ruby code down to buy code
that can run in the browser and well you
know yeah starts to break down the
javascript is owing the world idea which
you know again it probably makes that I
mean really javascript is not the kind
of a crappy language at its core and
it's just a happy accident that it
happened to win out I think yeah as big
as it is true true but we'll get into
that right cuz we're going to talk about
es6 Oh where's a segue uh yeah the
problem is what you know it why don't
you go ahead yeah um back to mine okay
gotcha yeah I was skipping over um so
yeah yes sick
has standardized so who made this post
here is a Dominic Ferber real world es6
examples and i'm very excited about es6
i think it kind of splits the difference
between coffeescript succinct Ness and
and and convenience and the fact that
you know it's JavaScript so everybody
learn what you can about es6 it is
coming the train has left the station
and you will love some of the things
that it has so some of the quick hits
that Dominic touches on our the arrow
functions which are get rid of some of
the weirdness of this right if you're
using arrow functions the whole VAR self
equals this convention that you're used
to you can in most cases do without that
another thing that will be going the way
of the dodo bird with es6 the Dominic
mentions is uh huh you know you know
what I'm going to say
array.prototype.slice.call well that's a
mouthful so how about you what is your
pet peeve in javascript that es6 solves
just one huh yeah that's right it's it's
too hard so roomy this seems a lot like
like it's so i still use coffeescript so
I'm one of those guys ah so like okay
you're getting closer but you're not
there yet that's that's true you're not
there yet I've done some character count
differences and there are still you know
trailing curly braces and things like
that in es6 that you can't always get
rid of yeah but i like the like the new
object literal kind of syntax where you
can just use the parentheses and it kind
of denotes that it's a function and you
just return out of there we don't have
to type function anymore like oh that
was a big thing for me with CoffeeScript
like I hated having to type function and
it drives me nuts every time so yeah I
think I did a
an analysis on some javascript file and
something like forty percent of the
weight of the file was either the word
function or the word return well I mean
think of all the carpal tunnel we would
prevent by not having to type all that
stuff yeah yeah so a rape prototype
slice call goes away with the triple dot
rest operator and spread operator you'll
know those r I from CoffeeScript well
and I'm not going to get into classes
really I don't try to use classes and
inheritance very much in JavaScript but
but it's certainly better the es6 way
then then the es5 way yeah and again in
CoffeeScript we have classes OOP yep
well you think you have classes well I
have whatever it feels like a class than
it is a class as well that is that is
the dynamic language principle isn't it
it's a it's a trance piled class right I
didn't know that word now I believe you
trans filing yeah it's uh well so now
like that's the other interesting thing
I think he talks about in here is that
uh oh no no it doesn't talk about it but
you can install the Babel es6 a babel
babel um package and you can start
writing in es6 six syntax now and then
it'll transpile down to es5 syntax so
kind of like polyfill or something else
yeah exactly same idea and I've used a
different package but you can you can
get going on that in meteor now you have
been able to for a while with either the
Babel one or there's a M quand I a
harmony it's another package and i think
the lowest barrier to entry is taking
like the test suite of an existing
project or package and rewriting it in
es6 right so then your production code
maintains its you know format that
you're familiar with but you can use
your test suites as a learning
curve and if you're using a lot of it
and describe blocks or nesting like in
cucumber some of those es6 features will
help you out today well cool yeah
exciting stuff like I'm pretty pretty
stoked that es6 got ratified so yeah
andy s7 is underway to so unfortunately
some of the more arcane features like a
synchronous behaviors that which you're
not going to get into right now those
will completely change in es7 but that's
no reason not to get familiar with the
stuff that's in dominicks post and other
good es6 posts today yeah yep that's
just my two cents alright so the next
topic we'll come back to it now is
creating meteor toys so Sasha or disco
on the discovery meteor blog max 7 had a
nice a guest post about meteor toys and
kind of how it came to be and just kind
of walk through all the things that he
had done like talking about you know
Mong Mong go what did he call it early
on it was about Mongol Mongol like
Genghis Khan Mongo inspector was the
initial name huh and then he renamed it
to Mongo and then he had a session
inspector as well which he renamed a
jetsetter and then he started getting
more and more into creating debug holy
packages and started writing a bunch
more and he called him the orb and he's
kind of created this whole system around
it so he's got this UI for putting the
kind of the this debug environment on
your screen so it's almost like you're
overlaying these development tools right
on top of your development environment
like a browser itself which is a really
interesting concept because you can get
access to the shell or the pump subs or
you can tell it to like Auto publish if
you want like this feels like a better
like it he's got a quote on this page
for me to me this feels like what
they wanted auto publish an insecure to
kind of do for people oh you know when
they created that so I must feel like
honestly media should just come in by
like a bass package and just give it to
the community yeah I was like what they
originally intended things to be for ya
new developers I I think that's great
they could even uh you know pay him in
chipotle coupons kiss okay he says
something about chipotle burritos okay
yeah so I don't know it's interesting
but you know after this post came out I
got into this pretty heated debate with
a couple people in a slack chat room not
not the meteor clubs like chat room but
another one I'm in and it was uh it was
interesting because you know a lot of
people think that it's a negative thing
to have paid packages in the ecosystem
and a lot of people feel like you know
his reasoning of you know developers get
paid meteor gets paid for hosting why
shouldn't I get paid for creating these
awesome packages and I agree with that
um so you know and the debate was very
much the the other way people feel like
it's gonna be bad for the community in
the long run mm-hmm so I don't have yeah
i think the the compromise you mentioned
were mdg adopts people either you know
hiring them but they can't hire everyone
who does some good work right um but
somehow like adopting and taking
stewardship and possibly with you no
money or a staight down that's an
interesting idea yeah yeah the way I
feel I mean I kind of feel like look let
the market decide whether this is a good
idea to do paid packages you know if
people buy it then it's good right if
people don't buy it then it didn't work
out but I mean I kind of see the certain
communities like I remember in the.net
world when I was a part of that it
seemed like every bit of code you wanted
to bring and it wasn't your own I was
kinda like pre github right uh he had to
buy a two bodies hundred all or 200 sins
that kind of sucked
but but you accepted it you paid you
know no I don't like that at the end of
the day you know that there's a couple
schools of thought that I have around
this and what one is like if if you're
willing to pay for an IDE or some kind
of tool that adds on to your IDE I kind
of see this is the same kind of thing in
also if this saves you time in some way
like time is money especially as a
developer like a freelance developer i
sell my hours like if this saves me over
an hour that's worth some amount of
money to me as long as it's saving me
two more time than what it would cost
timewise then yeah it's a win and ya
know you saw the same thing in the rails
community like with like early on rails
kit like you could buy a package that
would do the credit card kind of
integration this was prior to stripe
mobile and you can just buy this package
this gem pop it in and get credit card
stuff going on for your sass app like
come on that too i looks for askin yeah
and it probably save you at least a day
of work which is gonna be a win for your
company of your bottom line in some way
like that a pal no I don't think that's
about but I do wonder how many people
have paid this price for it and whether
you know he's gonna think about
adjusting the price to get more people
in or maybe even just the fact that we
know we've talked about him in so many
episodes on account of there being a
price like maybe I should set a price on
on my packages so i'll just be mentioned
when people will debate whether it's a
good thing no I'm just kidding yeah hmm
yeah i mean he's blazing a trail so he's
taking all the attack of the heat on it
yeah but yeah i agree with you Josh this
seems more like an ID enhancement than a
a meteor package that runs inside your
app just a dev tool so people pay for
dev tools and I mean I don't pay for dev
tools but some people yeah like I use
Robo Mongo I use Adam you know I don't
think I pay for either of those things
so you do I mean you you have like a
pretty big large like github
subscription for differential
so theoretically you're paying for Adam
in some way oh yeah that's true yeah wow
they trick they tricked me which were
they impressed yeah true angry tweet at
them why are you funning funneling these
dollars I hate you oh that's funny yeah
so I don't know I mean I think we're
gonna do like a longer meteor club
podcast on this topic I'm gonna have one
of the people that was kind of down on
it uh I'm gonna have them come on the
show and then I'm gonna have someone
from the Ruby community who has quit his
job and he's doing full-time package
development like pay package development
and you know I wanna like just put them
together and let them go at it I think
that would be interesting hmm so yeah
I'd like to hear how he came up with the
with the price and the last tool that i
bought was twenty-nine dollars it was a
called a deck set and it stung a little
bit to get it but I had to make a
presentation in two days and it looked
much better on account of doing it yeah
so I went back and forth with him for a
while and I think he did this with other
people to trying to figure out a price
and to me I told him $49 felt like the
right price um 99 maybe feel thi to me
so I don't know but I tell you what I
know he'll make a coupon code for us so
if you come to the meteor podcast calm
and look at the show notes for episode
65 I'll make sure we put a link in there
so you can get a discount on on meteor
toys so awesome it's a big ad for him ya
know it was a very brilliant strategy
you're welcome max all right let's go to
the next last topic that's an last topic
meteor is up twenty eight percent and
this is I'm gonna go ahead and debunk
this as being fact and here's why lips
core com which is where this data is
coming from says that in hey there were
sixty seven sites using the year and now
there's 86 sites using meteor which is
twenty-eight percent improvement but
i'll tell you what there's more than
eighty six sites
using meteor so I agree your date is
wrong yes crater you know interesting
like I looked through the list and try
to see if crater was on there and so I
had to go look up Alexa and it ranks it
like 151,000 or something and it's not
it's not in there but it's got things
that are above me and blow me as far as
crater goes listed there so I don't know
I see crater craters at number seven to
27 or 22,000 which is way lower yeah
yeah Alexa tells me it's much much
higher than that worldwide yeah so I
don't know where they're getting their
rankings from that's kind of interesting
too yeah you happen to my saw that yeah
there's way more sites I mean we've
built a lot of sites that aren't on here
listers not on here what the hell you
know maybe it's not a top million hahaha
dang it we need to get more traffic um
yes someone said they saw differential
in the list too yeah differential io
which isn't actually you know but it
resolves but well the French is on that
list yeah but I don't believe I mean I
guess we have a blog that has traffic so
maybe maybe it is yeah let's see the
great graphic than us yeah I know
craters I know last time I saw
differential stats you guys will I get
20,000 visitors a month or something and
craters up to like uh like honestly I've
been kicking some ass and it's up to
like 40 almost 50,000 visitors a month
now so yeah I don't I'd be curious to
look into their how they're doing this
yeah yeah be necessary I'm sorry good
that no bad he said now I was looking
for they're called there was some number
i think mdg published about the number
of windows meteor installs yeah Matt put
up a tweet with a image on it yeah and I
know that certainly every single meteor
install however many that is on Windows
is is new and represents growth there so
you know what's interesting i'd love to
see me tira like maybe open up some
stats on this cuz they've got them um
uh they check your if you've noticed
you've got like this meteor identifier
now file that's in your dot media folder
for each application and that should be
a unique per application and if you're
missing one it will actually generate it
for you and they use that to track like
how many applications are out there Wow
and so I'd be curious if that if I know
like how many applications are out there
in production right now so that's all we
got I don't believe the data so I mean
it'd be cool maybe maybe you did go up
by twenty eight percent last month but
this isn't the source of that so we'll
do it we'll do our homework and come up
with some uh some more specific numbers
next time yes yeah well we'll dig into
these guys and figure out how this live
scores coming across yeah all right hey
so uh you know I'm curious so what do
you guys you guys working on anything
interesting meteor wise oh my gosh yes
of course glad you go first Dean well I
have been working on like a tutorial I'm
trying to turn mediate tracker in on
itself so i'm working on a tutorial that
shows you reactively the numbers of
computations and dependencies that
tracker is tracking to create a tutorial
of that and it's highly recursive and
it's blowing the stack depth of my brain
and so I I'm probably going to have to
cut scope a little bit to get it out
there but I'm excited about this
tutorial hopefully by the end of the of
the month cool yeah for me I traveled to
San Francisco last week yeah last week
and did a presentation at the South Bay
meet up down in Palo Alto which was kind
of cool got to meet Rahul mmhmm yeah
presenta love what we're doing with
astronomer to that group astronomer is a
tool to do event collection out of your
meteor app and get it to the tools
analytic tools you're using
and I'm doing a talk in I'm working on
starting to prepare for talking at
DEFCON 5 in New York next month on
meteor which I've never I haven't done a
talk on meteor I don't ever have but
anything formal like that so mmm wish me
luck guys i mean i gotta go in front of
a conference and talk about meteor but
um that'll be fun if you have any
presentations you can give me this a
starting point send them over yeah i
have the one i did a paz con i'll send
you a link to the slides for it yeah
cool yeah sad it's always nerve-wracking
yeah i'm gonna i'm going to oz con not
to be confused with paz con but oz con
and portland next month and i'll be
doing a meteor tutorial there it's like
a three hour tutorial ooh so if any
listeners are gonna be there actually
like i would love to have a hand because
they set up like 96 seats and right now
24 of those are sold out and I think I
can manage 24 people but you know if I
had the full 96 that's gonna be a little
big for me to deal with to run one
workshop you need an assistant yeah yeah
so if anyone will be in portland around
july twenty first I want to say I could
definitely use hope and I could probably
get you a ticket if you don't already
have one at least for that that workshop
that day or something so yeah I've uh
I've actually been working on something
called space dojo so I guess officially
I'm gonna launch it today and it's a
performance review service I'm actually
working with my first client today and
like I just get access to your code you
pay a monthly fee still kind of debating
on with what that monthly fee is uh
right now it's it's somewhere around 900
bucks a month and I'll just come in and
basically go over your Khedira go over
your code find where all the trouble
spots are and then kind of give you a
report that says here you need to fix
all this stuff hmm um and then you fix
all the things right I I don't fix
another thing okay but you know you can
contract me I guess if you really
me to fix all the things but I think the
idea is that you know if your your teams
and experience so they're having
problems like you know this is a good
way for them to learn and kind of level
up over a couple months so I kind of
view this as an ongoing process like
every month we go in and fix around a
stuff and or find around around the
stuff that you can fix and then you fix
it and we'll come back and find more
stuff because there's always more stuff
always say it's the 8020 right as soon
as you know up off the worst parts the
next worst parts show up yep definitely
so space dojo calm gonna get that up
today nice yep alright guys well I think
that about wraps it up as always you
know we've got the the year-long
sponsorship from modulus to check those
guys out if you have hosting needs
modulus I oh and if you want to support
this podcast or crater or any of the
other things that I'm doing you go to
patreon.com/scishow month we'll get you
in the slack chat room which these two
guys are in as well as a ton of other
people I think we're up to like a
hundred now so I've invited some of the
some of the other kind of top 107 wow
this thing keeps growing some of the
other top meteor doves so there's a
there's a big big presence there I think
all the book authors are there and a lot
of the heads of the shops the
development shops are in there so whoa
yeah that's bunch of like rising star
like new participants as well I don't
know if we're giving shout out
specifically but niall o'brien I've had
