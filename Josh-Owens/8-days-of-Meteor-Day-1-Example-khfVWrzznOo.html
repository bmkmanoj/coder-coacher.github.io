getting started with a meteor app so if
you're following along the very first
thing that we're gonna go over is
actually we're gonna pick up with
understanding the app structure I'm
gonna skip over the installing meteor
part it's pretty easy you can use the
shell script to do it and the commands
right there in the email so I don't
wanna I don't want to spend too much
time on that but if you do need to you
can go to meteor comm click the install
button right there and this is the
command so it's pretty pretty simple to
get that thing going if you're on Linux
or Mac or something like that and then
the windows you know you can download
the installer and get that going as well
so a lot of what this course is designed
to teach you is to pay attention to the
meteor Doc's
and so you can go to Doc's top meteor
calm and you know I think I think the
question is like how do you structure a
meteor app and so there are some special
answers to that and if we switch over to
the full API we get all the Doc's over
here and you can see we've got one that
says structuring your app and so I just
I wanted to go over this real quick the
client is a special folder we've got
client we've got server public private
client compatibility and tests are all
the the top level kind of special
folders and then we also have Lib which
is treated differently as well and so
the gist is this if you create a folder
in the root of your application called
client any code that you do that with is
only going to be shipped to the client
and you do the same thing with server
any any code you put in a server folder
only going to be shipped to the server
and won't be shipped to the client
environment at all
and it turns out that that's actually
any directory name server or client that
actually works with so you can actually
structure it completely differently and
have you know like a module folder or a
features folder and have client and
server code kind of living there as well
in those folders and and it'll it'll
behave the same way so but at the top
level you have public which is just
gonna be any files that you need such as
images and icons and you know robots.txt
like they mentioned and then you have
private which you can actually access
using the assets api we won't really get
into that in this video or actually any
of the eight days meteor stuff I think
that's pretty advanced but if you need
to like have files that are hidden and
only accessed through code then you
would put in the private folder and then
we've got this this special client
compatibility as far as I know this only
exists at the top level compatibility
they don't really say in the docs and
honestly haven't played with it too much
as I generally have a client folder in
the top level of my application and so
this is just like if you're gonna
download a jQuery plug-in or something
like that you can stick it in the client
compatibility folder and it basically
makes sure that any variables that are
declared with var at the top level it's
going to make sure that those are
exported as Global's and they'll still
be available on window essentially so
the behavior is exactly as you would
expect it to be and then tests and
actually for the purposes of this course
and for the purposes of the docs tests
are just ignored they don't load that
code anywhere you'll have to install
something like velocity and a testing
framework in order to get those tests
picked up and run and then I mentioned
Lib as well Lib is a very very special
one it is one that gets loaded first and
in any any place that it exists that
that file is going to be picked up and
loaded before anything else and so if
you have a client Lib folder
than anything that goes in there is
gonna be loaded before the rest of all
the client code and so for me I tend to
put like I'll have like a liberator file
or something like that and so that way
you ensure that your your router is
always there before everything else if
need be but you know it's just it's a
way for you to be able to control the
load order if you need to and then
there's there's some other interesting
things they go into the file load order
honestly you know after two years of
messing with meteor I haven't had to get
into the file load order too much but
essentially it will load the deepest
files first so you can keep making
directories if you want and then I think
it's all alphabetized as well so you can
put like a zero in front of it because
numbers come before letters and and yeah
it can get crazy if you need it to
alright so that kind of covers the the
first part of the lesson and so now the
goal is for us to we'll create the
application and goal number one is for
us to create a client server folder and
move the default code that came with you
know our default created app into the
client so let's do that real quick and
so we'll just type meteor create party
planner everybody likes to have a party
and you can see it did some stuff and
now we can see D and a party planner and
we're running version one one zero two
and so I'm gonna go ahead and start this
up to I just think this is interesting
oops we gotta get this guy into the
meteor run got something already running
here
there we go so these this kind of meteor
run and what's happening here is we're
building the files were starting Mongo
the application is firing up with node
and it's being hosted on localhost 3000
and so now when we go there we should
see the example app that you get which
is just a click view button that counts
up I don't even think it's a shared or
reactive or anything like that but so
yeah kind of boring but what we want to
do now is let's make some directories
oops
make the server make derp a client and
we're gonna want to move all these party
planner files into the client folder
because they they have nothing to do
with the server so they don't really
need to be sent to the server yeah and
so we've kind of accomplished goal one
there and let's take a look now at the
next part of the lesson
so the reason we type meteor to create
is because we need our meteor folder and
so if we go into the dot meteor folder
it's hidden by default you can see
there's a local folder let's do this
yeah we get a local folder we get
packages platforms release inversions
and so the folder is where our builds
happen and then the other four files are
text files but they do interesting
things for us so the package file keeps
track of the packages that we want to
install it and so we'll get into
atmosphere and in a later lesson but
suffice it to say this is where that
data is kind of stored and then
hand-in-hand with that is actually the
versions file this is like gem file lock
or something along those lines if you've
come from rural ubi background this
tracks all the versions of the plugins
are the packages and the dependencies
that you
installed and so you can see even though
we only had three packages listed we've
got all these dependencies in here that
have been installed and a lot of this is
coming from the the meteor platform
package up here so you'd a lot of stuff
there and then let's see what else do we
get we get the platform's won't get too
much into but if you're gonna do
something like Cordova this is where the
iOS platform the Android platform would
show up in here and then the release is
pretty simple it just tells you what
release of meteor you're running and I
actually I used that personally so you
can see I'm actually catting out the
version from that file and sticking into
my bash prompt so a little fanciness
there all right and so goal number two
was for us to look at all that code that
was created and then use meteor run to
get it running and look at what the code
does in the browser yeah and so if you
want to see some something really really
interesting if we go back into the media
folder we can type I've installed the
tree command we can type that and you
can see actually what the entire
structure looks like under the local
build folder you know we get modules and
this is all the NPM stuff that's coming
over and we get all these like this
programs folder there's a main j/s
that's what runs the app so there's a
lot of stuff kind of going on under the
covers and then I guess another way to
look at all those files if we go here to
inspect element on the page and go to
the network tab know the sources tab we
can actually open up and see if we open
up the client folder we can see these
are all the files that we moved right so
we've got the template we've got a
JavaScript file here and then we've got
the CSS and and then if we open this up
you can see here's all those packages
that we noticed in the versions
file so really interesting to see how
this stuff's being stitched together I
think it's important you should know
where to go look when you're debugging
this stuff so that's why we start here
all right so that's goal number two so
let's go on to goal number three so what
we want to do we're gonna add our first
package like I said we were gonna get
into atmosphere so let's do that real
quick so the goal here is I want
something that looks at least somewhat
decent I'm not a designer but let's
start with bootstrap so we go here to
atmosphere Jas comm type in bootstrap
and you can see things are being sorted
on the page based on a number of
different things we've got number of
downloads that seems to be the primary
driver and then we've got these stars
those seem to make somewhat of a
difference and so we're kind of sorting
these based on popularity and I know for
a fact that this twb s : bootstrap is
the package that we want it's actually
being wrapped up and poured it over
straight from the bootstrap guys so I
think that's gonna be the best bet for
us because it's gonna be any time
bootstrap releases something new it's
gonna automatically pop in here and
update in in in the ISO build package
server that meteor runs which conversely
updates atmosphere so what we want to do
now is we'll just type meteor add whoops
I guess I copied all that meteor add twb
s calling bootstrap and that's gonna go
out and get some information from the
server and then it's gonna download it
to our hard drive and that's gonna
symlink it in and so if we come back
over here to the running application you
can see our design has changed a little
bit and then if we go back and look at
the packages we should somewhere in here
get T WBS bootstrap right there so
there's the bootstrap jazz file and I'm
assuming
our CSS where did it go down here it's
being concatenated together and you can
see here's all the bootstrap CSS going
into our our main CSS file so the
processor is working and everything
looks good and if you wanted to you
could download those files directly I'm
not sure that there's a whole lot of
upside to that other than you get to
manage it yourself so if you want like
an older version I guess maybe that's a
good thing but you just I would I would
suggest is create that client
compatibility folder download bootstrap
and put the files in there yeah so
that's that's goal three so that kind of
rounds out the the lesson but I also
give extra credit every day and so goal
number for the extra credit is to remove
the HTML in the body tag of party picker
HTML and add in the bootstrap navbar to
work with in the next lesson and so
let's let's maybe do that real quick
alright so I'm going to open vim here
that's what I use client party planner
guess there's a typo and then huh party
planner HTML and so we don't need this
code in the body tag anymore and we're
gonna we're gonna start putting in our
own code
all right I'm gonna get rid of this guy
I'm gonna get rid of the hello template
we don't need it either and so then we
can start doing things like the header
and we'll do a nav with a class of nav
bar and nav bar default we give it a
roll of there we go
role equals navigation don't close that
nav all right
and so then again we're just using a lot
of the bootstrap kind of classes to get
the look and feel that we want so we'll
go with the container fluid here close
that div and then we'll want a button
right here button type equals button
and data taco
so basically we're just making this guy
responsive right here I don't know if
this is super interesting or not but
finish it out I'll just put some spans
in here oops there we go and what we're
gonna want is a little icon maybe and
well it'll be a link it'll take you back
to the home page so we'll just have an
href of slash and then we're gonna
install font awesome here in a second so
you get to see atmosphere and work again
and we'll just use a glass right so it's
like a little martini glass or wine
glass going on yeah I think that's about
it for now
so let's see what that guy looks like
yeah so we're getting the navbar going
on and when you shrink it you get the
little hamburger menu over here that was
the button stuff I put in and then so
we're missing the the wine glass or the
little martini glass that I have
mentioned so we need to do meteor add
and then we want to grab the package so
I just happen to know it's for two
awesome : font awesome so will stole
that guy but you can find that through
atmosphere again where you can actually
do a meteor search font awesome and that
would pull back information as well and
I think it's sorted similarly maybe two
atmosphere I don't know
all right and so now if we go back you
can see boom it loaded so we're good to
go
so that kind of completes day one of the
eight days of meteor I think if you're
if you haven't yet I would take a look
at the kind of the directory structure
and the dot meteor examples from the
open source example section that I
outlined I think that's important too to
go look at other people's code and
understand like how they're doing things
and learn to read code because I think
that's that's super super important
skill to have as a developer so take the
time to do that and be ready for the
next video tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
