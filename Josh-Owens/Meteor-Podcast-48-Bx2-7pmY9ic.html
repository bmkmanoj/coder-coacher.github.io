thirtieth 2015 local media fans i'm your
host josh owens along with my co-host
right Walker welcome rye hey in your
fancy new office they're all faulty yeah
working audio video nice moment um
alright oh this week in medial and we
will be talking about upcoming features
and blaze using package.json and your
meteor app for fun and profit getting
started with meteor jf user accounts
updated site and news and building a SAS
app with meteor using stripe part 1 and
then we're gonna have a little
discussion at the end as well about
background workers alright so this one
upcoming features in blaze I thought
this was interesting first where I said
MGD you guys rock this post was on
medium I think that's a first yeah I
don't think they've ever posted any kind
of like official md HD stuff on medium
that I've seen um actually I'm trying to
see it was on sashko his account so he
was just writing about i think that the
blaze stuff that they're working on and
um I don't know like number one it's
awesome to see this like I love it like
keep it up sashko uh number two like I
know it's kind of weird because sasha
kind of pioneered template level
subscriptions in his blog post and then
someone decided hey let's clean this
pattern up and make it work in blaze and
so that was like a pull request and
that's like officially in here and a new
feature of blaze but i still love seeing
this they've also added in local
template state so now instead of having
to do all the setup that you do
for using reactive are you can now just
in the I'm assuming this is in like
master or something or develop range you
can just say like this dot bars and you
can set and get things out of there that
are kind of like template level settings
which that is actually a pretty awesome
pattern I used it the other day pretty
sweet and then the other thing is
they're going to change each so that
you'll say instead of saying like each
team's you'll say each team in teams
which i think is a little more
expressive and probably reads a little
better so I love this stuff I'm glad
they're like posting this and putting it
out there and no no what do you think of
it yeah it's interesting like we've had
a conversation internal discussion about
session variables recently you know how
shitty there well yeah I mean like tech
pura say it's a global variables
therefore it's bad for me like I've
never had a problem I know global
variables are quote bad and they love
them the problem is remembering to tear
them down right ya if ya i generally put
like an ID in there so i don't even care
about that a lot of times you know no so
so yeah so like I admit so maybe that
make you know maybe some people were
putting big objects in there well so you
know if you go look at accounts entry
which is deprecated by the way um you
can actually see where sessions could
potentially be a problem because we have
like we're setting errors in session
variable and then we have to remember to
tear them down otherwise they pop up in
other places so you know and that's
exactly what i use this the other day i
added a reactive are and I captured the
air from meteor logging in and just used
a reactive bar instead and so it's just
kind of like template local and it gets
destroyed when the template goes away
yeah yeah so I like I like the
simplicity of using session variables I
see that why reactive very effective or
better I don't like that you had to have
all that extra crap
for they're doing a through fracturing
or this feature in place now the put it
in the blue lays i'll use that all the
time you know it's the same pain as a
second but better you know architecture
than them sessions so yeah I think it's
awesome i love i love all the changes
they've mentioned i love the blogging
experiment to toss it out on medium just
let people you know just share what they
want to share so I think you did a good
a good move yes I agree but you know the
the thing I really want to see from them
is you know they mention components
somewhere in here in this article and I
feel like you know they're talking about
accounts you I as their version let's
see we hope that eventually any
functionality can be added to a meteor
app can be added through packages that's
that bundles self-contained fully
featured you I building blocks one
current example is the account you I
package but I think someone in here they
actually use the word components ah this
means a UI component system to take
advantage of the functionality across
the entire stack yep so I think that's
great but I'd still like to see
something deeper like integrating with
html5 actual components alright just
yeah yeah yeah cuz I think like html5
components are web components are like
they're kind of like a subset of a good
meteor component may be because the
meteor component can also have
server-side code that's doing stuff too
sure I would agree with that but to me I
feel like we're we're missing out on
like it you know I remember Gerard
tweeting a couple months ago about like
someone made a an audio player web
component and you know i i'd love to be
able to just grab that and shove that
into my code and make it work um your
regardless of whether i'm a media or not
i feel like you know the fact that we
don't support web component still means
that we're kind of limited to being a
meteor land yeah well so i agree well
yeah keep going anyway they didn't say
when this is the stuff shipping today
they did not uh keep in mind since we're
past meteor one all over
changes will be backwards compatible
until meteor two point oh oh so you can
use the new style or the old style but
on there's there's really not many
changes in here that aren't backwards
compatible so all right yeah cool all
right next topic using package.json and
your meteor app for fun and profit from
Gerard yeah it's kind of a cool little
post he did talking about features of I
didn't realize there's a script node in
the package.json file did you know about
that I'd go didn't know about it but uh
I'm not surprised me and you know I you
know I guess I did to some degree
because that's how the CI stuff works
over for like Travis and stuff gotcha so
yeah so like for me I just I do have
like these aliases but they are global
once again I'm a global variable guy no
I think I just go like if I need to cook
something that I'm just tired of typing
I just go in the bash profile pop it in
there and I generally used across
multiple projects so it works just fine
but yeah this is cool i like the it
gives you a way to share the commands
with your teammates and standardize how
some of these processes should work like
deploying and stuff yeah i totally agree
like I don't you know I'm so glad Gerard
put two and two together here and then
put it out an article because even for
testing you know like like we can start
issuing commands in there and and people
can run those and you know I don't have
to worry about whether they type the
right stuff or not yep yeah some of
those commands he has know that the
build command apparently you know where
you were you'd bet them that is if a
node environment vulcanized true and all
this other stuff it's uh that would be a
pain in the ass to have to share across
the team otherwise yeah yeah and it
seems like a cleaner way to share right
like I've seen other people check in
scripts or something like I like it's
nice nobody has a way to
this yeah so my comments on the blog
post was like I like the triple Cole and
dividers he did said that's it that's
all you got out of this thing nice all
right next is getting started with
meteor jas or as i said on crater the
best damn getting started post ever i
didn't write this but i did publish it
as a guest post on my blog um and
strahan and wrote it and he put a lot of
time and effort into this thing and i
think it shows no i love i love the
animated gifts that he chose to put in
it to that was not me that was all him
um but uh it's funny it's funny i got an
email from someone in there like those
animated gifs are annoying yeah um okay
keep scrolling need like a hide button I
guess but no it's it's got a bunch of
great stuff in here so he's got some
required reading in here like uh learn
JavaScript some shell stuff JSON Mongo
handlebars jquery like all kinds of
links of stuff you should look at her
read over then some optional stuff like
node and Cordova elasticsearch ionic all
kinds of crazy things and then he starts
to get down into good meteor tutorials
and see there's 12 and he tells you
whether they're free or paid hater you
know how much they call she's in dollar
signs and then tons of packages that he
tends to use all the time service
providers and then if you stick all the
way through to the end he's got a ton of
like blogs vlogs and news places and
that kind of stuff sound suggest just
when you think it's over a new section
starts yeah I think it's great great
great great post sure that would be nice
some SEO for you for you many years to
come eid i'm hoping that i'll give me a
like on the first page for meteor um yes
and real quick before we move on the
sponsor this week
you'll hear it if you listen to the
podcast will be in pretty role but is
modulus do they'll be sponsoring us all
year they are the best media j/s hosting
option out there so awesome absolutely
thanks to the right all right next next
topic is user accounts for meteor as an
updated website and pretty damn awesome
I'm so glad we deprecated accounts and
trips I don't wanna be competing with
this right here ya know right so I think
the gauntlets been thrown down for like
a ton of open source kind of projects
right because if you don't have an
animated gif showing off how your app
works and your little package works like
you're failing yeah I tenes before yeah
and I'm like looking at the polymer one
down there and maybe we should pull it
in i don't have to compare that with
what we're doing custom but any time you
can throw away custom code for standard
code yeah why write custom a good day
indeed so yeah so i don't have too much
to add other than the fact that it's
good use it and i don't know give
anything else dad about that one uh yeah
there was a he said something in the
actual post hey it is what did they do
they added they had a polymer which you
saw they added a lot of improvements in
options that just went out with 160 um I
just scanned at a Heineken oh nice and I
got some not Heineken I guess in the
fridge cooling down um yeah so it looks
like you know we may we may be even
seeing materialized CSS framework put
into play too for those that don't use
full on polymer but use materialized
they'll still be able to do that so you
know I'm just
I don't know I'm in awe of that guy yep
it's doing a great job all right next
one uh building ASAP with meteor
particularly stripe or one this uh this
is from the meteor chef aka Ryan Glover
Oh hee hee hee this is is a recipe right
like it just takes you through exactly
everything you need to do to get stripe
going on in your application I think
it's pretty good um you know I know
there's a couple packages out there I
don't know what the state I know greg
did one I don't know what the state is
of that but this one this isn't a
package but again it that just walks you
through everything you need to do like
it shows you how to build the plans does
it actually does it sync the plans up
for you or you have to build those
separately under sure it's wall post it
is it is there's a lot of stuff in here
which is great you know again if you're
just learning how to build meteor apps
it's really at me I I love seeing seeing
these sort of things out there because
it's tough when you see a tutorial with
psycho here's three lines of them here's
the hard stuff but then they don't show
you the easy stuff and if you're new you
need to know it all in order to get it
to work so now that looks like this is
pretty comprehensive it looks like
defining the plans happens probably
actually in the UI yeah you gotta do it
on stripe it looks like yeah but then
you just grab the ID and set it in your
settings doc JSON it looks like so it's
not too bad yep yeah Greg's billing
package basically you know he can't
physically he overstretched on on that
has too much it has too much opinion in
it and so someday he might do some
refactoring but the short term like you
know if we were going to we really if we
were going to do some more bill in which
we are assuming the practice a copy that
code into our project and not not use
the package necessary
that's sad panda mhm there are
open-source contributors yeah but I'm a
guessing that p or I find a portion of
that should still stay out you know so
yeah we'll see how that goes we haven't
even gotten to that point yet with user
cycle we're getting close but we're not
quite there yet so that's when it will
happen yeah nice hmm he used anime gifts
too so it must be okay oh did he at the
very end right let's all we can ever get
that look at that I'm self on the back
it's very inspired by you though yeah
maybe been on me I just do memes okay
then the day animated stuff so we got
like it says we've got four live viewers
if you guys have questions make sure to
ask them we're gonna have a quick
discussion and then we'll answer maybe
one question make it a good one nice all
right so why you pop this on why don't
you kick it off yeah so so I was asked
on Twitter today like have we done any
talk about background workers to meteor
and I know there are several packages
out there and I haven't really looked at
other peoples but I could just kind of
give a quick overview of where we are
with it and like to hear what you're
doing to josh project so right now we
have a package it's called differential
colon workers I think and it is using
monk I'm on Q which is kind of nice to
get started with because it uses the
existing long ago database you already
have in your media project problem with
it is it doesn't scale very far but it
you know if you start to get to the
situation where you have 20,000 jobs
queued up you might hear you might get
an email from compose I saying stop it
which we've seen that on two different
projects using this package so so what
we're doing I think where you're going
to do this weekend its move to keep to Q
and which is Redis you know know and
just kind of refactor our back-end to
use that but are you going to read the
fact
the package to use Q then instead yeah I
think I think we may like change the
package that it could have multiple back
ends you know either monk he's going to
play that so you have a upgrade path so
common common interface on the front end
that you can go from monk to Q as you
need that as your app scales and just to
be clear like the idea here is that you
should start your meteor app and then it
should like like you'll have a running
media process and then it'll fork off a
background worker and start running
tasks that you needed to run and you're
not really like managing that background
worker necessarily you're just writing
some code that it'll run over there
whenever a job needs to be run yeah that
that's kind of the idea yeah and for us
like here's an example of where we use
it so I just integrated slack into user
cycle so like when certain events happen
in the app it hits a channel just says
hey this user just did this thing and
it's really cool it's fun for the team
because the team can like to be in that
same channel like you know talking about
the activity give us like 18 lines of
code super easy in fact I'm gonna do a
little blog post about just because it's
that easy to do and it's a fun feature
to have and everyones using slack now
but it would take about a sec then took
just send it through the API you know
like it was a noticeable delay when you
had that in the in the flow so like this
is an example of I just popped the job
into the queue though and now it's right
back to the same speed yeah so the more
work you're doing in your app it's not
really important that it happens right
away and offloaded to background job
that's that's um that's where you want
to use it so you know we use it very
liberally and user cycle hence why we
have so many jobs and why we need to use
better cue for it yeah yeah so the only
one I've actually seen in the wild being
used is my current client and they used
power Q which I wasn't familiar with and
honestly like I've only lightly touched
the code just a kind of browse through
it because it was throwing an air during
our our cucumber runs and so it was like
it was stopping cucumber from running
functionally on on the CI server but
yeah really I really have a use it but
power Q seems excuse me pretty stable
and I think pretty self-contained as
well so it's definitely an option there
as well yeah yeah so you do have the
issue of like how does it work in
development you can actually have a
different production strategy versus the
development or testing strategy so yes
it does complicate the app a little bit
in that regard so yeah well they so they
were using it for doing like user
insertion like fixture stuff almost
which is weird because I'd rather just
use like cucumber and velocity has this
notion of fixtures that I can do so I'd
rather do it that way but they already
had it so we used it but speaking of
velocity and like background workers
it's interesting because Sam gave a talk
at dev shop last night I still need to
watch the video Sam a tomb but he has
gotten cucumber jas to the point where
you can tell it how many workers you
want it to run and basically like
velocity spins up throws all the tests
into a queue and then it spins up
mirrors how many of our meters you tell
it to and each mirror just comes back
and says give me a test give me a test
give me in test and so if you spin up
let's say I've got four cores right you
can spin up for workers and
theoretically they should just
distribute across your cores and you
know I can be running for phantom like
NN Phantom jayus based tests all at the
same time well so it's pretty awesome
yeah it's cool that's and that's how
ours works too like you can you can
basically say how many processes to to
spin up and how many jobs do you want
each of those processes to try to run
continued teaneck together at the same
time and usually you know I don't know
if we haven't done much to being to
figure out what the right settings are
you not to that come on yet well that's
the problem but it is
firing up little note processes I think
the main thing that grapes think about
right now with the refactoring is like
do we do really need all of meteor you
know like those processes because we're
actually forking and creating media
processes are really big and heavy so
can we get away with doing just knowed
some extra stuff to make them more
efficient but we'll say it's kind of
nice to have a whole meteor environment
and your worker code yeah i mean yet to
know right like I think for me I would
prefer to have the media environment
like thinking back to what I would have
used a worker like when i wrote sorting
app i was making calls to twitter and
then I wanted to insert that into into
the database and like you know do a
bunch of ranking working that kind of
stuff and like that right there I would
have preferred to have the media
environment available but you know Sam's
done a lot of work to for velocity with
the soft meters and he just uses node to
directly start those up and and then
wrap like a media environment around it
later so that's kind of interesting as
well yeah yeah I think the main the main
thing is it's early days for this stuff
but clap multiple people working on it
it'll it'll be good just gotta give it
some time yeah nice that's all I got
around that I just wanted to mention
that for the twitter user creates their
annual but um get that out there nice
nice yeah so um we don't have any viewer
questions I don't know some people said
they were watching on youtube so they're
not sure how to get the Q&amp;amp;A app working
I think you have to actually be on the
Google+ page and put a comment there and
then I think it shows up in the in the
app for us to answer and so instead I
went to the you know
do the patreon.com / media to club and
if you if you do 10 bucks a month you
get into the slack chat room and it's
getting its getting quite active over
here um and I've got to sasha grey in
here and I've got Stefan whole house in
here as well so just to get some people
in here but to Paul one of the one of
the supporters he asked what's the
average number of trains per hour that
come past your house and I have another
answer to that now because I gave a
training class and Paul took it and he
actually counted how many trains went by
at a four hour period and it was eight
so we're doing to her I think that's
about right so we did we just heard one
a second ago didn't like that yeah we've
done two since we went on the podcast so
maybe a little a little hotter on Friday
apparently Oh run the more cargo nice
all right anything else I don't think so
just we're getting close on the the
meteor club I think we're not quite
halfway to the next podcast goal but we
hit that 250 mark I think we're at like
95 right now if we hit 250 we're gonna
we're going to start a new round table
podcast and I think that'll be a lot of
fun a little longer format more people
so patreon calm me to your club thanks
for tuning in guys won't see a little
bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
