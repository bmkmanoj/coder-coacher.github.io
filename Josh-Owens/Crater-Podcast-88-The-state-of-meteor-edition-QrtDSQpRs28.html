second 2016 welcome crater fans to the
crater podcast i'm your host josh owens
long with my freshly shorn coast Brad
Pitt no I wish nice so if you're
watching the video Ben just got a
haircut yes it's very interesting I like
it it was the first time I ever went to
a hair stylist with a picture of a movie
star no like you see though you see
girls do that all the time but did you
actually like take the time and print
out a picture and you're like like this
print out the picture what am I or what
do you like pointing at your own how
much point in my phone ok ok I'm just
making sure like I want to become a
level effort you went to you yeah just a
quick Google search but still I felt
like I felt like a teenager it was like
yeah yeah I gotta thank Carl Dan eager
from ok grow for talking my wife into
saying I must get this haircut nice
we'll see how how it goes so is your
wife in the okay gross lack then no no
but you know I'm transparent that's what
it is transparent marriage right like
look at what these guys wrote honey
instago that looks okay yeah do it do it
do it now bend do it yeah so so uh first
off we get modulus is back as a sponsor
what Camus modulus she looking for me to
your hosting they're definitely one of
the best options available yes though I
you know I am gonna have a little fun
and poke a little at galaxy with my
upcoming blog post how to build your own
galaxy oh yeah that one should be a fun
fun topic
I wonder how you can go like down the
rabbit hole with that yeah and get like
pretty crazy what I think like you're
the perfect guy to kind of write that
right now because you kind of have the
pieces already and yeah out of time
figuring it out so yeah yeah it's but
it's basically just some configs you
know so it's not too crazy but this week
we're talking about state of meteor oh
that's a thing yeah and wordpress yes
with react graph ql what else we got
yeah node oh yeah she just say no to
isomorphic f it was a buzzword last year
yeah it's like just and it's funny too
because it's like you know now nowadays
it's Universal like Aaron Otis dating
himself by saying isomorphic okay I'm
just kidding uh and using a CDN with
your meat-eor yeah I heard someone
pretty cool wrote that no I is terrible
article terrible I'll tell you a funny
joke when we get to that topic okay
about it all right not joke but just a
coincidence all right so let's dive into
this yes so there wasn't this like blog
post a like didn't get much attention at
all that's why we're going to be
reporting on it totally did not hit
number one on Hacker News did not have a
follow up that hit number one on hacker
news yeah did you read part did you read
part 3 I yeah I did I did read part 3 I
did not spend as much time reading for
threes I probably should have though
part 3 was an easy reader like to some
ified everything that just happened yeah
I think I caught Sasha off guard too
yeah yeah I you know I think that's one
of those things like the title of the
original one I think you know the state
of meteor part 1 what went wrong like
that right there is probably no if you
get you on the hacker news like oh I've
only ever had one story at the top of
news myself and that was meteor killin
rails so you know they do love their
drama I'm gonna rant a little bit just
for like one minute all right all right
like I personally and I'd like to get
you input on it to josh i personally do
not like when supporters of meteor uh
and and sasha is ultimately a supporter
you know part two and all that stuff
like say that stuff because they are and
aaron autos guilty for it as well
because like if they lead with that link
bait right there all of a sudden it like
creates a tone yeah i mean i guess i
would agree on some level but at the
same time like I don't you know you look
at at Sasha's numbers I don't think you
get forty fifty thousand people reading
that post without that title just my
opinion I know but but it gave so much
ammunition to ignorant comments which
you saw I mean it did but at the same
time like a lot of what he said is stuff
that a lot of people have been saying
for a while um I also think I guess it's
like I don't know I get here's the thing
like there's an overall negative tone uh
in meteor with meteor with the community
and all stop sure but yet when you talk
to people and you're like well what are
you going to build your next appt in you
know what do you think is still number
one for node and they're gonna say well
meteor and so it's like well why is
there an overarching negative tone and I
think it's because or I don't know what
it's for it could be a bunch of things
but I just think link baiting like that
or like subtitles like that I will throw
a little bit of gasoline on there when
really we should like probably be
extinguishing it as leaders hmm maybe
you know here's Alexis justified here's
the thing like I would say it would be
completely unjustified if mdg worked
with the community more but they don't
and like you know I wrote that article
and I looked at the contributors versus
commits and I looked at like
multiple multiple open source
communities and their way out of whack
yeah yeah tell us tell everyone the
title they ever tell everyone the title
the article that is a very interesting
article that I thought I left it out
because I haven't put it on crater yet
because like I had mixed feelings about
riding it like i sat on it for almost
two weeks um and later so the title so I
she went into you I showed it to Abby
and like you know obviously it's too
negative don't do it and so Abby said
that yeah and I tried to I you know I
made the second pass and try to make it
more positive but yeah it was like you
know the why meteor development group
needs react and Facebook and no I mean
if he listened to this show I don't
think it comes at any as any surprise
the things that I've been saying on here
like there's no way there's no way
meteor development group becomes a
profitable hosting company off meteor
alone especially if they're the ones
paying for all that work on meteor right
just right you know no one wants them
and they know that too right exactly
yeah but you know in the end I we did
that interview it's gonna come out next
week with Bonnie eisenmann and like just
hearing her talk about the react native
community in the react community and
like how open they are like it just got
me thinking and like I went looked and
they have 6,000 commits and 600
contributors like it's 10 commits for a
contributor on average mom and rails has
like 55,000 or the commits and looking
at writing and they've got almost 3,000
contributors yeah and so that comes out
to be about 18 / committer on average
all right now listen up guys listen up
to the next part say are you gonna talk
about weed here yeah okay now meet here
okay guys listen up to this 15,000
commits 258 contributors that's 58
commits on average and when you go in
and you look any committer that has more
than 58 was paid by mdg anyone that's
below 58 was not
mdg person not an MD G paid employee in
any way it's interesting I I think that
that's my that's one of my new
measurements for like the health of a
community and granted like you go look
at something like rails and David hina
Maya Hansen has the number one commits
and he's at like you know 3900 commits
or something like that right and that's
to be expected like I would expect
people who are strong leaders writing
code to be at the top of that list that
makes total sense to me but the fact
that that average is you know way out
there and to me I would say a healthy
communities probably tops out somewhere
around 25 if you got someone who's
making 3,000 commits that's gonna skew
the averages to be a higher number it is
the fact that rails had a lower number
like speaks even higher well it falls
off pretty drastically to write like if
you look at some older rails core
committers you know they're down in the
like for hundreds and they were there
for like almost two years so yeah you
know I think you know to me it speaks
volumes that I still have more commits
and rails than I do in meteor and that's
not for a lack of track so that I you
know we keep hearing all this stuff
about how they're gonna do better right
we keep hearing it you know back in June
Mackin on the QA and said they're gonna
try to fix all this and you know we keep
hearing sashko talk about you know these
are great ideas we're working on this
stuff but I none of us want to hear
we're working on this stuff we want to
hear how we can help work on this stuff
yes that that's a big thing to me so I'm
not that's why to me that led to Sasha
Lake being validated and saying a lot of
this stuff in my opinion I yeah what he
said was legit i think i'm just i'm
basically judging his article in this
title based off of the response is that
at it conjured on hacker news I mean
then step and that's unfair to him so
I'll have to say sorry is that
but i want I'll agree with you the title
wasn't the best but at the same time
like I still don't I don't think people
would have paid attention if it was like
the state of meteor like where can we
improve like people would be like how
many people read part one that never
worked in meteor before but they read it
cuz those hacker news and then they just
didn't care to read part two yeah but
another their judgment notified that's
the same argument that i give from my
wife like well you know I I need to
discount my book to free in order to get
readers and like but then I'll get them
on my email list and then they like if
they enjoyed that book they'll buy all
my other books I got news for you people
that that download a free book they
don't like to buy books just that's the
truth like converting off of a free list
is terrible in its heart and I think
it's the same thing like I a good
portion of these people would never give
meteor try they didn't like it to begin
with and they were never gonna give it a
fair shake and so they're just they're
playing the pundit role from the outside
arm arm armchair quarterbacking right
backseat driving and uh yeah I don't
know I I'm not too sad that that that
happened yeah I think our community and
yeah yep it's interesting it's just
interesting I I like to stay a
cheerleader sometimes so I don't know
part one came out I didn't enjoy it it
was valid who's valid so but you you
liked part two I very much enjoy part
two yeah what did you like about part
two I don't know now i gotta i read that
like days ago man i gotta go back days
yeah i guess i should like yesterday
should should add this up yes I felt
like this took up all my week goodness
ah check out part 2 so he did he linked
okay part one I loved because I don't
hear a lot of people talk about this
mm-hmm I loved the title says the cure
for JavaScript fatigue yeah I've only
heard like two other people mention it i
100% agree that we are that a lot of
people are like oh what's awesome I
think we found it in the chat room
people are like Oh after like all these
parts are going to be cut out of meteor
what's going to be left you know apparel
is meet Facebook stuff in like there's
gonna be nothing left for for meteor
it's not going to have unique selling
proposition and my response is exactly
this like right now there's JavaScript
fatigue for everyone everyone's bogged
down there confused they're looking for
not only an opinion but something that's
really easy to use and right now stuff
isn't easy to use yeah yeah absolutely i
think if you it's going to roll out on
the stage now like it's gonna be like
meteor the second coming pretty much I
so I think there's like if you look at
react in comparison and the react
ecosystem in comparison right which is
weird because we can we can like tap
into all that stuff now and like we're
getting there with 1.3 will just be able
to say like oh yeah use that NPM package
and that's great no that's that's kind
of bizarre um but we're at this point
where I think that a lot of what's out
there about react is confusing to new
people because there's so much and some
of its kind of crappy like as far as
tutorials and trainings and stuff of
that nature goes um you know peed on
himself came out with a readme almost
like a tiny tiny meteor guides
typewriter yeah we get like that and uh
you know he's like I i went in there
he's still working on it like I think
for him react is definitely a still a
passion project um but you know they
they suffer from different problems yeah
and that's you know in my post I said
the grass may look greener but trust me
it ain't like you're gonna have
different just different problems mm-hmm
maybe those problems look more
attractive to you or you're able to live
with them better and that's a choice you
have to make when you're building
your business uh yeah yeah I um I like
that Sasha said listen like react isn't
as hard as people make it out to be it's
not it's not not once once you like
build one app with it it's like wow
these patterns just like fly out of my
mind now and I could just do it so easy
I thought and you know I've said it
before like I think to me it encourages
a much better practice as far as like
how you structure your view in the front
end you know I think back to like my
Twitter training class and going from
like wanting to share a template between
multiple pages and having to refactor
that like had had just been written and
react I would have written it the
correct way it would have been much more
reusable out of the gate yeah yeah I
think now we're where it spurs out is
like everything that is possible now
with react and it's just like it's
almost like all the stuff got puked out
by the community once react hit Oh what
can we do here and Facebook help with
that you know all the way from more
modular components we're talking about
like test modularity a CSS modularity
and then managing state well if you're
on that and so then that's like I think
that's where fatigue comes in because
all of a sudden like you switch out
react and then you see other
possibilities well you know down to
brass tacks facebook is Facebook right
like how many Facebook's have we had in
the last 10 years 1 &amp;amp; Twitter all right
and most people think Twitter is dying
or failing so I mean I love Twitter who
the hell is building an app at the scale
that Facebook is building an app jack
nobody even Ober is like order of
magnitude smaller I bet so I you know
they're releasing a bunch of best
practices they're putting out a bunch of
libraries that's great for them but that
doesn't mean that it necessarily fits
your startup project yeah i'm glad that
blazes sticking around I want to get a
firmer understanding on what it what
that beings I agree that's kind of why I
put that my post out there because it's
like I still feel like I don't
understand you know I used I took
air with the wording I used in my my
paragraphs they're talking about blaze
because there's questions I need
answered still there is but the other
thing I liked about part two is he
talked about server where components and
this is probably one of my favorite
features of meteor itself and it's the
fact that you can deliver both the
client and the server code wired up in a
way that it all works together you get
the functionality that makes sense and
you know it's in a package that you can
just consume and stick in your
application that's always been the most
powerful feature of medium to me yeah
yep but now it's like going to be
expanding so we're going to be an NPM
world uh well I think the great thing is
will be a layer separation between those
two will have clear separation but
you'll be able to take a react package
and kind of wrap around it and build the
server side piece and get it done and I
think that that's pretty exciting to me
it is because I think there's a lot of
client-side kind of libraries available
for react I think like we feel behind on
a lot of things like a lot of developers
with all this new stuff but at that
point where mpm starts leveling up where
they have a back-end and front-end the
possibilities of that like we've been
living in that world already we have we
have so that's where we're going to be
ahead and we can offer value yeah in
that Erica so yeah should be interesting
mm-hmm okay it's been a lot of time on
those things did I kind of thought we
would to be honest um once you tell us
about Ramsey would add to talk about
Graham's he's awesome and then he like
came out with an art couple articles
about WordPress and then I was like he's
often major experimentation mode right
yeah it's like oh oh you're doing that
he lost a star from me Oh joking
actually WordPress is like fascinating
to me on the bed and Abby show that I
did I made a prediction that we're going
to see WordPress which powers like
twenty five percent of the web move more
and more on the node ecosystem and less
and less on PHP in 2016 so it's just my
prediction and that's pretty cool
because that's just you think like as
JavaScript developers were in the band
now like like WordPress is going to be
bringing like a tidal wave of demand mmm
to us some more and so it is going to be
so rain is he's just on the front end of
that kind of huh I think yeah so Ramsey
works for a consulting firm and I think
he's like he wants to be one of the
first guys there and so it's really
smart these articles are right up the
alley for a lot of people a lot of work
press developers and seeing these
questions and here he is coming out with
these tutorials on how to like wire up
and start your WordPress front-end
working with node serving up the views
and and getting your data to graft well
I think the bigger story is graph ql and
part 2 heat douve into it a lot mm-hmm
if you think about WordPress and like
what makes it slow besides like
advertising it's um it's all the data
that you're going to be pulling down
right and graph cabal is going to like
well it's part of that is generating
that HTML on the server after you fetch
the data right and I think that that's
slower yeah um I think I left my puppy
outside oops oops oops need to run off
man help me out it's uh she's a lavage
29 degrees okay text my wife so yeah I
don't know like I think I don't know I
hate WordPress like when when he has a
site in WordPress I was actually talking
to Ramsey about this very thing and it's
it's like uh um it's just broken I don't
know why it broke I didn't do anything
she didn't do it
thing we just came to a one day and it
was broken that's like that's that's
terrible I should not have a deployed
application on a server that just breaks
yeah who is a developer on that one gosh
she's well you know I spent like 20
minutes trying to to fix it but I have
no idea what I'm doing in PHP land
anymore so but you know when we get
better it's gonna get better yeah it
will but you know I think this is really
interesting just to see like Ramsey
building something with web pack that's
tapping into WordPress and using graph
ql so I thought I was worth mentioning
mm-hmm yep you did an excellent job
giving all the code that you need for
web pack so it's going to like save
everyone like five hours at ya xav Thank
You Ramsay for doing that and it's cool
like all of a sudden now wordpress
developers are going to like really like
get a taste of of like how code loading
and and all that good stuff yeah we just
get out of the box yeah I like the
picture at the bottom to where it's
Indiana Jones saying that belongs in a
museum subtitles us talking about graph
ql in two years probably know hahahaha
all right all right what do we got next
just say no to drugs to drugs I wonder I
wonder if he intentionally tried to
channel that I don't know do they even
have that PSA thing out in Sri Lanka no
that was like an 80s Nancy Reagan thing
wasn't it yeah just so you know yeah so
I also think of like only you can
prevent forest fires good um so
basically he's saying like let's uh oh
he didn't he did mention universal here
maybe we switched it out so he made
editor
he did he did yeah okay that from you
did you give my heart I'm I did not give
him a hard time about it but I notice he
was getting some hard times in the
comments so universal I don't know
Universal apps yeah it's the idea that
you can write it once and it can be used
everywhere including the web iOS Android
you know I ok I don't know I don't know
how I feel like I I really have mixed
feelings about this post I number 1 i'll
say like it it's worth taking a read I'm
just not I have mixed feelings about the
overall message and if we should be
adapting it this was a very opinionated
poet mera nota and and usually we see
like innovative posts from him to see an
opinionated post like the innovative
ones have a sprinkle of opinionation'
and that's cool we can accept it but
this was like kind of like whoa what's
this opinion that you have like I don't
know just stood out to me it sounds like
I stood out to you too yeah yeah totally
and I thought you know I think he's
right um maybe one code base is bad like
I haven't honestly I I haven't had the
pleasure displeasure of like trying to
make this work mom you know the the one
cordova app that i built only had to
work for iOS and like it was okay that
we had iOS design kind of showing up
when people put up the web page because
we're really just for the phones get a
separate reporting an interface and
drupal so I you know I do I know I don't
know that I've ever felt any of these
pains necessarily I would be curious
like I have hopes that at some point I
can use Cordova react native and maybe
get a crater into a mobile app yeah and
I I see benefit like in and being able
to have one code base for the most part
yeah I don't know I'm not sure I buy
into it so I worked on a huge project
that had all three components Android
iOS and web
and uh I could definitely see separating
admin side the website mm-hmm from the
mobile but I can't see separating
android and iOS especially right renova
I I feel like you know the stated goal
of react native is not to write once run
everywhere but at the same time we
talked to Bonnie and she had a pretty I
mean it was a smaller project and she
said you know she had a hundred percent
code reuse on her project she actually
wrote it for iOS it was interesting it
worked completely for Android and I've
heard other people say that they're
looking at like eighty to eighty-five
percent code reuse yeah so that's
realistic yeah I I think that's pretty
great and I think that's a good thing to
shoot for in my opinion so he wasn't so
if you read this post more like he
wasn't saying like oh um you know you're
not going to have code reuse or anything
that I actually after reading the whole
article I do support it and I think he's
saying like just make smarter cuts where
you have your code reuse well he's
basically saying now how things are
moving and you have one package manager
NPM go ahead and make isomorphic or
universal modules or components yeah and
but have standalone platforms that then
import those modules I would I would I
guess I do do that and I like that um
and here's and some people are going to
be like well what's the difference then
and I think the big difference is it's
forcing us to have um more and more of a
package mentality and and we're going to
just explode with publishing stuff if we
build our apps in this kind of way and
our modules are are isomorphic but
they're not like tied to the app they're
like separate imports then what's
stopping us from like just like cleaning
it up a bit and make it a public package
you know and so high I like it it's just
I think again it was
some link bathing ha makes it look
extreme you read it and you're like oh
yeah it's just like a little bit of like
you know you just like move you're like
just moving the goal just a little bit
but not like extremely you know you
still got like isomorphic code you still
got code reuse just in a different way
um it also prepares you for react native
which I think everyone should prepare
from what I'm hearing yes yeah after
last night and then like listening to
Bonnie like you know I didn't dive into
react native one of the big things i
really liked from the bani interview is
like it's not compiled down to like
native code react native it's literally
just JavaScript on the phone executing
native commands and so you could totally
like do hack code push still mmhmm yeah
yeah it sounds like meteors working on
that which is super interesting they
will they will so like I was on the chat
last night and uh when we were watching
uh him did they change the name meteor
nightmare night yeah yes the dev shop I
don't know what I think about that I
like that shot more because you know
what in the chat there is I think there
are some people in there thinking it was
like a meteor talk like they cut it down
years like space meteors uh like there's
like when's the next meteor shower and
so I didn't know like if they were
serious or what anyway hahaha anywho so
sashko was in there and he mentioned
while Martin was given his talk about
Cordova and the changes coming in
version 1.3 of meteor saying that like
Martin's really looking forward to his
next project which is integrating react
native after the Cordova stuff is like
wrapped up for 1.3 yeah
so that's exciting it is exciting and I
think you know 1.3 with its modules for
it makes it a little bit easier to
probably pull it off yes yeah there's
definitely a trajectory here there's
still work that has to be done i think
but through yes absolutely yeah but
anyway you know good article I again
really worth reading take this time yeah
take a look at it yeah sorry we all done
that's it just three stories this week
guys we have an awesome one by our very
own josh owens take a bow i always feel
weird put my own stories on here why i
don't know just out of that I don't like
self-promotion no no okay well I'll
promote you oh there's this awesome blog
that you don't know about but usually
know about it's called josh owens that
me unicorns and rainbows he talks mostly
about rainbows but sometimes about
meteor so this one was using a CDN with
your production media area and before we
dive into it so the funny thing was is
we just like integrated a CDN on okay
grow calm and i we're going to be making
a push to write more articles this year
mmm and this was Karl's first article
for the year he was like working on it
right now Oh Carl it's been you know
honestly like it was half written like I
have so many have written post on my my
machine yeah oh I this was just the easy
one I picked to finish this I was
supposed to come out last week but i was
too lazy well i asked him to compare
notes and like to see like like what he
thought of it and like he was really
impressed with your article so oh there
he goes it's a it's vetted now nice it's
rockin yeah yeah I try to arena by a
couple of people who maybe weren't super
familiar with with CDN and like how that
works and you know again I'm just not a
huge fan of something that's like overly
engineered and I feel like cloudflare is
oh really overly engineered in my
opinion and
okay i get i get that there's valley
concerns that you may want to use
CloudFlare to protect yourself from d
das and all that kind of stuff but nate
I'm like right now you'd have to disable
DDP if you're if you're on their free
plan or you got to pay them like you
know you gotta get out your big check it
right it and send it to him um is it's
expensive but it was like more than the
twenty dollar a month plan I don't know
I don't know what I thought it was like
an enterprise plan to get ssl WebSocket
support is it okay yeah um it is
expensive I I could be wrong I could be
wrong but I'm you know I did I did a
little bit of research I actually did
this project back in August this is how
long I've really been sitting on this
blog post um but you know like at Dean
and I worked on it a little bit and he
found this little this little
undocumented piece of code that we can
call here web app internals prefix es
sjs bundle or whatever it is mm-hmm and
like you just make a car to that give it
a URL and it just shoves that URL in
front of every every little file that it
compiles or spits out and it like
automatically works with package calls
for like assets it works with um the
compiled CSS and Jas and so the great
thing is like you can um you you just
point at a cloud front not cloudflare
cloud front CDN URL and you tell cloud
front where to go find those files on
your website and then you point a cloud
front right so when you go to crater
your look your you're getting some cloud
front URLs you grab it you're going
there and saying like hey I need this
this JS file i need the CSS file giving
this image file and it's gonna like look
and say like oh hey what do we got down
here in our storage and here you go you
can have it if they don't have it that
origin is going to use that origin URL
and come back and grab it off the
website and then serve it back to the
customer so it's almost it's like a
pass-through
caching system but you don't have to
worry about like pre-packaging it
uploading it to the CDN doing any of
that kind of stuff yeah like it's got
all the smarts built-in and meteor has
enough smarts built in with the naming
of the files that you don't have to
worry about like you know things being
cash for too long because it's all like
md5 hash in the you are in the the
naming of the files that kind of thing
though I really enjoyed this article I
like that you separated the concerns
between CloudFlare and cloud front stuff
that people wouldn't really know yeah uh
and it was like it takes like someone
who like went through the trenches and
you summed it up really clearly yeah
well and I I think the key point to is
like um a CDN kind of gives you speed
ups in multiple ways right like today
they have servers that are like all
around the globe and your file gets
pushed all around there so if someone in
India pulls it up and there's a server
that's closed in India they're going to
get it from that server instead of from
you know New York where the craters
rivers hosted and that's that's you know
some speed and then the other great
thing is most people don't realize this
and it's not talked about a lot but
browsers have a you know they I think
they call pipelining per se but they
only open like two parallel connections
on average by default to any given
domain and so when you open up crater if
you look at it like you load something
like six or seven domains and most of my
like we're pulling in images off of the
Twitter CDN or gravatar or crater itself
or now we've got cloud front and so like
those four if you think about those four
if we can open up two connections for
each we're looking at eight connections
to be downloading data simultaneously
whereas if we if we get rid of
cloudflare we're down to six and so now
you've got you know you've got like five
or six files you got a load off the the
crater domain and you can only do it two
at a time so that gives you a little
speed as well yeah
yeah which is huge that adds up quite a
bit yeah it does it does it matters it's
good stuff yeah and so this is probably
going to be like one of the chunks of
building your own galaxy it is uh it's
like I'm thinking about republishing
this on medium as like the speeding up
crater as like a multi-part speeding up
crater series because I there's some
other interesting stuff too like the
indexing order and Mongo apparently
matters I found that out a couple weeks
ago um that's probably worth for writing
up because it's like a log boast about
it and that's it we found out the same
situation in a big project we're working
on but in rails and retina postgres mmm
yeah and so and then I was like oh this
is probably true it's like all indexing
yeah because it goes in order like give
you multiple indexes it does but the
kicker with Mongo is that you have to if
you're using like dollar sign in or
dollar sign greater than or dollar sign
less than that actually needs to come
last even though it's probably in your
query if you're doing like this is more
about sorting actually so if you're
doing sorting and you're using that
dollar sign inquiry you need to do the
selectors you need to do the sorting
fields and then you need to do the field
that you're doing kind of like that that
big search on like dollar sign in right
so there's the lease amount of data hey
you're then doing it yeah well so the
problem becomes like if they even if
it's indexed they grab it let's say you
you asked for 20 things they actually
have to sort in order that in the memory
and that's the key when you do the
explain you know it's sort in order if
it says true that's like terrible um and
it chews up memory it's really slow yeah
so it's going to be good and like I'm
always surprised how big the telescope
world is mm-hmm you know and you look at
Heroku and it's like one of their top
five installs is it really
so it's like really out there there's a
big market out there that people using
telescopes oh yeah so that could be like
a really interesting series yeah I guess
I could just write like a speeding up
telescope series and then just make
millions off being a telescope optimizer
and developer that's not sasha has his
telescope slack and yea big yeah does
don't go halfers on it I haven't
advertised there you go no that's kriti
that sounds terrible like I don't know
that's not my I'm a thing making money
is terrible terrible bad bad bad I want
to do it weighs I enjoy it I guess yeah
yeah ping crabby but totally your
something through some exercises native
that is fun man yeah get the heart pumps
so we watched we watched Everest last
night have you seen this movie I haven't
no it's about the like disaster or like
eight people died sorry spoiler in 1996
um I mean it's a true story it's really
interesting but like we turn it on I'm
almost like doesn't look fun and I'm
like no part of going up to like Everest
looks fun to me like it looks cold it
looks terrible like I have been to
colorado carrying suitcases and that
nearly killed me so I've always said and
I don't know why I live in Chicago but
I've always told my wife I said you know
what it's just much more enjoyable being
more hot than it is being more cold like
I rather like be in a warm spot rather
than in a cold spot yeah great it's just
me and an Everest like yeah I have I met
someone who climbed it like oh and she
was like I mean good for her but I just
would never do it yeah not my thing yeah
all right to you that guy wants your
room I think no way I got this reserved
till five he was scoping you yeah you
give you a haircut whose head Kobe in
maybes worried you're gonna like punch
him or something he goes by again I'm
gonna be like
maybe maybe he looked at you and looked
out the window and to see if he could
see a tank somewhere that's funny
because like my kids came home and they
were like freaked out at my haircut you
were like you know if I come up to them
and like I'm just like like it's scary
man like yeah you look like you're ready
to punch someone yeah it's fun all right
