2015 welcome crater fan I'm your
low-energy host Josh Owen I'm your high
energy host bend Strahan nice hahahaha
and if you watch closely I can shrug and
you can almost not tell the difference
between my beard and my shirt yes and if
you're on the pot listening to the
podcast right now go to youtube and
figure out what he's talking about nice
right on so why are you so tired huh you
know I don't know man I just I just I
was up like shouting at the TV screen
for the Bengals last night I guess cool
eight ball sports at all sports ball I
was watching sports ball very cool rock
and roll I have no idea what that is
yeah mile or not yeah just just call it
sports ball and everyone will understand
very cool yeah you know what talking
about motivation we're gonna be I'm
filming I've been a knobby show later
today and our topic is motivation oh
nice yeah be staying motivated because I
don't know about you but this like
October or I'm sorry this November he's
like starting kind of slow for me
because October just burned me out mmm
October did seem like overly crowded to
me I don't know you know I blame I blame
him DG in there hackathon not really
well I blame a second person too oh no
no I was that was like uplifting and
motivating do everything was awesome
that that's the problem I didn't want to
say no to the hackathon I didn't want to
say no to Space Camp I didn't want to
say no to Halloween I don't want to say
no to all that candy oh that's a problem
yeah it's the real problem right like
we're all shoving our faces full of
children's candy now November's here
November's always a downer for me cuz
cuz my birthday's coming up Oh getting
old huh oh my gosh yeah she'd be like 40
like that 4000 luckily not even close to
40 yeah nice all right so this week we
are talking about scaling at Khedira ah
why why I started teaching people to
code particularly with meteor sideburns
o dot 3 mm-hmm what's up being when
sideburns hits 10 is it like all the way
down speaking of a B architectural tips
for people still writing you I and blaze
you gotta really announced he ate tips
and done j/s done Jay ass don't they're
gonna be done with our podcast when
we're done with talking about that yeah
we're done just gonna drop the mic boom
if you haven't noticed I got a new
computer set up here so you can't see
the mic just off camera fancy again go
to youtube and watch it was it was
spectacular alright so scaling MongoDB
Khedira I found it so I let Ben make the
list this week and it was almost
identical to the list i was going to
make so that was interesting but I I
watched you move stories around and yeah
at first I thought you were gonna tell
this one but then you send me yeah who
did around sorry man no it's all good I
liked it but I thought I thought you're
gonna totally take this one um well
let's let's like go to flow on this one
then oh no I mean I feel comfortable
talking about it I just was interesting
at I thought you were gonna take it okay
uh yeah no no like this so stop just
press pause go read this article it's
worth reading right now I to me like
I've always found this kind of stuff
super fascinating scaling and like
what's involved in scaling because
once you hit traction and you're dealing
with flood of users in your system or
you know in the case of Khedira like
he's just got a lot of data that he's
dealing with right it's scaling is not
always necessarily about going and
fixing this thing mm-hmm sometimes it's
about completely riorca tech ting a
piece of your application and how it
works and so I've had a lot of talks
with Aaron Oda about how their
application works and you know they've
got a node data collector sitting in
front of a separate Mongo database that
stores all the time series data and then
they they use MapReduce to get it all
out and get it into a meteor application
Mongo database that that a meteor apps
working with and so when you connect
you're actually seeing like Cree
aggregated data that's stored in a
meteor Mongo database and then you know
it's it's being crunched and displayed
on screen for you yeah and that's in an
effort to make it super performance in
the different areas that we're talking
about imagine the data that Katara like
gathers and if they had to crunch all
that stuff on the client or through some
like wacky publication none of us would
use it yeah it would just like it would
be unusable yeah totally yeah so you
know I think um there's there's some
good nuggets in here I actually was a
little surprised about the MapReduce
versus aggregation I found aggregation
to be super zippy but I think maybe he's
dealing with an air of magnitude larger
data than I am at the beginning he says
1 billion a day 1 billion metrics a day
is that with her yeah yeah 1 billion won
sir we already have a million dollars
um sorry first thing that came to my
mind to um yeah so you know i think it i
thought it was super interesting that
the aggregation was slow for him and so
they use incremental MapReduce link
that's interesting I didn't even know
that was a feature imago uh and then you
know the other interesting thing so I
totally used to geek out pretty hard on
this stuff and had a show called wet
pulp TV and I used to interview people
at like github or New Relic or different
places I interviewed Jeremy who was
previously he was a offset ready and
then moved on to netflix and we got to
talk about that kind of stuff like the
infrastructure so much cool stuff like I
should find those videos and put him
back up but yeah um yeah like talking to
New Relic which is a similar service uh
they took a similar strategy with their
shorting at you know when a new client
signs on on board the generally they
know how much data is going to be sent
right like that's a constant for them
and so they can just whenever they need
to they just set up a new short and
start putting people on it and I think
they even went as far as they have a
tool so they could like if there were
certain customers that were a little
harder hitting than others like a little
too hot they could like migrate them off
to a different shard so you don't have
too many like people using the
application or the database like and
they're hitting it too hard and it's
making it Nam performant that kind of
stuff um but you know I essentially what
you're doing with this shorting is
creating like little shared pools of
database structure that people can
utilize and I don't know I I think I
think it's a smart way to go and I love
this article very cool it's my so check
it out it Coderre that I owe on their
blog and it should be like the most
recent one for a little bit long
yeah yeah definitely the next up we got
this guy named josh owens he wrote this
this blog post on medium that's getting
some traction called why I started
teaching people to write code and this
is a great article i love articles like
this josh so thank you for writing this
okay yeah what you all awkward i am a
little bit of this plush no but you
can't tell i'm in the shadows um but
this is awesome like people need like to
you know get behind the curtain and see
like really what's going on in someone's
mind and like what motivates them yeah
and in this is like almost like an
advanced talk like once you achieve a
certain level as a developer uh you're
not like working so hard to like stay up
to date and compete and be faster and
faster it's marshman now it's like what
is my legacy going to be and that's what
you tackled in this blog post yeah a
little bit i also wanted to just talk
about like Jim truly as an inspiration
to me and like I don't think I'll ever
achieve even a tenth of what he did in
his lifetime but if you look most of
that you know he was 50 something and
most of that happened in the last 10
years of his life so who knows I mean
yeah that's what I was just gonna say to
you you're young yet maybe maybe crazy
things happen but um you know I went and
looked and like he created rake like
most people have no idea who Jim wyrick
is but when you say rake a lot of people
know what that is like it was the make
tool for Ruby nah and he did an amazing
job with it and he may be adopted the
the node numbering scheme before note
did because he went from like zero nine
to ten point oh pretty funny but you
know he was he was a big inspiration to
me and I think you know it's speaking a
little bit about to been a knobby show
you know you guys talk about a lot of
different topics that new developers
have to think about or deal with or um
you know I I was
a couple years into my Ruby career when
I met him and it's it's just you think
you get to a point like oh I've been
doing this for four or five years like I
pretty much know everything there is to
know but that's just never the case
there's always more there's always more
to learn you should always find someone
that is smarter than you and try to
learn from them and you know just listen
and be respectful and try to be helpful
too I mean I I talked a little bit about
other topics like pair programming and
how that really influenced me I never
paired with Jim particularly but I
paired with some some other guys at
gaslight and like that was also heavily
influential like I'm in JavaScript now
because of pairing I did at gaslight
like i was doing Ruby work started to
get into JavaScript and enjoyed that
like the apps that I was building a lot
more than the stuff I was building with
just straight-up rails and that's what
led me to to meteor and mm-hmm just
decided to to really roll up my sleeves
and start teaching and it's not all
about profit either you know like I try
to do a lot of stuff like this podcast I
I get a little bit of sponsorship but
honestly price sucks up more of my
hourly billing time than the sponsorship
kind of brings in for me so right now I
do a lot of this stuff because i want to
encourage the community to grow and get
bigger around meteor I think you do a
great job yeah I really enjoyed this
this article and just like getting
getting to know you a little bit more
Josh but good nod to me in there unless
you got someone else hired at okay grow
well I'm at those just you whoo but when
I was reading it how you're talking
about Jim I was like oh man that's
that's how I feel about you so oh really
yeah so maybe like in the future rest in
peace josh you know oh good guy no no
not to joke about it but you're doing a
good job one so keep it up uh it's
bit of a longer article and uh no matter
where you are in your dev career I think
it would be beneficial for everyone to
head over to medium and read it because
it it helps you like refocus your energy
and like like kind of like map out where
you want to take your career not only
for yourself but it kind of like helps
you look around you and the community
around you as a whole and what it was
you're gonna what's going to be your
part of that how are you going to help
everyone else so yeah did a great job
Josh thanks yeah and I think it's going
to be part of what's gonna become a
longer series on medium about like core
concepts that I've learned over the
years being a developer that I think are
important and other people should give a
try or learn you know things like meta
programming programming testing like why
are these things important because as a
young guy you're just like ahh this all
sounds stupid like why would someone pay
two guys to sit together and code could
not just get two guys separately working
on different things and get twice the
work and you know that that never works
out no appear prepare programming is
awesome and you you hit it we're like
levels up everyone the code is better
that the clients getting uh and I would
say one more thing like it prevents yak
shaving you know you got you got someone
if you got a good person that you're
pairing with maybe yeah like it's a job
of the person you know he done it for
two years like I'm on vim now because
some yak shaving occurred during a pair
programming session like maybe the Yak
shaving went faster yeah yeah but it was
definitely different I think than what
you think but okay okay in my experience
so far it has yeah but at the same time
I'm a very conversational person right
oh that takes up a little bit of time to
do if I'm working on that when I pair
yeah I mean it saw a pair of guys that
are very very focused and guys that are
very
conversational and actually think that
as long as you are pairing with someone
who can converse and type at the same
time I think you're okay oh I can't yeah
we're not okay if you if you're working
with a get like I can type in target to
save time and kind of work through and
half listen you know and I that that
never seemed to bother me too much dad
is a gift my gosh I I just need that for
my marriage that's right maybe that's
why I'm good at it oh oh gosh what is
that my big lonely bed skill so bad oh
alright okay I'm getting worse about it
though like it's it's it's fading I
don't know age ya brain power is is
listening I guess I don't know alright
uh sideburns zero that three this is
very very interesting to me yeah and so
if you haven't paid attention
essentially what's happening is instead
of using handlebars order I guess space
bars now under the covers Oh it uses
react so we've got the blaze API we're
writing our HTML templates and our
helpers you know we've still got that
separation but then sideburns is
bringing it all together and rendering
out these react templates that are being
pushed in and frankly I think if if
you've never really looked at compiled
space bars code then you probably have
no idea what we're even talking about
and you know this this could be this is
an interesting way to get a bunch of
things accomplished so we get to keep
the blaze API which is real friendly
super like starter friendly stuff and
but you also get the server side
rendering and some performance stuff and
just really really interesting
implications there yeah for the place
community and this is one of the things
that sashko has been
kind of advocating for is let's just
build on top of the react compiler and
use blaze and so the link in the show
notes will take you to a soundless video
but he'll show you kind of writing a
side burns version and a regular blaze
meteor version and you know in that in
the front end they look exactly the same
and you have to inspect the code and
then you see all that ugly react kind of
extra HTML stuff attached but I mean
it's it's it's all there I mean it's
working correctly and it looks the same
to the developer which is the important
thing so this is interesting so like
when would I use this in the real world
and I think to myself well I want to get
an MVP going or hackathon and I want to
use blades it's like just like faster
less thinking well could be in my sleep
writing plays yeah and i think the the
interesting thing that happens because
you're building on react instead of
space bars is that you no longer have to
really worry about maintaining a certain
pieces of that part of the framework
right you're really just maintaining
kind of the templating api a little bit
and then you know under the covers as
react improves theoretically you're just
gaining those improvements as well
mm-hmm or if your project takes off then
you know you could you have react under
the under the hood already yeah well I
you know I would question why switch you
know at that point hmm I mean
theoretically I so one of the reasons
that I hear a lot of people switch to
react is one speed on the client mm-hmm
but you're already going to get that
because you're compiling down to react
anyway mm-hmm so the only other reason
to do it would just be because of how
like you structure your application
and blaze vs right act yeah and done by
like a team growing a project cool I
hear there are ways there are ways that
we can structure our blaze stuff our get
actually no hmm what an awesome Segway
Josh that's awesome so like our boy Abby
ire from the Benin Abby show I actually
he's really from work pop ohh la Venice
Beach but he wrote this awesome medium
post called architectural tips for
people still using ui in blaze oh and it
tackles just like what you're saying
like how can we start structuring our
app in an awesome way so we could start
being prepared to use different UI
frameworks in the future there was a way
to write blaze apps when when when I
first came out and we had iron router
and we would put subscriptions in the
route since then times have changed and
we have a better way of writing apps of
better best practices and I can't really
think of a place where those best
practices have been summed up so well
for blaze except for in this article and
so it's pretty awesome that obvious what
do you write two days ago I'll go to
medium and search for it you know
architectural tips for people still
using blaze and let's go down the list
really quick I'm like what is like doing
here first office this guy has
experience just because of the size of
team that they're working with and says
the app yeah yep the app is huge so
first I don't abuse session I'm done duh
and he put that first because people use
session everywhere yes and way too much
and and there's ramifications for use in
session to a big ramifications for rear
end during your UI Oh basically use
reactive bars
and sculpt them to your template you
know where sessions are our mobiles
they're all over the place so well yeah
so the big problem there is that if
you're not thinking about it you're not
destroying the session variables and
maybe they're going to hang around in
memory and that that's gonna like do
weird things your application as well so
that's to me that's the hardest part of
using session is figuring out where
exactly to destroy it or kill it or
reinitialize it or whatever you're going
to do and if you use reactive or is it
scoped to the life of the templates when
the template goes away just you know
your react or is gone and next time you
start it up you get a new reactive are
and there are times to use session
session is a good tool like we're not
just like saying don't use it but um
absolutely late you know I've for
instance probably the single best use
I've ever done and I backed it with
local stores as well to make it even
better because we're having issues with
hot code push but uh in fantasy hub you
know you're in there kind of doing that
daily fantasy juggle picking you've got
salary cap and you got to pick out
players that fit within your salary cap
and fill out an entire team and you know
that that's like a 20-30 minute process
maybe if you're really into it and you
know that that's the kind of thing that
I think sessions good for yeah exactly
and we had one of our most popular
packages at ok grow is persistent
session that's the one yep so and that
will have your data persist pet through
hot code pushes and it is when we use it
in our apps it is like a lifesaver so
like we're not cuckooing it but just
understand take the time to to analyze
these different tools that you have at
your disposal reactive aren't session
and once you study it then you'll be
able to know which one to pick second
one is smart components dumb components
and this is like something that they
took from from the react landscape
where you're going to be doing template
level subscriptions which means that
you're going to bring in data in at your
template level not at your router level
and you're going to feed it down to the
lower templates that data goes down and
you got one smart component one thing
that has that has everything and then
you just feed the rest down to the other
components to dumb ones yeah so since I
this is a smart way to do it I teach a
similar concept in mastering meteor and
I need to update the videos because the
videos don't quite cover it but you know
it's the idea that you have tweets that
are being reused everywhere and so you
know you have rapper containers that
pull in the tweets that you care about
make that subscription and then you can
reuse the kind of the tweet container
that displays all the tweets out you
know and it doesn't kit like you just
feed the tweet container the tweets and
it'll do the right thing the wrapper is
the smart component and its handling
fetching the correct data for that
particular template yeah set up we go
yeah and again uh yeah I guess like this
is what really makes this article good
is that he does a brief description on
these big subjects that you can like go
out and study and learn and try and
figure out and break things and rebuild
it and he's like just like packaging up
into a small paragraph to get you
interested mm-hm and it's going to make
a huge impact on the stuff that you
built and the next one that he has is
stay away from the this a pasture data
context from top downs next yeah we kind
of yeah I guess we did talk about it
yeah yeah I'm reading a long as you're
doing it hahaha but this is interesting
and we in the media club chat there was
a little bit of talk about this um we
talked about this staying away from this
that uh so hard to miss this this what
this what would life
little segue I was at starbucks today
and my fingers are all greasy from I
don't know what I was eating like a
cinnamon pastry that they have and I
looked out of my keyboard and like all
my greasy keys and I'll stuff right and
guess what the greasiest he was it was
the tea so I'm she typed this a lot ok
this too much oh my gosh been busted
anyway the conversation went was like
people were asking like what's the big
deal about this Abby um you know Abby
was saying I used blaze get data or
template instance to get your data in
rather than using this and the helpers
right and for this on render on creating
all that jazz and he basically said it
comes down to having it be more readable
for the people who come in to your team
people are going to contribute to your
code they're not going to mesh it up if
you're like writing it out like that get
data or template instance if you have
this that's kind of like a black hole
most of us feel like we're confident
that that we know what's there but do we
really know what's there and someone
screwed up yeah yeah I mean it's hard
you know and then like you and I talked
in the chat room and you're like I don't
understand I'm using es6 syntax and I
did the Pharaoh yep and like I can't
call this dot uh subscribe anymore like
what's working what's wrong with this
crap and I'm like that's because the fat
arrow changes the entire context of this
when you use it like it brings in the
outside this scope into the inside of
your function and for like on created
and stuff that's not what you want at
all and that's not readily apparent like
you gotta throw a debugger in there and
then say like type out this and look at
it and like that is a problem the fact
that I have to stop throat a bugger in
and spend two minutes trying to wasabi's
favorite term reason about what this is
then you know that that's that's lost
time and that's a frustration so
I totally get where he's coming from
with this I that was probably like one
of the most frustrating things I like
why I thought Java scripts are supposed
to get better with es2015 and rafta bad
I'm like I feel like such a knob yeah I
don't know I don't want this to turn
into an es2015 ramp but I I tweeted the
day I figured this out as well and I'm
like why oh why did they only bring in
half of the CoffeeScript conventions
that makes no sense to me yes because
there is a convention for a skinny arrow
would keep the context correctly but
gives you the shorthand and I feel like
a lot of people sell the fat arrow a
shorthand but in reality it's not it's a
scope cetera not not shorthand yeah yeah
anyway so someone needs a swift kick in
the pants on over iqbal and it just
echoes what Abby wrote here you know
stay away from this yeah it's it's yeah
it can be confusing you know mm-hmm uh
next thing is really short but to the
point stop subscribing in the router
boom just stop it yeah no reason to do
it and most likely you're using a weight
on because you're using iron router and
you've read a tutorial that told you to
do it and it's terrible like people just
have to sit there staring at a blank
page until your data comes across yeah
it's terrible it is give them give them
at least something put a loader
something I don't know it'll be better I
promise oh you know what he should a
totally linked to soft goes medium post
on that when he first hands introduced
it yeah I might add that to his medium
yeah because that was a great one
remember that mmhmm yeah yeah next is
encapsulating I think we're spending too
much time on this but man this this
bother so good knows a good post I don't
mind really is the last one is
encapsulate your components with CSS
selectors and I recently had a project
with okay grow where we're
building a platform for people to make
native mobile apps and so yeah we're
making hundreds of mobile apps that are
unique to to these businesses and we
give them the option to like kind of
like color pic feature pick all that
stuff right and so we got to encapsulate
the CSS and this is this is similar to
what we are doing and it's awesome it's
it's how I kinda adopted this now as a
standard for all apps after I did this
project and now he came out with with
this best practice and it's great and I
know there's a lot of work going on gosh
I feel like a knob someone like shared
something with me about like react and
what they're doing with CSS or what some
people are proposing do you talk about
CSS modules or something that what it is
I'm not sure if it's if that was it
possibly but I so it's the idea like
same as JavaScript modules it's just
something like you can rely on the thing
you need at the time you need it and
it'll bring in that little bit of CSS or
that little bit of JavaScript and so
rather than having this one giant
tarball of monolithic here's everything
you may ever need and we'll just make it
all available to you like you can you
can instead just rely on the few things
you need and and hopefully make that
page load a little faster yeah that's my
understanding of it yeah and that's a
must like CSS when we when we go to do
performance ranking on on our apps CSS
is usually always up there with it's
something that we have to be debugging
to gain more performance just like the
rendering of it and like yeah fun stuff
I love CSS all hail CSS I hate oh yeah
definitely like check this article out
guys I pay other people to deal with CSS
for me yes Amanda's awesome yes yes all
right so but now that we're done with
that Arctic we're done we're done we're
done with media we're going to done j/s
ah is that what you meant to say no I'd
look at this and its really really
interesting it looks like someone
literally opened up the what meteor
doesn't do list and then jotted it all
down and put it together and said oh
here we go we just built a new framework
that does all the things that meteor
doesn't do but it's real time so it's
it's real time server-side rendered they
have progressively loading bundles from
a CDN which I I'm like I'm about a third
done with my CDN article I should finish
uh and runs is a mobile application a
desktop application and a web
application test top what I'm guessing
electron I didn't get quite that deep
into it yeah um yeah I don't know like
the progressive loading and the server
side rendering or super interesting
because you get like a much better what
do they call that like time to first
byte um or really it's just time to
first renders probably a little bit
faster and it's gonna feel like a
slightly better experience which is huge
which is a huge issue with meteor mmhmm
yeah I think it's a huge issue with
blaze not a huge issue with meteor per
se okay so i think i think this allows
modules is coming yeah there they are
and that'll that'll help some but in
reality you know we I think we yeah
there could be optimizations done there
in my opinion yeah um and modules will
help some um yeah I don't know like it
it looks interesting I I did not play
with it honestly I just don't have time
to play with something like this right
now um oddly enough when I was leaving
differential these this is one of the
teams that I interviewed with and I
ultimately ended up deciding not to go
with them because they weren't using
meteor and they weren't interested in
meteor but clearly they were interested
in the eye
you know meteorite because they went out
and rebuilt they had can j/s before and
so I've kind of taken that and built on
top of it which you know i think is is
smart and an interesting thing to do and
does this use feathers Jas no it doesn't
but we were talking in the media club
slack room Niall was actually saying
that you could probably use the two
together and have a compelling story
there so yeah because I know we started
reaching out to like get some
cross-pollination going in Chicago with
some other teams in Chicago and you know
we're like saying hey yo meteor this
meteor that and what people came back
and said well we've his feathers a lot
of times which was surprising yeah so
and now this came out and you know you
know everyone knew this was happening
like the industry was moving this
direction mm-hmm meteor was the first
one to come out and they took over
everything and uh it's gonna be
interesting how how different different
like libraries come out and how they
interpret how the the modern stack
should be you know yeah yeah but I still
think like I don't know this doesn't to
me this one doesn't feel like it could
necessarily be a long-term winner like I
think they'll be able to build a smaller
community around it and I community will
be passionate no moving or but you know
overall they don't have the mindset or
the early market kind of capture like
meteor I think had early market share
whereas Facebook has a much broader team
and reaching people paying attention to
it so you know the stuff that their
doings can also be interesting whereas I
think you know to me this is uh I don't
know but I mean it's made by a bit Toby
right mmm and and maintained by them I
mean they have some
pretty they work for some pretty large
energy plants they do and so that that
might be like you know chopping into
what mdg wants to be tackling to maybe
maybe you're tackling it totally
different so you're right about the
mindset yeah we could really interesting
going yeah well I think they come at it
from like if you look at me to your
meteors like let's just throw everything
out its kind of start over and have a
different approach to it whereas I think
what you're seeing from BtoB is like
well let's take things we've done before
and incrementally start to change them
in a different way you know and i think
you to me it's like what is it jakob
nielsen the design guy i think i think
that's his last name talks about like a
bee testing can only ever take you so
far because your design is still based
on certain opinions where is like
completely redesigning a site could get
you an order of magnitude better results
on something because you you're
completely changing the approach to
something so i know it's interesting
yourself bro oops you got so excited I
did I did maybe I graduate or you're
swearing I leaned in on the space bar no
I'm just kidding um I just think uh you
know I I guess I am biased and probably
agree with meteors ideals and thoughts
here but me too why are you interested
enough to try done Jas I'm not know I
think I might this article did not
convince me I went to the done Jes
website and that's like kind of like
what's really done Jes calm mmm it
sounds like dungeon we're saying dungeon
and Rios anyway so now that we're done
with the show any news this week with
media club news with meteor club yeah
anything i don't know i got news for ok
girl i wanna share nice ya know so wendy
and i were uh we finally recovered from
space camp and so we started looking
around for another venue to have space
camp two point oh yeah yeah and we're
pretty excited about that awesome host i
am really glad that the community has
you guys and that like we're gonna do
this again it was so much fun yeah well
in you know my hope is we're looking at
places that can house 50 to 60 65 people
the place i really want has room for at
least 65 and I don't know like I thought
I thought meteor needed a conference in
we we had a slightly meteor focus
conference but at this point I feel like
um let's just all get together and swap
knowledge and you know if we have a talk
on done Jess or fine talks on react like
I more power to him if that's the way
the we end up moving so yeah actually
looking at a different domain name as
well that's just like space camp and
let's we're gonna drop meteor from the
name ah interesting yeah
yeah I mean ultimately the real value of
space camp when we are in Tennessee was
the group was a people man we got
together so well everyone and it was
just so neat happen with people playing
games with people getting to know like
that's where the real value is well in
any particular framework like not to to
like point now stuff you did but the
money bought stuff you know like you you
talk about I I just asked you the other
day like how much money have you made
with it you're like wow you know I made
acts but I haven't done it in a while
because it's so kind of a time-consuming
process and then today in the media club
side chat room in the in the money but
room you were talking about money bought
and how it gets really taken out the
most time-consuming process of trading
for you yeah um and for those who don't
know we built money but I started
building it on the road trip down to
Space Camp again showed it the first day
get got some interest and there was a
team of like four or five of us there
like at least five people up there
hacking during the hackathon on money
but yeah and like you're still going you
know like you you've got people think
most of those people were in the chat
room to begin with but yeah got a room
and you guys are coordinating and
building something interesting a meteor
and that's awesome yeah yeah ultimately
there's too many cool stuff going on my
family's big I don't want to spend time
making money right spent time akin mine
anyway like yeah so this is all that
that is like I'm stoked about that but
but the friendship is like what I'm even
more stoked about so I told windy we
could probably just throw out all the
programming stuff and just have a
board-gaming weekend oh my and probably
like still sell out and everyone would
have an amazing time I was thinking that
if we could like automated a little bit
more would beat would be like easier for
you guys to plan it yeah we should have
this like every six months well so I
just like you like poke around i
throttled windy back she was she was
looking at like march as a potential
date so I'm like yeah I don't know
that that seems like soon yeah anywho
I'm stoked about that that's good stuff
yeah yeah and another thing that I'm
stoked about that I'm not part of but ok
grow is doing another training camp in
Toronto oh nice on-site right on-site
training yep by Paul dalman and I think
Carl who's going to be there as well
please cost some front-end guy and Paul
is just a legit genius i think i am i am
so impressed with Paul's capacities just
like like everything that's going on and
ok girl he's able to step in in a few
seconds understand like issues that are
going on and I'm not really killer
advice on how to it's not something I'm
like how does I do it I've been racking
my brain for two hours on this problem
yeah so but uh well this is why it's
good to pair right yeah and so I one of
the biggest like benefits of working for
ok grow is to work with people
side-by-side comparison I love working
with Paul I love working with Tony and
Richard and Carl and those guys are
awesome and I guess that's why I'm like
excited about this class that they're
doing mmm cuz now it's pretty affordable
and people can get in and and work with
these guys side by side you know and you
know Paul really well is once you become
friends with Paul like he's there for
you you know I keep you have questions
and stuff and super helpful like all
Canadians are is that is that why people
like me I'm had a median are you really
have Canadian yeah no way yeah come on
in Calgary that is wild that is why I am
finding that I'm really good friends
with people who are like Canadian haha I
grew up going to Canada every summer
like we have a family cabin up there oh
that's that's he hands pretty funny yeah
my wife's from Canada my grandparents
were born in Didsbury
they moved to California when my mom was
like mmm five or six and so she grew up
as a green card Italian in California so
she really didn't know can at all that
much but my grandparents moved back when
I was like maybe 10 and so we used to go
up to canada for the summer as well for
like a week or two and hang out they
would like take us they were in they
were outside of Calgary so you know I
did the Calgary Stampede and I've been
to BF and all kinds of amazing things
Canada's awesome yes it is I'm trying to
find the date for this oh the the boot
camp ice yeah well they can just find it
if they go to a kegger over I think we
need to go and find it yeah I think I
think this is like a little like um a
little hunt you had a hunt for this if
you want to learn meteor it's gonna be a
little work oh we don't have a blog post
up so you go oh you sure you prematurely
uh announced it I don't know um I think
we have it up on me oh my gosh you guys
need a blog oh that's cool that's coming
out like we just finished building our
media react blog it's not live yet get
that sucker out it's done man it's done
and we're gonna be a pulling out all
that logic into a package nice it is
really nice neat stuff I'd like that
yeah because I mean you know the one
thing you can turn yourself with with a
blog is SEO and you can handle that for
you yeah so it's exciting stuff and then
just like how we handle images and it's
like a it's definitely for developers
off mmm oh right and mark down and you
don't have a GUI a super simple oh yeah
that's you know that's one of the things
that drives me nuts about medium like
like I spent 20 minutes getting
everything I read everything in markdown
and when I decided to publish an article
on mediums like
you spend all the time like taking all
the markdown out and putting it into
medium format and yes if medium fix that
I would write more yeah it is the 10
come on yes that is the one hurdle and
it you know just don't make it the
default but make me press a button I
know maybe they have it and I just
haven't found it cool alright well
thanks for tuning in tune in again next
week so we talk about all things crater

club and join up there and i still
maintain we are not the biggest meteor
stock chat room but we're definitely the
most awesome where we have we are 211
people awesome yeah and i gotta say
today i was surfing around all the other
way all the other media related psych
chat rooms i'm part of their all dead
mm-hmm she's just a lot of quietness I
think I think Ryan Glover maybe has the
second most active um but he's you know
he's got like 500 something people and I
still think they're like order magnitude
less I don't know maybe that's a bad
thing but if you got a question you
probably get an answer on me to your
club suck chat yeah well you definitely
have like a lot more experienced people
and I'm really impressed at that you are
stay so current with it that's a big
thing like if there's a facilitator of a
slack room like how involved are they
because it does take up a lot of time
I'm
for two of old you hey that is like a
big selling point though I use rescue
time and it tells me every week oh my
God look at all the billables you didn't
do cuz you're in a flak pretty funny it
