host Josh owns along with my co-host
today Ramsey welcome Ramsey hey Josh and
a special guest co-host taking Ben's
place Abby welcome Bobby hey guys I de
and our guest today is Dan Abramoff did
i say that right yeah that's right hi
everyone what welcome to the show again
thank you really glad you could make it
today um so yeah we you know I've been
wanting to have you on the show for a
while I've just been kind of following
what you're what you're doing and uh so
you wrote redux which is a popular
implementation of flux pattern that
Facebook put out is that right yep can
you talk a little bit about redox yeah
sure so I actually did not intended to
be a library like a real library so I
was preparing for a talk last year at
reactor Europe called hot reloading with
John travel this isn't like my pet
project I've always been interested in
the interactive development experience
and being able to write code and press
they even and seeing the results right
in the browser immediately like in
victor videos and so I was working on
this bad project called record holder
which is a tool that implements this
kind of workflow for air components
where you just edit them and see the
changes immediately and I wanted to make
it talk about this but I figured that I
like a lot of time I spend tweaking the
UI but I also tweak the logic a lot of
time and the problem is that these kind
of changes are really hard to do have
the same experience with so i was
looking at how can we um have the same
kind of developer experience but with
with the logic and
i was using flux quite heavily in the
last stop was working on because it was
a pretty complicated single page app
with lots of client-side up the logic
lots of like optimistic mutations and I
you know being able to edit something
locally and and is reflected remotely
and so I was working on the logic a lot
and redox is kind of like just up my
attempt to simplify the Fox pattern
deposit I didn't like about it to make
it more composable because i often
wanted to extract some parts of the
logic and if we use them several times
but it's kind of hard with fox whores
but if everything is a function it's
actually pretty easy because you have
high order functions functions returning
functions and so on so this is like my
attempt to do in this and i also had a
ton of input from andrew clark who is a
co-author of redux and he he helped me
shape it before the talk and so i gave
this talk and where this relax library
was just like a helper t make the top
possible but it grew very popular since
then and i reached the money on ERISA
money on patreon she worked on the
documentation examples so I've been
working just on that for three months
and then I joined facebook so i don't
work on redux as much anymore but on the
other hand i don't really plan any big
changes so it's pretty stable that's
kind of awesome I bet you know when you
wrote that you had no idea that Facebook
would reach out to you wanna hire you
huh wait we kind of talked a little bit
face before Redux actually because I was
kind of visible in the reactor co system
and I wanted to land the job there to
walk and react but they didn't have any
openings in UK and I could I can't get
to yes because of the visa and I also
don't want to live in you guys very much
so being hard in London it's like the
best
very grateful that this happened that's
awesome like I think I think Facebook
does go after people who like make
strides in the community right like
Sebastian Mackenzie with Babel
definitely read apps do you think that
excuse me do you think that the types of
problems you're solving now well are a
lot easier because you went through the
whole redox journey that you've been on
like are they different class of
problems there are yeah i mean i'm
working on the react team now so i kinda
know react as user I don't know it as
well as like the internals and it
definitely helps to have some experience
with open source like with maintaining a
really popular library just because you
know all the boring stuff like how to
cut releases how to you can attest
things how to interact with the
community how to manage ages and this
kind of stuff so yeah I definitely
helped it definitely gave me a bigger
perspective and also up like Redux is
one of the ways to manage state in your
reactor or angular or whatever
application but there are also other
alternative ways that are vastly
different like mo backs for example so
it's based on the opposite principle
where everything is mutable but the
dependencies attract so only only things
that need to rerender rear-ender so it
helps to gonna have perspective on a
deep perspective on one side of how
things can be done because you know both
the app sighs and the downsides of that
and you can evaluate other solutions
with a cleaner mind I'd say so what's a
what's stopping facebook from just
saying hey all of our facebook apps are
starting to use we deaths or like which
i'm sure a lot are right but yet there's
still a flux page in the facebook
documentation right yeah sure so up
first of all facebook has a giant code
base is like there is a
products some of them internal some of
them are like for advertisers so use a
user for example might not really face
them but they exist and there's a ton of
code there and nobody's going to rewrite
it just for the sake of rewriting it so
uh there's that and then there's a so
Facebook has a really large scale or
even like on the client-side
applications there's a ton of data these
are very complex dependencies very
complex entities that reference each
other and so on and so really is
probably a better fit for facebook in
many cases and when they have only local
data they sometimes like they're trying
Redux on some small projects but there
are some problems like one of the
problems is that again they have
existing complicated code bases that fly
on fox patterns such as wait for
dependencies between stores and it can
get tricky to refactor to read acts
unless you're writing in redox first so
this is one thing and another thing is
that they do a lot of dynamic code
loading and this is actually like an
unsolved problem both with fox with and
redux so relax doesn't really help solve
it if some dynamically loaded store or
reducer mrs. some actions that happen
before it was loaded is going to be in
an inconsistent state so these are they
have like bigger problems than choosing
the flavor of flux button I guess but
they do use it occasionally cool man hey
then also imagine relay how much did
Redux influence any part of relay or
there any similarities there well I
don't think I don't think they're there
are any similarities now and I don't
think it has influenced really in any
way at this point um in the future it's
not so clear and I don't really know you
probably want to invite somebody like
Joe savona in to tell me about this
I know that relay team is experimenting
with different kinds of like specifying
local mutations and this is definitely
planned and it may since Facebook is
using Fox a lot and relax a little it
may make sense that some kind of local
mutations are also expressed as actions
and maybe a some kind of graphical
schema can be can be described together
with some reducers but again this is
very theoretical I don't really work on
this and I don't know if anybody's
working on it right now but yeah it's
just space to watch I'm sure we'll have
some exciting solutions like in a year
on year and a half and I know there's
some stuff like enclosure script land
that there is oh next which people often
compared to really so yeah I can't
really give a good answer here that's
not thanks Rick like that so like in the
meteor sorry in the media community um a
lot of people weren't so into react in
the beginning and that's because meteor
had shipped around like front-end
framework that was based on templates is
called blades and in in our recent
versions where we're finally using like
es6 modules and stuff we were very
behind for a little bit which is one of
the biggest complaints about meteor was
there was no there was no sense of of
modules and you have to solve these low
daughter dependencies by using global
namespaces under a weird alphabetical by
ordering variables and it would be super
weird it's very weird anyone outside
they read a the react community or even
in the broader j/s committee would look
in and be like that's so we reuse
webpack and we were doing this for four
months without without right without
this like this need for like craziness
and even you know just just last month
is when we
that release where now there's these
there's native npm install things that
most developers already have and when
that came react and that came a huge
surge of people wanting to go to react
because all the tooling and stuff really
integrated well with the meteor build
tool so that's one thing that meteor has
going for it is it manages the whole
build process of your application along
with you know the package manager and
stuff like that so allows people didn't
like just start go without having to
worry with all the tooling overhead so
all these people are getting into react
and now there's a huge debate about
state management some people want to use
the meteor state management and it's its
way of doing reactive state other people
like myself have been going hey go Redux
way because most is you know there's a
huge following and it plays really nice
with meteor apps but it's it's crazy to
see that the most most like that most
people say in the media community what
they don't like about Redux is the
overhead of managing easy state and I
was wondering if you could touch on that
like have you heard that have you heard
that from people before that it's so
much work to do something very simple
but it's the same amount of work to do
something hard yeah definitely uh I'd
say that like with any tool you need to
balance and it's especially important in
cases when like 44 EDX I sonic marketing
a it as something for people who already
know Flux and if you already know its
weaknesses and its strengths and they
know our kind of what works well and
what doesn't work well but as it will
explode in popularity what happens is
that people are people try to solve all
the kinds of problems with it that it
doesn't actually solve or isn't supposed
self or doesn't so well and we recently
added a good section on the website
frequently asked questions so there's a
bunch of stuff there that people used to
ask us for like the past six months and
a I think it document some some of these
answers like when we want to put
something in local state for example as
opposed to global safe while the answer
is simple if it takes a lot of work to
put something to global seed don't do it
put it in local see if in then find out
that it's a lot of work to maintain it
in the local straight with into global
state so this is really unless all my
case by case basis and you look at like
how much code i have to write either way
and how I expect this code to evolve
like if i give this trade it is this a
bottom like a drop down and in this case
the state is not going to be used
anywhere else in the app so why would
you bother to like move it to redux but
on the other hand like if this is a
casually its or fetch the fetch data and
info that you have the same date on a
different page and you know that if you
want to press back you wanted to
immediately load so we want it to be
cached and you want it to be paginate it
and you want there to be optimistic
mutations and in this case probably
putting it into the component local
street is not such a great idea although
it can work as well if you use some kind
of cash in on the data feticide so if
you use something like data loader to
like make fake something that looks like
ajax request but it's actually fulfilled
from the cash again maybe you don't need
uh maybe you'd only need three ducks but
if you need local meeting this is where
it gets complicated yeah it's
complicated in like siamo exactly agree
with everything you just said like you
have to make that decision on a
case-to-case basis because not all state
is equal application but the issue is
when people are getting into a tool or
maybe they just want to move they won't
have a really high productivity they
don't want to make that choice they just
want to know that they can do the same
thing over and over again and achieve a
lot of productivity but with the thing
with readouts and a state management you
have to think about you want you to
think right
think you need to be like well what what
is this actually representing is the
application but people I feel like
that's one of the biggest things but
learning Redux is the fact that you you
can't kind of like just put it in cruise
control and continue to do the same
pattern that is recommended and she has
for everything yeah I agree it's pretty
low level in this in this regard and
there's great post by am chat I think
it's called overcoming intuition in
programming so this is something I
recommend to read is great post about
how I briefs have the positive space the
space of the problems that they solve
and the negative space which is
everything else and the problem with
learning any library is that you don't
know what is in the negative space and
so you might just you at the problem
that the library has like an intuitive
way to so something that it doesn't
actually have and you need to I think
experience is a knowin where negative
space of each libraries and knowing uh
when you have to be in the cruise
control mode when you just do the thing
whatever you don't think much and when
we have to switch to hey I need to take
a look at the whole picture doesn't make
sense am i doing the right thing so this
is the kind of thing that comes with
experience I think yeah yeah and then
with the state the state the state
confusion gets even even more complex as
people are mixing weather out there
doing isomorphic apps where they're
mixing a lot of like server logic with
the client logic and this whole state
decision becomes a huge hassle when
especially like here's an example like
in our meteor apps meteor ship something
called mini model it's a local state
collection purely for server-side state
so anything I get from the server will
be stored here and then then like you
have your Redux store and you have all
the client-side state and to me I think
that's a great separation um if you have
a really complex app it's nice to
separate like okay here's all the stuff
in the server is in the client but a lot
of a lot of people are really wanting a
way to just manage them both in one
store right you can do that today
by using like you know asynchronous
actions and stuff like that but people
want like especially for us who they're
already getting the server-side state in
some cash they want to mix everything
together into your just one store what
do you think about that because I think
people in the redox relay community also
like to have some type of connection
between relay and relapse or use both of
them at the same time so I think it's a
very close parable right there what's
your opinion on a server-side state and
client-side state and how they interact
yeah that's a great question um again I
don't think I have a good answer this is
like this is one of the cases that I
hope some library will solve for either
relay or some smaller apart the overlay
that is going to be extracted from it or
something but what I think is that in
redox for example you often want to to
keep the server fetch data together with
a client-side data just because you want
to keep the same paradigm like for
example if you have after optimistic
mutations and you want to insert
something into the list but then send a
request and if it fails to remove it
again or merge with the new entities
that have been fetched so if you want
this kind of granular control over what
is in your state you want to write some
producers for this at at this point you
want to use the Redux for this on the on
the other hand if there is a tool that
completely automates pagination
optimistic updates and this kind of
stuff it can probably leave in a
separate cash but you also often want to
have some client data attached to server
data like for example if there is a post
and you're editing it so you have a
draft attached that is logically
attached to this supposed to religion
and if you want to save you one you
wanted to appear immediately as it's
safe so this is one of the cases where
kind of enforce in a separation between
them doesn't really work because it's
quite as I straight but it reflects on
the server data so yeah I think some
kind of combined approach
would work but best but I'm not aware of
any I gained aviom next has it I'm
better closure skip so I can't really
say so you have to do a plug now for
this thing that meteor is building it's
called Apollo and I envy had a century a
ticket Yvette's and help we need it but
the the goal for the Apollo project is
to have a graph ql server in between
your app and any back-end right so
essentially we can you can use state
from different data sources and you can
manage them cleanly to grab duo and the
driving state store for that is actually
read us right so at the end of the day
everything is dumping into Redux under a
certain reducer name for example Apollo
is that the actual reducer name with as
the query exchange dumps into the Redux
order that reducing so you can see that
exactly what you said you are combining
the client-side say in the server-side
stayed together and it's a lot easier
than rest because if you know rest is
always a pain with setting up those
requests and dumping them in having a
clear graphical schema and resolving
those is perfect especially be going to
the Redux or you can you can need a
public API for the client is always
going to be the same and which is great
even if you're dealing with the server
side state or some clients I'd say it's
the best yeah thing but I always felt it
was really wonky having to do
asynchronous requests only to have some
optimistic requests and then if it
failed i would have to manage them set
itself you know and yeah even with
middleware like when you're doing an
asynchronous requests you can do the
middleware probably maybe a promise or
something managing the state of a
request it also feels a little weird
because why should i manage the state
like shouldn't the request know that
it's initialized load am and here's all
definitely so those are the things that
i feel that people say that there's a
lot of overhead to read ups and i have
to agree with them even though i love it
i have to agree that there is a lot of
overhead but I feel like predictability
is better than magic and if you can
write predictable code you'll never have
bug
or hopefully you'll never have but you
know so I most important part that if
you have boxed you need to have a simple
procedure to find like where exactly the
back happens this is one one of the core
like philosophy so free except you can
write buggy code but at least you know
where it is yeah yeah you know that that
brings up a good point to you mentioned
um next and I'm kind of curious like do
you pay attention to cycle an elm and
ohm and other types of frameworks and
libraries that seem to be you know
they're all kind of driving at the same
idea of immutability encapsulation that
kind of thing and I'm trying yeah I'm
trying to raise some attention I haven't
been very good at this lately because
I'm just swamped with work yeah but I
all miss pretty inspiring I think it's
uh it's hard for I I don't have a use
case for it so it's hard for me to
valley attack when I don't have a use
case for it and right now i'm not
writing any apps so i'm just working on
the library so it's hard for me to
evaluate stuff elm is it is pretty
inspiring it's cool that they're they
have some kind of react native thin 2m
native UI essence like this I'm sure
yeah but it's it's a little bit hard for
me to understand completely functional
programs like I feel that for example um
architecture I it is products in some
ways the whole like idea of producers is
pretty much what Elm does with update
functions I think actually the first
version of redox didn't have that so I
didn't understand for the second
position when i published the first
versions of redux and it was actually
Andrew cleric who came up with this area
hey like you don't need many stores
here's one store in we're going to call
functions so relax don't have to take
care of that it's just function occasion
so LMK is pretty Spartan but on the
other hand it means that you have to lie
right a lot of code that deals with like
street propagation because the purity so
for example at least this is my opinion
like maybe I don't understand it well
but in the examples as so anytime you
want to compose a stateful child inside
a parent you need to actually write the
code to propagate that straight inside
the child we have these updates
propagate as expressed in the parent
straight and for example in react this
is always an implementation detail of
the component because a react component
can be faithful now and it's it's an
implementation detail so this is a big
difference and I think it speaks to
reiax popularity that it's important to
be able to nest stateful things and to
stateless things and not have to think
about it and not have to write any
wiring code and as for a cycle again uh
it's a very nice um it looks as a very
nice API and a very nice pattern I'm not
so i'm not sure i haven't used it so I'm
out I can't speak about performance or
how well it encapsulates components or
how easy it is to refactor or not so I
can't really say anything about this ah
or the one thing I can say is um so what
is important for me in react and why I
inspired by react and why I want to work
on react is because it um it provides
the glue you between components and i
find it actually pretty important for
like for the future directions of react
is that um you never in react you don't
um you don't write the glue code between
a parent and child to make them work
together you just express that parent
contains a child which means that react
has a lot of freedom in how it treats
your components for example at some
point it may introduce an optimization
that lays rendering of
child components or things that are not
on the screen as an example and because
you don't write the wiring code you just
describe what your chat what your
component looks like you don't actually
depend on whether the child is rendered
or not at this time on the other hand if
you write a explicit code saying like a
map this observable of freedom to like
dysfunction and then combine their
results into another observable or
whatever you write this code so you have
full control over it but on the other
hand the framework doesn't have as much
control so it can't really do some
optimizations that would be nice to do
but this is very theoretical I'm not
trying to bash cycle or anything it's
possible that it's possible to like have
the same kind of component abstraction
in cycle so the cycle have this guy has
this kind of control and maybe they use
is so different enough that it's just a
smattering cycle and maybe we won't
succeed it with with like incremental
reconciliation in react either so this
is just something that's been on my mind
about this frameworks and this is what i
like about reactors that it has control
cool cool so we got a question from the
community here this one comes from Max
the back-slapping and he basically wants
to know if there's any plan to split
react into more mini web rarest so I
guess quasi recently you know we like
react on was broken out right from the
main reactor brary so I think one of his
concerns was is it gonna be possible in
the future to like split off react SVG
or one of those other libraries just to
reduce file size well ah
I understand the concerns about the file
size so the file raffle size has been
like people have been talking about it
for a while and i think it is well with
concerned in a way if you compare it
like libraries like pre-act for example
that kind of like two kilobytes or
something and claim to implement pretty
much the same API but on the other hand
is there's a lot of stuff that there's a
lot of edge cases that react handles
that some of these libraries don't
handle and it gets very tricky because
implementation details change all the
time so it's tricky to point out like
the exact list of this edge cases what I
want to say is a I think I'm fun to look
at it again after we change our build
process so right now our build process
is that which is shape a comment yes
commodious modules but this means that
people sometimes depend on the internal
I internal modules that get renamed or
whatever so we want to expose fled
bundles up for specific renters like we
have a reactivity as compiled to a
single file that without these
browserify definitions just like like
closure compiler does I think so we want
to experiment with these optimizations
that are able to remove some of the dead
code depending on the renderer another
thing that's important is that a react
doesn't use a some of the assumptions
like it doesn't use some of the things
that it can use in the future right now
and cutting them right now would not
probably be a good idea and an example
of that is this in fact a given system
so some people say they've hey is
synthetic event system is huge let's
just remove it from react right let's
just like ship react without it and let
people use it as a multi little version
of round but the problem is first of all
those react native and it's important
that we support react native as well and
a sec and it's good to have a common
abstraction there because we want to
move the core forward and not
the Tom part but another part is imagine
that react our implements optimizations
that make your that let react take care
of position in your children for example
rather than have a bunch of divs a bunch
of like deeply nested eaves with flags
box layout that exists only for layout
what if we let react what if we had
inline styles for example and what if we
let react position-specific Dave's on
the page absolutely kind of like react
native does ah based on the layout
information but in this case the browser
event system would not be exactly
correct because it would have bubble
through the same tree because some of
the the G would not look the same it
would be after react so it's important
that we keep this a system so that the
user code can say the same but react can
render components in a smarter way and a
lot of this is like targeted in the
future and this is not something that
this is not something that we're
currently working but we may be working
on this in a year and we don't want to
lose that opportunity and also I get
that some people want to have like more
modular libraries but on the other hand
a ton of people want to have a complete
environment so uh many people want
actually like the task of react react is
not a virtual Dom library it's not a
like Dom refinancing or whatever its
library for building you I composable
you is and user interface is this
rectangle on the screen a bunch of
rectangles on the screen which means
that uh probably handling touches and
clicks in a uniform way having gestures
but haven't just display bell with
animations having a priorities Catalan
for important updates versus low
priority updates all these things are
concerns of a UI library so it may not
actually be the case that we want to
like make it smaller we may actually
want to make it larger but hey 30
kilobytes is less than most images on
the page so
it's not such a big deal but of course
we take it seriously and if we increase
the file size we want to understand why
we're doing it and what we are given
here what kind of code you don't have to
write in your app as a benefit so yeah
okay as a very detailed answer thank you
and you mentioned inline styles so
what's your take on inline styles for
something like CS like react CSS modules
or or some other solution well um still
when people see inline styles and
therefore mean two different things one
of the things they might mean is the
declaration is when he specify things as
JavaScript code and suddenly happens to
them and another thing is actually using
inline styles as an implementation
detail that it's setting things on this
child object as opposed to set in CSS
class names so uh these are two
different things and I think that
defining styles in javascript is
superior but this is just my opinion I
think that it helps to like have access
to Constance and be able to pass these
as props to the children component if
necessary and to be able to use like
this predatory reader and we have
conditions and saying okay if hover it
then apply these trials so I think this
is pretty neat in terms of declaration
in terms of the what it actually can
pass down to you I'm not so sure so this
this is something that people experiment
with and there are very tricky problems
to solve like how do we make this usable
with the dev tools it is it so hard to
tweak like 50 components that each
define their own inline styles and this
is actually one one of the reasons I'm
excited about hot reloading is that I
think we move towards this stage we're
just dev tools tweaking things in
devtools is not going to cut it
and three things in the editor is much
more comfortable but in any case this is
a different thing and it needs more
experimentation we're experimenting with
this at Facebook internally so I don't
know if you read our the react or notes
we started publishing them again there
is a rapper in reactor es Oracle cold
corn oats these are meeting notes from
our team meetings and we have a little
bit of information about like
Christopher Christopher shadow is
experimenting with inline styles of
facebook but I only mean a the
Declaration side and this is currently
very tight to your facebook infra so
this is not something that is useful for
open sources oh but anyway we have
experimentation going on if like what if
we define styles in JavaScript but
compile them to CSS that our Facebook
internal as the pipeline expects and if
we do that we can start experimenting
with targeting inline styles instead of
CSS class names at some point and see if
it works out for our major products and
see if it works well for like developer
experience and the performance and all
the other concerns and if we can make it
work well then we'll probably just say
that hey using it in my cells is a good
idea but right now we don't know so yeah
this dropping knowledge right now there
yes us legit syba I have a couple Redux
like internals questions um so one thing
I really like about Redux is the middle
where I think middleware is a lot of
would you say that middle where is the
place to do more like additional things
in between in between your dispatches
like for me we use action creators law
for purely for business logic where
we're going to do business logic and do
the validations with some checks with
the dudes things bubble blah and then
we'll send it off to the store and all
be great or use a thunk or whatever but
like um
what about middleware like have you seen
a lot of middleware packages come out in
the NPM sphere to handle concept some of
the things that a thunk would handle a
synchronous calls like that like um
where do you see the future of
middleware I think that's probably one
of the biggest and most low key parts of
my readouts that people don't really
catch on right yeah so uh originally the
idea of meat aware came from so it's
inspired by like server-side frameworks
like Express car and a lot of that came
from I didn't want to enforce any kind
of specific asian pattern because I felt
that redox doesn't really solve this
problem and so we need to make it
pluggable and let people come up with
whatever they want and at the time the
most popular flights Lux library I think
one of the most popular flex libraries
both formics by Andrew Clark and so far
mocks handled promises by default so it
had the built-in support for promises
but I wanted to have this kind of like
being able to conditionally dispatch but
like what we dock stunk became uh and I
can decide if I wanted to go one way or
another so we have this concept of
middleware and the a lot of the API
decisions and stuff like that so like
it's just extensible was made by Andrew
so I'm very grateful to him and I think
like my favorite middleware is probably
redux thunk because it's just like it's
so silly and it's pretty powerful that I
like it but if he if I was looking at
like third-party middleware I think
there are some great things in the
community my favorite simple mirror
where is redux analytics by Mark tell
dish that you just specify which actions
how you want the actions to be tracked
by your analytics back back end which is
exactly these days for middleware like
you have a simple all that all your
things
all your actions flow through and you
can log them like this is awesome you
don't have to write any analytics crappy
coat in your app yeah so that that's one
thing another my favorite is Redux water
which is super simple like if you don't
want something like realize devtools you
just want a simple solution it's very
handy you just plug without slogger and
you see seed before the action the
action itself has seed after the action
and if the set is screwed up you just
scroll up and see hey this action this
action screwed up this size of state and
then you know which starts of straight
so you can find the register for it and
you know exactly where the mistake is so
this is very handy and my favorite
example of like really complex my middle
where is relax Agha so this is just the
crazy effort when I first looked at it I
was like what the hell is going on I
don't understand these star functions so
Alan generators because of it and it
turned out that generators are awesome
and they make tasting so much easier
compared to redact encore like other is
in this middle where because these sagas
just me descriptions of what's about to
happen so you can test these
descriptions for equality and like this
is it so and it has like when you want
some kind of complicated a scan flow
like authorization flow when have the
token that can expire but the other hand
you want to refresh it once in a while
blah blah blah blah is very hard to
express without some kind of dsl and I
think relax saga provides an excellent
yourself for these kind of things so
going deeper into these like into it
what you said like I remember that for a
while there's this big hype around read
that simple router and now we're getting
into routing and like changing state via
routing is off this is kind of like a
no-brainer right but let's see do you
think you would think right yeah but
it's actually not and like you so like
you have these people that have their
existing router whatever
maybe and are now trying to figure out
well how kind of wanted you know reset
the state when this route changes and so
what is the simple router and where is
Redux in the term in the in the big
router war that's going on well I think
as we as we first as people first try to
like build apps with redux they try to
go completely into the Rue des direction
and as my manager Tom likes to say that
any technology is like this oscillating
thing you know like II go into one
direction Nikhil overcorrect and go into
the opposite direction and eventually
you kind of find the optimum and so I
think this is what happened both with
like local Street so people try to not
to use local state at all and then it's
now that this is not a good idea and you
want to mix both and it's the same with
routing that at first people tried to
like go deep into the routing um like
try to do completely through redux and
return now that maybe this is not a good
idea because I at least it will react
the most popular option is wrapped outer
and it's inherently tied through the eye
and some people say this is a bad thing
but like personally I have only had good
experiences with it and I think routing
ease can I tried to your eye because you
know it shows different UI depending on
where you are and so when we're dealing
with the I some of the stuff is not
serializable like the current component
and in redox the rule of thumb is that
if something is not so realizable should
not be part of the street so uh what I
think the first solution was something
called to uh the name it was super
confusing we had reacts router which was
later renamed to react redux
how to react and then we had read that
simple router bye bye bye Jim song who
started off like all this complexity
which later got for him to react to that
router because it's no reaction order
Redux is that's what most people Google
and we wanted to come up high in their
front kicks so the thing is it's not
actually tied to react router is just
using history under the hood but since
most people are giving to Google react
router and redox we wanted to be high
because it's the position but like to
sum it up you don't need anything to use
ricotta with redux the thing about two
point O reactor or API is it you don't
really need anything you just use react
routed directly it works well with redux
you don't need anything else but like if
you want to you can add hooks like on
enter dispatch actions if you want but
normally you can just use them together
without worrying too much and in case of
like in case if you use something like
redox dev tools or if you use the
capabilities of redox like being able to
record all the user session as actions
and let your replay on it on a different
computer in this case you want the hero
bar to be in sync so this is the only
use case where you actually want to use
the reactor around the redox but in most
cases you just don't need it yeah thanks
thanks for answering that question I
think a lot of people now we'll have
some kind of guidance their routing is
always like those things that people
spend a lot of time on ya know porn so
you can contribute to the dogs oh yeah I
love to nice uh kind of changing gears
here um I'm curious about the you've
been doing an experiment lately where
you've been streaming on Twitch that
like the stuff that you're working on on
react how's that been going and has
there been a positive response so far
yeah i mean i don't really know I just I
just dream I think some people have been
have liked it which I'm grateful for but
other than that is just like I use it as
a tool to concentrate because if I
really need to get into something deeply
and I don't want to get distracted by
anything and want to force myself to
turn off all the notifications and to
not go into social media and so on I
just need to stream my screen so it's
been positive for me and I think in my
like some people express that it's
useful just to see somebody working
through and struggling like with the new
code days which which is what I'm doing
because I'm need to react away so
there's a lot of surprise and stuff for
me over there and I sis it's like
test-driven development because uh I
know I need to I need to actually test
my changes this is a framework not an
app like an app you can probably slack
off sometimes but in library he can't I
think it it has some kind of like good
work for vibe when it is stalled and
everything is red or nothing is working
an easy walk through it and then get it
to work and then refactor it it gives a
nice sense of accomplishment and I think
people enjoy watching that to you but
yeah I definitely plan to me to do that
in the future as well nice yeah no I i
really like it myself like I I think
back to the days of lake when i first
learned java script like i knew a little
bit of javascript and like could use
jquery back in like 2010-2011 but I'd
mostly focused on the back end with Ruby
and I came to a ruby shop that was like
completely dedicated to pair programming
and it was really an amazing way to
learn just because like what you were
talking about like watching someone
think through how they were writing code
and like being able to ask those
questions like as they were doing it was
a pretty amazing experience so I think
for like developers just getting started
this is actually a really awesome tool
for them to I mean it may seem boring
someone that's been doing JavaScript for
you know six years but at the same time
like you know someone who's just getting
started it's really awesome to kind of
see how people think through these and I
think you you tweeted the other day like
experience is just knowing where to put
the console dot log yeah yeah very true
you know like I just I have an intuition
of where I think something may be broken
and you know half the time I'm right
half the time I'm wrong but the times
that I am right like it leads to me
getting something fixed faster and
that's just I think experience over time
not yeah it's totally because like
beginners often thing that experienced
developers don't make mistakes I don't
know if I count as an experienced
developer like I've been programming
java script for a couple of years maybe
three years nah but uh I found that for
myself I make just as many mistakes as I
used to but I have a pretty good
intuition of like which edge cases are
going to fail so I just that test for
those and I'm like oh yeah this is
pretty much what I thought and it also
helps to can i get a sense for like one
of the most complex things about
learning to program is overcoming this
feeling that Oh are not like this is
magic I'm not giving to figure a figure
it out like they're it's a bug and I
know maybe it's a compiler bug and this
happens like it would bubble it happens
I mean I love bubble uh but uh it's just
fun to actually have compelled a box
since I ready but what I found is that
as a beginner you often think like
there's an issue and I'm just not giving
to get down to the root of it's just too
complicated but what he actually need to
do is just calm down relax and just go
one by one verifying your assumptions go
through every bit of where it's like it
to fail any you're going to find it it
just takes patience yeah I knew that
it's still in confident a time
commitment right like and people are
scared it's gonna be complicated but
really it's just like
taking the time to trace something all
the way to the source and and like once
you find that source and you know I
think with with something like meteor
it's sometimes feels complicated because
there's this like big framework of a
bunch of libraries glued together but
you know at the end of the day like you
can pick it apart and find that it's
really just a bunch of packages and like
you can dive through it and figure out
what is and even run it locally and kind
of put debugger statements or console
logs and you know in the right spot and
you'll eventually find the problem yeah
and I think in the redux this was also
one of my like goals with it is that I
wanted to keep it simple to I wanted the
debug experience she actually make some
sounds so in Fox the bakken can be
complicated because of the dependencies
between the source so you always go back
to the dispatcher logic and inside wait
for in it's like a tricky for loop there
but in redox is just like for each
listener just called a listener and it's
like a you have the previous straight
and here goes your reducer function and
I really wanted to make this step
through experienced really simple to
understand because like most of the time
the Box are in your code case yeah well
another things exactly as you get more
experience in developing your you're
like preference for having good tooling
gets more important like as you get more
experience you want better tools because
you don't want to waste time on stuff
you wasted time on your first year and
in the job I think that's what Redux
came in really really nicely is because
it came with that that developer toolset
in mind you should have tools to debug
this witch who previously didn't have
you shouldn't actually be doing a bunch
of console logs to test read upstate at
all you should not be yeah yep the
logger and I think even not maybe now
with this with or we can take
inspiration from this for this library
and you can see that especially with the
stuff I'm working on the Apollo project
it's tool focused development like we
are building
stuff so it can have tools for you
because in the media community
previously there were no tools to
observe especially reactive data
reactive data is the worst because first
it is undefined then it is then is
complete right there's two states
there's always loading yeah bouncing
true and yeah you don't have that
tooling to understand what exactly is
going to happen then you don't know what
guards to put in your application you
don't know how to reason about it you
don't know how to explain it to someone
else who may be working so i think i
think i can kind of give props to you
for that because before that i didn't
see a lot of tulle driven products out
there then now there's like bjs which i
think took a lot of inspiration from
like how Redux was built in now that two
point O has a bunch of features as
tooling as Redux implementation there's
all this stuff so I think that kind of
inspired a role for New Orleans I agree
I'm very I'm very happy to see this like
I don't really care if you people use
redox as long as like some of these
ideas and the this focus on not letting
on making hit hackable like its face for
example like mo backs is completely
different from reacts in how its
implemented but it's awesome that it
also exposes this hood so there is like
a debugger for my bags that highlights
the changed components this is awesome
stuff I'm very glad that is happening
and I think another important part is
that often these are like these
developer hooks are an afterthought and
they're often exposed to such way that
it's hard to hack on the tools so for
example you might have like a fox
library that has a chrome extension for
inspection straight but like is anybody
going to contribute to this Chrome
extension probably not because it's just
so hard to contribute your chrome
extension it's just such a mess and this
is like the this is how they get stale
and there is not enough innovation so
what I wanted to do with readouts dev
tools and I think it paid off even
though like the default a monetary is
like not not perfect but out of it we
have ramped recently which is a project
for showing the tree of data it recently
got some got a new new maintainer he's
my friend from previous project and he
made an awesome change where if you have
a bunch of items more than like a
hundred items in the list it shows them
I kind of like chrome adjust in the
buckets so you see like all three
hundred and hundred to two hundred and
so on so if you have a large list of
data is still easy to find the right
thing in the tree and he also built a
custom a different monitor that shows
the difference between the states so you
can see how this state changed during
this action exactly like which which
paths in the street were changed with a
gift like interface so this is amazing
and it's possible because redox devtools
is implemented as a react component and
the main point was that yeah there is a
Chrome extension like it was going to be
the leader is awesome but it's hackable
so you can just have dev tools on the
side and you can write a custom monitor
that makes sense for your application
and so other people like there is a
child monitor that shows your state as a
graph and it animates when you are we
need knows our edit and this is useful
for like really complicated stage trees
but you can switch that to any other
kind of monster that makes sense for
your application and how the future
libraries also keep the tools hackable
and make it easy to going to make your
own small tool that connects to this
library and get this information and
this is also what i'm working on react
right now is helping to advance this
ductile api we read in its still
internal but it's already kind of
possible to use if you require the right
module but don't do that I I didn't say
it but anyway is going to be official at
some point and it's going to drive both
our internal add-ons like perf for
example the new rep proof is using the
knee uh debug tools
and the near the chrome extension is
going to start using these debug tools
and it will be possible to write your
own like track react life cycle uh see
when components the mounted ablated
amount that you can measure what time it
takes to do that and like build
visualizations on top of the components
Heath maps whatever we want is to be
hackable yeah that's pretty awesome i
would say like that's one of the things
that i really enjoyed about learning
react like i've only been using it since
end of december early january but it was
super easy to pick up because those dev
tools were there and i think that's
that's gonna be even even more awesome
it once you get a proof tool in there
because like people don't realize how
hard it can be sometimes to measure like
the performance and it's hard to squeeze
out like a lot of performance out of
something if you're not measuring it
well like you make assumptions and like
you may miss the mark if you're not
measuring so that's pretty awesome here
alright well did anyone else have one
final question we wrap up I'd set a
comment so making things hackable I
think is going to be like the future of
like libraries implementations I think
the root of that is functional
programming is definitely the root of
that because passing functions and
writing higher level functions is allows
you to pretty much do it or the hell you
want yeah even internally in my company
at work pop we build our we build
everything as higher-order reducers we
build everything as i order actions that
with business logic bound to them
because we know that we want a pluggable
system we want to be able to dump a
function err there and have it be
predictable and reliable and so i think
like it's not just for dev tools that
you want to be hackable I feel like it's
with your your business logic code that
exists on the client I think that's to
be super hackable to that any person
coming into your code base can be like
oh I need something like this let me use
that and I can build something so I
think a lot of the stuff that i use on
my company
I was learned from you Dan so I just
wanted to say thanks for all that stuff
thank you awesome well uh so we
generally in the show we saw this from
JavaScript jabra I can spend it um with
like having a pic of the week so it's
just something that doesn't necessarily
have to be related to dev it can be
anything you want just something that
generally is like making your life
better or improving your life in some
way ah so yeah we'll just go around and
everyone can mention something cool i'm
gonna start this time ha it's over the
weekend i went to this place in some
from DC let's this place called tech
shop they have they have multiple
locations across the country but it's
basically like a place where you go and
they have a bunch of tools that they
have woodworking tools they have 3d
printers laser cutters they have like
kills basically they have like fancy
sewing machines sorts of crazy stuff and
you can go and you take classes and if
you try to use this stuff and then you
get a membership so once you teach the
class you can go and just make a bunch
of stuff so i took my daughter's my
daughter's there and I'd like young they
have like a steam summer camp programs
and stuff so give me a tour it was super
awesome and I'm like really excited to
to do some of those classes my
daughter's so shout out the techshop
nice I'll go next um so mine will be
tech related for anyone who wants to use
any database layer in their application
you should check out apollo stack docs
taught Apollo stack com we can agree
with Redux angular react and yeah that's
that Paula's tight Paul site yes you a
good name yeah sure
uh yeah so I'm also doing a shameless
plug yeah I've been working on something
on the weekends in the past few weekends
it's called backhoe loader 3 which give
the version to you so it's been a long
time coming I've learned a lot about
like how to implement hot reloading and
react I had a few dead ends I'm
deprecating the rare transform project
and of course I'm deprecated in the old
version of react older so I suggest that
you to check out there is a pull request
on react boilerplate repo that shows the
demo of RAC folder 3 i've released
better one yesterday it's fairly stable
it solved a lot of bugs and I encourage
you to check it out and try it if you
sound like a floater one porn acts or
babble plugin fair transform check out
where fourth-order free instead and give
me feedback thanks nice awesome yeah so
I don't know mine will be a weird one so
I podcast a lot I just got a new light
uh which is helping light up the room um
yeah i don't know i think it's it's
awesome like we were talking about
tooling like I spent a lot of time
recording so I've got a new mic recently
and a new light and we've even got a new
DSLR for recording videos to as I'm
starting to do more tutorials on youtube
so i would say like if you can invest in
your tooling like even if it ends up
being a computer or monitor or something
like it's definitely worth we're doing
so you spend a lot of time with it all
right Dan well thank you for coming on
the show is really awesome you dropped
quite a bit of knowledge on us so we
appreciate that thank you for having me
yeah yeah yeah so uh and for anyone
that's listening big thanks to digital
ocean sponsor of the show they
they do an awesome job with hosting if
you're looking for it so digitalocean
commonly I should've met and um as
always you can go to patreon PA treo
n-com / meteor club 10 bucks a month you
can get into our slack chat room which
pretty awesome and I think were maybe
talking about having one of the core
graph ql guys on next so that should be
interesting so stay tuned for that All
Right see you later bye this video has
