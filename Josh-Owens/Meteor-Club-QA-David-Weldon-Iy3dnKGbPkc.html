hosts josh owens the interclub QA this
is the april edition and we're talking
with David Weldon from idina vocal David
hey thanks for having me I'm super
excited to be here yeah awesome so I
really like to me you put out a number
of pretty pretty good articles about
maybe easy developer developer mistakes
and then like security and a lot of
stuff around that so I wanted to maybe
touch on security it's not something
we've touched on a ton in the past we've
touched a little bit on on scaling and
that kind of thing or like running a
development shop or stuff like that but
but not a ton around security so wanted
to kind of have an an angle on that I
guess um yeah so what if you talk for a
second about the the article i guess the
browser policy article you wrote uh yeah
well first let me say we've been we
really have implemented most of the
features that Emily talked about in her
first speaker need to talk the one I
look like meteor versus Mallory I really
recommend that everybody just google
that look it up on youtube it's really
good it's it's from a dev shop talk in
like two years ago and um most of the
stuff that you're gonna encounter is
covered by the topic and I think not a
lot of people like people thought it was
interesting maybe at the time but didn't
really take it all in but we went and
implemented everything she talked about
not talk so we've been using pretty much
all those techniques for the last two
years um and browser policies one of
them um I was a really early adopter of
that and actually gave her feedback the
time about things that didn't work
cross-browser bugs in the packages um
but anyway yeah
it's really particularly interesting
kiss tea because um yeah as I put in in
the article and I wasn't really sure
like any of those conditions would ever
get hit um I I guess one of them was at
a very in a very simple way where we had
a package we had a third-party service
that was doing something not loud in our
browser polity like I think they were
doing eval as part of a JSON parsing or
something and so now I wrote to that
third party and said hey you're using
eval could you stop that please and um
they were they were super super helpful
about it um and died got cleaned up and
then yeah and then it went a long time
like a year or more until we had had the
superfish situation where lenovo was
essentially installing malware on on new
laughs just and it was just doing all
sorts of bad essentially taking over
your HTTP sessions and forcibly loading
one of their scripts every every page
rendered on your on your browser and
interestingly our browser Paulo state
well it caught that because it said well
you can't load scripts that we haven't
specifically given permission to um and
then for reasons I don't completely
understand that made it so the users
that were having that as you couldn't
actually log into this site so we got
support tickets that just look like whoa
oh we see a spinner when we can't log
into the site um and those in under
circumstances where we're completely
lost well we'll ask the users to give us
a console log dump and we looked at that
and then I did a little bit more
investigation than it was clear wow this
is super fish terrific you've been
infected um yeah and I cleared it up but
I was free need to see it in action like
that yeah that's awesome yeah I am you
know I kind of wrote
an article about like why you should use
meteor settings rather than putting like
keys directly new code and part of that
like I reference superfish and it was
kind of funny like it was just like this
ethereal thing that could possibly
happen right like somehow your circle of
trust is getting broken somewhere along
the line that you're not aware of and
all of a sudden like someone's able to
to take some of your keys or something
and you know here is like an actual I
mean the attack vectors from the other
side right from the client but it's it's
really kind of interesting to see that
happening that's awesome awesome
article.thanks so uh you know I forgot
to say like what what is uh what is that
Deena what do you what are you guys
doing there oh yeah I guess I should
give you the pitch um yeah so Tina is a
video based platform for helping
teachers get better teaching that's sort
of a simple way to say it so the
mechanics oh that looks like teacher
goes out into the classroom and records
him or herself just doing a normal
classroom session and then then he or
she can upload that video into our
platform and then invite whomever they
like whether that's a professor or
another teaching professional or
colleague or what have you and the
notice people can collaborate together
and essentially leave that teacher
comments in the timeline you can stay
right at you know 14 minutes and five
seconds you answer question like this
but you should have used this particular
strategy when talking to the student you
know that sort of thing and you can have
a whole discussion around what could
been proved and yeah that's that's the
idea we sell primarily to departments of
Education and universities right now but
we're also branch Matt 2k12 nice so I
mean does the does the school contact
you and generally like buy a block of
like review time with you guys or how
does that work like does a teacher just
say hey I want to get better and like
they'll they'll get
started themselves ah that's that's the
endgame we far in the future we want to
have a marketplace for essentially any
teacher can talk contact us and say hey
I'm an 8th grade science teacher um and
I need help with this and we'll hook you
up with with someone who's expert in
that particular thing um right now we
don't do any of the the coaching
ourselves we just provide tools the
platform to do it so it looks like we
make a sale to someone like the
University of Washington their
department of bed and then all their
students use it in all their classes and
then they have professionals on staff of
course their professors or TAS or
whoever um that can give them advice
nice okay makes sense you know it find
it so funny i think there's there's
actually there's another educational
space I don't know is it a competitor
that's that's using meteor as well um
are they doing something slightly
different yes there there is another um
there's another startup that does
something pretty similar it also use it
yeah interesting stuff all right so
let's get into some of these questions
so this one's from URI tea or I'm saying
that line and he says what's the most
awesome thing that meteor allows your
app to do huh I'd actually say the most
awesome thing that meteor allows our apt
to do is not in the main app it's in the
uploader um so the really weird and
interesting technology piece that we use
and I really probably should have done a
demo of this a long time ago um but I
never have time um yeah so what what we
have our app is broken up into pieces
but you can think about as a main main
piece which is you know the video
collaboration
logging in doing groups and things that
fees and an uploader and so what we had
to solve early on was the problem where
any teacher recording with any video
device should be able to upload into our
platform um without a problem and a
problem might be uh you know your camera
is so weird an old or your internet
connection is shaky or whatever we just
want to make it as soon as possible and
so if they found out for a lot of
experimentation the right way to do that
is to transcode the video prior to
upload so we find is that um uh sorry
this is be a long path to get to the
answer but hopefully it's interesting
I'd I just lose you uh no I just I
turned down my band with a little bit
we're getting some stuttering problem so
okay um let's see so um what we found
was that the video inputs often were
goodbye so they maybe don't only or
within 30 minutes of the video and when
you get this 10 or 20 gigabyte video
depending on the recording settings on
your device and so we didn't think it
was reasonable to a either limit users
to five minutes of video or or be um I
do something like upload 20 gigabytes
and just cry so here's hope for the best
so the solution we came up with was
transcode all video on the user's
machine prior to being uploaded um which
is really interesting because it allows
you to do things like the user and like
throwin thumbnail and trim the video and
rotate it if they want to so essentially
what we built is this little tool that
allows you to do some light video
editing and also get a much smaller
version of video and then that tool uses
meteor um and is cross-platform so we're
using a node WebKit
or I think it just got rebranded to NJ
dot yes so we use node WebKit to build a
cross-platform president of our uploader
that then can do all the mechanics of
the video transcoding but also handle
all the uploading in a pretty
sophisticated way so it's resumable and
handles as internet faults and things
like that what's awesome is the fact
that you're using meteor on that so not
only can use are actually log and for
verify that they are a user have a valid
account and have the rights to upload um
but also also I can hot push code which
was really critical when figuring out
something as complicated as doing video
transcoding it just took us a really
long time lots of iterations and seeing
all kinds of failures and and what was
happening on the client on to be able to
figure out the billion settings it takes
in order to make that transcoding Ross
SS work really smoothly for everybody so
being able to hot push code changes a
week or whatever was really important as
fish early on um yeah so that that
uploader is an amazing piece of
technology and and media real helps make
that happen nice but that's actually
pretty amazing I'm a little surprised
that I would have never thought to have
done that so I mean I guess because
you're using node WebKit you're just
able to use some node libraries to
handle the transcoding then yeah it's
it's really neat um so we use um pretty
much everybody is doing transcoding is
doing ffmpeg under the hood so what we
actually do is ship node web way with
ffmpeg with an f of MPEG binary for that
particular OS um you're solving for and
then um yes using meteor obviously to do
all the all the scripting on the client
but I also have the benefit of being
able to use nobody calls
which allow you to touch the hard disk
so um and actually make os-level calls
so I can call it the binary stream its
output and then touch the disc and say
like okay was the foul written are we
sure it's done you know that sort of
thing and then read knockout and ship it
to our circus so I mean like what's uh
let's say I mean you've got a 10 gig
file like what how long does that
typically take on the client to
transcode and then kind of get uploaded
and done yeah so our goal we don't
always hit this but on average we do our
goal is to do the full process transcode
upload in roughly the same time roughly
the duration of the video so if you
screw food so if you shoot 30 minutes of
video um in general within a few percent
um we can get the whole process down
into regions nice that's pretty awesome
all right um but we didn't transcoder
might take you five hours to upload that
video so it's it's a good trade-off yeah
definitely alright so back to security
maybe um do you have a checklist you go
through to make sure you've covered all
the important security checklists even
it maybe it's in your head and I know
you mentioned that the talk that Emily
did so I mean are you generally just
using that as your your checklist are
you doing yeah I mean if you look at
anybody's blogs and security like oh I
don't think anybody's written a isn't in
that talk um so we added all those
features as soon as that top came out um
and we don't really I mean we have a
couple we have the uploader and some
other side apps so it's not like we're
in a situation where we're constantly
starting fresh with a nap all the time
we spot all the patterns that we already
established yeah but I I mean if you
force me to list an out i could probably
good
well I mean if you're using this like
you know what honestly I'll probably
just go through and turn this talk into
a checklist right people would probably
like that yeah this is uh this is some
awesome stuff I found her slides here so
it's meteor meet Mallory yeah is the
name of the talk and I don't I haven't
found the youtube yet but it's probably
will probably link it up in their show
notes or something alright uh like add
autumn augment you add audit argument
checks and you know I and then she goes
into some detail about like what an
injection attack look like um and you
know use browser policy um transmitted
over HTTPS yeah I like those are really
the the basics and then you have you
know all the stuff that you and I've
written about like which I don't know
that she covers but like the crazy user
stuff like don't expose all of your
users data yeah yeah yeah yeah I guess
that's that's yeah that's a good one too
like the field stuff for people that are
new they might not realize like if you
go in and say hey you know I mean
telescopes a great example of this right
like you want to expose hey this user
left a comment and you want their name
and you want their profile picture and
if you just do a straight up user that
fine and then publish that you're
actually publishing like their keys like
they're um not their keys they're
encrypted passwords and if they did if
they use like oh off you're exposing
their tokens and all kinds of stuff so
yeah I mean if you didn't audit of look
like eighty percent of you did not of
the other assets in the wild I bet like
eighty percent of them violating that
yeah yeah yeah that was a big one we
found pretty early on when i was working
at that differential it was like wait a
minute this is like someone's password
right here whoops yes yes we definitely
published to production probably the
worst one I saw though was a client i
had that they were they were making
client-side api calls to google calendar
and
so they were exposing all the necessary
Oh auth tokens to make those calls from
the on it and there was a bug where they
were publishing like anyone you invited
to the event if they had the calendar
token then their calendar token was
getting exposed as well and so you could
realistically gather all that data and
start making API calls yeah his calendar
that's another category of stuff like
don't expose your keys the client um or
yet in general just really try not to do
that uh both through calls but also I I
mean a really simple trick is just put
the stuff that needs to be on the server
under server drug arena won't get pushed
to the client via code I mean you have
to exposure points1 is is like a method
that you can act state and the other one
is like the data is physically like on
your on these machine what was
interesting though because i think this
paradigm was this was a percolator that
i took over and the paradigm was
interesting in the fact that they were
using the client browser as almost like
a background worker right like they were
making the API calls and fetching the
data and then sorting it into the meteor
app which is it was very very different
approach and I think it could be
practical the problem was there was a
bug in the user that find that they were
doing they were they were taking options
but they weren't passing that on to the
fine call and so even though I was
saying like don't expose all the fields
you know that was never getting passed
on so it was just something wasn't fully
hooked up and it caused the issue but it
was kind of interesting to see someone
it take the approach of like your
clients are your your background
processors so all right um here we go uh
well we always touch on scaling I guess
so I guess we'll we'll touch on it again
how many servers do you guys have have
you run into any quirks with scaling a
production meteor app so far um yeah so
I'd rather not give a specific like user
accounts and server numbers
and things like that I'll say that uh
we've done a pretty good job of scaling
our app as meteor progressed for the
technical perspective so we started we
started writing at athena in meteor
around 05 something or early 06
something um so yeah I mean by the time
we launched in August of 2013 we didn't
have any issues really that looked too
much like scaling by that December what
had happened as more users were on the
platform and we've noticed especially
the pattern a pattern we've noticed with
educators is both the professors and the
students wait till the absolute last
minute to do practically everything um
so all the reviews or grades or whatever
we're doing December and we had quote
unquote a lot of people on the site at
the same time um so by today's standards
pretty low is like 20 20 concurrent
users right and we had a lot of reactive
joins and we had a very complicated join
that was unfortunately on the user's
home page so um we got to the point that
was I so far that's been the only fire
drill that we've had running running
meteor where it was like oh my god
Saturday night there 25 people all on
you know and I was resetting the server
or resetting the process every 30
minutes because it was just a pig CPU it
was a nightmare um so a couple of things
fixed that one was the extremely
expensive join that was on the
the the users dashboard I made that not
reactive and in fact cash the results
per user for like five or ten minutes at
a time that that was a big improvement
and then and then like three weeks later
I fly came out hmm um so or up by
tailing I should say so um the ability
to do that was it was a total game
changer um but it definitely got to the
point where right at the point where we
were possibly screwed and then tailing
him out and then everything is fine um
and you know we've made through the use
of Khedira and just more knowledge out
how to do these things we certainly made
improvements over time and now we
hovered around two or three prevent see
you constantly and it's not a problem
the thing that I worry a little bit
about not so much today but a little bit
about is yeah it's something I think you
and I discussed in the past which is
when you go to deploy on any given
process all all of everything resets so
every user needs to reconnect and fetch
all their data and some of those
subscriptions might be very complicated
and cpu intensive so you might have a
steady state of two or three percent but
on deploy you might go to 80 or 90 and
that worries me a bit um right now it's
not pegging the CPU so I don't really
notice it but if it started to and I
guess I'd have to deploy at night or I
don't know I like I haven't explored
like the whole cluster thing or any of
that my approach at the moment has been
to ignore it until Galaxy comes out but
I don't know if that's a thing that's
going to happen this year or not hey I
don't really know what the schedule is
yeah so I you know I heard I heard
whisperings last time I was out in San
Francisco that it was going to be like
maybe they'll be doing like private
alpha stuff in late April
or sometime in May and so I think late
April is here so maybe maybe we're
looking at like midnight late May
something like that we'll see um but it
ignite back all that you broke up I've
added up the phone is inside my gosh ha
we're still you have some kind of break
up in the connection there hey young
yeah I mean buster yeah I think it's on
your end everyone says I'm clear all
right mr. that done so we're speaking of
like whole thing where you guys going hi
I'm just fooling with my internet
connections can you hear me get it now
um it's okay we're still getting like a
slight stutter but okay all right um the
we are hosted on ec2 so I'm pretty good
with ash scripts so I you know before
mup and all that stuff I just came up
with a bunch of scripts to board our
deployment um and it seems to work
funding I haven't no problem our
databases on compose so I balloon with
them since for a long time also since
before we were doing the current really
awesome deal we had a private Lester
just just so we can get a blog tailing
which was expensive but worth it for the
Performing canyons but you know now that
they've gone to I can't remember the
name of the product out but that thing
deploy yes thank you uh it's it's got a
lot easier yeah get cheaper did you guys
switch to the last thing to play when it
came out or you still
on your private so no no yeah we switch
the last thing to buy like two minutes
effort came out okay okay so like I've
I've often thought about this and
haven't really talked about it um much
I've talked about it i think privately
to compose but there they don't turn on
SSL by default with their elastic deploy
so yep how are you feeling about
security in regards to shipping kind of
clear text between Mongo and your meteor
app do you feel like that's like a
vulnerability point and you wish they
would fix that or maybe not such a big
deal well it absolutely is a vulnerable
point however we don't suffer from it
because our boxes aren't easy to east uh
so I've had this conversation with them
also um so you if you are hosted in the
city of data center the bits are not
guaranteed not to leave the data center
um so we're here despite the fact that
they're not interrupted well but I mean
theoretically if I spun up a box in ec
to east I could start maybe well figure
traffic right I um that's that's
excessive for someone who knows the
interval of how Amazon networks ah I
hope the answer we know um so yeah yeah
it's a sad world can see it I think
that's again with with the guys who can
both hold time go with Amazon is it's
true um I don't be surprised if that's
actually something that's possible um
just it would shock me that they'd be a
little sniff traffic from other other
connections even on the same machine let
alone somewhere on the data center that
be kind of creating but um yeah so um
yeah I'm not too worried about
thing that does concern me though is
composing can make that obvious like
nowhere is that obvious so I only asked
the question because I knew that there
are traffic was encrypted so I figured
there must be some something makes that
okay uh so I I don't yeah like they
might have a blog post about this they
blog a lot so I would be surprised they
didn't but there's certainly nothing on
home page it says oh by the way unless
you're hosted here or here or here we
have a security issue right yeah I've
also talked to them about it too and
like generally like I've emailed Jason
and we've talked a little bit about it
but i still had further questions and
never really heard back from him um I
don't know I feel like I mean if your
server can talk to their server then I
feel like maybe if there's not ssl like
someone could pick up that packet I
don't again you're right i probably
don't know about enough about the
internals of amazon's networking to know
if this is possible so if we have like a
tcp/ip networking expert an audience
they should totally chimay but yeah I
mean I I feel like it can't be this hard
for them to turn on the ssl right like
to me from what i've read i haven't
tried this myself it's just a
compile-time option and then like they
issue a certificate and i'm pretty sure
they can just be self-signed
certificates uh so i don't know yeah i
haven't investigated that at all um but
if that's a possibility i think that
would be a great selling point for them
and i would certainly you know that's
that's one more thing i could tell
either yeah so that and it would help me
sleep better overnight all right um so i
don't know if i know of any not sure if
we can answer this one but dave anderson
from the media club slack chatroom asked
what do you think the next security
issues what do you think are the next
security issues that should be addressed
by mdg
um well the easy one uh that I can at
least be to me immediately is the whole
just users debacle I mean we we touched
on it a bit already within / published
stuff but the fact that the users
profile is editable by default mm-hmm
not good and that's really not made
clear I'm so some of this is just like
the festive need to be made clear
because on them you really need to be in
the know on five or six different
details regarding the users collection
that just are kind of scattered around
the documentation and really not clear
and every one of them can cause a
security problem I address two of them
in my in my common mistakes article but
yeah it just users being screwy it is
not good from a security perspective and
I I think there's some hack pad where
people talking about ways that that key
improved it may be meteor pointed out or
something yeah all right you know it's
funny I actually after i wrote my
article number one like I at least on
reddit I got a lot of like backlash
about like overplaying how it's not a
secure like a serious issue for
developers and I said you know honestly
like as soon as I stopped seeing people
make this mistake I will not consider it
as a serious issue anymore right like I
still to this day will find people that
have no idea that the profile is
completely writable and they put all
kinds of security information in it and
I mean I mean I would go so far as to
say 100,000 of new users will notice
that that one line in the confrontation
and just do it yeah and um I yeah I mean
you're totally opening yourself up and
once meteor gets popular enough to get
to the point where um a lot of big
boxers you're using it at least one of
them will make this mistake and then
meteor will be deemed insecure based on
this one problem right which is
unfortunate because
there are so many good things uh from a
security perspective about meteor you
know certainly on the other web
frameworks platforms that I hope that in
the past meteor really does write it in
almost every way but they're like you
know handful of small things you have to
know about and this is one of those that
seems like it's hard to know about and
and should just be chemically different
to the user right you know actually so I
I had a talk with sashko he's the one
that started the hack pad and he was
taking kind of feedback and I just said
like you know I don't know what it's
gonna take to move this forward like I'm
happy to submit a pull request if you
guys are okay with my thoughts on it but
I really just think profiles i think
profiles are fine I think the profile
sub document is fine I think having it
be editable by default is where the
confusions at so let's just take that
out right like let's remove that role
and just go with regular old allow deny
that's pretty straightforward and
standard and people can customize it
they want yeah at the minimum that seems
perfectly reasonable because I think
probably most people just don't even
realize that it's editable right um so I
love the fact that I can stash data
there you know I can push some kind of
data there on user sign up or something
and then that data comes along with user
accounts pretty easily so yeah to
address yeah so I don't know like sashko
went on vacation I haven't heard back
yet so i'll probably follow up with him
and you know the other interesting thing
to me is that 10 came out actually 09 09
to where they introduced the debug only
flag and it occurred to me that I think
insecure and auto public are ok training
wheels for people getting started they
shouldn't they shouldn't be packages
that necessarily survive into production
and I'd love to see those marked as
debug only yeah I dream there's to be
something that happened there um it
doesn't seem right to
potentially have a security it is you in
a large number of apps just because you
want the users first five minutes to be
great mmhmm yeah I would totally agree
and so we kind of went back and forth
and sashko pointed out that he thought
having the auto publish might be a
legitimate thing that people want to do
because it doesn't actually publish the
user stuff just everything else new
database but that insecurity he could
see that being a potential security hole
and maybe maybe we mark that too but
only going forward uh yes although I
can't rid of the details if you have
aught of publish on and I think all the
users account information is exposed I
might be wrong on that but it I think
that's right I wanted to say I did a
test once were where if you add any
users and auto pushes on then if you do
a user's find you'll actually see all
the young the past credentials yeah I
don't know if that's true anymore um
okay that was old i don't know yeah what
to do a little test on that um yeah
that's not true then yeah i buy that
auto publish anything on isn't nearly as
bad as insecure yeah and I've seen
people you know um published to
production with insecure still being
installed so yeah or at a minimum if you
deployed somewhere it should say oh my
god yeah yeah that's what I suggested as
well so when you add like a publication
in and you still have Auto publish
installed it's like oh hey you know
you've you've you've published some data
but you have auto publish installed like
we should do a similar thing when you
build it should say you know hey you
still have insecure installed but i
still think to me the the default should
really be oh let's just rip out in here
and install Mongol I think Mongols way
better okay
easy yet uh no no okay you should
immediately go and saw that yeah I've
seen the video um I was just gonna say
it's it's it's funny I occasionally
several questions for um for that
situation you just described which was
published on and i've added publisher
boy this is this warning is annoying um
can i remove the warning without
removing auto publish i think i
discovered some like hack you can do to
make that happen I mean I told them
about the answer there but I the life
making I remember what isn't it right
now nice yeah we so sashko and I were
talking about like having maybe separate
packages like Auto published non warning
or something like that if you you cared
about that like it would not warn you I
don't know all right um well so I'm
going to take this question from junior
a lie but I'm gonna maybe adapt it he
said are any agencies or companies out
there currently looking for me to
developers I'm gonna say yes and say are
you guys hiring fact we are nice or
thank you for teeing that up for me um
yeah so so we are hiring i usually
posted that as a front-end developer
position um largely because hey it's
meteor there's lot back head right um so
that's that's the good news bad news is
maybe bad news is you know it narrows
the search of it to someone who's who's
pretty focused on um making it front end
happen um that's maybe like seven four
percent of the job you know thirty
percent is uh yep helping to to do
things that still look like back end
which you know methods stuff like that
database migration some things so it's
it's really full static job but i like
to publish it as its front end but yeah
we're looking for someone um and that
someone could be a meteor expert but the
doesn't have to be I'm happy to to put
in the time to train anybody who knows
um i knows java script well already nice
and so is that is remote okay are you
guys looking for it like san
francisco-based people or what yeah
we're a really small team and uh we like
the idea of all being together in the
same place and so so we're really
looking to hire just for our San
Francisco office ok so you guys in san
francisco proper are you guys a little
south there or what um were yeah we're
in san francisco proper I mean were it's
the month ok yeah well okay just hang
out well i had a friend of mine who
lives in cupertino and like he was
contemplating taking a job in like
somewhere like in the market district
and are down by market street and he was
like man my commute it's gonna be an
hour and a half and i'm like that sounds
terrible so he ended up like just not
taking the job because he didn't want
the commute more than anything yeah
funny alright and yeah so the other
thing I would say is I actually know
like David Sakura I hope I'm saying his
name right no he works for your
competitor man I really does indeed I I
cannot think of the name of their it's
like it's torch torch thank you all
right and I know they're hiring but so
if you're interested in New Orleans uh
they're definitely hiring and they want
people in the city there and I know like
differentials generally always looking
for people i think okay crow just hired
some ground work pop there in LA and
they're looking for people they prefer
on site so i think there's a number of
like startups that are hiring right now
that you know if you're willing to move
you've got your pick up pick of good
cities i think
and i don't know like i've always got
overflow jobs too so if people are
looking for work they should contact me
too all right so we're down to the last
question maybe we'll get some more here
if you're watching ask more questions or
we'll just make stuff up uh so Ben
Costanza wants to know what are you guys
doing for testing yeah great question um
up until a few months ago the answer was
nothing um we about a long time without
having any tests and yeah recently it's
we have a handful of collections which
interact with each other they're in very
complicated way it is um just business
rules are you know it's super
complicated there's good reasons behind
them all those rules really help users
do magic automatically um but uh you
know it's hard for the developer says so
um so uh yeah so my strategy lately has
been to start moving those the
collections and all their methods that
are hooks and their helpers and all that
transform all that stuff into one
package / / collection and and then
applying tiny test to it and I realized
that I'm saying the bright as velocity
is getting at the point where it's
probably almost usable um I sorry I let
me to offending on there right I I just
well I mean it's totally true because I
mean like Sam and I joke about it all
the time like the hardest thing you can
do with velocity right now is write a
book about it because there's so much
stuff like little craft little things
that aren't done right and
yeah like you spend your time trying to
fix velocity or trying to fix the
framework rather than writing a book so
I would totally agree with that right
and I think thinking I I heard you
interviewed on something where he says
something like well I spent three days
trying to figure out like how to do this
one testing thing and and I heard that
and and I was like all right well I feel
better my choice to you scientists um
biggest there were definitely some
quirks to work out and I've talked a
little bit about this I'm a meteor farms
lately but you know some sucking and
stubbing kind of kind of stuff that was
a little bit tricky to figure out um but
once that was done yeah everything seems
to be working swimmingly um yeah I think
the only thing with tiny test is you
have to be willing to get in there and
look at MDGs code and figure out how
they're testing things and then kind of
follow their patterns yeah and gotta
make your own I yeah I there's there's
definitely stuff I place I'd figure out
like oh it's better to declare your if
you're going to declare collections in
order to click declare them as unmanaged
so they don't run into each other after
we to test spare to have you know reset
that it does all that also handles the
cases where the you're using a
collection that is managed expert by by
another collection and it has to reset
that in a different way it's just that
sort of stuff needs to be figured out it
took me you know a day or two of doing
it wrong to to get that room but um but
now I you know regardless of what
testing framework we're using the story
is that we have a lot of tests around
our most complicated collection
interactions so I'm a lot more happy
about that yeah nice so I mean I guess
that means that you're probably pushing
a lot of your at least the code you want
to test or being pushed into packages
yeah um yeah so we've found over time
that it was really helpful to move a lot
of our code out of templates and more
into kind of like a modeler so we've had
a lot of success with the last few big
projects that we've done where we have
fairly complicated models they have a
lot of transforms so and then as as you
you might know i'm a big proponent of
having not doing my inside out
operations so i do everything through
methods so um so yeah the methods test
the clients tend to look fairly simple
they just invokes a method and the
method has all the complexity in it but
performs all the complicated checks to
ensure that no bad data interested it is
and so uh yeah I mean there's a lot of
good stuff to say about many things to
package those packages you get the
advantage of having you know all that
code in one place you can just you know
say okay I want to talk about this
particular my posts question on or
whatever and then have all the stuff
related to toast isn't one book one
place but then you know through the
magic of tiny tests you can actually
test it on some reasonable way nice yeah
yeah so I guess that uh that maybe leads
into the next question which was any
application architecture choices that
you made initially when the app was
small that you would change now that
you've built a larger app where i guess
you maybe have changed as you've moved
into a larger app yeah a lot of things
have changed as is gone the the thing
you know moving a lot of stuff to the
model layer is definitely a good example
of that our templates were much too
complicated um yeah i thought that's
probably the biggest one there are some
naming convention conditional choices
that we made
some data modeling choices uh where you
don't know what you don't know and then
until you actually uh you know right the
next twenty thousand one thousand nine
cents of code you don't realize like a
oh that was actually a terrible idea
yeah now we're kind of fun with it um
some of those imma change to the next
year maybe um but uh yeah nice yeah yeah
yeah so Sasha had a great article on
that it's like the the unknown unknown
or like when you're playing a starcraft
i love this reference like you know it's
the fog of war right and you can't you
can't see the whole map but as you
explore it you start to understand at
least the layout of the map so it's
definitely one of those things like you
start to understand as you build a
bigger app so you touch a little on a
node webkit the next question is
actually it has to do with iOS and
Android I'm assuming there may be
talking about Cordova as well have you
faced any problems with iOS or Android
platforms currently my apps don't seem
to run on certain Android devices new
and old so that's from junior have you
have you guys used Cordova at all um so
only experimental II so we headed Mike
receipt come in here and do a little
work for us to try to figure out like
what what would be the panics of moving
some of our uploader to to an iOS app
and so he kind of demonstrated like this
is this is the kind of forms you can get
here's what the phone gives you here's
what it looked like on on Android that
was a really interesting experience um I
yeah I can only speak to to what what he
kind of showed me um which was the
bottom line seemed like for what we were
doing was you know video recording and
transmitting on it seemed like iOS was a
little more advanced than everything
else like they have some into built
transcoder that does stuff for you you
can have
access to that from the app but in but
on Android it was a total mess so you
beyond i I don't I don't have anything
any wisdom to to spell about or bid to
give out about either of these platform
yeah honestly like to me I think at
least you know juniors question about
his app doesn't seem to run on certain
Android devices new and old I would
almost say like maybe maybe that's an
issue of the platform's making right
like um I don't know all right honestly
probably face this you just haven't
found an iphone old enough just because
most people hate older iOS is and
upgrade their phones i don't know like
so it was actually deploying
specifically to that vice if there's a
good question just my web app doesn't
work on iOS it was more my web app
doesn't work on certain android devices
new and old oh I would just say like
even though we have Cordova doesn't mean
like it's a panacea it's gonna fix all
your problems or even like you mentioned
just because we have Cordova we have
access to plugins doesn't mean that the
plugins well written or the API that we
need with a code that we need has been
exposed on the platform right and it
sounds like you know you guys are doing
transcoding and you said iOS is from
what you could tell doing a better job
so you know that's that's probably a
fundamental OS difference yeah um to
address the the actual the original
question that I didn't realize was
mostly web-based um I I don't I still
don't have much curation there we do
play around with different devices will
we test our app but uh frankly we don't
spend a lot of time doing responsive
design um so site doesn't always look we
try to make a site somewhat usable phone
but it's not really our first goal
we like most people are doing this on
their top so it's not something that we
run into a lot yeah yeah I'm kind of
curious like are you guys thinking about
maybe doing an iOS Cordova application
where like people can actually just do
the recording right there and then it'll
get uploaded and still leave from their
phone cuz I like that's why yeah that's
what I meant with with with Mike helping
us experiment with that that's
definitely something we're looking at
two um we want to have a mobile app I
just don't know if it's going to be
we're just deciding like do we white
label somebody else's thing we write our
own if we write our own is does he need
to be native does it need should it be a
mini rap I'm water all the trade-offs
that's that's sort of what we're trying
to evaluate right now yeah yeah i know i
will say they'd like one random thing
that we encountered with with mobile
devices in n video was i can't recall if
this is just I OS or foots all the
little devices but there's something
that that forces you to actually hit a
play button in order to start
prefetching the video which I didn't
realize um said oh uh so if you have an
html5 player and you're running on a
desktop it'll you can tell the players
suspect prefetching the video but on a
mobile device it will refused to do so
so I had this thing where there was a
bursa like you know it's loading screen
um and the is loading screen would block
the buttons but iOS it would block the
buttons and those are the same buttons
you had to hit in order to avoid these
loading screen so it was it was like
months where we had people complaining
that you couldn't actually use the thing
on on um iphone I was just like all
right I'm gonna spend an entire day and
figure out what the magic is to make
this happen and finally it was just like
oh this is stupid restriction so we'll
just remove the loading screen for iOS
devices
that's funny nice all right um so we're
kind of out of questions there we got
through what tenim that's pretty good
that's that seems to be average usually
pretty good we have not just about stack
overflow it's like the one thing oh
that's right yes yeah so let's talk
about that because you're like you're
like one of the top answers on stack
overflow right I'm curly Ryan a number
two in the world for for meteor nice
number two we'll just call it number two
in the world um qualify it with with is
it the meteor yes it's definitely juices
the effect but um but but yeah I spend
time on the road day I my I just try to
answer one question today I don't know
what's making it but um but I definitely
read uh I read probably more than ninety
percent of the titles and then of the
actual question I might read half of
them I'm so you're posting stack
overflow I'm I'm really likely to see it
um that's kind of crazy that's that's
like just like volunteering your time
basically right yeah yeah it's renovated
addiction I try not to indulge myself
too much fun at work um and you know my
wife gets annoyed while I do it at home
suicides it's I have to limit the amount
of time I spend on it but um but it's
fun to ping few people and and I enjoy
doing it for the most part yeah see now
I I always have trouble I don't stack
overflow is ok to me but people want
very specific answers I tend to myself
like I'll answer a lot of core questions
because it seemed to be more like high
level to reroll like why should I use
this or that or you know what are the
benefits here those kinds of things um
but yeah that's that's pretty crazy so
uh someone wants to know who's number
one uh it's his handle is awk shot but
it's a camera or the guy's name he's in
the UK thank
ah I remember it doesn't have much in
his profile I did know the gets name
might be but now I can't remember all
right he answered a lot of like like a
lot of really early questions um so
that's that's the thing about these
subjects cific accumulating points in a
subject is you get in an early answer a
ton of questions you'll keep getting
benefits of those over time um so uh and
I can do nothing and still get like you
know people voted day on top of whatever
answering so um unless you dropped off
of this is my and I and five questions
today hard to imagine catch on but they
might display that's funny yeah yeah so
I'm less familiar with stack overflow
I've answered some questions they were
um I know like it's weird because you
have to UM you have to get points before
you can do certain actions to write like
leaving a comment like I did I did just
go through and and answer a bunch of
questions and try to get points because
I wanted to be able to leave a comment
yeah yeah the commenting thing is very
restrictive but i can see good reasons
for it you know want random people
creating accounts and then just causing
all sorts of problems with moderators
yeah alright so we got one question but
it was in the chat window rather than in
the topics uh do you want to do you have
time for one more not sure okay all
right we'll take it so this is from
Manfred uh he said I'm from a non tech
background want to be tech entrepreneur
let's say I'm fortunate enough to get my
app made myself I don't make sure it's
tested and secure and all that other
stuff that's a big question I don't I
feel like we kind of covered it a little
bit so yeah would you have anything to
add they're not really I mean read read
you know do the you watch the video that
I'm assuming you're struggling in the
notes and read the articles and security
though that'll come you there it was
your the question just testing um oh
yeah yeah i would i would say um I mean
you know more about that's something
that I do it I I you know just yeah I
would say like if you really want to
make sure your apps tested and you know
i would i would seriously take a look at
cucumber and try to get started there
Sam's done a complete rewrite of it in
the last two weeks and I think he's
gotten better um I haven't had the
chance to upgrade my app yet to see if
it works better but it definitely looked
better from what I saw um i would say
probably if you have a new app then
diving right into velocity seems like oh
that makes a lot of sense because i
think that's probably going to be the
future um in my case you know I I don't
want to take this the wrong way I didn't
mean to say look oh well screw velocity
it has a tiny test in our particular
situation I didn't feel like I was in a
situation where i could do testing and
spent a lot of time figuring out
velocity do the testing and then like
three weeks later fixed the test after
all the bugs have been fixed and they
later fix the test so i didn't think i
was reasonable choice for me so i went
with something that i think it's
probably gonna be stable for another
year but uh yeah i mean if you're
starting out with with nothing you might
as well use the new hotness which is
skin loss anyway yeah yeah i would i
would actually see i would take the
opposite stance of you having documented
tiny test right like that was the one
chapter i had in my in my book that was
complete before i gave up on it and like
tiny test is the absolute most ghetto
part meteor it's like non documented you
know they're matchers are just what they
wanted like I remember going in and
finding a match sure and it said what it
should do but I didn't do what it needed
to do and so like that was my very for
is commit to meteor was to fix that that
matter but it's definitely like not a
place that they put a lot of thought or
time into and I think it's obvious I
mean they're there test runner is kind
of cool right because it fires up a
meteor app and it'll run all your tests
and show you pass or fail that stuff's
kind of awesome um yeah I don't know I
don't think our tests or like super
sophisticated where you need all kinds
of like really like crazy magic it's
more like insert stuff in the database
do some transforms did it work um yeah
yeah definitely um if there's one thing
I can interject also on the stack
overflow stuff um if we if we have a few
more minutes yeah my my general advice
that would be to anyone in the community
list isn't into this that wants to post
questions it's a stack overflow it's a
handful handful of things that I think
will really hear your experience um I
should have probably listed his out
written down i'll try to him from memory
i I was I've always intended write a
blog post about this but I haven't
gotten around to it so I said the first
thing you should do is um Google your
question and I specifically say Google
because do not use stack overflows
search well it's terrible Google
actually does a much better job of
searching Stack Overflow then stack
overflow des hommes so search for your
thing and you know there's probably
about a 50-person chance you're going to
find something pretty close and that
might solve your issue before you bother
to take to answer otherwise I'm gonna
have mark your thing as a duplicate so
you just say time by doing that um so
the next thing is if you can't find it
I'm trying to reproduce your problem
like I cannot emphasize this enough this
is not specific to meteor this is just
general how do you do Bob computer
programs reproduce problem like any
totally separate contained environment
like create a new app insert code and
see if it fails in the same way well
honestly I'd take that a step further
and say like you know you mentioned my
Chrissy and he did a good job on media
interviews
but like use I use meteor pad and
reproduce your bug right there right
because then that becomes shareable and
linkable even better uh yeah when you go
to post it that's fine um it might be a
lot faster to just do locally first
before you put them in your bad but sure
um the point is going through that
exercise of taking the part that you
think isn't going to work and then
putting it somewhere else running it and
seeing if it still doesn't work and
there's another QP part of us which is
uh doing it as few lines as possible so
what you want to do is remove all the
stuff that has nothing to do with a
problem and anyone listening this is key
um Rick remove all the stuff that are
sending you with Bob because this is all
stuff that I need then need to read and
then try to mentally figure out whether
it actually has to do with the problem
um once you've done all of that and you
still have a problem and like probably
enough half at a time you're going to
figure out like oh well once I've
reproduce it it's not a problem anymore
therefore what's the difference and you
might might be able to to debug the
issue from there um if it's still a
problem at that point um then write a
question um and paste whatever code is
necessary the very reduced code hubli
now and when you do that uh the only
other piece of advice I would I would
give on question asking would be um try
to make it as general as possible so if
you write um not only in your code but
in your question and things that are
really really specific to your problem
and maybe they have to be if they don't
have to be I don't get really specific
and the reason for that is um fewer
people will see the question and fuel
people will update about you fuel people
will find this question helpful in the
future if it's super specific but if you
can generalize it even a little bit and
make it more searchable that's great and
then the final thing I'll say is a
respectful of the time of the people who
take two
gets used up when they're answering
these questions so uh you know sometimes
I'll find stuff and I can answer it in
30 seconds and sometimes I will spin
half an hour answer your question and
when I do that it's filled a nice if you
can give me some feedback if it didn't
work or if it did work please accept it
or upload it or both um you know just
showing the person that hey like I
evaluated this and then it didn't work
or did work and give giving them that
feedback is helpful not only to the
community but also to per person taking
time to help you out totally all right
um what did so I gotta get going we're
redoing our kitchen and we have people
coming over tonight so I gotta like
mount cabinets and crap but I want to
say thanks to you David for coming on
the show really appreciate it yeah I was
excited to be here thanks grab me on
yeah yeah definitely and so if you do
want to talk to or ask questions of like
the probably one of the top scaling
media apps right now you should tune in
Thursday May seventh actually at the
same time we're going to do a three to
four p.m. eastern we're going to be
talking to Brad Vogel from mixmax and
we'll talk about his scaling experiences
and actually why they've ditched blaze
and they're using something else on the
front end so um yeah tune in for that I
think it'll be a great conversation
again I think they're like one of the
bigger scaling apps out there right now
and they're very very like I guess gmail
plugins are very susceptible to slowness
and people don't like it when they're
slow so funny stuff all right well again
thanks for tuning in everyone and then
thanks for coming on the show David
thanks Eric see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
