and all that goes on or say fear the
reaper I say bring your Mon you probably
follow
you're looking hot show me how you came
back to Shelby arm for a run I enjoyed
it yesterday so gonna give it a try
again I had to cancel my meeting might
the internet and Airbnb that we're
staying at is just not that great like
not not good enough to work at so no no
real deadlines today don't we kill if I
get lost again I did forget my
headphones oh that's come on and the
temperature is a little bit better than
76 instead of 86 so I'm looking forward
to getting a run in hopefully I don't
know maybe I'll try for like four miles
again you know the problem with the run
yesterday is like when you run in one
direction rather than in a loop you have
to gauge like what your energy levels
gonna be like on the way back like so
when I went to San Diego and didn't run
I ran four miles in one direction and I
just don't I don't think I would have
had the energy to do four miles back in
the other direction and so I end up
calling uber tell me how you feel cuz
you say you're living fine all the time
but I know what's real and saw this
tell me how you do consume baby came up
with a system when I come to a trail and
I want to take it only right times and
then coming back only left turns and
that way you I think you lost another
hot run I turn around three her 1.75
miles so I ended up getting three and a
half turned out perfect so I think
that's all ahead of me today I'm going
to try to ratchet up to five at some
point soon though so you see right not
hear those
they can't help but notice say my name
till they wear it out envy is the focus
there's no reason to doubt you follow
you're looking hot
got done with my run quick shower like
I'm still sweating to other people have
this problem like my body temperature
after a run just stays however usually I
have to wait like 30 minutes afterwards
before I take a shower otherwise the
sweating just continues I took a cold
shower but it's still in seemed to help
the time could just be it's hot here I
don't know was a good run I got some
shade some sunny spots it was nice in
the shade I'm starving though so I'm
gonna head over and to the juice bar and
grab a quick snack and then meet Wendy
for lunch in like an hour so show me how
you do tell me how you feel cuz you say
you're living fine all the time but I
know what's real and solve the same

waiting on the next thing I would say im
