club apprentice series here I just
thought it'd be fun to you know I'm
working with someone who wants to learn
meteor Paul welcome Paul hey and I
thought it would be fun to just kind of
record the teaching and the learning and
everything that's going on so can p be
preserved for others down the road and
you know maybe other people can learn as
well but specifically we're working on
kind of meteor meteor club related
things so today we're going to be
working on the media club site the goal
is to start getting new features out on
it so yeah anyway without further ado
I'll share my screen if you're not
familiar with pair programming the idea
is that you know I'm going to be writing
code and you know Paul is going to be
watching and asking questions and kind
of forcing me to stop and think and
start discussions about is this the best
way to build the feature and I also find
that pairing is a great way to to also
learn so it's a good way to transfer
knowledge can you see my screen okay
Paul yes okay okay so let me turn off
all these notifications we've got a site
on github it's private right now I
actually make it public at some point
get a window yeah
I use team ox and them if anyone's
curious what that is look at that it's
still notifying even I turn up occasions
let's see I'm gonna work on meteor jazz
that club just get this running kill
that guy your run yes step one should be
to upgrade it huh he goal today is just
too we've got a design that's been pre
done by the designer that allows us to
easily integrate the Q&amp;amp;A sessions and we
can um we can show upcoming sessions and
we can show past sessions and the past
sessions will integrate the YouTube
video into the website and then the page
also exists so that you know I plan to
get the video transcribed and so there's
a some transcription that can be put in
as well and so the goal would be to get
that working oh goodness I guess I
should have started this lot sooner
alright well we'll let that run in the
background also had some documents here
that I pulled up api docs because we're
going to work with the Google+ API did
you have a chance to look over those at
all Paul um I looked incredibly briefly
I didn't think a lot of time to check it
out okay now I've taken a kind of skin
but it wasn't really sure what exactly
what areas we would need to be looked at
okay so i think the portion that we care
about is the activities and so they've
got a activities resource here as part
of their HTTP API yeah and I they've got
this API Explorer which looks cool and
so I took the UH ID of this guy which is
an upcoming Q&amp;amp;A session and popped it in
and hit execute and it gave me a 404 and
it looks like you need an API key on
here but I don't see like they don't
have a field to set the API key so I
guess we could
bit of reading i was doing are
struggling to see how they look at their
events versus and activities or hangouts
I think there are all considered
activities okay I'm guessing if it's a
hang out there might be additional
information just not sure how to get the
Google+ API key maybe the intro so I'm
seeing Adam if you're working too much
with Google+ i managed to look a little
bit in seeing the developers console
where you can basically create a project
and it looked like fun project you could
get key okay and which is console dock
developers.google.com deed that's where
i met so call this meteor club
you know get a fancy modal with a
spinner here here we go and then I think
it was that enable api's in the middle
this one I briefly look to see because I
was trying to see how do i set up so i
started there because i thought well i
don't i don't understand one which which
of the api's i should be working with so
this line at that point see maps their
Google+ API right here just to create a
whole bunch of legal stuff uh my reads
those Kathy nope just doesn't flash my
credentials now it's not something you
particularly want I wonder if we can get
it with the public access
oh really you gotta give it an IP
address huh not necessarily yeah can I
give it like the whole internet this is
bricked because I provide usage minutes
need your milk is with it's an abuse
they can do client browser as well let
me create one without oh yeah there you
go you just leave a blank all right so
we'll just we'll use this one for
testing and then we'll delete it after
the session let's see if we can get the
API Explorer to go that's a long
offering yeah it's taken a while so I
think we can just try curl see what we
get back
404 it may be all versions are we on
version 1 keep an activity yeah maybe
you're right maybe the events of their
own API because this should be public
yeah public event
if we can try this one list out for a
user list so where's my user ID
oh google no it's easy a select expected
no definitely not me we can just say me
but i'll say when we do that 404 not
found
and if I do some searching and
background no no go ahead so expected
actually yappin up maybe they don't have
this information in their API hangout
app you see that's willing to app know
they have exactly google+ hangouts API
there I found some different
documentation mmm this is for writing a
hangout app that's not quite what we
won't either
I mean another hack I guess would be too
let's look at they give you youtube url
so maybe we can look and see what the
event looks like on YouTube just like at
events you've got the Q&amp;amp;A here
yeah if i click links then you get the
event page the youtube and the video
embed
there we go get the app running at least
you
you
so I think I commented out the ink here
we go so in the top bar we've got a link
that goes to ask questions and it takes
you to this page okay and the idea is
that each event would have kind of like
a listing down here sequentially and
then I would show like guests as well so
I guess each one has a guest associated
with it we can pull in their pictures
and stuff finding some stuff on on stack
overflow I'm a while back let me see
what I can find I not give you some
Eastern the stack overflow link okay
it's the group chat and and there they
had a samba link it says you can use the
activities a pxe activities greater for
public events and but it doesn't look
like you get access to the full details
about the events we only need some but
that goes to the same spot we were
oh that's
the event link is different from the
activity ID how do you convert the link
to an ID that's the problem that's why
we're getting a 404 their discovery
mechanisms kind of suck so cool i buy
something so far from anybody my
extensive googling is to look at the
activities for a group or something
effect unless you can get that list of
activities you might be able to find the
events that are happening right but
nobody seems to be saying that a direct
correlation between and like how do you
convert from your activity i need to
event idea or an event ID to an activity
i do right so probably like the worst
api we could have picked ah a pro yeah
so you know 444
I guess we have to say public it's work
a miracle invalid credentials sticking
something
see how do we here we go that's better
look at that the idea is all numeric you
see that yeah yeah huh yeah that is
bizarre whoa down here it's not all in
America that's for this event session
one oh wow it's got all my shared notes
too man this crappy no wonder no one
uses google plus now the panel it's a
wonderful bits ABI uh maybe it makes
sense to tackle this from YouTube then I
know they've got a decent API and I've
got a package that works with it cool
yeah okay let's stop let's take a look
at that angle maybe um something near
better biggest on a point
you stand by the next question is what
does this look like in the YouTube API
get an individual video I know you can
what's the part I don't understand the
part where parameter specifies the
comments have already list one or more
live stream resources the ABI response
will include the part names that you can
include in the parameters are ID snippet
CDN and status
cut it off crazy kinda want to find
video then like a videos get here though
is get reading so title it works bad
request
one summation you're looking for from
the video i just i want to see like i
was hoping to see maybe when it starts
cuz it's got a countdown on the page
right you can say it says please stand
by and it's got this little counter this
is kind of hoping to like it had some
kind of date associated with it so we
could pull that out well let's look at
our guess we should be paying attention
to our UI here so this this right here
should be the most current youtube video
and then hold on sorry about that and so
when you click on one we should have a
page like this and so it's got a title
it's got the youtube video and then i'll
have the transcript I don't know maybe
we just rather than sinking the info /
we just intertwined yeah sucks but I
mean then if you just build something to
display the data and to store it and all
the rest of it whether you think that
data at a later stage or that's true not
at least you've made a starting point
yeah get something hurry yeah okay let's
try that will just make like a a makeup
videos collection so my goal is to make
this like these parenting sessions
available on the site as well
and some wondering if it makes sense to
just have like one video collection but
then have like a video type on it or
something you just want to be able to to
have a series yeah because I could see
you doing pairing with multiple people
so you might want to have a series of
one thing in a series of another right
you've got you have your video type
which might say it's pairing and you can
say my series is you know airing with
full type thing and you've got that
group going you can have pyramid someone
else yeah yeah that might actually be
more like a person ID or something on
there I would think because then I can
tag the ones that you're in and then we
could actually based on that like if
someone comes back on a Q&amp;amp;A or you and I
have multiple videos let's see if we go
back we've got these pictures right here
but they don't actually link anywhere so
maybe it makes more sense to have these
link to a page that shows like Chris's
videos right mmm or like Sasha's videos
or like if you and I repairing then I
would show you a picture and it be your
videos where we paired which make sense
and then we we would have liked the
video type would determine the section
that it goes in on the website and then
the person would determine how it gets
categorized in that view I guess all
right well let's try that then so
collections want videos or coffee i'm
using CoffeeScript on this site so that
may be new to some people
17 so we just say videos equals mu 0 dot
collection you don't know useful just
leave it like that for now and so the
other thing we kind of need I guess we
can just work backwards we can just
insert maybe from the console but will
eventually need an admin area there's
something to make my life a little
easier mmm your would be inserting stuff
from the database from local yeah
in fact we can't good assume that's
because it's published and you're not
subscribing to it this is because the
noggin I rules that are in effect no
it's it's probably because of a loud and
I like we were removed insecure and we
haven't put an allow rule in there okay
doesn't find them in all its American
tonight nothin okay okay so I'm just
trying to decide if we want to like get
the authentication going yeah maybe we
do maybe we want a seed user and
I've already put user account bootstrap
in here now get the latest and i wanna
get sidetracked i really want to get the
videos creating so we'll just do a quick
allow rule for now look at allow it the
DA guess we can just do ups and serve
for now do me give up videos down low oh
yeah maybe three videos good let's see
that just tells it to run a function and
we're not going to take any parameters
and then and CoffeeScript feels weird to
me now after being a JavaScript for so
long I'm gonna have to do great
CoffeeScript tutorials so here we just
returned true so just be like that not
allow anyone to insert for now we can
start playing with hooking up the rest
of the stuff
think that to be Auto publishing here
where is it available because I created
it right then then the husband's becomes
you created it yeah that's good publish
in here taking this thing so long now if
I'm going either the retail outfit took
quite a while mean it's not that my
internet connection super amazing o mine
kind of is this so 70 not use one took
me years to get here yeah well I think
I'll faustos connections are 20 or 40
make connections oh yeah so I was on a
30 meg up until we moved in in South
Africa that's in very limited areas so
if i want that i have to move house yeah
yeah well yeah we had to move to to give
you 100 megabit we can get a gigabit we
actually discussed it but it just seems
ridiculous like already pushing imports
of the house the Wi-Fi to the extent
that it can handle Wow like if you're in
the front of the house and you're on the
that Wi-Fi access point it can only do
50 megs so it's like it's kind of funny
feels like
wasting yeah i do not know what's going
on here can just kill easier versions
file i wonder if it's freaking out
because of the RC tag on velocity here
we don't even need that anymore don't
need that either
there we go now add accounts password
stop my ears so we have something to
tell you absolutely do you see this post
about using package.json this it's a
good think I think either you mentioned
it somewhere I think that I wolf crater
yeah we were talking about on the
podcast do that real quick i'll try that
if you do
oh you can't have to comment at the top
and if you introduce oh haha I did what
you did God's is going to keep the
karmic trenches oh and says you can't
have the comment vicious circle of
comments thanks Jay thanks a lot nice
fully works all right now we're running
all right so it is empty it's also
legitimately empty I don't think we were
able to insert so you guys haven't seen
it I know you saw at Paul but Robbo
mongos a great tool for looking at your
local database somewhere no users
nothing okay so let's try to insert that
video again while the ABS actually
running meteor oh okay there was stuff
in here videos alright so we're getting
our video alright so now we need
subscription here
I start by writing a publication do
videos by type 2 videos that find yes we
need right here need to take a parameter
of you type I'm going to double D I'm
against a fine thanks yo type books
video type no and oddly the router is
JavaScript just making life easy yep the
designer wrote this so yes or questions
just returned me here dot subscribe yes
type don't quite like calling you
questions QA oh and I come up here is
Jade st. yelling at us right so let's
insert one here
so call that title something like
YouTube URL that guy I'm give it a video
type o QA here we go knit number so get
rid of that one document yes
not sure
should we just set a future flag on
these like I don't know like put a date
on them when we enter them if you're
putting dates of the broadcast you said
it then it's in the future you can come
down towards if you said ask you've got
the ability to show and it's a sort by
date and say when this happen ok so what
cost enter or something like that it
works all right I don't even know the
munger day it look like share ID oh do
we have Houston in here and we have a
problem brothers a Houston collection is
Amir i'm considering Houston's the
package yeah it's like an admin package
hmm all right well let's just start
iterating in our template and see where
we get
oh that's interesting she totally faked
out that's designer ever that we got
like guest details already in here for
us video details she's already created a
striker yeah that's funny hey that's
kind of awesome yeah of course these
need to become functions but do
something bad to get it work in easily
yeah maybe it is time to bust out the
YouTube API I know we can get this stuff
from it I did it all media talks because
you want to be able to basically missed
every YouTube video that you've done
well not know but we can like if you see
this here like this is all coming
directly off youtube so that we're
getting like this thumbnail screenshot
we're getting the title and then when
you click in this is just making a
lightbox but obviously
who's gonna have the URLs yeah yeah this
is the point where I'd want to put
youtube in all right if anyone's done
recent work than me on youtube I prepare
my frame API searching there you go
let's see if he i er there long alright
so let's try his package baby need all
right all about out of time so this will
stick a pin in this and i'll make a
branch and will continue on on thursday
okay sound good yep i'll do some
research with me time yeah all right and
I'll find my keys and we'll put them in
the settings file so i had to expose
them all over youtube
attention yeah alright okay alright man
i'll talk to you a thursday will do the
same time that work that works i mean
okay awesome yep thanks yep right cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
