what we're calling this I guess pairing
with Sasha Josh what huh welcome Sacha I
guess I should say that hey are you
standing yeah I'm trying out a standing
desk alright if I totally just go nice
little about my regular desk but yeah
nice yeah I just totally got mine set up
to all right uh yes so I thought the
focus today it might be interesting to
just look at performance stuff so I was
noticing that crater is a little slow
here and there so like how could we
maybe speed that up and I saw a few
things just on my initial go through but
I wanted to save it for a video my mic
doesn't reach on the new desk yet so i
got a new cable on the way um so I just
I thought it would be fun to kind of
record this this process and maybe it'll
help other people out and also just to
kind of see what pair programming is
like I don't think you've done it before
have you Sasha no I haven't so I just I
thought it'd be interesting to kind of
watch as it's happening and learn you
know kind of what it's about and why can
be beneficial and so you know i don't
know the telescope code base as well as
i show but i do know how to kind of dive
into performance issues so he knows the
code base he can maybe point me to where
things are so you know hopefully between
the two of us will kind you thinking
through things and working on things and
i thought that would be unofficial so
we'll see oh well I want shim you do it
that sounds like hahaha yeah yeah yeah
let me share my screen we go so I
I have khedira already installed if
you're not familiar with it you can go
to Khedira that IO highly recommend it
for this kind of thing I've got it set
up for crater I'm sure y tres explorers
popping there so when you come in here
the first thing you see is kind of like
what's going on real-time the site I've
got it it's already pegged at 24 hours
so I think normally you'll see a 30
minute window so you can kind of see
like we we hover it 85 sessions in the
evening picked up to like 90 91 but our
CPU performance is pretty good here and
seems like our memory hole it's pretty
study but you can change it to 24 hour
window which I would recommend
especially if you're diving into stuff
like this you can see our method
response time today is actually been
pretty zippy our publication response
times actually been pretty good too we
may have to surf back a little bit to
see maybe some spikes but usually where
i start when i'm doing this kind of
stuff is looking at the pub subs because
i think that that's where the majority
of your data consumption is happening
and that's that's you know we've got
weight ons and subscription and so we're
waiting on those to come back with
something and we kind of want to see you
know things populate is that data comes
in so speeding these up I think would be
the biggest one for us so if we go over
here to charts you can see like I've got
it sorted by response time and then
underneath it so the green is the
response time and then underneath that
is a gold bar here and it shows you
that's kind of like the sub rate so 1.7
subscriptions per minute seems to be
pretty tops here so like this is the
slowest response time and the highest
subscriber so I would think that this
one would actually be a pretty big win
for us and you can go here like we can
see the spike right here at 644 if we
click on that you can actually
see these traces down here so we can
click on this guy and you can see we
waited on 16 subscriptions this first
one is just like this is a core meteor
stuff the client version that's how the
hawk code push stuff works within
categories and this this looks weird to
me because we're seeing like post list
post list users post last post less
users like its kind of weird that we're
seeing those over and over again we
probably shouldn't so maybe there's a
problem there yeah yeah maybe some kind
of loop that's not quite working the way
we thought it should and then down here
you can see this using a blog this is
generally a good thing as well so should
be nice and fast so you can see actually
the query that we're doing right here we
were looking for a user we are observing
changes on a user actually a bunch of
user excuse me so the interesting thing
here is we can take this users ID in we
see the query i'm using robo Mongo by
the way but it should work with plain
old mom go as well so we can just run
you just explain on that and you get
this this back this feedback here that
says that we've just done a cursory
search it's just a basic cursory search
it's not multi key we had to scan five
objects in order to find them actually I
don't this isn't is this telescope yeah
this is telescope okay just make sure um
so it didn't
it on any indexes so but that's not
quite what we did here either so the
search was actually more like be go to
put quotes around that guy we did the
dollar sign and so you want to try to
replicate the query that you're looking
at what's around that guy too I'm just
give it an empty array you can see again
it's a basic cursor search still don't
think that's right
so what are you saying you can find out
right now uh so the goal is nexus we
want to want to see a different response
on that long ago vex explain we want to
see like a b-tree cursor instead and
that tells us that we've hit an index
and that means it's going to be nice and
zippy let's see if they show an example
yeah here you go bee tree cursor
indicates when the query used in index
and then what you should see is the end
scanned drops dramatically so it doesn't
have to scan the whole database table
right okay yeah unless that never really
looked into like MongoDB the um just you
know group basic queries and like how to
use it but the whole performance aspect
and scaling aspect it's really pretty
far into me for yeah yeah I mean it
would sir it was foreign to me too but
coming from like rails and my sequel
well it's maybe a little less for him
because I've done this kind of work in
my sequel so like the explain stuff is
very similar in my sequel you can run a
query in the toss explain on it and then
we're in the front of it and then it you
know it gives you kind of like this this
output from the database telling you
what it what it's doing so we see see
that doesn't look great to me this is
cucumber dot users working off the
comber branch um yes so you can see like
I just called the next screencast
testing yeah well that's that's the the
topic for my next blog post at least
yeah so we can see we actually do by ID
here it's kind of funny it's not oh you
know what I'm in the cucumber instead of
the meteor that's why duh there we go
copy this query let this is basic cursor
that's really not what we want to see so
what do we want to see we want to see a
b-tree curse or a comeback when we're
looking at it let's close that guy okay
that guy so let's look at posts you've
got an index on ids so if i did like if
we do an ID here ID equals blah right
like it won't actually return to the
church but we can still run i explained
on it and tell us what kind of thing it
did okay you can see here like it tells
it tells you it's a b-tree cursor ID and
then the N scanned is at one whereas if
I take this away you get the basic
cursor and you can see I had to scan
seven objects which is much more
inefficient right right it's actually we
kind of like do you have the whole here
to be in the in your local system or
yeah I mean this is all local obviously
but and it like seven objects is going
to be zippy but you know if we look at
Crater there's like thousands of posts
in the database so skinny through a
thousand post is going to be a lot
lighter so like what I mean is you have
like seven posts in your local database
or something really yeah yeah yeah so if
I just do a plain old find oops you can
see I've got seven po sila book yeah
that makes it yeah so why why maybe I
got to put something here to get it to
trigger right one yeah okay so there is
a cursor here so that this this should
be nice and zippy for us so that that's
probably not a place and that I kind of
knew like that should be there because
that comes from the accounts packages so
I'm question though does it make good
day for which um which property you
query on like if you're querying by ID
or by users slug yeah yeah absolutely
because if I if I say is it user slug I
think it's just log just look so if i
type slug here you'll see it'll change
to just a basic culture so if you know
we query by slug a lot then yeah yeah
you'd want to want to index on that so
maybe that's what's going on because I
think in this case we're querying by um
yeah I'm not sure may look sister let's
look at the code right uh so that maybe
the post list is a good place to start
or um so github telescope no the public
being server publications and post list
server publications post lists yeah and
I know I asked you this the other day
because we're passing in these terms yep
and the question I had for you is like
what what are these terms and I said it
depended on like which
type of front page like what what you're
loading right yeah exactly so and so if
we look at crater by default its top
yeah so my thought is like let's let's
figure out top first yeah so the terms
basically um could you know like when
you're doing posts thought fine on the
client and when you're publishing a
cursor all of the time you end up
repeating the same kind of code like the
same object um so terms is a way to
avoid that and having like a at objects
centralizing on in single place okay so
we're uh what can I look at like what
the top code is actually so in that way
together as a term so in the telescope
base package that's where i define these
objects yep base objects based rjs yeah
ok so just crawl down a little Oh or is
it I just searched from top oh okay
right there are views so view parameters
are based parameters that's like the the
basic object the file and options and
then that can get overwritten or rather
extended with the ones you see right
there okay so in essence
so I will be like the fine will be
status status approved and the options
will be a limit 10 plus sword sticky u
minus 1 square minus 1 okay so let's
look at that what is status approved I
saw 22 ok so just change this to a 2
let's run that I didn't like that once
oh we need to get rid of this so didn't
like that huh this guy working I'm gonna
put because we're in the Mongo kind of
console we gonna put right so I've been
working on a post a blog post about this
terms better I'm not sure if it's like a
common thing or it's just my my own
invention but I think it's pretty useful
like I've done something similar before
where like you can build like the query
up in the client especially for like
search stuff and then like I've
whitelisted it on the back end and kind
of just let the client build what they
want to see type of thing Zoe you mean
right yeah because but the issue here is
you don't want to just like pass an
object as a the argument for the
publication right because like you don't
want to apply pass another that can be
inserted into the fine statement right
away then opens look like you a security
hole so that's the the whole point of
having these terms because you can
define the terms that you want and then
there's a function that goes over debt
and generates the define object and the
options object so it's kind of a
two-step process but there's this a
validation step in there that's really
important
okay all right so I just ran like the
basic query we should probably just fill
it out the rest of the way um so there's
no a basic cursor so it should be a
b-tree cursor yeah that's what we want
to see so I run limit fire I just wanna
make sure the limit stuffs getting in
here right it's not I don't want to
limit in Mongo itself I don't know if it
matters let's just try way if we try
liked up with Vegas yeah so again the
explain tells us this week scan the
seven objects and it was a basic cursor
so what you can do so she does that mean
we should have had an index on status
yes definitely so the easy way to do
that I usually just have a little rushed
why not add indexes on everything then
that you cost you disk space and they
also slow down your inserts so I don't
know if that's true Mongo but I know
that's true of my sequel the other thing
is like if you had an index on
everything then I mean it's just like
performing a regular database lookup
right like you just want to index the
things that you cared a query on
particularly we're right okay that makes
sense otherwise you'll lose the benefit
it's like instead of it's very good like
important on everything then nothing is
important right yeah you have kind of uh
so I usually just making indexes file
are you okay with that like in the
server yeah sure okay um also how it
that can be managed through a simple
schema I guess it's kind of separate but
oh yeah are you using too much keema I
don't think I didn't see anything about
indexes in simple scheme Albert
yeah I know they're totally is a bit in
there about index ID sure yeah I'm less
familiar with it I don't use it myself I
really recommended that an auto form
it's I feel a its kind of the missing
piece for large apps I don't like the
syntax just seems off to me I don't know
um yeah I don't see anything um yeah I
don't think cuz i lo I looked and there
was wasn't anything in there but maybe
that's an idea for more than it was
Compton hmm alright well we'll just
we'll do it the other way um so you can
just call like uh let's see is it posts
or post you know what's the collection
yeah well that's done and sure index is
the so it's kind of a private method and
I talked to media group about this and
they said that they feel like maybe they
just didn't have time to get around to
documenting the method but it should be
made public at some point so I think
someone takes the time then maybe we'll
we'll see that with no underscore in
front of it soon also I noticed we have
one viewer if you have questions feel
free to use the I think you just pose
questions right on the page and we'll
pop in here in the Hangout and I can
keep an eye on that um yeah so you just
go to enshrine X and gosh i have done
this in forever so um my own blog posts
that explains how to do it nice t-shirt
by the way no phonics on your photo
right there yeah yeah I thought you'd
like that
yeah blog posts are a really good wig
like to remind yourself of something but
a lot of the time that's why I write
about the topic is that once I feel like
I have a good grasp it's a way to like
freeze that moment in time and when I
need to come back and helps me a lot
because I like some of this stuff act
leaving forget it's like a week after I
learned it so totally so what are we
about wrapping meteor packages and I
have no clue how that works anymore so
it's a good thing it's like all written
down yeah definitely yeah be clearly
like I already did this and it's kind of
funny I've already gotten it from a
couple months ago but yeah this is like
all the same stuff is outlined on this
this blog post here how to optimize your
Mongo database for a meteor yeah so we
just tell it the field that we care
about and then give it a one for that
field and I think you can use a comma
and you can specify multiple built in
your index as well so if we're like
looking at multiple fields for something
which may be the case like we may need
to just double-check the sort and see if
it's going to change anything but now
you can see like I'm I save that it
restarted the server in the background
inserted the index and now you can see
we're getting the b-tree kosher it still
says scan seven objects which is kind of
weird but the other thing you can do you
can if you use in robo Mongo you can
open these indexes and you can you can
see there's one on status right here and
one on ID right or if you're not using
it you can also just say like get
indexes it'll return you all the indexes
and your query here so you can see like
statuses on there now
and then when we look at our index
bounds it tells you like it you status
to get there I'm sure what all this
means but so that should help a little
what we probably want to still try to
construct the query construct the query
to look a lot like the one that is going
to run which has limit and sore dang in
that kind of thing can get here I like
tell you the exact wary that's running I
haven't uh let's go look again Akira
what about that oh yes I'm go oh yeah
you got if you look at the observed
changes right like so we had clicked on
one before that was looking at the users
that was a quite the right one but this
one is looking at the post here so we
just copy this guy just like this oh
that's interesting the posted ad is less
than or equal to what sugars that guy do
you know um so it would be hot oh
alright so that's actually like to
prevent from showing posts that are
scheduled in the future okay all right
well then that might make a difference
as well
yeah okay there's the sort stuff down
there today where's the limit hmm it
doesn't show the limit in here alright
so let's space this guy in we're still
hitting be keep btree cursor so but
poster that doesn't have an index right
so like how come it's still using be
precursor let's uh well I think it's
still hit on the status but we may want
to put one on posted out as well so
let's like is that always going to be
there you think yeah okay let's uh let's
drop that index and come over here and
just try to do posted ad oops so why do
you have to drop the index cuz i I don't
I just want to get rid of that one
locally because when I save it should
rerun and and add a new index back yeah
so here we go you see it out of this
status one posted at 10 well then if I
were quarrying just I status doesn't
mean it wouldn't use that that index I
guess I don't know like we can try that
do we need like 10 here you go see this
is this is much better see now we're
getting like okay 00 objects that could
be the time stamp that's doing that no
should still pull those back well you
can put the time here that's are you
sure to see what
looks at when we run him yeah it still
hits that other one so I think thank you
good there so see after that guy and
then how do we looks like a raw manga
swhrt yeah we just call sort on it let's
go back to Khedira grab these sport
options out see if that changes anything
now still says betrayed cursor Nick will
be all right okay so that's posts um
that should be a big win and then post
users no post list users that's the
other one we were looking at right
excuse me
click this guy look at him look at the
observed changes this is the one we were
doing the query on the ID in an array
right yeah three thousand milliseconds
is really long it is but that's combined
right so i think the post list user is
maybe as fast as it's going to get
because we're already hitting an index
there according to what we looked at
before but the real question is you know
why you can see like up here we start
querying for the post list and then the
post list user right can we do it 1 2 3
40 times on the set and then a fifth
time on post list so one reason i don't
know if that's the case here but like in
some views like the daily view there's
like the page is broken down into
components so if you have like five days
each day will have its own subscription
I see so I
it's good because you can like click
load more on each day independently and
it's all self-contained but I guess it
does require more subscriptions um which
might mean uh yeah longer loading times
totally honest Famer here oh that's
pretty cool that's a first or not wow I
guess meteor apps are pretty easy to to
spam because you can just do it through
the console like you can get it
programmatically please or you don't
need to you need to trim it up still
have to have a huge right yeah kind of
make the user actually it's really good
because it gives me a reason to charge
people for a service like i can i can
create my own and his fam thing look at
his map yeah i was just listening to a
podcast interview with matt mullenweg
from work present was explaining the
whole thing like how he launched a
keysmith and so on was very interesting
but anyway ya did it they don't charge
for akismet do that or do they have not
a paid tier but he was saying I was kind
of that the missing the bus right Bob
comm service yeah all right um you know
I really wish there were a way to see
the URL or something associated I drop
we can't as far as I know oh here we go
top no it was totally top but it was
limit 180 huh that's interesting yeah
well okay that if you're trying to
display 180 posts it makes sense that it
would be a little slow I mean I still
don't know why it's
why there's like well it's let's look
this one's a little a zip here let's
look at this one yeah they're just
looking at 20 okay but uh you know what
you're we're still making two calls here
to post list yes still doesn't seem
right to me but one other thing with
Aaron router like it's really cool and
it can manage your subscriptions but the
reactivity means that a lot of the times
things are getting cold twice or more
and maybe that's what's happening here
like yeah we're uh where's your router
violent brutal water I live routing no
lip router and then post gotcha gasps
and yet so post this controller
subscription also I need to remember how
this thing works
yes i'm not using way arm and there's
two subscriptions one for the posts and
one for the users not all those posts
that should be fine though like it
depends on the search query session
variable so maybe that's making it run
too many times for some reason um yeah
that's true I'll just add a console log
here okay yeah I guess we could look
like locally I've got it running as well
lately I've been thinking that I mean
our Erin router is a great piece of
software but I think it may be tries to
do too much like I've been trying to
move subscriptions more inside the
templates or inside the controllers or
whatever you call it to to lighten the
load the way the light on the complexity
of of the routing code all right I hit
my staining limit I'm gonna move my desk
all right check the logs here
look at that like the search query like
re root causes that to rerun like five
times yeah but i'm not even using a
query right now right yeah so it's
probably um well yeah I guess that that
needs to be fixed yeah wait to be fair
like this what thought shouldn't even be
here because it's like managed by a
package so I need to find a way to like
insert that into the query without
having that code in the core because I'm
trying to keep all the search code in
the search package all the categories
coding the categories packet and so on
oh I see okay that's probably something
I need to look at anyway yeah still bugs
me though what would would would what
could we do that well what if you just
take it out like if that's all the
problem then at least we know that's the
that's where the issue is coming from
yeah you some not in think it here and
see if it put it in half
we lost our viewer yeah so now it only
runs twice rather than like six times so
it's kind of interesting happened if I
move this out here we just code out once
twice okay hmm yeah it definitely seems
like it's causing that code to rerun
more than once yeah definitely be a
performance issue all right well do you
want to like dive into it or you want to
like take this offline for refactoring
or um yeah I'll probably do that later
okay we can look at a few more indexes
real quick well the other interesting
thing is you can look at the methods as
well right all I can see if we sort
these by response time yeah the embed
Lee data is definitely the slowest since
I make a deal like external call yeah
yeah same thing with these two like
these are MailChimp logout that's a
little surprising yeah why are people
logging out nobody until oh gosh what
are you go ah but what's slow about it
that's the real question excuse me sorry
um lot stuff it is doing a lot of stuff
I'm guessing it's so because there's a
few filters that like look at your login
status to know if you have access to
some routes or not yeah yeah like now
this really looks ripe for refactoring
everything's like 12 milliseconds pretty
zippy I think it's just like a ton going
on when you log out right yeah now here
we go of a post this seems like one that
would be we want to be a little zip here
see if there's anything in there that
that's interesting
you
there's still no big gotcha in here it's
just a bunch of small queries that add
up she kind of see if you probably go
look at the method we do a fine on the
user yeah and then those I actually gave
a half-finished the post already and so
stuff like that yeah yeah again like
short of I think the interesting thing
here is you can look at these selectors
and probably figure out like this up
voters might be a place where on the
posts we kind of care about ID and up
voters yeah maybe we let's uh let's copy
this guy where
and be trickier because we're searching
my ID so i think the way mago works
maybe based on this report we give back
is that it's going to limit by the beach
recurse or it could find and then
restrict it from there so then it will
apply this other stuff to it so maybe we
don't have to do it there but I guess
who would've known that if I have paid
attention here fetch on post that should
grabbing the data it's the fines that we
care about 000 yeah all this stuff looks
like it's probably set up pretty well
again a lot of its just lying on data to
come back from the database take some
time um yeah I guess I kind of tend to
assume that database calls are free cuz
it's it's the database but yeah they're
not mean yeah well and so when we get
into production we're adding more
latency on the wire right so yeah I
won't worry if there's like patterns
clothing patterns I could use to
minimize the number of scrolls like
maybe do store more things in memory or
fetch more and then like in anticipation
of other calls I don't know yeah I mean
I guess if we look at this we do find on
users with us the ID here but then down
do fetch on the user's again right
because there might be some okay I like
this yeah
i'm passing i'm using acquiring for a
user in one method and then passing the
ID to another method which also queries
for the user objects may be a good job
um yeah I haven't yeah like I didn't
consider that when I was coding that
part I think yeah I mean performance
wise it may speed it up a little bit but
I don't yeah I mean I'm I'm kind of torn
there it's probably cleaner excuse me
pass IDs between methods right thing
yeah cuz like you sometimes you're
you're not sure if you're basing it like
objects it can be harder to figure out
what's going on with that ah the other
thing to like this you know we're doing
a fetch on the user's table ID in right
here yeah I wonder I wonder if you
should just get the field you care about
right because it took twenty eight
milliseconds but you probably care about
all those fields in that code right yep
so that that may help as well let's
hoping to find another index in here
we'll go back to the pub what's this
good this guy's really slow well yeah
that makes sense because it's just
firing for every single user by all the
Lincoln or happenings though so it's
like when you're you know bringing up
the user dashboard or stuff like that I
see it's just a lot of just a lot of
documents really yeah over a thousand to
be exact
post comments there we go comments by a
post ID just comments like that oh I
didn't even ask can you probably pretty
tiny for you huh oh I can read under my
uh okay still I'm pumped for the
internet ID and basic picture again
that's still of semi hi sub rate on that
guy right that
users that really bothers me why is it
the slowest oh no my tear into it well
you know why I'm here ah so now just
make sure we fixed we go Petrie cursor
zero scanned awesome cool i'll probably
have to head out so I'll just uh make
this a pull request for you real quick
sounds good hey I know which I've pulled
this from yep not the right one you got
a fork telescope why do all this offline
but oh yeah i'll send you a pull request
and i'll probably copy this file over
and deploy it to crater here in a few
minutes and kadir is pretty pretty zippy
and data starts flowing in pretty quick
so I'll probably see a of this within a
few minutes so awesomely crater seem
zippier later tongue oops alright thanks
bolt thanks I'm sure well uh we'll do
this again um huh I'm looking forward to
that we design okay yeah yeah I got kind
of got to work on that I've actually got
someone that's interested in being an
apprentice and kind of using that
project is a way to learn learn more
meteor stuff so we'll probably turn into
that
on an apprentice video in the next week
or so right yeah and then you said might
be interesting to do some SEO stuff as
well right or like Open Graph yeah all
right maybe maybe when playing something
next week and spend an hour kind of
tearing into that sounds good all right
man Oh see you later you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
