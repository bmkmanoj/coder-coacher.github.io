we talk about graph ql graph ql graph ql
and please episode is for fridays for 16
2016 come crater fans i'm your host Josh
oh it's along with some nice special
guest co-hosts been do good welcome Ben
not to be confused with Ben Strahan oh
yes new bit it's like it's like a new
hope maybe I don't know yeah I think we
even have the same birthday do you
really funny I think so his is November
10 ah that sounds right ish you should
come on should come to Space Camp so bad
my hand just signed up for Space Camp
Ramsay's all that birthday is also that
same weekend I think abhi's is like
right around there to like LOL so just
all the birthdays that's funny indeed
speaking of birthdays no I don't think
it's a birthday but uh we're gonna talk
a lot about graph ql maybe it's official
first birthday yeah like this launching
if it's one coming out of technical
preview ah so we're going to talk a
little bit about that we're gonna talk
about github an aircraft ulap i want to
talk about subscriptions with graph qo
and one of these things is not like the
other we're talking about blaze come on
blaze yep please hanging around yes so
well will actually start with the blaze
story it looks like it's getting some
new life breathe into it and so if you
check out the show notes they actually
have a website dedicated to it now blaze
jsf work which is you know they actually
try this effort once before but it seems
like maybe they're they're doing a bet
job of it this time around back prior to
meteor one point oh so if you're not
familiar with the blazes the default
kind of rendering front-end framework
that came or comes with meteor you can
obviously switch it to react if you can
switch it to what's what's the other one
that no one uses no thank you just
kidding we use it um ya know like lake
blaze blaze has gone through this weird
tumultuous life since um just almost a
year ago like people were asking what
the heck's going on like pull requests
are sitting like nothing seems to be
happening and then there was a focus on
supporting reactant angular as official
like easy to add front-end frameworks
and then I think the community just kept
pushing and finally meteor came out and
said listen we're just not gonna be able
to work on this like we think reactant
angular probably go and um yeah I think
I think that made a lot of people sad
because it still is like a solid
front-end framework like it has some
performance issues that can be fixed and
maybe it's missing a few things that
could be short up but it's still it
works really well and I think if we you
know work on it and try to develop some
good solid best practices around it it
could still be something of do something
wrong in the and i think that's that's
what's happening now like they've
decided we're going to turn this over to
the community to work on like it's not
something we can keep pushing forward
and based on this website like it looks
clean good documentation kind of covers
a lot of what's what's going on how to
use it and a lot of this i think a lot
of this was just information that was
scattered elsewhere and they've just
brought it together into this is a
website now yeah
and they talk a lot about the future
work that they would like to get done
and I don't know like this is this is
exciting to see but I also wonder if
it's maybe too little too late I don't
know what do you think yeah I think of
year I mean if you're a fan of blaze and
this is pretty huge this is pretty cool
I know that they broke it out into its
own repo too along with this because
it's always been under the same just
media repo which is again I think one of
the reasons it was hard to contribute to
in the past hard to get prsn because
they have to test everything and in 1.4
which just came out they like the person
of meteor is not specifically tied to
core packages right yeah they've
unpinned it so now you can you can
upgrade independently like two different
versions of packages core packages yeah
so yeah this this now becomes easier to
say you know I want to use blaze to
point o rather than 1.4 or whatever like
i think i could let them were being kept
in lockstep number-wise yeah and and
you're right um and it's like it's it's
a weird thing now right because now
we've we've got a maybe rely a little
more on good testing uh like automated
testing of the package to ensure that
we're we're shipping solid releases um
but you know at the same time I don't
know like I'm still kind of weird about
the whole unpinning thing but I get the
available potentially dangerous because
it's not super well tested yeah but I i
mean i think the npm ecosystem mpm
community has been doing this for a
while and it works and and that's one of
the things I i think when meteor started
it was really opinionated again they had
blazed they had the full stack way to do
it there was the meteor way and of
lately it seems like they're just less
opinionation' if you want opinionation'
then you go to the guide but it's not
necessarily a framework built entirely
on opinionation' which i think it
differs in that so if you if you want
less opinionation' then it may
sense to have them on it unpinned it's
an interesting it's an interesting
trade-off it is but I think you know the
flexibility like the fact that i can use
reactors is keeping me perhaps in the
the meteor ecosystem still you know
because i understand that i can get a
solid kind of structure on a friend with
good performance and make a solid team
of five six people that are just focused
on pushing that forward and that's super
interesting to me and so I'm glad that
those opinions are there we can swap
those out now and i think that's that's
just the way the frameworks tend to go
like you you look at rails and even now
like you can easily switch to different
view compilers and stuff like that like
this this has always been a thing if you
look at i remember going through this
with rails and stuff like active
relation and that kind of stuff and so
as long as you adhere to this
abstraction library that they've created
then all of a sudden you can use a lot
of the ORM niceties that they built with
different databases and all kinds of
interesting i think that's that's kind
of what we're what we're seeing here um
no no I'm I'm excited to see what comes
of it but at this point like i don't
think i have anything i think i have two
sites left in place maybe yeah yeah i
mean i'm excited for the people because
i know there are a bunch of blades fans
and over the the way this the whole
blade situation has turned out it you
know it's not not so fun but i'm excited
that now there's it seems there's some
community momentum and the people that
like blaze can drive it forward but uh
indeed and down there's a you know if
you're if you're a fan there was a poll
I wonder if I'd find it here but it was
on the forums and it was about maybe the
state of blaze or something like that
and I think max 7 posted it he's a big
boys fan yes indeed he is and he just
put out a new router for blaze as well
um anyway like it was interesting to see
the results there were
more people voting for blaze and I think
I realized um yeah here it is 279 votes
and fifty-six percent of the people said
they still use blaze well twenty-nine
percent said they would not go back and
fifteen percent said they would go back
which was kind of an interesting result
like I yeah I definitely fall into the
twenty-nine percent I think like I would
rather maybe learn something like view
and then then go back to please yeah I i
love angular I mean react I'm stuck in
reacts Lin right now it's a while the
project i'm currently working on this
angular which is why Sonia brain oh yeah
shut up excuse me react is I really like
react i think it's a it's more explicit
enough more focused than blaze blaze did
a lot of magic under the covers when i
first started learning it that I've just
totally threw me off hmm but and it is a
different its place is more HTML centric
where react you know everything's in
JavaScript it's more JavaScript centric
and I think I like them more but yeah
also like that you can pass you know a
prop that's actually a function and you
can get down and I can do things um I
think that offers a ton of flexibility
I've tried other patterns like that with
blaze and I just don't they just don't
end up being is clean passing along a
reactive are and then having a method
that's watching that and reacting to it
uh gets a little weird little funky yeah
I think it's cleaner just to say hey
here's this method and this is what it's
getting passed from run having to hunt
for that code but what I'm I'm excited
for this and hopefully we can see
something like this happen for the
account system as well because I think
there's there's still some amount like
I've definitely started a conversation
on an issue and there's a pull request
to kind of get blazed out of the
accounts system
because you like if you install accounts
Facebook or accounts Twitter you end up
getting the entire blade stack for that
little configuration screen that they
have no ma'am we want the configuration
screen so just giving me placed your
bloating my crater JavaScript sighs
anyway up which is already kind of big
but yeah I don't know I'm interested to
see what happens from 1.5 as well yeah i
think i think the future braid blaze
looks good now um better with just which
is cool yeah yeah so now they just have
to get it on NPM and I think this thing
could have a potential life of its own
yeah second time's the charm speaking of
new life new life let's tell us about
math ql subscriptions graph ql
subscriptions so if you haven't been
paying attention meteors been working a
lot on our MDGs been working a lot on
Apollo lately which is a graph ql client
and server there's a server side too so
they just came out with subscriptions
which again if you're familiar with
meteors is very similar kind of
conceptually at least from the client's
perspective how you've been using meteor
because you simply you know you ask for
your your query and you tag it with a
subscription query instead of a graph ql
query and whenever those data changes
based on other outside events you get
the record that changed or records that
changed um which is pretty cool and
again is very similar to how meteor
worked in the past but yes this time
they're doing with Apollo and graph ql
which which i'm a huge fan of graph ql
for a lot of different reasons but this
is really cool i'm really excited to see
this now something cuz i know Apollo can
be kind of or at least maybe I'm new
maybe I'm the only one but they talk
about Apollo and really there's two
sides to Apollo because there's a palo
client which should work with any graph
ql server graph kill spec compliant
server i guess which should be most of
them and then there's a bald with server
which is an NPM package
for your server side and in order to get
subscriptions to work you have to use
you have to use both pretty much now
they have another package that's
subscription I have never dear
subscription transport double yes yes so
they're just using web sockets in order
to actually transport the data back and
forth which is really interesting but
the way they're doing is and we it's
funny because project I work on this
past summer did something very similar
just using WebSockets I think you don't
need like web sockets are really not
that hard they're pretty straightforward
which is cool but essentially the
pattern is you fire your subscription
from the client so you in your query so
okay I want all of the users and I want
to subscribe to them so if you use it
gets added or changed info on a user
changes I want to then get that results
and then I have a function that simply
handles any changes up and if you're
using react it can be really simple
because it's just okay rerender
everything with the new data and then
the differing algorithm figures out the
optimal way to change things and it's
pretty cool um so you fire so coming
back you fire the the query from the
client which gets hit by this server
side component which is ok essentially
we now know that this client is
subscribed to this so whenever we get an
event saying that there subscribe to in
this case the users changes then we're
simply going to give them the new data
so somebody else on another client
changes their username or signs up it
adds a user that event so added user or
user modified one of those is going to
get triggered and it's going to get hit
the point of the server that's listening
for changes and then it's going to
notify all the connected clients I guess
or subscribe clients I should say and
it's a pretty cool pattern it's a I know
that internally Apollo client is using
Redux to kind of do a lot of this on the
front end where let's say you have to
you have two components that are both
have like a comment list and in one of
them I update a component all right
update a comment that should immediately
get reflected
the other comment list let's say
assuming they're the same source of data
and it and yeah and so it does that by
using Redux events internally to kind of
say okay comment list changed and then
goes and updates whatever needs to get
update and that's pretty cool when I
think they're they're essentially using
a very similar pattern of that on the
server side which is really just kind of
goes back to event sourcing and a common
way of listening for events and they in
the article they talk about using
channels and I'm not sure exactly what
implementation wise they're using if
that's something like RabbitMQ or some
kind of queuing service but a pretty
cool I know Facebook has talked about
this and they say you know mdg said
they're they're trying to mimic what
Facebook is doing is in regards to the
subscription to make it scalable because
I think that's the other kind of piece
that you run into when you start to do
WebSocket stuff is sometimes it's not as
I guess intuitive to scale you can't
always simply just horizontally scale
which kind of would be the easy way of
scaling okay we'll just throw most more
servers at it because sockets have to be
connected and again if you paid it into
the meteor you've known about this
because the whole sticky session thing
and so so it's interesting but I think
they're they're scaling it down in a
sense where I think meteor before again
with sticky sessions they were trying to
only send you the data that had changed
where this or Apollo subscriptions
trying it seems like they're sending you
just everything when something changes
they're sending everything and so
they're doing a little bit less
monitoring of exactly what changed and
just pushing the data to you but what
are your thoughts yeah I think it's you
know it's early like hopefully they'll
they'll figure out some kind of dipping
so you're you're just getting the
changes run the entire result said oh I
don't know week this is you know oddly I
this is the number one question you
solve for the longest time when people
would join the Apollo slack chat maybe
like is it real time yet and yeah I
still maintain I am building an entire
application for a client and
I don't need real-time just don't you
know and I I question how much you
really need real time in any particular
application and I think this gives you
the flexibility when you do have that
need that you can easily add it and they
did mention as well that there's a
package that uses Redis so there's a
Redis pub/sub driver basically that
would allow you like if you're gonna go
to production they suggest using that
yeah so I I think this is super
interesting and you know they've broken
it up in such a way that you know
they've got the graph ql subscriptions
library which comes with the pub sub
driver and the subscription manager and
then on the front end you know they've
got the the apollo client working with
redux and you can make the subscribe
call and then you get the updates and so
like the breaking apart in such a way
that you could really use any graph ql
server that you wanted on the from the
back end and still kind of participate
and use apollo client on the front end
side and gain this functionality so i
like the way they're doing it and i'm
pretty excited to see it yeah i think
it's pretty cool so one of the things we
did at work was we add the kind of a
full stack Redux set up so we're using
regex on the front end with react like
normally people do but on the back end
we went full-on just a vent sourcing
everywhere so we had a different
microservices which each had their own
Redux tour and we were just using
RabbitMQ to fire bends back and forth
which made it really easy we had we had
set it up at one time to have like a
WebSocket like my cursor vez which just
monitored whenever any client joined a
specific socket room which is just
something you can do in socket i/o and
the the micro service would just listen
to all the events coming across the
queue and if there was any that pertains
to a specific room it would just fire it
to whatever connected clients were in
the room um and I think that because we
hadn't you know used a palo server at
the time we were using graph ql but i
think that you know this system seems
relatively easy to plug into um if we
were using something like that which i
think is really exciting because i think
you know
past meteor was not always the easiest
to kind of plug directly into but yeah
pretty exciting yeah I'm definitely a
fan of small libraries that offer easy
integrations right because like someone
else could take one of these sides of
the implementation and integrated in and
i think that the adoption rate can be
much higher and maybe we see this become
aa more officially like part of the spec
for subscriptions um and I'm glad to see
MDGs kind of leading the way here with
that yeah speaking of uh big leaps and
leading the way uh I was kind of
interested to see that github totally
just implemented graph qol API and I
think maybe this is the part that a lot
of people don't get is like graph ql
sounds interesting and but i don't i
don't always fully understand benefits
i'm gonna gain from it and you know for
me I worked on a team where I for
godaddy and like they were building an
application godaddy bookkeeping and like
we were rebuilding the mobile app and it
just didn't it wasn't easy to do because
like it turns out people were just
building little bits of API here and
they're all over the application and
there was no real thought or rhyme or
reason kind of put into how it all
functioned and how the communication
would happen and what are the return
results look like and the front-end
backbone application was relying on that
data to come back and so you know we
were trying to figure out like ah we got
to do some versioning and you know we're
gonna have to like rebuild all this in a
different way and like graph qol I think
would have made them way more
interesting and enforces that thought to
happen um I guess up front if you're
gonna use it and um yeah you know that
the thing is like you stop caring about
versioning you just care about like the
data you need you tell the server that
you need give it some stuff like in
search off of and it'll return you that
data in the format you want and I don't
this is this is really really
interesting to see github kind of
offering this up and they're you know
they're they're consuming the graph qol
API to build the actual site so when you
hit like the comments they added the
emoji reactions on comments and that's
what started them down the path of hey
let's try crack you oh and you know that
here's here's maybe the sentence I found
most interesting is we found
implementing a graph fuel server to be
very straightforward the spec is clearly
written and succinctly describes the
behaviors of the various parts of a
schema I mean this is like their
although the Baba okay and so they're
using relay I didn't quite read all this
part but yeah um you know I know this is
super exciting to me you know they're
they're using gradual Ruby to kind of
handle the back end and they've got a
graph ql client now um yeah it's like a
ruby specific kind of integrated two
rails graph kill back views pretty
interesting yeah and they also have um
this this get hub graph qo library now
ah that's what I was talking about
that's the yeah they they have a client
built for rails which I guess this
wasn't one of the things that they use
along with really yeah so it allows you
to easily define queries in in Ruby here
it's really interesting and I I think me
it's exciting to see some a big player
in the Ruby community make this move
yeah i think you know this this maybe
validates the fact that that mdg is
making the switch and I think as a
business it's a smart switch for them
maybe as a consumer of meteor it feels
weird for them to make that switch but I
I really do think in the next you know
35 years rest will be replaced with
graph qo and I think it's a smart choice
right I'm just making all till one URL
and you give me back the data I need and
that's it's always been annoying with
when you like I've built a twitter app
and you'll be like okay I need this data
and then you get that back and you're
like wow I need a little different data
and so then you have to go make a second
call and then at a certain point you're
going to start hitting like rate limits
and all that kind of stuff and so it's
it's much much better to be able to just
say like it i need you said it back oh
yeah I'm definitely really excited about
this because I think graph ql solves a
lot of pain points with scaling I know
you talk about versioning well Facebook
who it kind of came up with with graph
ql they have I think the number was
around two thousand versions in
production of across all their different
apps at once yeah which is kind of
completely absurd if you were going to
go the versioning route because any time
your back-end API changed you end up
with v3 v2000 and that's just really
difficult to maintain and I've heard
people claim that a few people of
Facebook say if you pull out your old I
guess iphone 4 maybe he was even iphone
3g yeah and power up facebook like it
would still work which is pretty crazy
um you know and that I think I come Sam
do like a people problem a resource
problem like when you start having that
versioning you actually have to make
sure that those teams are like
communicating constantly to deal with
that and I think you're right like it
becomes interesting because all I'm
saying is like there's a piece data
here's how you resolve this piece of
data i can choose completely independent
of like you as a consumer how I'm gonna
scale that and like rewrite a resolver
like oh crap my sequel is no longer
going to work we're gonna like switch
this thing to Cassandra or oh my gosh
like it turns out postgres was
terrible for building graphs and so
we're gonna switch to neo4j because that
just makes sense and like you can
totally make a switch independent of any
consumer on the front end which maybe
wasn't always the case before yeah I
think I think from the client
perspective graph ql is like the dream
because I just ask for whatever i want
and and i can even have you know
graphical you have this amazing almost
ide for graph ql which which again like
once you use it it's like wow why didn't
we have anything like this before it's
almost my my analogy as if you've ever
done like sequel development and then
just try doing sequel from the command
line that's almost what rest is and then
you go use something like microsoft
sequel server management studio or one
of those sequel server clients that's
like you were like wow this is really
powerful um just introspective queries
that graph ql can give you or they just
say okay you know if you hit the
facebook schema you can just go browse
through the docs and they're just
generated for you like that's super
powerful pattern especially when your
schema is as big as you know facebook's
is yeah um it's pretty cool sure sure
but yes so tell us about the technical
preview so graph ql is leaving technical
preview there now production ready even
though they've been production ready i
always think it's uneven it's like a
rubber stamp yeah it's finish on now now
this is really exciting they the graph q
org got a facelift it looks different
now which is cool so the docs got some
improvements but yeah they're one point
oh and and this is part of just how
facebook believes about you know their
beliefs on open source and how they use
open source they only want to open
source things that you know they're
using in production and solves their
problems which i think is really cool
but I yeah I think this being in
released at the same time that you see
kind of the biggest you know github is
probably one of the the best-known like
rest examples if you look at rest it's
like I get hubs the go-to example
because they did a really great job
implementing rest and and now they've
moved on to graph ql because they think
graph ql
better I think says a lot at the same
time graph ql says this is it like this
works this is official we're at a public
beta which i think is really exciting
and yeah and so now here's to the future
i know there's subscriptions they're
talking about adding to the spec they
have been talking about for a while I'm
along with batching and there's another
one I don't know if they said it in this
article anyway it's just kind of more
performance things from the server but
I'm really excited about graph ql a
meteor and Apollo or obviously they're
back in graph ql and i think you're
right i think we'll see a graph kill
takeover rest in the next three to five
years yeah yeah there's I there's just
too many big players that are moving to
this and I think it's we're going to see
but our clients that are easier to kind
of ingest data into your your
application and and that's going to be
that's gonna like rapidly increase the
growth of this behemoth yeah yeah i
don't know like there have been other
attempts to like you look at uh what is
it hypermedia and stuff like that yeah
you know I those weren't interesting and
they tried to like build upon the idea
of rest but it's definitely I think it
was probably better to just take a step
back and say let's try a completely
different angle and um I think it's I
think it's much stronger I also think
maybe looking at this announcement and
github is announcement maybe they were
cordially have a bit um no we surprised
yeah that's not a bad thing um I I think
it's good to see like these these teams
that are passionate about it or using it
like they are communicating and talking
and like seeing github talk to Facebook
or a team at Facebook about it and like
I know MDGs had conversations with the
graph ql team as well and like they're
running a conference now and mdg is in
like a lot of the
bigger players are gonna be coming and
speaking at that conference in San
Francisco um I you know I just think I
think we're seeing something strong
being built here and it's gonna it's
gonna become something amazing down the
road um I don't know where the day
where's the future stuff and I didn't
actually see it in the post was it
anonymous maybe yeah i just i read I'm
all over the place when it comes to
graph girl so I'm then picked it up
somewhere else but yeah yeah I don't
know exciting I I agree um also think
like I love the new site think you've
got some animated gifts kind of going on
showing you how everything's working I
love the little like little cloud
servers like you know someone's sending
a query up and back and kind of gives
you an idea like that's the most
distinct picture of how this thing works
that I've ever seen um it's true and i
love it i love how it's all star wars
examples too and you know I gotta say
like you're right like uh graphical just
feels like really great tool and they're
out there already right like i can use
robo Mongo and Mongo chef or something
like that but it's it's like it's right
there in your browser easy to use and
ready to go and put out by the people
that are kind of creating the specs so
that's super interesting even still
stuff like Mongo Robo Mongo and that
stuff that's just like database side
that doesn't tell you anything about the
endpoints you're actually changing so I
mean postman i think is the closest
thing to graph graphical and I think
that postman like you can pre define a
lot of stuff but if stuff changes then
like this man is just broken because
it's not introspective but yeah it's
definitely exciting and if you look it I
don't know if you ever heard of Falkor
which is what Netflix uses which is
similar to graft UL yeah it's just I
think the biggest difference and jafar
Hussein who talks a bunch of conferences
and stuff is really cool really good
speaker he gave a talk I think at a
reactor
that was graph cal versus Falkor and
kind of the one of the biggest
difference is Falkor is great if you're
your schema is not that complicated so
like it netflix they had around 20
entities like it's just really not that
complex where Facebook you know um I
want to say they had like four thousand
entities four thousand properties across
all their different you know graphs or
nodes and objects I think that a real
type system if you get with graph jail
kind of makes more sense in that respect
but but they're they're doing the same
thing as far as the way that client-side
developers think about the way that the
server side is implemented it's it's
just a different architecture than rest
and I think it's I think it's a better
way you think like she's more fun yeah
speaking of like orange afar I
actually contacted him and I think we're
gonna have him on space dojo show pride
in the next couple weeks so nice kind of
excited about that too I wanna want to
dig in like I haven't looked at Falkor
at all so I like to use those podcasters
