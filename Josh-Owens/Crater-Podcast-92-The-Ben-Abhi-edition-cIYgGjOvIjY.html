2016 welcome crater fans i'm your host
Ben Strahan and I'm your special guest
co-host Bobbi I her where's Josh today a
bee oh no I think we like we kidnap and
put him in a in a closet so you can be
here all the people wanted to see you
and myself be host so we had to do some
sort trickery there yeah yeah
mysteriously Josh lost his internet
connection yeah mysteriously seriously
let me put these wire cutters away I
think josh is actually teaching the
react class I believe so he knows so
good reason he's not here and good thing
we're here yeah right it's just like
worked out like you and Josh did amazing
show last week yeah that's fun everyone
loved you and then it worked out that
like now there's two co-hosts you and I
so like when josh is like m.i.a we don't
need to skip yeah the show must go on
right now I can I can't yeah I'm gonna
make it happen for those of you who
don't know Abby and I man we go back we
go back in podcast history we go back
it's a very short history but we go we
did like 16 shows of a show called to
Benin avi show yeah it was fun it was
fun while it lasted it was fun and maybe
we should explain our hiatus right you
know or did that we never did this is a
great opportunity or right on dude yeah
yeah haha it plain it you're the famous
talk show wondering too uh I want to do
the Benenati show but unfortunately i
don't have enough time yeah that pretty
much came down to it so and there was an
opportunity that came up to work with
mdg on transmission and obviously was
super supportive and and it was it was
it was the right decision i think for
definitely
meteor community as a whole even I think
yeah may look look at what great stuff
has happened like the forums have died
in terms of like their negativity slowly
there's dying not much negativity and no
more flame wars over there no more flame
wars and that's the best thing you can
do is to up you know uplift a community
like that so yeah yeah miss and I will
be around on the podcast and the crater
podcast I'm sure and then the meeting
the club and all that stuff so yeah yeah
ah will be around I said that whole
description with a lot of remorse show
man it was so much fun yeah ah anywho
but let's see here before we get started
I just want to give a shout out to one
of my new best friends what's his name
anthony phillips anthony phillips
anthony i'm dedicating this show to you
so Anthony is a wonderful YouTube
youtuber that gave a really beautiful
comment on the last show I think it was
really I be in disguise that's why I
think it was it was is killing me I made
a fake account so i could so I can make
funny well Anthony you got your wish
Abby's back unfortunately i'm back to
fortunately but you said that I don't
know the topics i'm talking on and i'm a
little pessimistic so I'm gonna totally
work on that I'm gonna be like way
detailed and way optimistic and we'll
see what happens yeah so and
unfortunately josh is not going to be
doing transmission which anthony wished
that i got sick so that Josh could do
the transmission show that's pretty
messed up I hope you I hope you I hope
you like died of like pig pig flu but
you someone else could do a podcast
it's pretty tough man it's pretty tough
and that's what happens right when you
get a little bit bigger you know I'm
sorry I guess so that's why I responded
saying like this is what Justin Bieber
must feel like yeah yeah but anyway it's
all good I mean I actually like feedback
just that was like a little like that
was like posit that was good feedback
wrapped in a lot of like crap so dude
Anthony keep you feedback coming I like
that but uh step back on on I don't know
what you wouldn't like me to say to you
yeah right on okay other than that I
love YouTube you know what I think I owe
you know YouTube owed me that comment
because I like two shows back I kind of
like ripped on youtube comedy yeah i
think it is like you're totally right so
let's get in the show dip we got four
topics we're gonna be talking about
microsoft releasing a native UI plugin
for cordova whoa we're going to talk
about l mesh functional programming in
JavaScript it'll be fun we'll be talking
about introducing telescope Nova ooh
telescope nola telescope nuba and node
chef verse galaxy developer edition ooh
I'm going to say something interesting
things there ah it's going to be a fun
show I'm I think so so let's dive into
it so the worst topic is microsoft
released a plug-in for native UI for
cordova apps and first off i just wanted
to reiterate that because you guys heard
right microsoft released this and if you
go to this link you'll notice that it's
a native rapper for android and iOS only
their windows phone does not even
include if I think they have like a
JavaScript like platform it's like when
jay s or something like that for their
phones so there you got that but this is
amazing and obvi you and I did a show
sharing our opinions about
Cordova verse native apps yeah in the
past and you are the native app yep guy
mm-hmm and I was the Cordova guy yeah
yeah so this kind of like brings us
together in harmonious matrimony right
yeah did you have a chance to look at
this UI yeah yeah awesome it looks great
it looks great it's it's the right
offering like like no matter how much we
like native or Cordova or phonegap or
whatever there's always going to be two
people in each bucket or people in each
bucket right yeah and the only way the
only way that like people are going to
be happy is if both are developed really
well so projects like this where they're
trying to you know up the game on
Cordova support it's it's always for the
better you know and like this looks
amazing like you you would think that
it's on Microsoft you know yeah but it
does it's cross-platform right you can
just write once in JavaScript which is
always the dream right right one senator
goes everywhere ships everywhere yeah I
think that's awesome I think it's great
yeah it's definitely good you can even
use zamel if you want oh nice yeah
that's if that's your cup of tea you
know a couple concerns that i have is i
looked at the github repo for this and I
was like okay how many people are
contributing to this like like what's
the real backing was microsoft honest it
turns out there's only like really one
guy making it Adam Nathan so like Adam
it thumbs up to you for making this I'm
wondering though Adam if you can answer
me I'll tweet you out like what do you
see the future of this it was this like
a one-off project that you're hacking
together for something Oh or is there
like a longer maintenance plan or
strategy with this because it's awesome
if there's going to be some life to this
plugin then I'm going to totally dive
into it
yeah it's interesting because Microsoft
Microsoft is not traditionally known as
heavy JavaScript players right and with
not not until recently right you know
until is recently like where they have
their own JavaScript was a compiler in
the browser the new Eddie is or is it
edge I think it is their new browser
like they have the RX j s which is that
reactive extensions javascript library
which saw so microsoft and then
predominantly most microsoft developers
that work in my shop for using like
knockout j/s they got the oyster dip the
typescript like these things are just
blowing up you know yeah yeah and it
goes aight you could build native apps
in it with through JavaScript with the
window again so like you can just see
that like the shift is coming so
everybody is just starting to try to
just make JavaScript a lot better you
know and if you're the type of person
that does phonegap or Cordova I think
you should hop on to any new plug-in
that comes out to see if it's going to
be good because right now you probably
have qualms with each one personally you
don't like about each one right yeah
like you could you could achieve what
they're achieving here by getting other
plugins but then you got like sometimes
mess with the native stuff as well yeah
so they're kind of combining a bunch of
things and then they have like really
nice things where you can actually have
widgets like Android widgets hmm
everything so it's it's awesome um what
would you recommend let's say like
you're a developer that needs a mobile
app right like what like your thinking
is okay i do i need to go to make a
native app do i need to do cordova like
meteor gives you the great cordova
built-in are you doing react negative
you know like there's so many options
right now what would you say is the best
like considering a stew like what would
be the best to get your product out
there really quickly
I don't know Abby that's a great
question like right now where we stand
right now I would probably say um try to
stall don't make the decision right now
seriously like like this plug-in that
we're talking about ace is great because
you need working with the new android
and all the animation you really want
native you get so much user experience
when you go native but you might not
have the knowledge to go native yeah or
the resources yeah I mean you're you're
whenever someone asks you a B you always
give the same answer so I can answer for
you which is if you have the resources
in house and go native yeah yeah but the
stuff like ace makes me think of like
last week we talked about deco which is
the react native builder oh yeah it's
the same type of widgets right there's
the same type of concept where you know
you you have a lot of stuff for free I
can like drop certain components well
the components in you know and that's
react native that's another like
approach to building these like you know
it was a hybrid mobile apps you would
say yeah yeah the neat thing with ace is
that you can mix you can like mix this
in with existing projects existing yeah
yeah that's the big thing reactive power
yeah when you go react native you're
going react native that's true that's
true so yeah so someone who wants more
flexibility could use plugins like this
to add some more flair to their app or
something yeah my only concern is is is
it going to be maintained because you
don't want to be adding this into a
project that you're going to be that's
true that's true it is under the
Microsoft github and the last commit was
an hour ago from this like right now it
is cutting any good that's like less
promising right it's there yeah exam
anyway we'll see guys keep an eye out
for this is neat like the landscape is
changing just like how I be framed it
like there's what's the answer we don't
know yeah we don't know no one knows
right now how much good stuff why don't
you make one happen each
I think so like honestly like just do a
small pet project with a sore react
native or deco or whatever these things
like maybe don't put in your production
athlete the the more knowledge you have
about it like just just by being like
introduced to it having some familiarity
with these things it's gonna be way
better than not knowing it so and I
think it has something to say with like
the community it's going to be around it
so I wonder if the Cordova community is
shrinking and the react native
communities growing if that's relative
and if you can project reject that out
you know or is react native just like a
flash in the pan I think that's a big
how look at ya and users tweet tweet
tweet what you think about that tweet a
crater podcast think tweet like do you
think that Cordova is getting bigger or
smaller terms of community size or ya
see what happens and yeah you can have a
discussion about it will be great yeah
what's your opinion on a mobile app
development you know it screwed over
here to stay it's what I'm wondering
cool cool Oh elm ish that's an awesome
name elemis yes so yeah so funny thing
is check corcos the author of this blog
post called el mesh functional
programming in JavaScript I've actually
actually met him like a year ago in LA
when he came to a meteor la here para so
be sure we shared a love seat together
it's space key at Space Camp it was an
unreleased crater podcast oh yes it was
a little wild I just gotta say I know
chat very intimately well in hand so
like yeah chat just a very smart guy
Barry very forward thinking in terms of
like thinking outside the box and I
always tell in this that he is always
thinking about things that people aren't
thinking about yet and you can see that
with this with this blog post here l
mesh is
a temp to implement elm architecture in
JavaScript and people may not know what
Elm architecture is Elam is a
programming language you say purely
functional programming language and that
it actually compiles to JavaScript so
it's kind of in the same league as
closure script anything that compiles to
JavaScript which is a good proposition
right there's a lot of fundamentally
being things about JavaScript that
people don't like that's why they have
to rely on abstractions like coffee
script or type script to get what they
want out of the language and as long as
it compiles down to something the
browser can read then everything is fine
the great thing about element has his
principles of high purity and purity in
the UI and a lot of this is based on
three concepts one is the model model is
like how the the data the shape of the
state is there's the actions what these
are the events that change this state
and then there's the view how things are
rendered on the page so Chad actually
went through these these same core
principles in his example but he changed
it up a little bit he had his component
model is like it has an initialization
called in it and that's where you
returned the initial state you have
updates which take a state and some type
of action and return a new state which
is very similar to redux because Redux
is actually inspired by elm directly
yeah that was my question to you because
like you're the redox master that I know
I am the redox man in the media
community and yeah it's it's pretty much
like straight up redux is like pretty
much a very inspired version of elam
architecture yeah so back into it update
is like is similar to a you know Redux
action where are you take some type of
state you mutate this state but you
don't mutate it in place you actually
return a new state and in turn the view
is updated with a new state so that's
what pretty much elvish is trying to do
is it's actually very similar to the
Redux principles I've had
reducers that you know take stay in
action and return the new status it all
boils down to this functional code and
the cool thing about this blog post is
it is a very high level blog post about
functional programming a lot of people
that have been programming for 10 years
or whatever have might have a little bit
of you know a hard time understanding
this concept right away because all of
us are used to maybe in backbone where
you're you're mutating the Dom directly
you're removing and adding elements in
place and you know things are yet to
manage these mutations by removing
elements and introducing elements the
beautiful thing is if you think about
your front end or your your application
as a big function one function then you
can predict how this state of the
application is going to change because
it's just a function it's just
JavaScript it's just code there's no
domain-specific knowledge here that you
need to know that may cause bugs or
something like that a lot of the
problems that we have are we work with
the done directly and the DOM is slow
and there's a lot of there's a lot
there's a huge checklist of things that
you need to be aware of when you're
mutating stuff but if you can represent
your whole application as a function
that takes in stimulus from its
environment do some type of actions or
calculations and returning you state as
a function one it's easily be easily
tested you can easily write unit tests
on this whole state of the application
yeah to you can do some crazy things
like change the state by going back in
time like the current state I can go to
the previous state I can go to the
previous state or I can go over to the
future state like because it's just a
function think about it you're just
running another command that gives you
the next or previous state yeah so
that's that's what it boils down to and
I think you should you should read this
blog post just to get a sense of that
but she gets even he gets even deeper
and he gets into a library that over a
year Chet has been bragging about this
library OEM de it's kind of like
underscore but it's like for functional
composition so it's pretty much utility
methods to help
you write more functional programming
you know like curry functions and he
also uses thing called slid which I hope
I'm saying in that ripe right away yeah
lid but it's another it's another way to
do reactive programming and if uses
observable streams a chet had a blog
post in the past about doing observable
streams with mouse clicks or mouse mouse
movements and if you should go read that
block was this really great so I guess
at the end of the day at the end of the
day this is all great it's all
interesting there are there are projects
that are using this type of architecture
today Elm redux and then there are there
people that are doing other types of
functional architecture like in cycle
jas that are different than this but the
thing that people need to know like
that's a lot of positive stuff that I
outlined there are some like there's are
some downsides and I want to cover the
two downsides that check said and then I
recommend people reading it so one
downside to these are both redux this
Elm architecture Elm ish even chats Elm
ish is there's a lot of boilerplate
plate going on yeah we're used to in
meteor we're used to magic right the
original meteor movie or let me start a
YouTube video back in the day before the
rebrand was this like the sales pitch of
this is the easiest framework ever
because there's just so much stuff that
happens for free and it's magical and
the problem with magic is it's hard to
debug magic not everyone's a sorcerer
you know it's hard to debug magic and I
think people have realized that over
time and other frameworks as well magic
is hard to scale magic is hard to reason
about and the same so the op so with
Elma Shan Delmon redux you have to write
a lot more code and by writing more code
you have more control over this magic or
what's going to happen and that's might
be a downside to some people who are
used to having like you know like this
things happen and they don't really
necessarily have to worry about them so
if you're not into boilerplate you could
write helper functions or you could go
look
for some libraries that help this but if
you don't mind that you rather have
predictable code then you might as well
just forget about boilerplate as a
negative a second thing that's wrong not
wrong but a downside of chess approaches
he has to recompute the Dom every time
the actions changes so he's recomputing
the state he's pushing a new a new view
yes sir render a new view every time so
if there was like a way to just find out
like what if there's equality between
these views then we wouldn't have to
just push new sets of views of the Dom
every time because that that's pretty
costly right you have to do a rear ender
I know anytime an update happens and
that might be slow on some people's
shitty browsers or something like that
yeah so um yeah I'm not sure if he wants
to like in the conclusion did he say
anything about expanding elvish you know
like I talked to him about this and what
did you create yeah I talked to actually
this morning a lot of this stuff is
purely out of thirst for knowledge and
that's the great thing about shed is
like he does these things because he
wants to learn and get deep into these
concepts yeah firstly I don't think L
mish is going to be some library that
people are going to use until he has a
lot of work before that could happen you
have these trying to tell people that
the way that you're thinking there are
other ways to think about problems and
there's other ways to solve them and
yeah yeah so like in our in our old show
we talked a lot about people learning or
becoming developers yeah and I to take
away on this is not only is it like
excellent code to observe and watch and
see what Chet does but like guys see how
how excellent developer an excellent
program or chat see how he approaches
learning new things at the very
beginning he said he did this because he
wanted to understand functional
programming better and javascript is his
main language that he's fluent in so and
he he wasn't too fluent in Elm this is
how
like a true engineer goes out and learn
something is that they actually go out
and build it yeah you know they get in
the weeds they get as deep as possible
and then they actually then produce
something so and they have something to
show for their work yeah I think the
issue that most developers come by is
not like they think that if they're
working on some side project or
something that it has to be production
ready or it has to be for other people
to view they have to get github stars on
it they need to get contributors like
did sometimes you just need to build
stuff for the sake of yourself and it
has no notion of being public or has no
notion of being on you know you know in
the list of things that people should
read that week like the best thing you
can do is if you want people to learn
about your architecture or like things
that you're working on or to write great
blog articles about this just
introducing these concepts in a very
friendly way and by doing that wuntch it
has just made everyone realize that that
guy's smart guy and maybe one other
things he puts out that are more serious
in terms of production use people will
take it a lot more seriously because
they know that he goes deep on things
for sure and I think that that's good
advice anybody that wants to learn stuff
and you know really get deep into the
weeds there yeah and just for a little
bit of context I I want to say I have a
vague recollection of him first
implementing this and trying it for the
first time at Space Camp I remember was
like 2 a.m. and we're still we're
finishing up playing board games and
Chet comes down from from the second
floor and he's like look what I did guys
and he's showing us a time traveling and
time traveling debugger and everything
in this architecture and so what was
that that was like six months ago or
something like that so he got its like
the 8020 rule like he got eighty percent
of this done I think months ago and then
the last twenty percent it took him up
until now and then he wrote an article
about it so there that offers another
context like like you don't just spit
the stuff out right away like everyone
has a day job everyone has things to do
in their life so
fun fun this is a good one Chet yeah
thank you for for doing this man this is
big next up someone that we all know in
the media community Sasha grief who has
an open source project called telescope
and also like wrote a book on it
introduced a new way of building the
whole I don't know telescope
infrastructure yeah I in front end and
he's calling it Nova and it's a
radically different a radically
different change from what telescope is
built on like nowadays yeah yeah so it's
pretty interesting on the telescope blog
we're going to be talking about an
article that Sasha put out in a video
where it explains the old way where
everything was built into the meteor
packages where the packages included
everything from the schema of the
collection publication helpers in your
view layer and all your styling and he
says he now admits that that was a great
user experience but it was a horrible
developer experience exactly yeah it was
it's a true nightmare because how can
you get fine grained control if
everything is locked into these silos
and you can't get you want to keep a
majority of the silo but you want to
totally break out the view because you
want a custom view yeah you can't do
that it you got to have all or nothing
and that was that was the real tough
issue so there was there's a way around
it el deed inspired Sasha and I don't
know if telescope uses el deeds package
or not where you can override templates
wastin ya yep and so that's what they
ended up doing but that's just like that
just blow to your your your your code
got closed a new code what's overriding
what so he came out this new structure I
i we all know from the chat room that we
have it's a show like he's been
I in to tackle this new react world and
how how is it going to work with
telescope which is probably one of the
most advanced like open source apps that
people can just get okay yeah I comb for
it no what he came up with is pretty
interesting and I'm interested to hear
hobbies opinion on it but he basically
kept the old package system of keeping
the different features and silos but he
totally broke out the view layer there
is no view layer in these silos anymore
but instead you have these containers
which I enjoy this approach in the
container is what they do is it it
handles getting the reactive data yep
what you do then is then you have that
reactive data available to any of the
views the view components that you right
inside of that and that way then you can
scope CSS and all that so now he totally
did a 180 instead of a great user
experience now it's a great developer
experience and it's up to developer to
make great user experience yeah and I
think that's how it should be the answer
should be we actually so in work pop we
have this feature called community which
is pretty much a telescope site and we
pretty much had the same problem where
we want our own view layer we actually
wanted our own post logic our own
comment logic we wanted the base of
telescope but we didn't really want all
the telescope so what ended up happening
was you fork telescope and then you
tried to like make your own things
happen and then now you have your own
version of telescope well now we can't
take advantage of things like nova or
the next versions of telescope because
we have our own standalone version of
what telescope was now it's not even
telescope much anymore as like work pops
look for whatever really so like this
thing is great for people that want a
community without having to do much dev
work right they don't need to write it
back in 4 posts or comments and stuff
like that they may need to write you
know some views and how to get you know
the containers are all set up for them
so the view is what they need to write
it now I have some problems with this
approach
now I think it's good for the developers
that need to get it done quickly but the
same with thing with the old telescope
with a new telescope I I'm just not a
fan of magic I'm not a fan of things
that are like they're like 11 1 line
functions that do so much stuff for you
now that might be attractive to a lot of
people so this is just a personal
opinion of mine I'd rather write more
code and have control over my destiny
and write one line function that does so
much for me and that's just that's the
beauty of open source software right huh
you know yeah yeah it's totally and it's
totally fine but people enjoy that
approach some people don't like I think
this is great i actually would hope that
he breaks out the business logic itself
into smaller packages so if i only want
to use posts then i can do that I only
want to use comments you know that would
be like the cool next step also she is
another thing like as the transmission
is told us like Apollo is on on the way
you know Apollo is on the way and
there's a new version of telescope Nova
mean we have to rewrite again for Apollo
is this going to be flexible enough to
just swap out all the publications
probably a lot that was my big thing
yeah probably not and that's the cool
thing if you split out your business
logic even further and all these things
into even smaller parts where the
developer actually has to do has all the
little parts and needs to make a bigger
telescope or whatever that might be
cooler because then you can swap out the
Palo or yeah in all fairness to Sasha
like what he did is he made something
pretty good with a tool at available to
them at that time totally so it's just
like like Sasha got a little cut this
time by being on the bleeding edge you
know with Apollo now coming out and it's
okay well now there will need to I have
to release Nova and now anyone who knows
what's coming down the line was Apollo
now knows that there's going to be
another rewrite I've been in so yeah the
party's really get bugged a lot about
when's the Apollo version coming out
that's this the the beauty of open
source software is people that complain
about stuff right
yeah and you know I think maybe he had
bigger plans but I think right now this
was a big thing about breaking out the
views and breaking out the UI because he
even said that none of the publication's
changed you can take your old telescope
database plug it into this new telescope
app all everything is the same you can
go and you can switch back and forth if
you want to be testing on staging this
this new telescope and that's huge now
when Apollo comes out that's not going
to be the case so that's when the whole
back end is going to change there's not
going to be any pub sub in Apollo so so
it's a little bit different but yeah I
really like the idea that sasha is is
pushing this big project forward it you
and I were part of projects we know how
hard it is to do a major rewrite this is
a major yeah totally total hats off for
you it's at one man team yeah yeah and
it's an open source project yeah I know
so it's like dude we really appreciate
your blood sweat and tears yes I said
this is amazing work for her like
someone who is not traditionally a
programmer right he's a designer first
and now he's like now he's a great
programmer and now after running an open
source project we factoring it's
probably been better i would recommend
anyone who wants to get a community
going on their site or a new site just
used nova don't use blaze cuz i hate it
but use nova this has reacting it and i
think that's great that's the right
direction especially as a community
leader like Sasha's community leader
even wrote discover mediator like what
he says is very powerful to people and
the things he does is very powerful to
people so as long as you push and
positivity like this it's great yeah and
here's an example of another senior
developer and this is how he learns he
actually did this to learn react
university we rewrote the discover media
website and react then he built a whole
like cat form nova based off a react and
managing data with that so he can learn
it more and now housing
like push this out and make some money
and a living off of it is he's going to
update discover media yeah yeah and this
is another example of a developer he
wanted to learn something new and he
made actually something of value while
learning so that that's pretty cool
that's actually pretty neat to see the
two links between these two stories yeah
again cutting-edge stuff you're gonna
have to do another rewrite eventually
yeah I mean it's JavaScript we've we've
come to know and love the the rewrites
in the Yaak shapes that we have to do a
long way so it's okay oh yeah all right
so the last one we got man alright the
last topic is note chef vs galaxy and if
you get sort of a note Shep is it's
another like node hosting platform but
they parade that they can host meteor
perhaps very well now this link is a
little biased because it's from node
chef themselves and this is the type of
article where you go on whenever you're
buying software where you're buying
something they have the competitors they
have a big graph right if the
competitors and their features and they
have knowed chef and their features and
always makes Galaxy or the opposition
look like crap right yes this is a
typical block host just it's a very
typical like comparison blog post but I
looked at it and it's interesting
because the infrastructure is a little
different like no ship uses just
containers were like just you know
straight up like containers let a good
thing is docker containers mm-hmm and
galaxy is running on AWS and we have
these virtual machines that they just
like you know if you need a container
just spoof one up for you right yeah so
what if you're truly into dev ops this
is a problem for you to think about
right if you're truly into dev ops then
yeah maybe you care about the difference
you know but maybe most people maybe
most people aren't or maybe most people
application developers so they want
something that's easy or cheaper or
whatever so so that's cool i mean the
infrastructure behind
is very important um you can watch Matt
stock at the Amazon conference about how
galaxies works and that'll get you keen
insight into how galaxies is structured
and infrastructure I don't know if no
chip has posted anything about how
exactly things were you know we've might
have to pry some more and figure that
out big thing is is how do you manage
connected clients and rolling out new
code like can anyone compete with galaxy
with that feature where you're you're
each client that's connected is is
associated with a certain container so
wait slowly rolling out your your
updates it's not going to restart all
the containers is going to do one
container at a time yeah just going to
those clients reconnected yeah yeah
obviously load balancer that they have
will do these rolling updates very
nicely where you take users you wait
till another container is is done
booting up and then you go to the next
when you move people to different
containers as as a coming to your site
it's it's it's a really interesting
smart infrastructure but you know still
there are some issues with it right so
people want database hosting as well and
galaxy doesn't do anything about
databases you have to go to compose or
Mongo labs something like that no chip
on the other hand they do do database
containing a dedicated database
containers while galaxy does not so
that's cool like if you want that all in
one type of solution that's great you
know like but I personally have not had
trouble with compose a composed of great
company bought by IBM a pretty good good
company I heard was a good inner date I
heard Watson became the CEO of that oh
really it's ran by eight and AI oh it's
serious a couple things that stood out
or yeah couple things that stood out to
me on this one is the size of the
containers so yeah so this is comparing
the galaxy developer edition which is
slightly different than what Abby's used
to because he has all the bells and
whistles of galaxy cuz you see I get the
pro yeah yeah but there's is like four
times
and galaxies which means you got to get
four four containers to match one of
galaxies as far as with Ram yeah it's
you'll need with media for sure
definitely is it is it one fourth to
cost no so you are actually you know
that dedicated database container you're
paying for that yeah you know and and do
you need it like I know modulus provides
a free database as well and you when you
get going but right away you ditch it
for compose right when you're willing to
show caller so more data has scale you
know yeah exactly like you do not want
to keep it there you need you need more
tools that compose offers to you yeah
definitely okay I guess let me do a
little plug on galaxy like we use galaxy
at work pop we used it since it launched
and we have some issues go like in the
beginning when things were new like you
know CDN URLs weren't being preserved
properly when we deploy so some people
wouldn't get CSS we have these little
issues and sometimes their spot
maintenance that are unannounced in our
application containers restart like all
that stuff is fine but like what we were
doing before with modulus having to be
worried about our deployments like
literally having to like worry about is
are all the containers are all the
servers that we have do they have the
right code in it do this one does one
serve it not have the right phone
because if that is true then that could
screw up the whole application because
some people have old code that might be
affecting the database in a different
way so we were constantly worried about
you know ghost ghost servers not booting
up in you know ever since we've been on
galaxy we've had a lot of good
visibility into what's going on into our
are the health the health of our our
application you know we have an SLA with
meteor so we're always we're always in
the loop of what's happening we're
always bugging Zoltan about problems I
think it's it really has it has not
replaced the need for DevOps role for us
and I interesting I think that is
one of the things that they're trying to
say with the developer edition is like
you you won't need like it like galaxy
will be a DevOps person but I have not
seen that that need go away because we
have a lot of data we have millions of
data points we have a big team and a big
app we're looking for DevOps talent
right now because even with galaxy like
galaxy does not help you make this
process better galaxy does not help you
like deduce like what is wrong in the
application and what's affecting the CPU
like galaxy does not read kabira and let
you know what's that what's what's the
health of the meteor app itself but it's
really good in facilitating the annoying
things that a DevOps person would have
to do to launch their app right yeah so
that's like Alex you take away I mean
we're gonna still get a great DevOps
person i'm sure the galaxy will become
better when more DevOps people are using
it like that that's that's what I hope
but you know yeah in the last show that
I do with sashko he we were talking a
little bit about the future of galaxies
and and so he did mention that one of
the things that they are going to be
adding on is application logs logging
and and performance monitoring so we're
improving that because right now they
kind of like a lite version of it yeah
yeah so that that's huge and my question
was you know well what about Khedira are
you going to be competing with them if
you guys want to know the answer that
you should watch show number seven or
transmission but it is interesting like
like there are little things that
galaxies little features that is that
are actually huge a galaxy doesn't offer
yet but it's an MVP product that is
actually performing on a production
level right now so that's a huge thumbs
up to media team for executing on that
but we do wish it there like these extra
features that are that will roll out and
they have been rolling them out I have
been improving galaxy a little by little
um but when you go into this node shaft
like they kind of call
out the things that they don't support
these little things you know like an
application logging wildcard hostnames
ya know it it's interesting it's
interesting it needs to be talked about
oh yeah I think galaxies a great value
though I really do yeah I mean then just
like purely from a professional
standpoint the node ship operating like
even this post it's not as professional
as I would like it they spelled media
wrong you know like well you know the
only big difference is the database like
the only like glaring difference between
these offerings is the database support
and just because they have a bunch of na
is next to galaxy it's supposed to be
value it like yeah this is like
propaganda to be honest like things like
this do not really tell the true story
if you really want to know the true
story you should try both of them out I
think they're they have good pricing I
believe like you know 128 megabytes
container nine bucks like that's pretty
cheap us cheap enough for you to to just
test it out you know and I think when
the free the free galaxy version comes
out at this for dia I don't think it's
out yet or this video like the developer
edition is out right developer edition
is half and you can try that too and I'm
sure if you're running a meteor app
personally if you're running a meteor
app you might as well have the people
who built the platform post your app but
that's just me it really is a good
service i really like it i don't know if
it's publicly available yet i think to
ryan the edge of like look at that
switch yeah but you know like the team
on galaxy is cool like Rohit mark like
they're they're very knowledgeable
people they worked in Big Data Systems
before I think rotate worked at Hadoop
like or as a hooded oops consultant or
whatever that people have knowledge
there I don't not very familiar with the
node chef team so I guess I'm very
biased ha oh yes I'm very wise I'm
biased to like here's the thing
don't let the database is included
database fool you you are paying for it
with less ram on your container and
honestly spend the eighteen dollars
could compose boom get galaxy because
you get more ram it is a better value
that way you might not have all the
frills but you got everything that you
need to get your app out and deployed
you really don't need those feels too
much and if you do Luxy team will work
with you to get it out think about this
there are huge production apps like
Abby's I'm galaxy right now with the
features at galaxy buffers right now and
they are running a multi-million dollar
business on it so do you need all these
drills if these guys don't have it so i
would go galaxy plus the last thing is
if you like meteor this is the way that
you're supporting meteor this is the way
that you are making sure that meteor is
going to be here tomorrow and years to
come there you go that's that's my thing
go again don't go to see me that's it
huh right on right on alright this is
the end of the know Josh Cohen's show
the know josh is the node josh owens
additional or the event and avi addition
the ben and avi show okay hey what
progress is this again oh it's okay Yeah
Yeah right don't forgot guys if you like
to show please jump on to twitter and
like at Crater podcast and if you want
to see what we're talking about go to
crater daioh and see what we have on the
message board it's actually built with
telescope yeah that's pretty interesting
but up two stories and the top stories
of each day we're going to bring over
and do a weekly podcast about it yeah
and also if you want to get more insight
into the space dojo productions and the
meteor club and all that you can join
the meteor slack meter club / chat room
or the space dojos select chat room
where you can find me you can find Ben
and a bunch of other cool people to talk
about meteor to get
nope and I think it's a great
opportunity to get to know more people I
definitely met been through there I've
met a bunch of people in media community
that have helped me get my name out
there so if you're the future meteor
star that might be you who you should
come join us black shadow totally we
talked about Chet and his article he's
in there yeah we talked about Sasha with
no I Shasta's in there and if you want a
DevOps guy there are tons of DevOps
guidance in fact there's a channel
dedicated to dev ops and people just get
between your meteor dev app question for
free it's called hashtag DevOps go
figure get outta here yeah see it's even
a full of no-brainer channels yeah
alright guys well please comment and
subscribe let us know what you think of
this show and we'll make sure to make it
better the next time yes yes thank you
well what does Josh say at the end of
every show this has been a media club
production now that's how he says I
don't know this that's a perfect ending
right there this video has been in space
dojo production you can click the learn
more button to find out more about us at
