welcome meteor fans i'm your host Josh
Owens along with my co-host rye Walker
my long-missing co-host a better one all
right she's been like two episodes yeah
I know and I was like so frustrated
today as I like 315 I'm like Josh why
it's dumb videos well I'm here nice my
head all right uh you know I used to
always say like where you can find us
and stuff I stopped doing that just
realize that the other day it's coming
and he um see sponsors modulus big
sponsor all year long and speaking
modulus I just got an email from them
about Mongo and then oh yeah I'm gonna
have to read that uh anyway you'll hear
the the ad if you're listening on the
podcast if not be sure to check them out
modulus do we have a coupon code I need
to say it someone was asking me the
other day hey what's that coupon code
it's met podcast all one word get you a
$25 credit and it'll tell modulus that
you value their sponsorship this show
all right this week we're going to talk
about a release candidate for meteor and
talk about a MongoDB story environment
settings and security for meteor native
OS x apps with me here and reactive user
interfaces all right uh so I think the
big story today won't come out today it
was today or late last night 104 RC 0 is
out and available for testing and
there's a lot of good changes in here so
there's
template level subscription stuff there
is the changed session set syntax and
now you can set multiple keys and values
there's something around like pausing
like you can pause a local collection
now and like it'll stop doing updates
they've got it looks like they've got
compression support excuse me for DDP
now so WebSockets now supports
compression and DDP can take advantage
of that if you want some Cordova updates
yeah I don't know also I've got one in
there I changed dash dash tests so that
it'll only run once now and then exit
properly so i think when you're in CI
mode that was kind of the expectation
you just run dash dash test and it
should like air out or pass properly but
what was happening is you actually had
to pass dash dash once as well which
seemed a little odd because you know
when you're in a CI environment you just
kind of want it like it's gonna crash
just crash an exit and trying to rebuild
over and over again so then you get in
this situation where it would just wait
a minute timeout and then tell you your
your build failed then you look at it I
don't know it's kind of weird anyway
there's a there's some really great
release notes up like I'm curious what
they've changed in Cordova oh it looks
like there's some kind of attack vector
for Android in Cordova and so now you
have to specify you have to whitelist
all the allowed domains that your media
app or that your Cordoba app can access
with 104 so that that feels like kind of
a biggest change I don't know yeah yeah
I just looking at the pause pause flag
and local collection
and then read read that one yeah did you
have to be look at that thing no I
haven't um first that is that that's in
mini mondo yeah yeah try and figure out
what that does that could be interesting
but yeah I shouldn't read wawa podcast
sorry I can't I guess the other kind of
interesting thing is that they've moved
to a newer mongo driver 06 yeah it
supports like they've officially tested
out everything with 26 and there's how
there's a couple little changes related
to that but the driver itself will also
support three point oh so theoretically
you just with 104 you should just be
able to like connect to 30 and it should
just work right yeah 3 is pretty
important that's where the wired tiger
comes out right yeah yeah yeah yeah and
I would love to like I got to see an
email from air note of the other day and
I think it's like it would be a very
mind-blowing email for other people to
see this like a mind-blowing experience
for people to see this email so I'm kind
of hoping he'll he'll blog about his
setup on Khedira soon you know they're
they're using go and meteor together and
he's he's been using wired tiger and
three-point oh and you know I'm
curiously like using that with go or is
he using that with meteor or like would
you know where's well he's using 30 at
and were there any trouble was there any
trouble for him with that and that kind
of thing but yeah it looks exciting
based on some of the numbers he posted
well I imagine he's Aaron Otis oh there
will be a blog post yes there will be
blogging one of the Aaron others will
make the blog post yeah no I think this
is good I mean there are a lot of little
things doesn't think there's anything
really breaking in this release that's
good yeah just a little dot release so
how will try to update it as soon as it
ready yeah yeah and I think you know
this is a precursor to 11 there's a new
preview out for 11 as well I think like
preview 0.2 and if you're on a Windows
machine you should go try that tell them
all the bugs they still have good stuff
alright this module GV story who wrote
this what is it Harry it's me for once
yeah it's funny like I literally it's
funny we had another meeting with this
this company time i'll tell you the
quick story was that we were trying to
get a deal with a fortune 1000 company
and and I kind of just blew off their
questions about Mongo you know thinking
we're going to just use compose so it
doesn't really matter the licensing
stuffs all moot but in the end they came
back today we're just not comfortable
with using Mongo at all and you know I
dug a little bit deeper kind of
post-mortem and just interesting like it
i'm actually swinging a little bit away
from this blog post a little bit after a
couple of the comments on creator i
don't know if you've been following even
the recent discussion on this Josh I've
read a little bit of it a couple of late
comments from like Google people who
know Google my google would not allow a
GPL software in their world because you
know if you have thousands of developers
all having this you know the risk of
accidentally packaging in or linking to
or compiling in some a GPL code you know
it's a lot of that bats to kind of make
a big mistake so I can kind of see why
maybe really big companies we just want
to avoid that you know completely know
maybe some brand new developer doesn't
know the heck he's doing and just makes
a mistake but then that's in their code
and I think it's a big problem so you
know really how to take that basically I
guess it's why it's such an issue why
it's such a gray area you know because
it really depends on it's just a risk
thing so but yeah the main idea here was
that uh you know people there's a spot
around long go because it uses the a GPL
license
and so you know even though MongoDB will
say hey if you use this the way you are
saying you're going to use it we promise
to never have an issue with you you know
so calm but really this genesis of this
post was just thinking about it after
just talking some people about Mongo and
meteor at all and I realize like we're
not really the meteor community has been
kind of neutral or really quiet about
Mongo you know yet where everyone's
using it without a problem or else we
would have left meteor long ago I kind
of feel like it's our responsibility as
a community to stand up and fight it
fight for a little bit even though it's
not necessarily the long term in the
short term like we don't know when
there's be a other sequel support for
meteor yeah I think it's not as short
term as we would have hoped like in you
know I was out last week and talking
about de Burgh Alice and you know he
didn't give any specific dates or
anything but the way he was kind of
talking about things it sounds like they
haven't really done much thinking or or
even really started on any other kind of
sequel support at this point so that
that made me sad you know I felt like
we'd see something in the first half of
2015 and I have a feeling like it's
probably going to be in the second half
of 2015 yeah and I think about like okay
let's say meteor have toast bread
support to like that's going to keep
let's go make me do more complex you
know it's going to break the simplicity
of what they've got you understand why
we need it but it's just it's kind of
frustrating that so I don't I kind of on
one hand them like can we just defend
Mongo and you know it's working for us
all and it's getting better and longer
30 is coming out so well yeah and then
the other the flip side of that argument
is like can we just rely on the
community to fix this problem and I feel
like yes maybe we could write because
you see up in I think it's been green
num tell working on the my sequel
package and you know I think people are
just hesitant to even jump in and use
that because it's not like an official
blessed solution right yeah and people
don't want to trust their data to
something that's not official
bad plus then whoever writes it has to
maintain it you know it's like the chris
mader effect yeah you're right important
piece of infrastructure you're on the
hook to maintain forever I don't know
how that works okay he who smelt it
dealt it rule he co-wrote it maintains
it forever yeah really yeah give him a
big pat on the back for all the stuff
he's done I router yeah yeah but yeah so
I think you know again the main point is
I'm gonna probably to make it a point to
just kind of fire some positive
positivity around Mongo now again it's
in my posts and my community because
like I said we're stuck with it right
now we're stuck with it and it's not you
haven't heard anybody like grant say I
quit meteors Mongo sucks I haven't seen
a single post like that yeah again um no
but I get you know what it is I get a
bunch of emails in my inbox and this is
what I was conveying to Matt it's like I
think meteor has a bad rap right like
everyone likes to make fun of it like oh
if you actually made murder traps they
don't look at me you got me to your mom
Mongo sorry Mongo gets a bad rap in the
community and you know I I get emails
about meteor and a lot of them will
point to Mongo like but it doesn't scale
or it has this problem so I'm not even a
look at meteor I just think we're
excluding part of the community so I
don't I don't think anyone's coming in
and leaving because of mongo I think
they're just never coming because of
mongo that's yeah but doesn't it say
something that supposedly mongos this
horrible thing right yeah no I don't
know a single developer that's coming to
the meteor community and left it because
of manga you know so therefore Mongo is
not can't be as bad as as reputed to be
and might just be really good they just
haven't done a better job defending
themselves online that's my opinion I
mean I've bread you know I know if you
search MongoDB you get like a lot of
negativity mmhmm yeah that's what stuffs
kind of older now and and maybe
unfounded yeah I mean yeah I mean we've
got 30 out right and you don't like
that's bleeding edge but 26 has been out
for a while and I think they probably
solved a lot of these issues in 26 yeah
and it's been out for
a long time so yeah I don't know maybe
maybe undeserved at this point but as
with any technology like it's only going
to take you so far like I'm not gonna go
start with big tables or whatever the
hell google uses because like I don't
have the time to invest in putting
together start up around some huge thing
that I might not even need cuz let's
let's all be honest like your problem
with building your apps not going to be
scaling it's gonna be getting people to
use your jab thanks right now can learn
more and again I don't have any I
haven't heard a single startup lately I
mean they have said we're using my own
go and it's just it's not working for us
I mean no a bit pot they're probably out
there I'm not denying that that scale
like but a lot of times you know what
I'm finding is a lot of these switches
from like meteor or Mongo are coming
from like a new CTO who just doesn't you
know it doesn't know that stuff and they
want to move into an area that they're
comfortable and so they throw up meteor
in favor of angular you know they don't
know it on a meteor so yeah yeah so I
think the same thing here that's where
after that I agree with you though it's
blocking a lot of people from coming
into meteor but if we actually can start
putting out some positive vibes around
Mongo that can help them feel okay
coming in so yeah so I know I know it's
all I know it's an uphill struggle but
again it's our database for the time
being so let's uh let's you're all on it
a little bit big hug up mithi especially
maybe maybe with three we have a big
opportunity for that you know since the
it's gonna be lost a stern stuff like
that it's all fun and games till it
crashes and burns and loses someone
whole database and a man i I've deleted
data from postgres too yeah sure we can
happen to anybody all right uh
environment settings is security so I
wrote this one and it was this one kind
of hit me out of the blue so we were
talking in the the media club chat room
the the patron one and someone was
saying like oh hey is there an easy way
like I'm doing this if else around a key
and settings like is there a better way
to
do this I'm like wait a minute like
you're checking whether you're in
production to call different keys from
your settings oh it seems really not
awesome so kind of dug a little deeper
and realize like you know the point if
you read the article the point I'm
trying to convey is that the settings
should change from environment to
environment and you just call the same
key and you're just making sure that key
is correct for each environment that
you're in so for instance if we're
looking at AWS s3 or we're looking at
stripe you know it obviously like stripe
you're in test mode on your development
box you're in text mode on staging so
that you can insert like testing credit
cards and make sure that all the
callbacks are working and everything but
then when you go live you've got these
production keys and you actually want to
charge people's cards so that's that's
kind of the difference there and you
know you should just have like a
publishable strike publishable key
setting and in your development
environment you set it with your
settings file and then in your
production environment make sure that
you set it with your you know
environment variables and I I don't
think a lot of people realize that like
that's kind of a best practice for
deployment and I also kind of talk about
why you don't want to put those keys
just directly in the code and that's
because you know you don't you don't
know who's gonna have access to that
code you don't know when that code might
accidentally leaked out you know there's
been a lot of security stuff going on
lately I don't know if you followed any
of the superfish stuff right I don't
think so so if you had a lenovo laptop
they had this ad where that was
automatically getting installed and it
was sanctioned by Lenovo and turn my
opinion in genetics benchmarks and the
chat room um yeah so anyway um long
story short it turns out like it was a
major security role because they were
basically you could do a
man-in-the-middle attack on any web page
and like gang
anything that anyone was looking at and
so if you're looking at github and your
private key on it like boom your
security is compromised right there like
anyone that knew about superfish could
have been there and like get that data
out of there if they really wanted to
and that's just one potential security
leak right and with your code base like
I'm sure I mean what do you guys have
hooked into user cycle right now do you
know that has access to your code like
third party services oh gosh through
pretty services that have access to our
code yeah like ci or hound nope nope in
touch looking good yeah we don't really
have anything that I code code climate
would be another one yeah and I love
code climate but no we're not using that
yeah um well yeah I mean like that's
another like I mentioned in there a
circle trust right and yeah I don't I
like maybe I think github secure maybe
they're not right with hundred some
employees I would think the attack
vectors are pretty easy um but then in
you know at the end of the article i I
just I link to you know people putting s
creaky knees in public code just a
little problem I've done that before
yeah I have as well an Amazon like it
was with the the differential credit
card on the differential amazon account
kicked it in two that's really yeah i
cast and then they like disabled our
account for like hey we found you the
keys you should fix that yeah i think
that happened to call on 24 yes yeah he
got a big bill for it though yeah um
yeah so i think this is like it really
easy concept if you're coming from rails
in Heroku because that's just the way we
were brought up that rep who has these
configured variables and you can have
different variables when you're on you
know when you're developing locally and
just it just was very obvious that that
was a feature that exists where I think
if yours like just coming into media or
maybe you're coming from some other
technology PHP or something like that
and you're just not used to these
configs you just miss you might misuse
it so I think your post was really good
to help help people if they're they are
misusing the settings and certainly
checking that stuff in yeah so that you
know kind of there's a big question like
do you do you commit that settings the
one using development into the repo no
you know sometimes you actually have
production like like maybe a pushing to
a dev version for Mixpanel or something
like that right and I think it's fine
like if you guys want to like share a
dev settings file like that totally
makes sense but your production one
should not be yeah that's your security
those are your keys you know you need to
make sure that they're only being set
one spot and then you know someone even
asked me to follow up like what do you
do you got to share your production keys
with someone and I said well chances are
they've got access to a system that's
going to have those keys right like give
them if you're using modulus like give
them access to the modules and they're
going to be able to see those in that
environment said so yep there's
definitely that yeah that's good nice
post.thanks jump to the next topic which
is some dude made a native OS X app with
meteor that's pretty sweet the the
github user name is meteor hybrid do you
know who this person is of Andrew
reading looks like it's hot don't
actually oh nice so I hadn't looked at
this yet that's why I gave you the story
how nice yeah I looked at it I thought I
had that sounds fun only I had I didn't
know that I've used meteor to make
native apps now to you know my world is
getting really big all of a sudden yeah
into a meteor yeah so looks like they're
using something called back gap to ya
can't argue that now it sounds like its
new i mean it says it's considered beta
and it's not very actively developed bad
docs he says but sounds like I guess
there was a Cordova OS X platform which
is also not moving along very well so
yeah again I don't know how practical
this is however slack it says you know
slack is actually using madcap 24 it's
mec up and I use that app all day long
yeah I think you're helping Mac Mac
version yeah so I mean
obviously could can be used and it's so
it's kind of a nice idea i mean i don't
know i didn't really get into how much
instrumentation required here but
doesn't look like too much looks like
there's just you know config file a mad
dash config file and then you have to
use gulp to build it and you know xcode
it fires up xcode then you run the
application so yeah I think it's a sure
there's a nice little hack hear that
someone could get there an app like I
mean I wouldn't mind having user cycle
have a native app you know that's cool
you know but the interesting thing here
is you've got other things like what is
it flint at the name of it no that's the
UH was the other one uh this is called
oh you mean like it'll just like have an
icon for your for your nap no it's
actually like a separate browser um yeah
like a app-specific browser yeah and you
can you can just point it at any old URL
and give it like a custom icon and all
that kind of stuff and then there's I'm
pretty sure there's a gosh I can't like
I'm even looking at it right now and he
doesn't have the name in here anywhere
um but yeah you can show like Doc badge
labels and you can set fluid app that's
the name of it oh yes or than that and
you can you can totally I'm pretty sure
there's like custom headers you can set
on the page or something and it'll like
you can put unread kind of labels on the
dock badge if you want like it looks
like actually so i use it with Trello
I've got like a fluid specific Trello
that I keep open yeah and it's got the
dock badge that shows like I've got five
things that need done right now or five
notifications anyway yeah and so the
other thing I was just think about this
mac app is i don't know if i want to
ever be back in the world where if i
change the code i have to like get
people to read down
loaded so unless this thing had a way to
automatically keep itself up to date
with my latest code doesn't sound too
exciting so basically you just need
Slava to come in and like out all the
stuff to make it like cordova and get it
to work just like that yeah yeah yeah so
yeah you want to basically have an auto
up table in the server change but sure
that's not in the cards with this
because it sounds like it fires up like
far as AB Xcode we probably does some
more more like compiling and stuff like
that hmm choice this oh yeah so again
kind of neat and fun but we'll see if
it's practical yeah who's not too
practical you just have fun wilkes-barre
nuts could be I mean you no slack is
ruling the world now right so yeah it is
i spend i spent four hours a week
chatting in slack so there's definitely
winning um yeah so next is reactive user
interfaces a blog post by who is this
this cannot tom tom coleman yeah jeez
where's this guy been he's been hiding
under a rock uh yeah so I you know I did
click on this because i saw was
percolate I thought okay we'll check
this out and then it turns out like it's
actually about react uh the the
framework and about how he feels like
it's creating a much more a much more
easy to reason about way that your coat
your codes updating right like he talks
a little bit about how he's got
something interested interesting
animated kind of graphics here and it
shows like if this this changes then
like it goes and updates those other two
nodes whereas with react they use a
virtual Dom and you know kind of like it
flows differently to update those those
templates I guess so
you don't it's not as hard to understand
how why things are updating I guess was
his home well probably the most
interesting thing to me is that there's
an official react sanctioned a year repo
and they've been working on this for a
while looks like back in August they
started on this who's they they like I
saw one commits from Tom but let's see
oh the official read new year package
yeah still a work in progress and so
I've been jam react and Newman okay oh
okay it's just person been Newman's
working on this he works at meteor and
John Gould what it looks like it's been
mostly been Newman so that's an
interesting little tidbit coming out
there yeah yeah i mean i remember when
the react guy came remember ed to talk
during one with deb shops seemed to me
like there was definitely a lot of
interest for the two parties to work
together I just sensed that from that
talk that they were trying to figure out
a way to work work things out yeah yeah
you know we were talking about reacting
are our differential slide there's
saying like the thing that kind of sucks
about is like the HTML you have like
HTML in the JavaScript you've seen that
like the template like little snippets
of HTML throughout the JavaScript code
oh really yeah I mean yeah like Doug and
oh how we act forks that way I haven't
no mean it's just like I don't know it
just feels like maybe that's the way
things are going you know but it sure
feels nice to have these little by HTML
files for HTML stuff no I agree with you
like I don't you know we don't we try
very hard not to put styles in our HTML
right or like on click handlers directly
in your age you know
interesting is bad nowadays yeah yeah I
was like a lightning talk it never
shopped you as a guy like doing the
putting all the CSS inside over from the
JavaScript to know yeah we were talking
to him about that afterwards like I was
out there last week and we went out for
beers and we were asking like how does
that work and he's like I just like
compute everything and then just like
shove it onto the element as i can on
element style and it was like that seems
really weird but he was talking about
maybe instead like generating the CSS
file and then reactively like applying
those classes can you like keep changing
the file though like I don't know know
if you can keep changing a file as
things are kinda changin yeah I don't
know I really yeah it just seems like
again cool demos like I don't mind
having food demos but the practicality
of it all and now the thing about
reactive course those were react is like
super fast right like it's I think this
right now it's like de facto to me if I
was gonna say like what's the hottest
front end student suppose we did fast
this thing it's react right so that
makes it interesting it just kind of
sucks that if you have to put HTML
snippets in the javascript is the way it
done but you know I mean maybe it's the
way to go I we don't like sluggish front
ends so you know especially when you get
on mobile and whatnot or if we do like
Cordova well actually you know react has
the react native stuff too yeah so I
don't know where that lies either
completely different than normal
reacting so things are changing meteor
was to play with that stuff but I don't
you know George you're going to talk
about this next week too yeah yeah yeah
I'm excited about that and I think where
we're going to record that so it'll be
on my my youtube channel for Time In
Memoriam so people can can remote in and
kind of watch that so yeah if the atopic
for next week's discussion right indeed
for sure maybe yeah how the week after
we'll see ya oh we get it up
yeah so uh real quick like have you if
number one if anyone has a question like
they should ask it now on the live
streaming page but I'm gonna ask for I
like have you done anything interesting
this year man interesting sure have a
dining frustrating yes it was wrestling
with CSV flip past few days what a
horrible format you know I wash can I
rent on CS be real quick do you need to
like doesn't matter though I sure hope
no one in this world thing like CSV it
says I don't know no no CSVs better than
JSON shut shut up that's not true no I
mean I basically issues with API is like
interpreting a string that has an
integer inside of the string as let's
just convert that to a to an integer you
know like it was just mysterious
conversions in various API is that you
know if you don't specify there's like
no way to say what did you intend to be
did you want that to be an integer did
you want to be a spring if you wrap it
with it with it with quotes I think I'm
saying to you this is a string but yeah
anyway so I had that last few days
really sucks nice yeah but I am actually
it's this whole users legal things
bringing me into this world of letting
learning about like redshift you know
like postgres in the cloud that kind of
stuff all the data science stuff you
know I get to learn all these foods so
if anyone's uh you know in
visualizations you know we're getting
deep in a d3 else we doing this fun
stuff yeah look like tuning like this
week Greg and I spent a lot of time
tuning this job work this back-end thing
user cycles is crunching data all day
long it's using third-party api's and
like if you use it too much you get
these errors back saying nuts too hard
yeah right lemonade yeah yeah again if
you go too soft on it you're like kind
of like it's extra slow for the user for
no reason so how do you tune a system to
get right at the edge of the
rate-limiting but not going over it so
we have have two refactored a bunch of
times on that yeah I remember so back
when I
follower you know Twitter had the API
rate limit and we did some interesting
things there because it turns out a lot
of the data I needed was just public and
the rate limit was / user / token for an
application and so like if you signed up
and i signed up a greg signed up like i
could use all three of those tokens to
fetch public data if I wanted to and so
like I had this whole system where I
could watch for an air and then just
drop that token on the ground and pick
up a new token and then just continue on
with fetching more data and I had this
you know it's kind of like this this API
harness where I could suck in a bunch of
data from Twitter on demand but yeah
that's like that's not easy and it only
worked because you know i was using
public data and so we have like in keene
we have rate limits that are we thought
the rhythm was per project but then we
have like multiple views per project so
we have to like make sure if we have two
views this goes half the speed because
it needs you know and then but then we
actually discovered this week that I
don't know the rate limits are actually
the orbiter like the account level and
but they didn't even tell us like then
the project / true when I asked yes
people upload their project credentials
I don't know if they're all in one word
or you know so they we've actually had
them change their API to help so take it
up being nice too so that's pretty um
pretty fun stuff but you know what
real-time time consuming but you yeah I
think you do anything new this week uh
yeah just doing a lot of meteor club
stuff so I I've been working a little
bit on a meteor club pro account so I
want to replace patreon and move it to
meteor jas club which required me to
figure out ssl right because i'm hosting
right now i'm hosting on digital ocean
for that site with right now that one's
just uh just regular old mop and then
I've also got crater there and I was
trying to get ssl on crater because you
know like let's just let's be secure
right and yeah yeah so then I like
craters fronted by engine X and right
now it does is just load balancing
to one box right so it's not really like
engine X wasn't doing much so I spent
time this week working on like SSL and
then also having engine X serve up your
static assets like your images and your
CSS and Jas and so like this afternoon
we were having a big debate like how
much faster is engine X than though does
this make a difference is it worth
spending a few minutes on so kind of
where my head's been at the last couple
days yeah it's interesting like you
mentioned serving up static assets I was
talking to a big startup and they were
telling me about their you know like
their cloud front bill and all this like
all the different asset posting stuff
like that you'd be sitting it's just
kind of shocking how much that costs at
scale I really realized that but that's
a big deal yeah yeah for sure yeah yeah
anyway all right so i'll mention patreon
if you go to patreon.com/scishow gia
club you can support the podcast sport
media club on the bloggie i'm doing
great I kind of stuff um get a bunch of
people uh Nate John tree Arthur Sean
Michael see Robert quite a few we're
almost everywhere I gotta start a new
podcast no cheese promises huh yeah but
I am going to switch it over so if you
want to get in the chat room you'll be
able to just go to meteor jazz club /
you know pro and you'll be able to get
an account there and you know we got we
got like thirty five people in the chat
room now like its knees so what's uh do
so real quick question like if someone's
trying to learn media right now are
there any govt getting active classes or
anything like that they can sign up for
ya softball but nothing on seriously
yeah no seriously um yeah so i've got
i've actually got a video that i need to
put together and like i'm gonna start
selling that specifically so we do like
self-paced so your answer is no but my
my next law class is in march why guess
it's march oh starts
or no not that soon but it is it's March
twentieth and twenty-first so it's a
friday and saturday 11am 2303 p.m.
eastern so you have space in that still
I do I think I've got two seats so it's
like it's so close to filling up yeah I
think I think this one's gonna fill up
so yeah that's good but uh just go to I
guess meteor jazz club / learn and
there's a little sign up link on there
just put in your email and you'll get
all the info yeah I've referred some
people to that to your to the josh owens
school of meteor nice yeah I'm excited
about it eight days a meteor like that
was really the impetus for getting ssl
done well so i could start selling eight
days of new year okay cutie commerce yes
yeah so almost done almost all right
good luck with that yeah that's like SSL
is the thing you do like once every six
months and some youth like you relearn
it every time yeah I figured like while
i was doing am as well put it on crater
and then it turns out like a bunch of
the crater stuff isn't set up right to
handle ssl so well gotta go fix
telescope alright man have a good
weekend ya next week yep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
