that took my cousin don't seem at
Christmas ya once removed actually what
i did find out and maybe you saw this on
my facebook or whatnot is that I'm
related to Ada Lovelace or Lovelace nice
the girl who who did the first computer
program who's that oh no come on wasn't
anybody's hopper ada ada ada lovelace oh
gosh yeah now I got him know anyway so
that's a cool little fact about münster
yo people hey I want some followers on
twitter oh yeah okay yes you know like
how people have like stupid goals on
twitter like hey I care about how many
people follow me and stuff right that's
like totally stupid doesn't mean
anything you care until it's annoying
and you don't care anymore well I have
the secret goal where I want to have
more followers than the people i'm
following so I want my followers list do
you there with Dean beef do you uh do
you follow me on Twitter cuz that might
be an unattainable goal me yeah I follow
you on twitter of course it you can't
have more followers than me I'm not
gonna have I'm not even close to that
okay like i'm talking like I'm like
three hundred and forty people now and I
just want to get the 380 or something
like that yo G you both should be 1k oh
my god I thought about like
were way off topic but try to go run it
I was thinking about running like a
Twitter ad for a post the other day and
I look at it and they're like we can get
you 66 clicks for a hundred dollars and
I'm like what you guys are insane holy
 I don't even think google charges
oh my gosh that's like that's almost an
advertisement to go to Facebook and do
there is this so much no job yeah you're
done anyway people are following under
underscore benster that could be part of
your problem you gotta start with
underscore dude i know i know there's
like this stupid person in China that
did a benster and logged in twice so
it's underscore be en st or write as TR
that's right yes you're all like web 20
with no ease or anything well it's the
first three of my of my first name and
the first three of my last name there
you go now people know now it knows so
follow so i get i guess i should say
like you know you work at okay grow I do
meteor jazz club and you can follow me
on twitter at josh owens or you can
follow at meteor podcast on twitter as
well to find out all the latest and
greatest stuff all right yes so this
week we're talking about meteor 1.2
galaxy meteor and ssl don't get hacked
react again I mean just gotsta gotsta
and ultra-responsive you eyes with
meteor which I think this this post was
like a precursor to a deaf shop Talk so
we talked a little bit about that too um
salt on soft I loved his accent
yellville script some basic last night
yes yes yes so much better than most
accents in my opinion like if you're
gonna have one that's the one I'd want
you know yeah totally all right like you
could be the nicest guy but it kind of
sounds
arrogant with that X I look at Han soft
like it's almost like how dare you ask
me that you know where I work okay all
right all right so meteor 1.2 your much
harder to corral than any other post
I've ever had okay do we're best friends
man yeah meteor 1.2 release candidate is
out so they've kind of been playing with
it if you look like I I'm a little
shocked it took them this long to like
say something about it because you can
see there are all the way at our c7 RV
and I saw it in the tags there and kind
of knew it was coming but it was pretty
awesome to see and what's the they have
this link to equip which is interesting
it kind of they call it an upgrade guide
but it's really it just looks like the
changelog to me so it doesn't really
tell me like what I need to do to
upgrade my app it just tells me like the
changes that are coming i guess so some
of the import stuff is changing and like
the build tool api's that kind of stuff
which i mean if you don't write excuse
me write a lot of packages maybe it
doesn't matter to you maybe it does I
don't know mm-hmm but there is a lot of
great stuff in here you know I think
we've all heard the highlights of react
and angular and acma script 2015 as we
call it now kit called es6 anymore you
know um or Lucy or Lucy Paramount
Pictures called us yeah a threat used to
us we get yeah we gonna got a takedown
notice um yeah no not like there's
there's interesting stuff in here you
know I love it because every time I hear
like a you see an AMA on crater or they
started doing this ask us anything right
before the dev shops on crowdcast like
the number one question on
noticing is anyone that uses media
they're like oh what about blaze like
when are we gonna see some updates to
blaze boom it's in here it's landing we
get let and we get each and we get
spacebar sub expressions like this is
actually some pretty awesome stuff so
I'm excited to see that land if only we
could see template parent template land
that would be awesome but no one's
touched that so no love for me uh was
there anything else going to react is
that what you said huh yeah moving to
react that's what you said no that's not
what I said well I mean I might have to
parent template data link come on but I
am convinced with like the subtask me
anything kind of stuff that that sashko
and alice is doing after the last one
I'm convinced that like any any talk
that I hear about people saying oh I
wonder if plays is gonna stick around or
not like like I think it's locked in
place places Stan yeah I don't think
they're gonna get rid of it I mean
honestly like uh you know and and I I
guess we can talk about this too when we
get to the fourth story there about
react the other side of the coin there's
some good points in there as well Oh was
there anything else that stood out to
you in the 1.2 kind of dogs that looked
interesting yes Cordova is getting
upgraded and if you haven't heard like
all the packaging for Cordova's moving
to thank you npm or has moved yeah yep
yeah yeah and i am dead is probably the
biggest things I've been doing a lot of
Cordova work and it's so annoying
working with the old package system like
you want to move to NPM so I ready for
that that's going to make my life easier
I'm interested to see a the meteor build
integration and what comes out of that
yeah and there's supposed to be some
speed improvements there too you mean so
which lower knows we could use it slow
seriously it is I I watched today like I
was talking to Sir Charles walks in and
media club slack
and we decided to do like I just quick
like looking over uh what you would call
it Khedira and like he fired up the app
locally and like we literally just kind
of like SAT there twiddling our thumbs
but that's gotta be the slow step I've
ever seen oh yeah crazy alright um still
better than rails just saying ok move
galaxy game excuse me hello Stella's
been there's not much we can tell do you
know that that I have been that people
aren't talking to me in the community
about galaxy because they know that I do
a lot of podcasts day and you know you
read let everyone to sign an NDA you've
been blackballed well they just don't
want me they just know I'm a talker yeah
you're a leaker you leaked all that
information right everyone I love the
community so much so yeah but the post
we link to is talking about the early
access yeah we can talk about that yeah
yeah that's yeah so so so there's early
access I wasn't I wasn't asking you give
away trade secrets been what boring just
want you to talk about the article yo
galaxy if you have a production app that
is challenging and big call up mdg right
now and say hey I want free hosting for
a couple months get me on galaxy and
they will be like okay yes absolutely
yeah and they're a pretty much yeah you
go we should we have you have to have a
production out you can't be like hey yo
I got this really neat toy I should I
should email him again when the
developers disc subscriptions came out I
emailed him I'm like so how much is this
maybe I'll do it for crater and they're
like yeah real like I got that email oh
I was like now just curious how much it
was yeah I should email me like how
about galaxy and crater that makes sense
seriously I don't know I still feel like
that's gonna be like
not a cheap thing right um Dean and I
were talking a little bit about this
today and my take on it is I'm kind of
seeing meteor follow the business way of
WordPress where where their first like
for-profit product was an enhanced
hosting environment for high-level ah
heavy-hitting blogs wordpress blogs
right but I think it looks super
expensive you know I don't know like I
feel like I to mean like how can galaxy
compete with someone like modulus whose
sole focus is just hosting right and
they're not focused on anything else
they don't they're not doing a developer
just subscription they're not Oh running
in a no I'm a pretty big app I know
pretty big meteor app that's moving from
modulus to galaxy right now mmm
interesting yes and I also know why
they're moving away from modulus mm-hmm
and and so they're so if galaxy can
fulfill these few things that modulus
has I mean I oh yeah but i think you
know to me like maybe so I'm talking
about the low end of the market right
like I think there's a point at which
like behind the more like doesn't really
give a crap like just fix our crap make
it fast make it run you know he's a PCP
zippy yeah there's a pile of cash like
absolutely get that but i think you know
i read the forums and everyone's like oh
it's a second coming and no i don't i
don't think it's gonna be that like I
think it's gonna be like it's it's gonna
be up there on costs because you're
gonna have like a support structure
around it and that stuff's gonna cost
money to pay those people salaries in my
opinion well what if okay so what if
it's the same quality as modulus let's
just like put that out there same
quality is modulus but on the lower tier
it's free it whereas modulus is like
seven dollars and fifty cents a month
yeah but I I think well that's not true
at all modulus is like 15 bucks no they
have another day of a lower tier now
they
do yeah they were lower ram mm-hmm lower
than I mean you can't whatever like I
feel like even on 15 bucks she can't
really run a meteor app so like 368 bags
like yeah yeah kid I've done it no yeah
can't be done well not not when you have
users instead she said oh no there's no
he said she said hey dude I got crater
stats right here boom I have to say that
uh you know I focused on like enterprise
stuff and like not as much public work
is what you do so I do have less
concurrent users but yeah those those
smaller boxes work just fine for under a
hundred okay yeah so i would i would say
yeah like i would probably agree with
that for me like crater sitting on a one
gig digitalocean box and it's i think
i'm running anywhere between 350 and for
50 megabytes you know for the meteor
process just depending on how many
people are connected and we're slowly
eking up there towards having 200
concurrence at any given time so yeah
yeah well alright i don't know i think i
think they're going to get a lot of
business from the low end just from the
Association you're in meteor you got
meteor galaxy why not go with that why i
introduce a little pain point if it's a
few more dollars in modulus i would
probably go with the galaxy if it has
everything I need like it does it won't
have imagemagick out of the box i know
version one's gonna be pretty stripped
down so I wouldn't yeah well I mean but
for crater like I don't for me i don't
think i have any crazy hosting
requirements and I think we totaled it
up the other day I'm paying I want to
say is it 10 bucks a month I think it's
10 bucks a month for the slice and then
I'm paying eighteen dollars a month so
we're at 28 there and then I'm paying
like another 20 for the mailchimp but
they won't replace MailChimp I'll still
need that so
I mean I you know is it gonna be cheaper
than 28 bucks on 26 bucks I don't know
22 you know anything about the pricing i
know the free tier is gonna stay I don't
know what that tier will cry yeah I
doubt it would be able to host creator
and I the other concern I would have is
like what kind of assurances do I have
with up time and that kind of stuff like
that best stuff matters to my my whole
thing is saying that is like if they're
keeping a free tier then and we know
that they also are focusing on serving
large-scale production and our prize
apps mm-hmm uh and they're going to be
providing the free tier for the for the
low end I would assume then they have a
product for the whole spectrum yeah and
I'm getting me well and they start
asking for money that where is that
that's it yeah I guess and my other
thought is like I'm hesitant to to move
right away even if they say like oh yeah
sure come on the free because like i do
want to know the pressing like I don't
want to get everything set up and feel
comfortable and be like this is awesome
and then the like dude like that's gonna
be two hundred dollars a month and I'm
like ah that's crazy don't do that well
and like you do community stuff so like
you could like head that little like
sponsored by I galaxy at the bottom
corner of crater and if you get it for
free so who cares right right you
listening mdg oh next topic meteor
and ssl so i think there's like actually
there was one thing i wanted to say i
feel like a meteor start to put on its
suit in time it's quite interesting to
watch because they they also launched
their they announced their their
developer not developer there a partner
program which looks really interesting
as well so i don't know what do you
think about that um i think that they
expanded their team a lot their business
side another to you and so I am almost
positive that there is their culture is
still being informed their corporate
culture mmhmm yeah because like they're
moving from startup culture which is
mostly developers to now a full-blown
business with different departments and
everything and so like what does the
culture look like in that type of
business and I think that's yet to be
decided yeah and the tones it in the
tones that we're getting from meteor and
mdg seem to be different any on the
person that you're talking with right
now so that tells me which was not made
yet yeah my two cents yeah but it you
know it's it's interesting to watch like
this is a little bit different so like I
definitely like when I watched the
meteor community I'd draw parallels to
like what happened in rails and like
this is one thing that never happened in
rails because it wasn't like there was
no even though you have 37signals and a
core group like this stuff wasn't really
there you know right yeah they were
totally separate yeah they were very
loosely coupled yes very interesting
stuff all right meteor an SSL uh yeah so
like I I love all you guys and I added
SSO to crater and I got some questions
from people about it like how does that
work and why would you do that and so I
thought maybe it was time to talk about
it and like this one's been sitting in
my draft folder for the longest time and
then p corey wrote an article as well
about sniffing out DDP traffic and it
was like oh well Pete showed you how bad
it could be let me show you how easy it
is to fix that problem you know so i
wrote finally publish that article it's
looking awesome I haven't read it yet
yeah it's I mean it's pretty easy like I
give you an engine X config if you want
to add SSL and if you're on modulus you
know you can just upload a cert it's
pretty easy there too yeah um Heroku may
be a little different you gotta pay them
like 20 bucks a month and then obviously
no idea on galaxy imma sue me pry
there's probably some way to upload a
ssl cert if you need to but you know the
thing is like force your traffic to use
this so um you want that DDP to be over
an ssl connection because like that that
could potentially be a problem for users
like you know if you if you do all this
work to
like I don't know make sure your data is
correct and all this other stuff like if
Joe Schmo comes along and like gets
inserted in the middle like he could
just see all that data being passed back
and forth which is terrible so stop that
just get ssl set up super easy and you
know there's the force ssl package or
I've got a little engine X redirect
config that just detects you know when
you come into crater I Oh it'll redirect
you to the ssl mm-hmm and then you don't
have to worry about it anymore yeah well
I guess you have to worry a little like
I went in there and and already like
since I launched it back in April maybe
there's already like a ciphers already
been deemed weak at this point and i was
like i went from an a+ 20 be on that
little scoring tool that I link to and
it was just because like one cypher is
deemed weak now and i had to remove it
from the list so crazy good at all this
stuff yeah great article guys go read it
yeah it's like mandatory so and you know
what surprisingly not a lot of people
wrote about it in our community so it's
great that that you put that together
Thanks Thank You Josh in the community
to you tell us about the other side of
the coin been yo I love this article
yeah I shared it with the whole team
over at ok grow let me find the tab
where or is it freakin I don't have the
table open react jsx the other side of
the coin um so I love react and I am I
haven't been around like forever uh in
the deaf community like Josh I'm not as
old as man how old are you me yes 35
okay you're not that much younger than
me or you I'm right there I'm 32 okay
yeah but I had a life before develop I
had another like
professional working here before this so
I wasn't around for like all spaghetti
go code and like people saying like
separation of concerns and all that
stuff that about it on the hard lessons
so when I like see reactant jsx and I
cool let's do it and everyone's like
this doesn't look right at me AJ has
possession um right did I get your voice
right take it your tone right no enough
I someone manly than that here comes
this article the other side of the coin
and and basically his argument in a
nutshell is we have haven't noticed or
haven't raised a red flag about we are
comfortable with putting j s in our HTML
like plays angular yeah we're okay with
putting it in the HTML and so we're
already mixing concerns right there and
this is the other side of the coin
bringing HTML into JavaScript well I
think so if you look at meteor it
actually even goes further than that
right because you actually just take
those templates and you compile them do
javascript yes in the end and so you're
like but i want to write HTML i think
from like maybe a designer's standpoint
writing it in the HTML is a little bit
easier and that separation a concern
makes more sense and maybe the other
side of the coin here is like let's
actually make it easier on the
developers I don't know mmhmm yeah and
then that's where it goes into the
article was going into saying okay now
that I've made that correlation of hey
were cool with putting j s into HTML and
now hey other side of coin HTML in the
jas then he went into the rest of the
article talking about how its superior
bringing HTML in the JavaScript so it's
a great article it and i think it was uh
well warranted to be written so props to
who rubbed out
Corey house yeah good job Corey man
thank you indeed indeed so I felt like
for me like reading the articles like
yeah yeah this makes sense i'm totally
in and then like he gets down to the
advantages and I'm like yeah these don't
sound that great like the first one was
hey we could compile time airs Wow we
can compile time airs with blaze already
like it's it's a linter for us it'll
tell you if you forgot a closing tag so
mmm we're switching for me and then his
other one was let's uh leverage the full
power of let's see what did he say ah
the ides and because all our code is in
the same file we can now reference like
methods that we've created up top like
down below or vice versa and yeah maybe
maybe not enough to make me switch so i
feel like the article could have been a
little better that could have been
fatter yeah on the plus sides myself um
but you know I the top part really did
resonate well with me I do feel like
he's got a valid point that you know
we've we we we've slowly stepped this
way and mustache and handlebars and you
know all those kinds of things were
attempts at making templating safe for
the client and they've taken it to the
point where now like someone else
realize like oh hey we don't need these
templates let's just use straight
JavaScript instead mm-hmm so here we are
interesting stuff we're on the edge of
the future this is a I would say this is
a must-read I would yeah yeah you should
definitely take a look at this thing
alright so hum soft
haha which by the way like I you know I
would say watch the watch the dev shop
from last night you haven't yet there
were two really good main talks and then
there was like this really stellar
lightning talk from some guy about file
uploads to write oh yeah who's that guy
who was that guy Oh tall dark and
handsome I Pullman all right said hey
hey hey calm down from Canada to talk to
you guys it no today I'm gonna talk to
you about oh my God we're terrible all
right so um con soft building an ultra
responsive UI sharing nearly all Co
between web and mobile um and this was
uh written by I think most people know
him as Zim on Oh atmosphere and various
places but he just talked about like all
the stuff that they were doing and in
particular I found a little bit
interesting because they really really
placed a high emphasis on like client
side rendering times they wanted
everything to be like meticulously fast
and they kind of detailed a lot of stuff
that they had to do to make that work in
particular you know one thing that kind
of blew me away is they said we don't we
don't we didn't use Cordova so um I
don't even know what does that even mean
because they've got a link here to an
app on the App Store yeah how's that
even working WK webview really so you
can just build a native app that uses WK
webview I guess I've never tried that I
wanna when I was I I've heard of it
before and I never looked into it yeah
my first thought was well what about the
Cordova plugins like that that that's
the thing that attracts me the most to
Cordova is the plugins and access to the
hardware um
so I'm like so now it's like oh man I
want to know what this is but react is
topping my list of things that I really
want to dive into so maybe yeah that's
the bottom of my list well it is you're
interesting yeah and this is interesting
because this is all kind of this is
around blaze right and not not react um
yeah and I like to me like react native
I don't know I don't know how I feel
about that yet like I'm kind of curious
to see react native on a meteor app
because like they do what are things
like they run a lot of code like behind
the scenes using web sockets which is
like that's exactly what meteor does
that's kind of weird um so it's like I'm
gonna have a meteor within my meteor
mm-hmm there you go sounds like too much
fun yes but no I you know there's some
interesting things in here like he
talked about you know they're there how
they made everything zippy right like
they've got fast click in salt and
they're using the WK webview and they
don't use Cordova at all which by the
way I ended up reading up on it after
watching this talk WK webview there's a
problem where you can't reference local
files we can't say like file colon
Colin's that our colon slash slash um
you can't do that and so that's that's
kind of a problem in some echo dude said
on your and your mind uh hello echo echo
echo echo yeah good night go that's
sweet I don't I don't hear anything all
right hmm anyway um anyway um is it bad
you want me to disconnect and reconnect
no no it's fine uh yeah I did he did a
lot of template caching and that was
kind of interesting Aaron Oda did a
similar thing and had an article on it
and that was kind of how you know when
the screen changes are happening they're
almost instantaneous and I started
paying attention to the Cordova apt and
I'm working on and it is a little bit
slow and so I'm kind of curious like I
almost want to
so the memory stats Paul Irish memory
stats and kind of pay attention to like
what's the memory look like if I turn on
this kind of caching you know it's gonna
shoot way up on the phone like you
definitely don't want that either so but
uh there's a lot of good stuff in here
like i would i would definitely
recommend taking a look at this and um
you know some of the stuff that they
found performance wise they were able to
tweak to to make their app super fast
yeah you could tell that they spent some
time on this because when they were
talking about it I think it was Hans or
maybe it was the other guy I think
what's hands that touched it because I
had two guys from Han soft talked that
night yeah ah he was like yeah we spent
a few weeks on getting WK webview going
I mean a few months and then he went out
and I'm like oh they smell like here
yeah this is so this is like I am
curious when he said that that actually
like triggered something like if this
was a challenge if this was a mountain
that they climb I liked like that some
knowledge that needs to be passed out so
thank you for sharing this article yeah
and there was uh there was something
else in there which they haven't talked
about and he said they were using some
kind of like channels to do like
sharding and channels to use Mongo in a
different way that seemed maybe a little
more performant and less of a like right
load issue so he said they they are
working with the mdg now and trying to
figure out if it makes sense to like
give it back to the community somehow is
like part of the Mongo driver or
something so could be interesting who
knows all right we're at the end I'm sad
dude I already miss you Josh I have to
go drown my sorrows and a beer or
something cute yeah we get a beer
festival here and it's like literally
300 feet from my house so prettyful way
yeah
I can talk all right by my here drunk
bike writings funds we'll see maybe for
tonight bring your helmet yeah that's
definitely uh so yeah if if you want to
know more about the show you go to media
podcast com if you want support the show
