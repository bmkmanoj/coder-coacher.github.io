apprentice series this is I believe
episode 44 the media club podcast site
that we've been working on I have Kobe
with me again colbycheeze welcome hey
what's up guys so um yeah let's let's
dive into it off camera let me share my
screen Kobe did some work and did a pull
request it's minimize that guy Oh kind
of stuff good on your feed yeah I have
my screen ready before but now we're in
the early that's what I wanted to be all
right cool there we go alright so this
is attempt number two we we had some
audio quality issues but they seem to be
cleared up so the work you did you
cleaned up the metadata and it looks
like you added the play/pause
functionality to the to the button here
yeah just got some some of the simple
stuff out of the way bunch of a kind of
looking up info for people's Twitter and
all that so nice yeah so this was a
white space commit yeah i just opened
the file and my stuff auto changed it so
add tabs instead of spaces just the i
guess she gave feels you to listen to
the train i couldn't find the mute
button in time alright uh yeah so just
updated the year the footer there yeah i
tweaked the stalling just a little bit
on the play button you'll probably see
it when you open it up it's not a huge
difference but it looks a little better
okay awesome um yeah so it looks like
this is interesting so you're just
you're catching the click on the play
button and I guess you get when you pull
the player in using jQuery here
uh get this player object and you can
actually ask if its paws huh correct
that's pretty handy yeah so you can do
some cool stuff with it in terms of you
know messing with the play speed and the
where you're at in the player but for
our purposes of just playing and pausing
oh nice so if you can mess with the play
speed maybe we can have like at some
point we can add controls that allow you
to go like 1x or 2x yeah that's what I
was just initially looking at and so I
wasn't sure there's well there's
probably some like simple deal out there
we can like copy paste over or we can
make our own I don't know whatever
simple copy pasta all right um yeah and
so here this is the metadata looks like
yeah he changes this stuff here you
added an ID so we could catch the audio
player that makes sense ah and then you
changed all this metadata right headed
in the links for the Twitter and all
that that you had as hashtags oh yeah
okay that's funny my designer didn't
look my info yeah and then it looks like
you went through and just kind of
removed a lot of the old episode
insertion code that we had she's been
right yeah I figure we weren't gonna use
it if we needed to put it back in later
we've got it in the commit log so so you
also remove this sign in form but did
you remove the packages that were
attached to that that's actually a good
point I I thought about that after it
already submitted it and then I went a
bit so that's something I do need to do
but it's all good okay and then here you
just removed all the all the the various
fixtures that we had because it's all
automated at this point so right yeah
and infer for the looks of it since we
have three of them in there it does look
a little bit weird until you get 25
that's the way it's designed but I mean
the testing purposes you can go in
Mongol and you can add two more but
that's also what i mentioned to you off
cameras that probably need to play with
the styling on the list of episodes too
because right now it's i guess the way
it with the design is it looks fine with
a title being one line but once your
title goes to feed lines it kind of
shoves everything together and what
you'll see yeah well I think maybe what
we should do is get this thing deployed
and then we'll fix it now don't work
it'll work it's all small tweaks at that
point so this one's done oops don't need
a file there we go so this one's cleared
up how I get back to issues I used to be
a link marathon now click over here I
guess yeah alright yeah so I thought
what we could do an honor of like Heroku
launching their web they're such an
affinity we could play with that okay
and see if we could get a deployed there
so that could be interesting let me pull
down the latest code just give it a
quick hand test and then
what's your master which perhaps brings
up another good point of you know should
we think about writing tests at some
point as well yeah that would be cool
too damn you I think in the next session
so the goals are to get this deployed
and then clean up anything that looks
funky so can get this thing launched and
then we can start iterating over it and
I think that a good first step would be
like you know making sure we have some
test coverage and then we can start kind
of refactoring things too awesome yeah
that very cool I'm down for that oh it
always get to learn tests so think you
have to click on an episode I don't know
oh no no totally just worked I don't
know if you I did ok I just didn't hear
it yeah okay I don't know the chords on
my end or you're in or uh oh I see what
you mean about it being funky right yeah
so you just got mom go and do a
duplicate twice and it'll look but for
now yeah it does look poopy well if
we're gonna oh god stupid that's
something that's something I was like
well I don't know how it's gonna work
out for the deploy until you get fine
but yeah unless you just add some kind
of thing where it just at least shows
the background color I don't know I'll
look to you went and found my stack
overflow that's funny yeah get then
Google skills you know ok I'm going to
change mine out to Cora cuz honest and
never get on stack overflow ok I wrong
oh yeah same way I go on there if it
takes me there from google basically
mm-hmm which is often right but I never
answered like I'm always there looking
for answers but I never answer any me
yeah exactly i do all my entering
through blog posts and likes like chats
basically I don't know kinda
hopeful it is okay all right so I think
we're good to go to iTunes like I just
put it on instead of instead of putting
it to the direct episode I just goes to
the actual podcast itself yeah okay so
19 so so my thoughts are here maybe we
could split this guy on the dash and
maybe make this like a sub okay what's
this is this like an H television
whatever yeah oh it's just a span huh
hmm interesting yeah so we can just make
a new span or something here seems like
this would you really want this to be
like an h2 tag for that's not gonna say
it might be easier to just go in and go
to the typography section and just
replace episode cuddle with you know h2
or whatever you want to whatever you
want to do guess you'd help to just see
if that changes yeah you know that's not
terrible and then what we could do if we
split right here on the dash
do like an h3 tag right here yeah that's
not terrible of course like I tweaked a
little yeah yeah these boxes are they
must be like yeah they're not like
they're not response ever maybe maybe it
was like a flexbox I don't know not sure
how yeah cuz I said whenever it gets too
big a actually they are the when it's
responsive it's doing the right thing
but what interesting oh it's it's the
it's the desktop version that doesn't
seem that yeah that's interesting if you
just have to go with it the way it's
style deliver my machine all of a sudden
got super laggy oh just closed a some of
this crap I got open every 14 eats up
some cpu
goodness oh I think you might actually
be my battery's dying on my wireless
device here oh that's free you actually
use one of those two I like these things
just close some of the stuff we don't
need anymore let me see seems better now
okay good stuff so so we're gonna do
Heroku find an article here oh look this
is mine haha mmm good stuff well that is
asking you write an article and it helps
you out later
bill packhorse may see which one I was
looking at when I found when I googled
was Hiroko bill peck for me or uh yeah a
lot of those are out of date I think the
as far as I know the the horse pill pack
is the one that's lower being kept up to
date as you can see okay let's get
updated three days ago there you go um
yeah it's someone's back Margie teens
okay yeah why horse there are gazillion
forks and branches of various bill packs
for mixing the word Heroku bill pack
meteor many of which are abandoned or
outdated or broken and it's really hard
to keep them straight so this is the
horse one alright I like that
description that's funny indeed that
might be one of my favorite descriptions
all right um let's check it out what we
gotta do here forgot to play with kids
there we go this is what I was looking
for we can tell it to create with the
build pack that's what I wanted however
so create bill pack do need to tell it
now we don't have to tell the stack
anymore
ah you know what incomplete credentials
fun stuff then while since I used to
rope you back when i was doing rails
stuff think this is what I actually want
because i don't i don't want them to
name it i want this to like all right
thank you recognizing with my dash
button dashboard yes I nasty on 7142
doesn't seem very recognizable to me
yeah all right reminds me of that you
best so I think I need to do karoku
login here
oops hurry everyone goes BAM Josh's
email that's pretty public man I mean I
put it yeah and a lot of places all
right oh geez okay fun stuff all right
login I do have it saved three did this
part off camera huh yeah might as well
apparently I was for you apps right in
there yeah acorda got that's why i said
like it I need to like have it be
something obviously named right I should
really go in and like clean all that up
all right there we go oops now I gotta
change my password so you sayin roku was
similar in price to modulus or well
technically it's cheaper right now right
uh run one dino free but then like their
new pricing i think will be more in line
with what modulus charges you yeah is on
the podcast you were talking about it
you can run it for half a month yeah
yeah so so it's ruku beta pricing
Oh have they launched that pricing may
be pricing hey so one Dino oops just one
just one Yeah right now it's free still
good yeah so I guess I guess the the new
pricing your tongue out is to combat the
people who ping their website to keep it
away cuz ya which will shut up all right
fun d does see if I still have that
running a meat-eater club you know it's
not runnin let's figure that out too I
had an uptime app I forget where I
stashed it
yeah see it's like totally less obvious
here alright so the build pad behinds be
that guy there we go so we've created
our meteor club podcaster oh crap com
we've got a Heroku remote so if we say
push heroku master the build process
should kick oh wait wait wait wait wait
there's another step we're gonna add
Mongo lab I did so they they had this in
there as part of the build pack but I
don't know if it's changed they probably
removed it was completely used to use
compose but they don't have a free tier
anymore excuse me hmm so that's how you
get it connected to the TV yeah so for
now we'll just do media club podcast.com
kind of I get it to run with the
settings file oh uh yeah okay we'll get
into that in just a minute basically
we'll set meteor settings here just like
we did for this root URL will do the
same thing with meteor settings okay and
we'll do that and then I'll go back
later and we'll change the API key not
that it matters i'm sure but i don't
work out
so I guess we should do that so there
was like a handy I saw some modulus
bueller settings they've got like a nice
way to like cat the settings file and
then set it so there's like an
environment yeah there it is fine yeah
cool Oh max so let's grab the following
set up yeah please so you your settings
goals do we want like maybe it's these
guys for expansion do you remember and
bash like what would cause it to run
like that good question
hey I'm dude that did not work Oh can
see by there that worked you just just
got it yeah double quotes or a break
yeah and so you can see now on the
screen like it set meteor settings to
this little bit of JSON that we had in
there so now like if you go look in the
the other thing the other way you can do
it is um you refresh your screen because
Heroku dashboard is not real time we
click on meteor clip podcast here and go
to settings there's config VARs BAM and
so the meteor settings are in there just
as JSON so now I think we're good to go
git push origin know her oh coo coo coo
master and so what happens the build
pack is really just a set of bash
scripts and it's telling it to like
download the meteor files and like
install node and all that stuff so you
see here like right now it's downloading
meteor distribution so it's grabbing
1102 probably sweet and it's going to
get that installed and now it's running
the bundle right so it's doing a meteor
build command right here which is going
to create that directory that it can
execute against
this does all the commands you would
normally have to do manually yeah yeah
yeah so I mean the think of the build
pack is like mop right it's pretty
pretty close to what Matt does it's just
specifying it in a way that's gonna work
with Heroku because you just you fire
your app and it's going to choose the
port for you and all that kind of stuff
and then it handles like routing like
hooking up the router to route
everything properly nice all right we
just got to let it do it staying there I
suppose yeah takes a while to build node
i knows yet play the waiting game oh
nice we can connect it to github huh so
it's interesting yeah we could totally
hook this to Master and then any time we
merge the master it would do a deploy
for us which I think could be
interesting as long as we get tests and
see I in place yeah yeah that'd be
really easy yeah fun stuff all right Oh
says we got one okay so you can see here
it installs fibers looks like it runs
the build there's some other modules
that get installed and then at the end
like once everything is ready to go it
starts attaching environment variables
correctly you can see an installed
phantom for us so if we use spy durable
we should be good to go there hmm and
then it launches it and so theoretically
we should just like see this thing
working now so is this kind of like the
process that modulus says it does where
it converts it to a node instead of me
or snow oh not at all that's DBT Roger
so yeah check this out we totally have
yay yeah that's pretty cool man and then
so yeah all we got to do is just tweak
it up some some looks and gonna be whoa
super crazy oh gosh let's put that
that's awesome so if you're in the
meteor clubs like chat room you'll know
why that's going on if not sorry all
right um yeah so looks like we're
working that's good um so now we can
easily deploy this thing yeah so what
Demeter Iser does is basically it takes
your so it used to be when the bill
would run it would give you this tar
ball and it was a tarball created in
such a way that you know you had to run
that and soda meteor Iser would instead
like make it more of a standard node
application that could run on modulus uh
with the way that they were expecting no
taps to be built and so it would go in
and basically just rearrange your you
would run it on your machine it would
rearrange your project and run a build
and like spit out a file and then you
could deploy that file up to modulus and
then they integrated it in so when you
do a modulus deploy it would detect that
it was a meteor app and it would run the
meteor eyes or for you and handle all
that but since then I think if you just
output a directory build I think it
works roughly the same so I don't know
if you need immediate riser anymore or
not you he may still like modulus
handles all that 40
behind the scenes gotcha okay cool
alright so now we gotta fix some design
stuff oh boy oh boy so yes since it
works for the mobile version I guess we
just got to figure out what is missing
from the desktop session yeah so what
file would that be I'd be like views
episode maybe hmm be good so there's a
clear it's got the calls over oh no it's
just saying there's a there's a clear
fix at the bottom like seems like that
would take yeah that allows that to to
go stack on top of each other everything
but um I wonder if ass I'm gonna do
let's see that bitch you've gotta get
like a call small small column and on
medium column I wonder if it's mmm city
here the clear fix if you look at the
size on my screen here mmm so the
episode description is actually like
somehow being shown underneath this guy
right so I'm guessing this guy's got a
static height on him no that's not it
lookin x go episode let's see are you
looking at home or you oh you're
actually just trim around console ah ro
episode has a static height set to it
yeah that's what I was thinking it was
doing yeah so here this looks better
right oh there you go to the height so
um you're on local mail okay yeah I go
to your mom go and add two more episodes
and see what happens though whatever I
yeah I know exactly what will happen
will either I think the problem is the
size of this sideboard static yeah if we
made that not static to to grow with it
I mean that would be the ideal like this
we wanted to match our remaining
episodes there are however that works
doubt yeah I gosh so the problems gonna
exist even if we like cut this guy here
right like this is still gonna be a
two-line title which is right yeah
you're gonna have to expect that because
some of your titles are longer right the
question is do we scale down the the
font size I mean we're in JavaScript we
could like dynamically resize these
titles to fit I think there's libraries
to do that I mean it depends on if you
want all of them to be the same exact
size or if you wanted to do like it's
doing now and half like just
the size equal what it needs to be based
on those factors I think it looks okay
if their varying heights the main thing
is just getting it too well so the
problem is once you add these two more
end their equaliser yeah they're equal
height with this guy right okay i don't
know let's let's maybe let's attack this
problem in a different way for a little
bit um my thoughts are what if we just
make this container gray and then it
doesn't stark at least only having three
episodes yeah that's what I was thinking
as a initial yeah that's made me an
easier one right now so we need to set
this row C was the color right there f2
i think that uh so there we go if you
take up the static height and it pushes
down the little pagination bar if we can
make the actual site bar not have a
static height and just push down i think
i'll look okay that makes sense okay we
can try that ah let me just finish this
guy do you have a hardstyle party um
well not have a little bit more time
that's why I wanted to push it back a
bit more so we took it or push it up I
should think so then we need we need
this guy as well so I think we should
put this on the row
and then try to look for look there we
go how's that look that looks may be at
least a little better when you only have
three wudu yes that's much better
because it actually is presentable now
right okay so we'll move it ooh let's
see do that and then move the static
height you crazy yeah we'll see what
that looks like when I move it on the
sidebar yeah that's I think that's gonna
be key right so what do we want we want
episode at that one episode archive here
we go so these two guys we want to move
up oh so you can remove looks like I
guess I guess we're gonna have to do
something so yeah if you remove the
static height on the side panel we still
have to add something in to make it
stretch to equal the height of the left
one that makes sense or on let me just
finish this and then we can yes episode
archive list so we'll save that guy will
just make sure he looks right
here we go looks good to me cool nice
all right and then street like have a
height on all right that guy's gonna
just fill in okay I see all right so
you're saying on the sidebar we need to
ditch the height so so do this go go
into Mongol and duplicate an episode
twice so you can see what its gonna look
like with five okay duplicate duplicate
there we go and then and then if you go
in and remove the height you'll see what
happens the height on the sidebar know
the height on the episodes because we
obviously want them to be responsive to
the 2d content if you go to the right
throw at the seven yeah right so there's
but then the this is the problem here
right yeah yeah so that's why we're so
it looks good right now all we gotta do
is so that sidebar to stretch instead of
being static and I think we're good so
whatever the CSS for that acted look it
up this smell since i played with
columns let me see can see know off the
top you have a good no i don't okay so
look at this so info panel has a height
of 800 i used to know how to do this
when i was learning CSS but that's okay
rules easy enough
wonder if you said it height one hundred
percent or something yeah I tried that
but didn't see it might not be in a same
panic container so no see what is this
row stretch I had stretches to the
content of what it's doing so so
basically we need to pack yeah I don't
know if the sidebar if it's not an
apparent container I think that's the
problem it needs to be eaten like a
parent container that that the other
episodes are in and then you can have
height one hundred percent and then I
think it will stretch so many ways we
add another wrapper around the well this
guy would be the parent container right
here right ah the div clammy see div
class the div class row well kinda is
but the same climates be one just around
the episode I think where it says
episode loop I sort of let me see you
try this I'll let you know if this works
okay have to wrap it around recovery
ends links this is the bane of ESS users
everywhere making the stuff Matt yeah
that's okay think I'll get it here
double check okay updates oh I got it
alright cool faint i think well actually
hang on let me make sure i'm not
mistaken there go on let's be teasing
oh it's right to the chin sign okay oh
my gosh no no this is wrapping it like I
want what you do trying to wrap it div
around the row episodes and the sidebar
and then killed that and then make it
match we'll see if it works still kind
of new bit CSS to hope you throw light
on your blueprint use that for us you
talking about the episode archive row uh
yeah I was just trying to basically just
need to get it to match a parent
containers height I guess it's whatever
that until take off the
no baby not you just look up where's Jen
really trusting you find something maybe
okay not do it
ya see where they're saying you do like
a page wrapper and then you put the two
columns in there to them all one hundred
percent well we have a rapper though
yeah yeah I think we need to add it like
the row is a rapper rightly right
oh my god or flow or something can't
remember the name of it there's like a
CSS / flow property we got to access
overflow oh I got it I got that a like
parent one to make me try maybe I'm
think I might be honest um we'll see all
right I'd have to be so difficult I know
like it I love like the you know the
funny tweets with pictures that say like
you know we can lay in someone on the
moon and you know we can do all these
difficult things but in this day and age
you still don't have like you can't do
vertical centering like height one
hundred percent is difficult like come
on yes that should be better than I
think this would what's box is supposed
to be helping with
there's some there's some designer out
there face palming at our feeble
attempts to do this right now look maybe
maybe you may not ever watch this though
it's true that's true but if they did
yeah that's not quite what I wanted with
the black okay hi Otto may be harnessing
there cuz the dogs
feel like this should be working but
it's not oh my goodness how you faring
over there yeah not very well
oh that's interesting a clear fix huh
yeah I added position relative position
absolute I think a clear fixable
so the info panel is floated okay yeah
kinda is me so maybe what we should do
is uncheck or remove the height on these
guys deploy and then we can ask the room
with they have ideas yeah someone who's
better at CSS than us yes I feel like
that should be like CSS layouts 101 but
I completely have forgotten what's
making this not work well you can't wait
it oh I see why this is not a problem
when you go responsive you lose you lose
the sidebar when you go responsive right
here notice the sidebar is just not
right there therefore it's no longer a
problem in that case sure yeah right now
the sad part is our only problem because
we got the rest working out once we took
off the fixed height right so it looks
like anything above 768 and screen width
768 pixels applies a height to the
episode
hmm oh man you don't have the
highlighting on your style beer no I
should I don't have a plug-in for that
all right so remove the height we got a
few changes in here so we'll just do ya
do these HTML has a min height of under
percent on it I think that's so that
your weight usually you do that if you
have like a sticky footer bunch of white
space changes mmm there was a crap ton
of trailing whitespace in this file yeah
I noticed that when i was looking at it
i fixed it I've got a key binding that
just like removes it all there's no
really good size makes for an ugly
commit true well you can always just do
that equals capital G and that does it
for you oh really yeah you know what you
know where auto and dance for you it
also fixes the white space stuff so I
didn't know yeah just do like Gigi
equals strategy
although we had to be carefully if you
don't have some custom tabs facing
whatever you don't want the Ottoman did
I said change oh man I feel sad you
couldn't get it to work yet people get
it but we got that Heroku redeploy so I
was the step one expose indeed it's a
big step right yes mixed up getting it
online for people to see your ring yeah
so I think what what we'll do off camera
is all think through some more issues
and stuff and then we'll see if we can
get those fixed I mean we're getting
whoa push rejected air unexpected did
not like something oh did you do I
messed up the stylus file is you oh
because of this can change the end
facing now I left a media query in there
with nothing under it I think that maybe
did it gotcha whatever you saw us before
but just looks like a like a sass mmm
similarity mm-hmm there we go whoo
hmm still giving you problems no it
looks like it's good now just building
okay good okay just takes a while yeah
yeah I fixed it over here cuz we were
getting the air over here I just didn't
look okay I guess we gotta going forward
clip the styles and get that matched up
on the sidebar and then then the next
big one would be pagination for future
functionality yeah well I mean so if we
get a hundred percent height then
pagination is maybe less of a immediate
need right yeah I mean after basically
by the sixth episode is when we would
need pagination to work plan out the
buttons loose what if we get if we get
the sidebar to grow to a hundred percent
of the div on the left then
technically we actually have longer
right uh yeah yeah that's true because
i'm sure it'll look okay for a few then
when you get to yeah just gets again but
every she can be like a school we don't
long in the tooth otherwise yeah let's
see i'm gonna make one of those like
sticky side bars where like schools down
on the in such an interesting thought
too there we go alright cool it's a
start gonna send this to the designer to
she'll probably know maybe maybe yeah
you guys have butchered this whatever
you're gonna do yeah i'd like to figure
out how to get this guy to fill up this
bar as well oh yeah good points cool all
right man well good show something yeah
hopefully that was helpful to somebody
somewhere somebody can be like oh it's
not just me that has trouble with CSS no
all right oh wow I like totally oh there
it is stop share
alright well yeah so again this is this
is probably one of those episodes were
they like oh god these guys suck at CSS
I know right I was thinking I was like
man I why I hired as I don't you so she
can she said that yeah that's true but
uh again i think it's it's good progress
so like these at least look better and
since we only have three it's less of an
issue i'm sure you know the the designer
will probably cringe because this is
like this line and this line were meant
to line up but they don't so happy about
them yeah alright well know where I
