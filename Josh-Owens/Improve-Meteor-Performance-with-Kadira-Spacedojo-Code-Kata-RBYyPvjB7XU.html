your host josh owens and today we're
going to talk about Khedira so you
you're using meteor and you want to
figure it out like what the performance
looks like in your production
application or you can even use this for
staging if you want i would highly
recommend using khedira i use it to kind
of nail down problems for myself and for
customers and their applications so
let's let's give it a look here so you
just go to kitty Rio and they've got a
step by step that will walk you through
getting things installed this is more of
a how to use it tutorial I'm going to
open up crater so you can kind of see
what things look like here back to the
default state so you can see like I get
pub/sub response times which kind of
matter method response times memory
usage cpu usage and how many sessions
are connected / host and so if we look
here you can see you know we're doing
right now traffic's a little down but
we're doing about a hundred connected
users and we're doing we're averaging
about 43 right now and so if you're on a
paid plane you can actually click show
host and i'll show you how many are
connected to each device same thing for
memory you can open that up and kind of
look at that but the thing that i think
matters for most like i do code reviews
and when people have a slow application
that usually comes down to the pub sub
response time and so if you just click
here on this pub sub tab you can you can
sort this by a response time and you can
see that categories actually has a super
high subscription rate and also has a
the largest response time and so we can
go in here and click on this and when we
click on one of these points on the
graph you'll notice we get these blue
traces down here
and so if I just click on one of these
we can see that the actual categories
responded in about three milliseconds
database wise we're using alpha log i
would highly recommend that people will
do another one another code con on that
some at some point but you can see we
actually spend a lot of time doing a
categories find and then looping over
the each so this this could probably be
optimized the other thing that's
happening is we're kind of waiting on
some stuff to happen and so i'm not
really sure why but for some reason when
meteor set up their pub subsystem the
publications are blocking and so if we
think about the node event loop we're
actually going to sit there and wait for
one publication to finish before another
one can run and so if you request five
publications that's actually what this
wait time here is indicating is that it
waits for this to complete and then it's
going to wait for the auto-update client
versions to complete and then these
other three will all kind of go
sequentially and so i don't really see a
reason for that to happen the way that
it's happening right now so you can use
something like there's a the same
company that puts out Khedira used to be
called meteor hacks and they put out in
unblock the package that you can install
and add to your publications right at
the top to say this Don unblock and it
will allow no to be more efficient and
utilize the co routines the fibers
properly to actually decide when
something's going to run so if you think
about how lake if you haven't heard of
kuru teens or fibers before it's the
idea that instead of having to write
threaded code or
having to write callbacks or any of that
kind of stuff instead you just write
normal code and then you let the
underline process kind of decide what
runs when and and node functions in an
event loop so when we use something like
fibers it's able to say oh this needs to
do a little bit of work and then it can
pause while it's waiting and then
something else can run and so you know
we should be efficiently using the node
event loop too and fibers to kind of
decide what runs win it you know we're
not waiting for any kind of response
from a publication so I would highly
recommend adding this dot unblock to
your publications again you should
probably test it out just to make sure
but I've added a global unblock call
before and it didn't really cause any
issues so I you know maybe maybe that's
something that will eventually see its
way into core let's look at this one
instead here we go so this is what I
wanted to kind of show off and so if you
watch my other video when i talk about
indexing Mongo this plays nicely with
that because you can pull this up and
you can see like I've added unblocked to
some of these already and so in order to
pull up the post list we can see can we
see no we can't really tell where this
query is coming from but we are asking
for posts to be returned and so you can
take this selector and this sort and you
can build your query and kind of look at
you know the query planner and try to
figure out what you should be optimizing
so highly highly recommend digging in
here I know that it's not like super
intuitive to click here and click here
and click down here and then like open
all these up but a lot of information in
here you can see like it's using a log
we're getting a limit of 60 so it
actually it looks like it had cash
documents
a lot of interesting stuff going on in
here and I think this has to do with I
don't know I don't remember I forget now
anyway so you can really dig in here and
go through a lot of these traces and
figure out like why the site slow like
you can see we're doing a find on users
by ID using dollar sign in query we
wanted sorting really have no idea why
this was so slow anyway interesting
stuff the other thing you can do is any
kind of you can look at the observer
reuse and so if we look at low observer
reuse one thing we'd want to see high
observer reuse on would be this post
list and so it kind of tells you you can
see we were waiting for data to come
back but if we had high observer reuse
if we changed I think the reason we're
getting low observer reuses this posted
at bit and so I know post list is that
bit you see on the front page and so I
know for a fact with telescope if we
went in and added a changes query to be
a little more performant and a little
less specific to opening the page like
instead just did a sort by score and
with the statuses we're all correct and
we went just off status to and sort of
by score then this would go away which
is a time stamp based on when you're
connected and so you know if you connect
at this minute and someone else connects
in another minute then the queries are
slightly different but if the queries
can be the same and you have some kind
of public facing publication then you
should be able to get high observer
reuse and so if we think about how
meteor works you get observers every
time you do a query for a publication
and it's basically going to
you paying attention to when that data
changes and anytime that data changes is
going to send it down to the client and
so if we're able to reuse those
observers we're going to cut down on our
memory usage and theoretically probably
a little bit of CPU usage as well so
that's another thing to watch out for is
just sorting by observer reuse and
looking at like if you have a front page
or a landing page or something that's
like putting some data out there you
you'd want to see hi observer reuse
there you know so hopefully that that is
also helpful and then you can dig into
the methods as well and kind of see
what's going on so we can see with
upvote post if I click on one of these
we also get a trace and then we can dig
in and you can see like there's some
highly efficient inefficiencies going on
in here where we're making calls to
settings and users multiple times this
has to do with telescope and how it
handles callbacks along the way so
there's you can add listeners to any of
the the data so whenever a post change
is all these post callbacks get run and
that's actually what's happening here
while you see this over and over and
over again and I think you know this
this could be cleaned up and tuned up as
well but it gives you an idea like what
your methods are doing and how they're
running and you know all that kind of
stuff so you can dig into that and it
shows you particularly like we can see
here we spent a bunch of there was some
way time that was the method a sink we
have it in here
yeah it looks like there were some slow
spots in here but you know you had a
breakdown of whether you are making HTTP
call or waiting on the DB or sending an
email or doing some kind of computation
so it gives you a much much better idea
of like why your methods are taking so
long to respond and you can again you
can sort by response time in here or
wait time or DB time so you can really
dig in there and then if your upgraded
to you get live queries which will allow
you to kind of dig in and you can see
here a lot of what we have our change
calls so a lot of people stay connected
they'll keep the browser open and the
added czar when they initially come in
but then after that we get a lot of
change calls and these are likely
related to like the scores changing over
time and that kind of thing so and then
heirs you know you can dig through here
to find errors I would probably
recommend a different air tracking tool
but that we can dig into that in another
video and then this is a fun one to you
can actually take snapshots profile the
CPU and that kind of thing so if you
install the kido profiler you can you
can turn this on if you have a paid plan
and actually look at like what is the
CPU doing I think you get a little flame
graph back so kind of interesting as
well and then if you want like locally
you can run Khedira and you can tell it
to connect in and you can actually
instrument your local running app and
look at different things that are going
on locally as well as you're doing
development on your machine so maybe
we'll cover that in another video but I
thought that this is kind of my thought
process when I'm digging through here I
spend a lot of time and the pub sobs and
methods just trying to figure out how to
make things faster and that's I think
super important to kind of that speed
perception that you get if you have
like if you're using iron-router which I
wouldn't recommend and you're using a
weight on that's why you get that
loading if you're using something like
template level subscriptions hopefully
your templates are broken down enough
that you know you'll have maybe a couple
of different loading indicators on the
screen you know if you add this this
dawn on Block in there then you'll end
up with things that are incrementally
loading and you know it'll it'll speed
things up and you can also again just
use this information this pub sub to
kind of figure out what needs to be
indexed in your application based on
highest response time or highest sub
rate sometimes like I can tell post list
would be a good one to probably optimize
post less users that kind of thing so
it's worth spending time I've done some
poking around in here before and done
some indexing so if you haven't yet now
go back and watch the indexing video I
think that'll be super interesting to
apply after you have this knowledge and
if you haven't installed this yet you
know it takes two minutes or less to get
Khedira up and running it's it's super
super easy to get going with a meteor
app so if you enjoyed this video please
do give it a thumbs up we'll do another
one it let's say well we'll do 50 on
this one since it's meteor specific and
not just JavaScript but if you did enjoy
it feel free to go in and give it a
thumbs up and we'll do another one once
we hit 50 this video has been in space
