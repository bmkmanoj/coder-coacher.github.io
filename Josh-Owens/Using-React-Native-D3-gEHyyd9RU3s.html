crater remote cough mobile edition this
talk focuses on building mobile apps
using javascript you can find out more
information about upcoming crater remote
coughs at cough crater io enjoy the talk
alright welcome back to session two for
our third day and this talk is about
using react native with d3 and so I've
got Harry wolf with us and he is an
engineer at todaytix
and he's been using react native he used
it for six months at his previous job
and he's kind of doing a lot of fun and
react stuff where he's at now
so I'll let him take it away from here
cool yeah Thank You Josh for having me
on today
very excited happy Friday to you and
dipper in elseville sitting in but the
yeah and then without being said let's
just jump into the talk everything
looking good yeah all right so welcome
everyone this is my talk about react
native and d3.js you can't see me but
I'm standing so I can pretend that I'm
presenting even more so as Josh said my
name is Harry wolf I'm currently the web
development lead at todaytix comm I also
blog tweet and publish open source code
all the same wonderful people so you'll
have no problem for getting it this talk
is the spiritual successor of a talk
that I gave a couple months ago that
talk was more of an introduction to
react native if you didn't have any
experience with it if you don't know any
thoughts of is going to be a little bit
more advanced than that one I'll be
building on the information shared in
that talk but if you want to get some
more background I definitely encourage
you to check out the previous slide deck
so as Josh said that my last job I
at a company called Sharpie there I
helped build their new iOS application
from the ground up built entirely in
react native this is in the App Store
you can see some screen grabs here you
can see the application in action and
again everything you see here is built
entirely in react native including these
graphs and it's these graphs at the top
of here that directly inspired this talk
where I get to actually share what I
learned and like was able to do in there
and let you be able to make graphs so
into that in your own react native
application so again this is gonna be a
more advanced topic but a more advanced
talk but just to make sure we're all on
the same page Hey ah Harry really I
don't think your slides are advancing
all we see is just your your uh yeah now
they're changing what a bummer
yeah I don't maybe maybe you went
fullscreen I wasn't sharing it or
something there we go now we see the
charts do you still see it now yeah okay
do you see a video no we see here we see
your notes actually so we're seeing like
the keynote Hampton so how do I get this
to be full screen then I can resent it
like this it won't be the best but I can
do that yeah it's up to you
I mean um you need to see the nut this
slides
yeah I go I'll do it this way whoops
would I do um okay this will be
different ah whoops okay again um please
don't cheat on the side can I hide the
side actually if you don't see the
Navigator oh come on
nope
Oh slide only look at that
just like fullscreen but not okay so
again this is the truck beat iOS
application thank you by the way Josh
for the heads up appreciate that here
are the graphs that I mentioned that you
didn't get to see beforehand fun
I don't like life coding it scares me so
this is just all videos here um I did
that cool so I can't advance the slide
now yeah so two guys on the same page
was react native so react native is a
framework for building native apps with
react this is straight from the website
react native lets you build mobile apps
using only JavaScript so you use the
same design as you would react when you
compose a rich mul UI from declarative
components and so straight from the
react native website this is what a
react native component looks like
instead of divs and spans you're using
view and text components okay
create applications right everyone okay
so let's talk about b3j s this I'm going
to go into a little bit more depth as
you might not have as much knowledge
about d3.js so again according to its
website d3.js is a javascript library
for manipulating documents based on data
now when they say documents by default
d3 means HTML SVG and CSS and you can
take some data give it to d3 and then it
can output it into these environments
here's just a screen grab from d3.js s
home page where you can see just
examples of graphs made in d3.js
I'm sure you've seen this around the
internet before now what's
important to know is that d3.js
whistling came out with version 4.0 and
that's a big deal especially for us
swine to use it in react native because
it's now modular d3 is now many small
libraries that are designed to work
together in d3 version 3 it was one
monolithic library where all the kitchen
sink was included you couldn't really
decide what's in there
why that matters for us is before d3
version 3 and included modules that
required access it required a browser
and as you know three-act native there
is no browser in react native but now
with d3 version 4 we can just pick and
choose what modules we want to use in
making our graphs which is great
so we also worry about all the HTML
libraries or CSS libraries we can just
pick them each choose the ones that we
need for our use cases we're going to
focus on two libraries this scales
library or module and the shapes module
and let's go into a bit more detail
about those because we'll be drilling
using those later on in this talk so the
d3 scale module has in it a continuous
scales function and a continuous scales
Maps a continuous quantitative input
domain to a continuous output range and
that's a fancy way of saying given a
value from the domain return the
corresponding value from the range so
what does that look like so we have d3
use the scale linear function to create
a scale instance and then we can set the
domain and then we can set the range so
this is on the y-axis so let's say you
want to make a graph plotting out test
scores from 0 to 100 and the height of
your screen is 640 pixels you set the
domain 0 to 100 you set the range is 0
to 640 so that if you start got
a 50 on their test score that would be
outputted on to your screen at 320
pixels and the same thing for 80 and
this is very handy when trying to make
translations from data your domain to
your native application which is your
range of pixels on the screen also in
the d3 scale module our time scales and
these are exactly like continuous scales
except the they have a temporal domain
being that the domain values are dates
rather than numbers again this looks
very much similar except the domain are
now date objects instead of just
integers and again the same principle
given a value from the domain you get
one from the range scale time are most
useful when you're plotting over time
which we'll be using later on in this
talk now let's talk about the d3 shape
module this module is pretty awesome it
provides a variety of shape generators
for your convenience one of those shape
generators that it provides is a line
generator and this line generator can be
used to compute the D attribute of an
SVG path element so let's do a slight
diversion into SVG land so I'm not going
to go in depth in this there's a link at
the bottom of this slide to read more
about SVG in the past object but in the
world of SVG when you're actually
creating your vector graphics there is a
path element paths
allow you to create complex shapes by
combining multiple straight lines or
curved lines and the shape of the path
element is defined by one attribute
called D so this is the d3 scale line
generator in action you have here this
is an example straight from the d3 shape
readme you have a array of data you have
d3 dot line which is creating a line
generator instance and then you have X&amp;amp;Y
functions that set how the line
generator should compute the so when you
give the data into the line generator
it'll be X&amp;amp;Y tell the line generator how
to output the domain values to the range
values so in this case we're actually
outputting very directly the domain
values DG value there's no real
transversion there so that's why you
would usually include a scale object
inside of there to make that conversion
from domains to ranges so that was just
a lot of words but it's a lot of
information trying to condense it really
hard um so at the bottom here you can
see that we're passing in the data into
the line generator and out pops out this
long string and that's actually the
value that is put inside of your SVG's
paths D attribute causa welds on if
you're still with me I applaud you
because I'm out of breath and my voice
is hoarse I'm taking a glass of water
okay and now the fun so how does d3.js
work with react native so come with me
on a stroll so there is this library
called art linked to the library at the
bottom art is a retained mode vector
drawing API that's straight from there
remain what that really means is that
you can create SVG vector graphics using
an object-oriented model of programming
rather than having to hand write your
SVG so here we have an art surface art
group they have an art rectangle size
100 200 100 100 by 100 moving into X 10
y 10 Flint with blue then adding into
the group what that looks like is this
so when you actually render that art
code you'll output something very close
to this and you don't have to actually
write this code yourself so that's cool
that's fun what's cooler than art well
we act heart haha so react art is a
JavaScript library for drawing vector
graphics using react which is to say
that it provides declarative and
reactive bindings to
to the art library and that's what react
art looks like this is again when you
review the slides later you'll see how
brace similar this code is this is just
provides you a react interface to making
SVG graphics so you have service group
rectangle same deal
okay so we have art we have react art
can you guess what's coming next we act
native art if you guess that you get a
hundred dollars of imaginary money
so yeah so someone actually someone
being the face book or the face book
team made a native bindings to the react
art library for react native this is a
screen grab directly from the react
native repo this is upstream in the
library itself and you can see here all
the native code required for react
native art just to be clear in this talk
I'm going to be focusing just on iOS
just because for sake of brevity but
react native art works completely the
same way in Android and again this is
the code for react native art the actual
react components look exactly the same
just where you import them from is just
off of the react native module so cool
so we're going to take this knowledge
and now actually make something with it
I want to make a graph so the first
question might be what are we making we
are going to make a very simple weather
forecast application where you can put
in your address it'll go here an API and
then it'll graph for you the weather
forecast for the next upcoming week and
it also animates and you will also learn
how to animate your grass because what's
more fun than making a graph is making
it move awesome
so this this that application is
actually entirely open-source it's a
public on my repo right now feel free to
clone it down fork it open an issue do
whatever you want with it but it's there
for you to learn from each commit in
repo is made such that they work
standalone so you can see the
progression of code that was done to
make this application and then this taco
in some ways echoed that progression as
well so let's build b4 we can build we
have to actually link the react Native
art library to our iOS application may
believe this is true for Android as well
what this means is that you know by
default react native comes with many
components included by default but they
don't include everything because they
felt that it would cause unnecessary
bloat because not every application
needs to have support so when you
actually use the reactive part
JavaScript code you can actually have to
link the native code in your native
application for it to actually work and
there's a whole guide on the react
native website teaching how to do that
pretty straightforward and that's the
only prerequisite for using react native
art in your application
so let's gonna jump into some code now
this entire view that you see in front
of you is the weather page J's component
you can see here it's a regular react
native component as a view has a header
and then it has this weather graph
component and this is where we actually
see our nice plane d3 graph for the
first time okay
so let's actually jump into the weather
graph component this is the this is
inside of the weather graph component
now in its render function you can see
here we have the view surface group in
shape this is exactly what we saw
earlier on in this talk and these are
the reactive art components that are
used to actually render out our d3 paths
D attribute did you follow that okay
good so right here we have the D
attribute is being given this line path
variable this is being taken off of our
state so the question is where and how
is this line path value being computed
so let's jump up inside of weather graph
so these two in component will mount and
in component will receive props I have
this compute next state function just to
catch both of those cases
so let's actually jump into this compute
next state function here it is again
this is where the state is being sets
which causes that rerender you can see
here this line path a dot path attribute
is being given onto the state and that's
being made up here on this graph details
that create line graph and we have this
graph utility function module where they
function on with a function on it called
create line graph and you give it some
data and it spits back this line graph
with one property called path which has
the D attribute so the question is where
is this data coming from so as I
mentioned before because we actually
have to you know use d3 to make actually
d3 needs data it's actually make the
line path so this data as I mentioned
before is coming from forecast dot IO
which is a weather website they actually
have a awesome API very easy to use very
easy to register for an API key it was a
it was the easiest thing to use took me
longer to find forecast IO than to
actually use it so you actually hit the
end point is what it looks like you get
back this big JSON blob of a weather
forecast for a given latitude and
longitude that you passed in the URL in
this JSON response there's many
properties the one that we're focusing
on today is the daily property which
gives you back a data property which is
an array of objects that tell you the
weather forecast for the next for the
next week for the given latitude and
longitude so daily data is an array of
these objects and that's what we're
actually passing into the create line
graph function so graph data daily data
then we also have
expats gesture and a why accessor here I
just kind of included them in line so
you can see what's actually going on
this is also it may look like a
premature optimization but you'll see
later on when you get to animating why
it's done this way but the X access er
is given into this great line graph
function as an easy way to say where it
should get the x value and the y axis
are the same way so D time and D comes
your max you can see here to go back a
slide there's D time at the top and then
do time do not come to your max
somewhere in the middle okay so let's
now jump into this graph utils module
and in particular the create line graph
function so here's the graph details
module at the top we're importing those
two standalone d3 modules that we talked
about earlier d3 scale and d3 shape
we're also using t3 array which are just
helper functions like the d3 equivalent
of look of a lodash or underscore and
then here we have the actual create line
graph function please do not be
overwhelmed this is pretty
straightforward
so what is this create line graph
function doing so the first thing that
it does is it's making the scale X
function this is the same thing that we
saw earlier on we're using scale time to
make a scale function where we can use a
domain of date objects and here you can
see we're using the first date objects
time and then the last date objects time
and then the range because we're going
you know from left to right is zero to
the width of our native applications
screen and that's being passed in as
well as you can customize the width and
height to your fitting so that means
that you know given the if you were then
invoke the scale x function with the
last date with the last data time value
you get out the max width of your screen
and then we're doing the same thing then
we're also making the Y scale function
and here we're making just a very simple
linear scale where we have the domain
which is the extent of all Y values so
an extent is a fancy way of getting the
min and Max at the same time and the
reason why we're doing the extent of all
the Y values rather than just doing 0 to
max why is because we actually want to
have greater fidelity into the
differences in temperatures that were
graphing over if the differences in
temperatures is only like you know 2 or
5 degrees and our domain is 0-2 like 80
they'll be very hard to see that
difference just because of what you're
graphing so instead we're just going to
zoom in onto that graph and just give us
the min Y value and the max Y value
you're using this nice function which is
a helper utility in d3 that if you have
a domain of like 63 to like 78 that got
nice function we'll change that to 60 to
80 to give it a nice round feel and then
in the range we're inverting the height
we're inverting it to actually fix the
rendering from D threes axes into iOS s
axes and then here we have the d3 shape
line generator and again this is what we
talked about earlier we have the X
getter and the Y getter where we're
using the X access err on the date
object to actually get the x value which
were then passing into the X scale to
get that value in our range which is the
output field in our application and the
same thing for every Y value we have the
Y access search the scale Y which means
then can use then have the line
generator output the right
v3 the right SVG papdi attribute which
we then return at the bottom and I am
out of breath because that was just so
much graphing things oh my god but after
you get through all that you get a d3
graph and react native that's awesome
I'm ecstatic
but we're not done okay we have a nice
graph but we don't really know we can't
really make sense of it so how do you
make sense of a graph you add some
labels so let's do that for our graph
right now let's actually add some axes
and ticks to actually annotate the graph
with the information that is actually
showing so let's go back to our graph
utils module where before all we were
returning was the line shapes path value
for the axes and the ticks we'd a little
bit more information so well actually oh
good that is not showing up I see it in
here but I don't see it there that is
weird
well I'm gonna jump to the code then
just to show that because that is
annoying
can you see my atom editor is that
possible again oh we don't see it right
now no why is I see it in the in the
thumbprint right yeah and it was working
last night well in any case ah that
sucks
do you have a nice green hooked up or
something no that's the fast anything
about at all oh maybe you can reshare
your screen and then choose like over
all desktops entire screen cool thank
you for your tips by the way oh my god I
have not seen any of your comments
before and now I just did so I'm glad
that I was able to read your mind with a
dot nice method so we have here the
graph utility function and before it was
just the path property and now we're
actually going to be tune with that
going to return this property as well
which is
is us mapping over the array of data and
simply passing every x and y value
through our scale object to get the
final x and y coordinates that will be
rendered to our iOS application
let me just oh my god let me just go
back to sharing just the screen in case
other things pop up alright cool cool
all right so then we're going to take
all right we're back we're good yeah
cool
so we're then going to use that ticks
property from the line graph function
that it returns to actually just use
straight up react native code to create
our axes and ticks I think there's a way
to do
SVG texts and stuff with react native
art I haven't done that tell no need for
that so I just went straight to react
native itself but you can see here we're
simply using the tick X value to
directly position our ticks on the axes
where we have the elements positioned
absolutely and then we just use plain
old react native and style sheets and
the same is true for our y axes and our
white ticks now you can see here we have
we're setting the left and the top
property of our textiles objects with
the ticked on X and fixed up Y we have
some offset here to make it just look
pretty when it's actually outputted then
for that dot that you see there as well
even more clearly we're using directly
ticked red X stick that Y now it's an
easy very easy way to make your axes and
ticks to get more information into your
graph so now let's get to the fun part
the part that you probably all been
waiting for let's get things moving and
I need that very literally so to add
some animations we're going to add these
control button components and you can
see there I'm at the top for maximum win
and what these do is that you change
whether you should be graphing the
temperature Max value or the temperature
min value
so then just to go through the sequence
of events what happens you know you tap
on this control button which calls the
diskette max function which is just a
bound curried version of our unchanged
function which then updates our state
with the new show max value which causes
a rerender as you know that we react
with react if we were rendering the
temperature min before we would have our
Y access or be a function that returns
our temperature min now this is where it
looks like premature optimizations
before but I just had the benefit of
foresight which if only every project
you can have that we'd all be a much
happier people um but this lets us
easily customize what we're graphing by
just changing the function and what it
returns so now that we're saying you
know show the max value this function
jumps up here and returns instead D
temperature Max and then after that it
causes weather graphed we render with
these new graph properties on it cool
still can't see your comments so I'm
just going to keep going so let's jump
into weather graph when it actually
renders with these new properties again
we have weather graph we have this nice
utility setup with compute next state
and then instead of compute next day we
saw this before as well where you used
you know graph utils create line graph
to get the line graph but we're actually
going to have to expand on this function
to actually make things animate so past
that initial set state there's more code
now so the first thing that we have to
do is just a first time set up wearing
if this is the first time that we're
rendering this graph cache the line
graph object so that we can use it later
on you'll see where you'll see where we
use this previous graph just in a second
this is a nice little performance
optimization where we're not going to
render or reanimate if our properties
are the same the only reason when our
properties would be different is if that
Y access your function changes
very important thing to be aware of and
then down here we're getting our path
from value and our path to value now
these these values are the D string
attributes that is the line path string
so at that big long crazy string that d2
generates for us so that's all we have
this previous graph path because we have
to know where we're animating from and
where we're animating to here we're
doing some stuff with animating that
you'll see in a second and then here
we're doing something which is not
exactly a hack but it's a shortcut where
we're opting into using react natives
layout animation module which allows us
to easily animate all of our axes and
ticks when we also animate our g3 graph
if we wanted to have more fun at control
here we could have used the animation
module and react native but this has
pretty much the same effect a gotcha
with this is that laya animation can't
animate hold on you some water
laya animation can't animate text
components so you should wrap all your
text components in view components for
it to animate here and this is just some
custom configurations so that it
animates along with our d3 line graph
path attribute then down here is where
we actually to do the magic of animating
the d3 line graph to do animations here
we're actually directly using the art
module this is like the the real like
primitive just art module because inside
of there there's a morph component which
allows you to tween from one path value
to another and if you've done tweet
animation tweens before you can set a
delta of like where it should render to
but you're actually making
the more between instance where we
actually set up where it's tweeting from
and tweeting to after our state is
updated we kick off our animation with
our animation loop and then again we're
caching which is now our current line
graph as our previous line graph because
we'll use that next time that we animate
so let's jump into the animate function
everything in here is wrapped inside of
the request animation frame function for
performance reasons just so that we have
everything nicely queued and fluid here
this is this this whole function is very
typical of tweening animation loops but
you know if you don't have a start time
you use the time stamp given from
requestanimationframe here we're
computing the Delta for how long in the
animation that we're in this is the time
stamp of where we are now - our start
time once we have our Delta if our Delta
is above 1 that means that our animation
should be complete like we should be
done animating we should be our next
state and like everything should be done
here if we say if we set the state to be
disprove you scrap path just make sure
that it ends up where it should be and
then we return early to stop our
animation loop however if we're still
animating then we actually have to set
the tween value of our line path
transition and here we're directly
accessing the line path instance in our
state object and tweening it according
to the Delta of how long we are in in
our animation after we've updated this
tween we can then set the state that
caused our pre render with that new
tween state and then kick off our
animation to start the next frame to be
rendered and then that gives you this
nice and Thun animation so the line is
moving with our tween function and our
numbers are moving with layout animation
and that is my talk react native and
d3.js the slides are online I stealthily
published them last night in the cover
of darkness I'm probably gonna fall just
talk with a blog post as well pretty
much reiterating what I talked about
here just in written form and thank you
so much for tuning in and thank you josh
yeah awesome good job Harry um and now
brief word from our sponsors before you
see the rest of the talk Raygun spend
more time building great software and
less time fighting it
Raygun helps keep a watchful eye on your
web and mobile applications and tells
you when problems arise you can learn
more at Raygun calm native script back
by telluric bye progress is an open
source framework for building truly
native mobile apps with typescript and
angular to use your web skills to get
native UI and performance on iOS and
Android enjoy the rest of the talks you
don't better have any questions yet I
just that throw me maybe you were yeah I
can I mean so yeah I mean that that I
yet it is lots of taken that is that
play sure that was me learning over like
form that's that's four months of
learning like on the job full-time
condensed into 30 minutes so it's also a
lot of like disparate topics combined
into one so I am NOT insulted in the
slightest Thank You Carlitos I
appreciate that I like I like the way
that you did it with videos and code
snippets and kind of highlighting the
parts of the code definitely one part
was visible that was weird
but I have one question does the morph
plug-in work with other SVG shapes I
don't know
the so it works directly with the path
element and in particular the paths D
attributes shape where it can take one D
attribute and morph it into a next one
so in that sent and like a path element
is the primitive upon which all SVG
elements are built on top you can
replicate any SVG element with a path
element there are just nice wrappers for
that so in that sense it does work with
that but you still have to just use a
path element to make that more capable I
don't know who works with like rectangle
or circle but you could have that same
path and use that for um for for
morphing purposes there's there's if you
google react native art transfer
transitions there's this great blog post
where I definitely learn most of my
stuff from I forget the name of like
brown field year or something like that
brownie field were was published last
year so some information is a little out
of date but most of it's still very
current but that's still a good place to
start nice alright ah another question
from Ryan can you give a brief overview
of what you can do with react art you
showed it in the context of graph but it
looks like you can do a lot more um have
you played with it more react are only
used within the context of react native
so when in the actual like Sharpedo iOS
application if you recall there was like
some like fade transitions between
different graphs and that was actually
just done with the animation library
where I would have to I have
react native surfaces and took me a
while to realize this but like if you
use the animated module and react native
you can arbitrarily make other
components animatable
so I by default you have animated view
animated add text or whatever you can
actually pass in react native dart dart
group into animated create to make a
animated group and then you can actually
just use that as any other animated
component to actually have it do
animated transitions like opacity and
other things inside of there which is
like another like that's more in there
but yeah does with dropping answer the
question but I about it I'm gonna remove
this one over question was what BB were
you using for the app redux okay it's in
fact it's entirely Redux um yeah that
was the hardest thing is figuring out
how to store that data in the Redux
store because it's massive and it's
large but it's also real-time so it's a
large data dump that updates on an
interval and then I would use Redux
connect function that would cause the
components rerender then update the UI I
got into a lot of issues where if you do
mess around with react native art its
stuffing more of the Wild West in the
react native world just by nature of
itself but you'll encounter very quickly
when you step outside of the lines
you'll get this like red screen that
says I cannot parse JSON no or something
like that and it means that something's
misconfigured like the path attribute is
wrong or it's null and it just like says
barf and just like throws it up so a lot
of my time is spent debugging making
sure that those cases never happened
because you'd have this swipe animation
which would cause the transitions to
occur to cause different data to load to
then cause that to update and I had many
headaches and
advil was my new investment and what I
could make myself stainless um tell me
what else yeah I haven't that was
literally going to modules that I played
with his deep three scales d3 shape ball
that I needed um there's so many other
ones that you could probably include and
like because now d3 is modular there's
no preventing you from doing so and
asking and like there's a react native
open-source component that just does
SVG's generically that just wraps react
native art and lets you just like render
SVG's and like just having that
primitive building block just enable so
much that you can do in your application
rather than having to worry about
importing pngs or JPEGs you can just
have it in an SVG inventor that in your
reactive application and not worry about
different assets for everything yeah and
I guess the advantage of SVG is that it
should scale properly you can
arbitrarily set its width and height so
long as the ratio is correct
put the vector graphics indeed does
anyone else have any questions it goes
online okay all right well did I invite
you to the slack chatroom Mary no no
okay
I'll get you in there and if anyone has
any other questions they can just ping
you in slack as well go yeah
also feel free to ping me on Twitter I
tweet both sense and nonsense so all
things are equal yes well your eye over
the top it was a super informative and I
think we we all learned something there
is one thing I hope just be gems Fall
Fair yeah alright well we'll take a
break the next talk starts at 3:00 p.m.
Eastern
so about 17 minutes or so we'll get
started with that
talk and we'll be discussing using
meteor as a back-end for react native
with Spencer Carly so alright guys
thanks thanks Harry thank you thanks for
watching this crater cough talk from the
Mobile Edition 2016 for more information
about upcoming conferences such as the
one in February 2017 go to camp crater
