2016 welcome Raider fans but oh so rusty
yes i'll be coming on board i totally
draw this of the show i'm your host Josh
hunt with my rusty co-host been Strahan
luckily April Fool's Day yes indeed this
is actually this is gonna be the new Elm
podcast oh no great just kidding I'm
just and no Facebook ate all the love
that we've gotten from the Elm community
oh yeah it has been cool yeah I you know
I didn't even know about it was like oh
hey congrats on getting in Elm weekly
and I'm like what what are you talking
about I actually knew before you because
they did a little tweet and they
mentioned me in it I don't they didn't
mention you yeah they didn't they
mentioned me Oh today they musta done
separate ones I'm oh yeah I mentioned
Ramsay too and I thought I was important
no just no one of the crew you're just a
guy the guy the beam just a podcaster so
I did I did get a little food yesterday
because uh did you did you see the post
about Aaron Nona oh yeah but you called
it yeah I'm reading it I'm like wait a
minute yes it's April first over there
like yeah this is totally he's trolling
us oh but he said he was quitting
Khedira and he's moving to San Francisco
to work on reacts which hey you know
it's not unpossible I can love
believable it was yeah I'm gonna go work
for facebook guy yeah which I mean I
pulled the same thing last year when I
was like you know facebook is buying
meteor and everyone's like what yeah
yeah he's funny yes so this year I I saw
tweet from an EO dash and i'm getting
ready to press the upload button on a
new youtube series that was inspired by
his tweet where he said like don't do
stupid jokes instead do something good
for the word
so I'm try I did like a debugging
techniques in JavaScript video and if
people like it then maybe I'll keep
doing who knows very cool yeah I hope
people do like them guys go ahead and go
to go to youtube subscribe to josh's
channel yes i said in the video if i get
50 likes i'll do at least one more so if
you like it should give it a thumbs up
totally alright so this week we are
talking about a meteor 1.3 study plan
react story book which is arresting two
very interesting did you watch did you
watch the dev night last night i watched
the tail end of basel towns talked in
the beginning of sash goes and then i
had to go ok so neither of us have seen
the chromatic stuff which is apparently
similar uh building building your own
galaxy bowling your own galaxy smoking
it now i'm just kidding um and react
router basics yes let's roll with it man
roll roll roll him well i got roll on
the brain i don't know why ah so meteor
1.3 study plan in case you missed it
meteor 13 is out that's right what rock
you're living under yeah if you did miss
it but if you're not and uh you knew
about this and and I get a little poll I
curious now I never looked at the final
results of it oh I saw that David good
one just asking people like how fast
they thought they were gonna upgrade and
how I was actually getting some mixed
response than ourselves I was kind of
interested in yeah I picked the third
one yeah what was that one again I got a
ship features so who knows yeah that was
me
1.3 but uh what was a lot of people said
like within this week right yeah so
fifty-three percent of the people said
this week thirty-one percent said maybe
in April twelve percent said crap no got
a ship stuff and four percent said never
imports an MPN suck man Oh mate what
percent said that four percent okay good
yeah let's go solo and you know i mean
like given what went down last week with
NPM ah it's a fair thing to say i guess
that you don't like him p.m. i'm glad
that it would add that happened now the
conversations is happening there's gonna
be solutions and well yeah they've
already said you know they're there
they've already made a change their
policy so you can't unpublish a package
if it's been more than 24 hours and then
to contact them if you want to so you
know good changes i think uh anyway so
1.3 if you haven't tried it yet i think
quite a few people have already upgraded
right and i think the new features are
kind of like an opt-in and so you can do
the upgrade and just pretend like
nothing changed in your meteor app in
your fine yeah and sad you can slowly
start switching the MPN and using the
import system and that kind of stuff so
with this article that we're reporting
on that sashka grief put together it
goes one step further and it says now
that the 1.3 like ecosystem is here the
old way of thinking of apps like how do
you put it all together and initially
that's what discovered meteor does if
you buy that course but he was saying
like that's a huge undertaking it is so
here's a little index of what you're
gonna get yeah well in you know you're
in this awkward position now why Tom
works for mdg and he's primarily working
on the guides but he's also authors of
discover meeting so interesting I
totally didn't put those two together
though times like a full-time
documentary and he's also writing like a
paid
look as well so yes uh there's there's a
slight I don't know if it's a direct
conflict of interest but there's
something there like I've I've had some
walls Sasha and they're trying to figure
out the best way to do it and does it
make sense to upgrade the book series
for 1.3 etc etc like it these are the
same things I struggle with you know do
i redo a series like my my master meteor
series is it worth it do people care it
seems like a lot of people care from
what i've seen so yeah well and like
this is really interesting for their
like business plan because before the
guide when one point no came out oh my
gosh there's a huge push from mdg to get
people on discover meteor you know and
they had the free day I remember I mean
this was like massive stuff now that the
guides out md I don't see em DG ever
supporting like discover meteor like
they point everyone to the guide or its
tutorials like they got their own
resources now so does that affect the
man a little bit uh yeah yeah oh yeah it
really is like there's a lot to think
about here but I think the article
itself is really great if nothing else
like he's kind of giving you the links
on where to go learn about all the
different topics that you may care about
in regards to 1.3 like obviously we've
talked about data loading in the past on
this show and the different options that
are there like create container or react
composer tracker react and now there's
tracker doc component which came out
this week as well oh oh that's options
uh but you know he highlights all that
and kind of shows you like this is where
you're going to do your meteor subscribe
any links to the different areas where
you can kind of learn about it so like
it's not the end all be all like telling
you how to do everything like the book
might be but it's definitely a
collection of links it's almost like an
outline I think for him to go back and
rewrite the book more than anything yeah
it's really valuable I was going to say
it really is reminiscent of the book
where when I got the original Discoverer
meteor book I really enjoyed it gave me
those little tidbit
information that I needed from an
experienced developer and their point of
view and this is what this article does
too now it breaks it down and there was
a few things that like I found
interesting especially at the forum
section you know like that's always
something that we're going to be talking
about going forward and then you know he
had a whole section dedicated to state
mmm which you know before when in the
past was meteor like it was just like
not really talked about that much yeah
reactive are came later and now we have
the whole thing with redox flex and and
now state management is huge so it was
good to see that in there yeah
definitely definitely yeah I've had some
fun like playing around with local
client side collections only to manage
some stay but yeah it kind of links all
the different options and some of it I
mean like you know that the testing was
definitely there's just a punt right
hehe links to the section on testing in
the meeting at itself um III definitely
you know I think there's there's good
stuff in here like most people don't
even know like this week also react
account you I came out from well let's
make sure I get the name right studio
interact which is where Tim Braden works
and it's been pretty awesome to watch
because you know he he was putting stuff
together and I was like hey I've got
some code I was thinking about
extracting and there's been this
conversation going back and forth in
this face dojo slack and you know it's
been awesome to see that thing kind of
come together and people in that room
we're all working together on that and
so like Nova is already switched over to
use react counts you I so I've been able
to play with that and was able to I
don't know give some code for them to
look at so the social account stuffs in
there now
so yeah it's really awesome I do that
that's that's pointed out in this
article as well yeah yeah I noticed that
too I was like wow so this is like
really fresh this article super fresh
like go to the second yeah seriously as
of this week it's outdated as of the
time you hear this it's already outdated
even if you've been following 1.3 this
is a quick enough read that and it has
like that one or two valuable things
that you might not know about where I
recommend it to everyone to like go
through and check it out do a quick skim
of it it's a great story book haha tell
us about react storybook been so another
instance of the air noda robot cat fired
up and this one was very creative so and
it came up with this this newly like
repo called react storybook it's like
what is this so essentially what you can
do is you could add this to your project
and then go and fire it up in the UI and
you can essentially make a isolated
component react component eat it some
state and be able to play around with it
in the browser pass it around other
people be able to isolate that like a
new component and have people test it
and it's pretty neat yeah yeah so I
think the goal here is the isolation
right yeah the ability to create that
component sans any other piece of your
application being there and so I think
about where this would be useful like
developing a video player right and
something like that like developing that
video player component and applying some
styling there and making sure it looks
good on its own and react storybook and
then bring that back in and just
applying putting it into your full app
and applying the data like the props
correctly and we think should work it
and no no I like this I think it's fun
it is fun it goes past like just
isolating but since its integrated with
your current app all of a sudden now you
can import everything that's already in
your app yes CSS other components that
you got and that's huge as well and that
that's this is why you is messy because
it is a messy situation and this is like
giving you all the tools that you need
all the resources that you need that are
already in the app you don't need to
recreate it but yet it's giving you that
isolation that you don't wish you had so
it's it's really combining things in a
unique way where it's making developing
for the UI a lot smoother just a more
enjoyable experience I think that's how
he framed it he framed it correctly at
the beginning of the of the article yeah
I am really stoked to try this out I
wanted to try this out before our show I
just didn't have the time to do it yeah
I'm very excited to see this yeah I
think so the interesting thing we were
talking about like before we got into
the stories was last night there was a
meteor dev night and I know where maybe
a little meteor heavy focus here on the
podcast oh um we do talk about other
other things as well and like storybook
react storybook is it's just node right
there's there's no like it's using I
think it's using what pack it's it's not
really dependent on meteor you can use
it with meteor you can use it with
Express you use with anything you want
and it'll just work and then last night
um mdg kind of announced a similar tool
I thought it was was funny they they
kind of released on the same day um but
it so they released chromatic and that
was an mdg yeah yeah oh yeah and I guess
um I think Dom gave a talk and it
included some of this they use this to
develop their react interface for Galaxy
itself and you know that the interesting
thing is like
it's an MV g package and so you add the
package to your app and then you can
start using chromatic and they've got
this thing called specs I didn't see the
talk and there whoa i'm super-interested
out yeah they're the readme is like it
could be better um it's not oh I'll give
props to air nota for firing up one of
the other BOTS to get better dogs um but
it is seriously impressive guys like
like we talked about like they're not a
bot and we're not like trying to like
this is like all one hundred percent
professional respect when we say that
was for ya yeah well it's be fair like
most people don't realize Khedira's like
a five person company too so it's not
all just him but he does quite a bit
yeah um but yeah so like just got
released and you can create components I
like using it and yeah I don't know I
still don't get the the specs piece of
it but it's it's interesting because oh
wow yeah I didn't even look at this they
have a bunch of components that you can
install to like mdg animations mdg
buttons that they're using so oh it's
probably like if you're looking at this
and you're a meteor fan it's probably
worth looking at but obviously like it's
gonna be focused meteor ecosystem for
the time being so I'm guessing this is
like Dom's project mm-hmm he's heading
that up mmm I'm so blown oh I'm pretty
interesting about Tom does good stuff so
actually um think so this is you don't
think you there's good stuff no no I
don't think it's his project really it
sounded just the word animation sounds
and again he's very much focused on you
x z hen yeah uh was the committer and
he's got at least of all the commits
maybe dom created it i don't know i love
plaque thickens I should have researched
us more before we on here sorry guys man
i am totally the dive into this later
okay cool so
I mean you know if you're if you're
looking for something like this I know
Phil from respond Lee gave a talk a
while back about you I harness was kind
of a similar idea just an isolated
environment for I think for people to
build stuff like I I see this being
interesting like working with Amanda you
know she was trying to build components
and doing her best to try to hook it all
up correctly and this might be much more
user-friendly for her to work with so
absolutely and then also just testing so
if you notice on this you're able to
toggle state right away and that's the
thing with you I like okay you got a
full-blown developed you I on there how
do we test you why yeah we go in there
we try to remember all the different
states that something different happens
well here you can just like heaven on
side and click it yeah I'd almost be
interested to see like enzyme testing
built into this or something you know it
could be interesting to I'll to play
with it though very correct it up
clean with something playing yeah
playing with your food I don't know I'm
a little a little hobby that turned into
something amazing yeah I don't know if
it was amazing but I definitely spent a
lot of time on it uh yes so building
your own meteor galaxy hosting setup
digital ocean digital ocean style yes
and I guess disclaimer they are they are
a sponsor of this show we love them and
you know honestly like I reached out to
them because I've had such a great
experience hosting my own meteor apps
right and so like there's this weird get
started testing there's another article
have comparing like modulus and Heroku
and I mentioned digital ocean at the end
and like the site just always stated
digitalocean cratered it after I wrote
that article and I never really anywhere
else call I remember that yeah it was a
while ago I I really wanted to get into
like how do i how do i scale out my
setup bigger
and it turns out like some of the things
media is really terrible at is when
there's any kind of blocking operation
going on a node like it degrades the
experience for everyone that's connected
and so it turns out like uploading a
post on traitor or pulling in you know
subscriptions or any of that kind of
stuff like that's all blocking and so if
you came along and some other guy came
along at the same time and loaded up
crater-like you would get your data
first but he'd sit there spinning
waiting for the page and so that is
sub-optimal and so what you really want
to do is try to load balance that across
multiple app servers because if you come
along and you block on server1 and she
comes along and and hits server to like
you're gonna end up both getting a
slightly better experience like you may
get a little you know lag coming out of
the database because you're both trying
to get to sync data but you're not like
blocking in both places and so it turned
out that a lot of times people would run
a blocking operation you don't realize
it and it kind of degrades the
experience for everyone else is
connected so having two plus servers
means you you're less likely to kind of
see or hit that problem hmm interesting
yeah very cool yeah so I I set out to
create something that would allow me to
do that easily just using mop and using
digital ocean and I still have one more
piece of this article to write so if you
look on there I've got the the kind of
the like your graphic record the info
graphic that shows you how everything's
working knit the pre-rendered piece has
not been documented yet but everything
else should be documented up to this
point and for the sake of argument since
we're you know using comparing this to
galaxy I use compose I use for the other
articles well they do a great job like
hosting the database and galaxy doesn't
offer a database yet so it's crap picked
up there anybody got easy so you go over
firing up the server
is getting them set up you have load
balancing in there you have cpn in there
you have SSL supportable yeah this is a
pretty amazing yeah and I put all this
at the top of the article like links to
setting up ssl and CDN which you know
I've kind of been working on honestly
you can run wrap all this into a book
yeah I initially thought about doing
that but yeah like I'm not sure it's
with my timer or Riley call this man up
black and man they have terrible terms I
talked to them about writing a book is
not good um anyway uh so I think you
know I I don't really go over mop itself
an article I feel like plenty of people
written that article I'm up yeah he's
off like just go look at that and um I'm
actually in the process of switching the
whole thing to my back so it'll be using
docker under the hood too but um I don't
know like this is it actually turned out
to not be that hard right and so a lot
of people talk about sticky sessions
like how does that work and do I need it
so I kind of cover a lot of that like
here's why you need it and then like it
really was just a one liner in engine X
to say IP hash and basically it looks at
the IP coming in right and it'll run an
algorithm and then send you to that
server and it as long as you stay on
that same IP next time you come in
you'll end up on that same server so
that's kind of important yes have you do
you think like this is more like just
recanting your memories of being in the
trenches and learning things as you go
optimizing as needed because I know like
this has been like a long time coming
yeah yeah I like most of this was done
in december and so yeah a lot of it was
like I just went in and collected a
bunch of links that I've linked to an
article that show you how to do the
different things like custom compiling
your engine x4 in boone two and so like
you still use the package that's out
there but then you can custom compile it
and then install that package so you get
like all the upstart scripts and that
kind of stuff
um it was a lot of that and frankly like
that's probably where a lot of my blog
post come from it's like I've done a
thing and I'm gonna tell you how I did a
thing like it's not necessarily I I talk
about things that I'm doing for clients
or for myself in some way not
necessarily just some tutorial I just
sat down and decided like want to write
a tutorial well it's not really my style
I try to teach from experience I guess
and that's huge like there's there needs
to be more of that because really
quickly everyone has experienced where
there's just a bunch of beginner
tutorials out there where do you get
goat for like the medium and advanced
levels so and that's why i always
appreciate about what you put together
at the same time you talk at the level
that anyone can understand you so yeah I
try to that's always been I don't know I
think a strength of mine I don't I think
I'm like even before I started
programming I remember getting hired and
they said one of the things they really
enjoyed when they hired me at Avon was
the fact that I could relate to someone
who didn't necessarily understand tech
stuff and explain it in a way that they
could start to grasp the concepts so and
I think a lot of that is just like don't
put too much jargon and what you're
saying you know and then find a good way
to compare it to something that makes
sense to them ah yeah no no no I hey I
once had a speech teacher that handed
out a book that it was like some like
learn a new advanced word every day and
you have to then find what that word
means and used it like use it like 50
times a day that was the goal and then
can create and you could tell this guy
pride himself on that because no one
knew what he was talking about all the
time because he was using all these
fancy words and it was just like yeah
yeah any who can talk about fancy words
let's listen about a tutorial cool so
the meteor chef came out with an article
that really has been
one that's been needing to like come out
which is react router basics yeah and uh
just like to circle back really quick to
give some context in the study plan for
1.3 that Sasha had grief put together
that we talked about him mention react
rammer he didn't he he said he said go
ahead and use flow router and and I
would have to I really like flow router
I really like flow wrapper but I really
like the utility of reactor outer itself
and so the thing is other it's a
different paradigm on how you make
routes with react router so with flow
router and iron Robert good kind of like
pick up and like get going with either
one right like we learned iron-router
first floor Robert came out yet oh I
totally get this boom well to me it
makes more sense right when i hit a
route there's a component that i want to
render and that's really what react
routers doing yes and go low router
though you could use it with blaze you
can react right and you can choose to
mount something or you can choose to
just run some javascript code like
there's no reason like it actually has a
little more flexibility server-side
rendering is a lot easier but it is but
it's possible with react router as well
yes it is possible and like you were
saying at the beginning everything's
through a component and that's what is
like a little bit of a shift but if
you're going to be developing everything
in react this is actually this is
actually where you want to work in you
want it you want to have something this
flexible and built like a component you
would you then have all the tools that
you have in react disposable to you in
this component as well it's just going
to get you going a whole lot more
helping you with the edge cases now this
is a basic overview of reactor outer so
what I mean by basic is they have a
really simple route they have navigation
they have a navigation component on how
you trigger routes and
then what was the last thing that he had
Oh layouts and there's one more why am I
trying to blank here sorry parameters
passing through parameters but he
doesn't get into authentication um and I
don't know that that is something that
should be covered in a basic router
tutorial though I agree hi one hundred
percent agree this is this is a great
basic article and the reason why though
I want to emphasize basic is because you
go out and you start using this tutorial
you're going to hit a wall right away
and any app that you're making pretty
much one when you need to have
authentication integration in there and
punch over things he does cover
conditional routing with a 404 something
not available so this will this is
definitely like a great like first step
to understanding react router and in
typical Ryan fashion mr. meteor shower
chef himself to the great job writing
the detailed explanation of this
tutorial discuss stuff I like how he
shares a snippet and then he breaks down
everything in a snippet right book right
below it like in amazing detail yeah
yeah yeah it's good stuff I I've
actually been i think the I've got a
project I'm starting this weekend that I
think manase reactor out or four and you
know my thoughts here or I think there's
a smart team of people working on react
router and they're shipping stuff at a
faster rate than you know say other
options out on the market and I think
that's a similar reason people look at
flow router instead of iron-router now
which was funny cuz I saw your tweet
about what ninety-four percent of people
are still using iron-router it was may
be biased like we just haven't gotten a
lot of flow rather people to put in
there
thank you you're calm or whatever that
you are a well and so if you I'm on NPM
right now I'm gonna go to react router
like react routers numbers totally like
overshadow any numbers at iron Robert
and flutters have gotten right and I you
know I think beyond that the
reactivities just bigger than the meteor
community is which theoretically means
that you know this is a better tested in
the wild package then this is really
anything else that you might be able to
download and use so my thought process
why I want to give it a try and I don't
know look at listen to these numbers
almost almost 600,000 downloads in the
last month only 15 open gitcha github
issues yeah amazing yeah that it that is
amazing like that's at estimates Ryan
Florence I think his work oh so and you
know I'm kind of curious now to look at
flow router has 25,000 downloads so I
round red yeah that's what 396 thousand
react router did 26,000 yesterday just
for the day it's had more daily
downloads of them flow router ever which
is interesting I also think so that was
a question as to whether look in here
react account you I is still showing 0
happen stall so we think maybe download
counting is now broken on atmosphere
yeah I've always had an issue with that
I but I've seen counts go up but like to
see that this has been out in the last
week and I know personally I have
installed an application that's running
this code like I know that I should
become as one app install yeah well you
know it's gonna get better the reporting
with census what once it goes to MP MJS
and we get reporting from them
instead of this fear which is you know I
i also found it funny like there was
some conversation that happened in the
slack chat room around how how this all
works as we were talking about it and
like atmosphere is really just a data
informational site it doesn't do
anything it doesn't host anything it
just like allows you to browse a bunch
of information that they've gleaned off
of i think it's called troposphere yeah
you're you're telling him about that cuz
ya so we got i did a lot of research and
studying i had an article i don't think
i ever wrote it about how the package
system works well i don't know if it's
worth writing now because I mean this
thing will be dead in nine months or
whatever i'm talking about reporting
installs and and everything did you
listen to transmission 10 i have not yet
no give me the skinny never been running
in like a couple days so i'm interested
in your take on census hmm on that
package did you have a chance to like
pick up on unlike that reporting i know
i haven't looked at anything since i
told you about it we were talking on the
like sharing that forum link and I was
like this is I don't know I feel like
there's not enough alarms may be peaking
crazed like I don't honestly they've
been tracking a lot of information about
your meteor apps for a while so yeah
yeah well you'll really like to show
that yeah yeah I'm gonna go out running
later so make sure to cue it up and take
a listen yeah very cool and you know
that might like increase our analytics a
little bit more unlike packages or what
now I found it really interesting what
Zoltan was talking about with the
atmosphere one of the questions on QA
were you there for his old times Q&amp;amp;A
yesterday one of the guy said hey are
you guys going to be deprecating
atmosphere and old times answer was like
he took a long pause to answer it and so
you could tell like a bunch of stuff was
going on his head yeah but the answer
was like pretty interesting so pretty
much the gist of it is is he sees
atmosphere packages going away
everything going to NPM packages but
atmosphere itself stain so pretty much
like package manager like troposphere
every year said that's going away but
atmosphere staying and it would be a
filtered subset of NPM packages that
were that they're tracking that are just
meteor specific so yeah maybe you put
like meteor colon true in your
package.json and then this is gonna be a
thing to write right you're gonna have
to be like consuming packages coming in
uh and kind of grabbing those IDs and
tracking them I don't know if there's a
way to like use the API to do a search
but yeah but I could see that being
interesting but you know the thing is
like I don't I don't know if this is
true not but to me it doesn't feel like
atmosphere has been touched in over a
year since the purchase happened and a
guy called for mdg to open source it
there's really no reason like I don't
think there's any competitive reason for
them to keep it closed source at this
point like let the community make it
better but yeah I think I wanted I think
they have the story still out on what
they're gonna do is atmosphere there's a
chance in fact that that story still out
over a year later like tells me that
really they've probably made a decision
a non-decision is i don't i'm not sure
yeah they still have a really small team
the percolate people came on board and
right away they integrated them on like
really critical level projects galaxy
yeah they were like the original team
pushing galaxies forward yep yeah and
now Zoltan is is the project a project
lead for you dear yeah so Dom has been
insanely busy with uh with everything Qi
wise over there there's another guy that
came over and then there was Tom right I
think so yeah so it's not like they've
had the time and they're neglecting it
like that but handed over a community I
don't know
like at some point you have to realize
like you're never going to be able to
get the kind of velocity you need out of
the team that you have and you've got to
be able to stream other people and I
think that's a lot of what you're seeing
with them switching to breaking up the
repo and allowing other people in and
that kind of thing like I think it's
just realization that their team like
hiring more people isn't necessarily the
best answer for meteor and for galaxy
because obviously if you're trying to
build a like competent scalable hosting
system like again you don't want to be
supporting 30 people working on this
open-source thing that only accounts for
like let's just say ninety percent of
their business right now but that number
is probably gonna go down and so meteor
itself is just going to be seen as a
cost Center to mdg like supporting
meteor and that's why I think they're
they're becoming more and more okay with
like working with the outside community
mm-hmm absolutely absolutely I am
totally for atmosphere going open source
but after after it pivots there's a
pivot coming it's all time just hit it
just like hinted at it so interesting
yeah you know I gotta watch it okay
alright guys thank you for tuning in
this week and check us out next week
we'll be back Siam's in time uh well i
