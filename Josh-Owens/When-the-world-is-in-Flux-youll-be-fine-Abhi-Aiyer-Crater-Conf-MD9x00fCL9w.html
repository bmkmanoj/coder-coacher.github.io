remote cough given to a live audience in
February 2016 this video was made
possible by sponsors like modulus I oh
ok grow calm and space dojo com if you
would like to find out more information
about upcoming conferences be sure to go
to conf crater on Io and put your email
in the form that pops up in the lower
left corner enjoy the video welcome to
crater cough day 3 we're going to kick
off the day with the talk about flux we
have a bir with us welcome Abby hey guys
you you work at work pop right if I do
yeah awesome so uh I guess I'll turn it
over to you I know you guys are you guys
hiring right now yes we are and i have a
whole slide about work pop so awesome
we're right to that so ok before i start
i want to change my screen sharing
options i I guess looking at myself
looking at myself right now um how do I
do that Josh I don't know what you mean
here but I can change it here like that
whoa yeah trippy I want to I just want
to share one window oh yeah I don't know
that's not super easy to do alright
whatever let's just get on with the show
then yeah hey all right um hey welcome
everybody uh before I start just want to
say thanks to Josh were having me as he
knows I love talking about software I
love talking about product I love
talking about engineering and that's why
I wanted to come on the crater cop this
is awesome and I hope everyone enjoys
this talk my talk is called when the
world is in flux you'll be fine and but
this this talk view just came out of the
the fact that so much in the software
engineering world is changing
right now it's always changing so like
people are really just like scared or
they're like up in disarray because they
don't know where the where this this
boat is headed so before we get into
that I am avi iron I'm a software
engineer at work pop work pop is a is a
job hiring solution for both candidates
and employers were based in Los Angeles
California were live all in Southern
California and soon to be expanding
nationwide we raised a 7.9 million
dollars thrown out that throwing that
out there and we are hiring our app is
made in the meteor Jas and we use
reactions on the front end and we also
do native Android and iOS for our apps
as well a lot of meteor apps are like
Cordova and we we took a new spin and we
wanted to do fully native so we're done
some cool things there if you're not
into meteor it's it's a really good rate
framework and I suggest you take a look
at that okay so let's get into it what's
the problem today there's a huge problem
right and software engineering is always
changing that is the problem everything
is changing every week there's a new
framework every month there's a new
podcast coming out and what do we what
do we do with all this change like just
shoot me seriously shoot me because
every time I learned something it
changes the next day and how am I ever
going to become a master of this if
everything is always changing right
that's how we all feel right now and
this is the issue we face right there
are 14 competing standards right now
someone wants to unify them well now
there's 15 competing standards because
the the communities that we're in have
so many different opinions right uh it's
it's tough right and I just being called
JavaScript fatigue write JavaScript
fatigue look at this there's so many
tools right here babel es6 web pack
mpm react like all these things all
these buzzwords that you need to be
aware of because that's what people
think that you need to know to get a
great job in the software industry if it
is fatigue right so things constantly
change if they're constantly changing
how do we manage complexity right as
software engineers is a great quote from
Steve McConnell you never read code
complete it is such a great book it's
just about how you think about software
process but this great quote is managing
complexity is the most important
technical topic in software development
it's so important this is our job our
job is to manage complicated so
other people don't have to write that
says that's what this really says so
let's talk about architecture that's
what we got to talk about today so
there's two things going on right place
frameworks and there's business logic
right so let's let's talk about let's
talk about business logic first business
logic is the stuff in your application
that is specific to your problem that
you're solving or your business right
for example in work pop our business
logic is about surrounds cool little
functions that help people apply to jobs
help people message candidates all this
stuff that is sold work pop specific
that it has its own structure right it's
not a framework for save but maybe there
could be frameworks built upon it in a
work pop sense right but our business
logic is completely different from the
framework will use we use meteor we use
react we use Redux like we use all these
libraries and frameworks that helped
organize our business logic but to the
problem that I see in other applications
that I that I they look at or other
people's code that I review this concept
is mixed people are putting business
logic in their frameworks right you can
go and see some jQuery spaghetti code
you'll see some Ajax requests in there
there's some buttons toggle
on and off like in the same function
call there's a lot of crazy stuff that
gets mixed and so when frameworks change
you get this you say this right ah
frameworks always change FAC and yeah
that's all I can say about that
frameworks are always going to change so
let's get into the solutions let's stop
complaining for a bit i think i
complained a lot let's uh let's get into
what we can do ok so i'm always about
actions actions are everything so this
is the one thing that my mentor has
always taught me methods / results how
you do something is more important than
the outcome right this is why a lot of
these frameworks get us like so caught
up is because we always worrying about
what the framework can do for us at the
outcome meteor solve this great problem
of you know having database everywhere
right the data on the client and server
are synced but there's no there was no
like understanding of like maintainable
patterns to do this type of work right
and so when things change on you you
kind of lost right you you're worried
about what this thing could have done
rather than how it did it so at work pop
and personally I advise you know you
should write in maintain patterns okay
so that's some things that maybe you and
your team decide that are that are good
for you you know like things that you
all can get around so your code starts
looking the same comprehending the same
it's great you should d couple your
systems right if you have a complicated
system that you know literally is it
different pieces that are you just put
in a monolith d couple that a good
example of that is microservices that's
a great buzzword right but it's really
decoupling a huge system into really
like like understandable chunks
and just understand every piece of Cody
right in a system or you know in the
front end or whatever if they're all
cogs in a machine right we need to think
about how we do things overall that's
how the application is going to be built
the application is the machine and the
things that we build our the cogs in
that machine and as a developer you are
responsible for making the cogs turn so
how you do stuff is way more important
than the result all right so let's get
into the design patterns it's enough
philosophy like there's I didn't create
design patterns like the gang of core
did and there's a great book by audio
smonny called JavaScript design patterns
and since we're all JavaScript
developers I hope you've read that book
but in case you haven't like two
patterns we use that work pops or really
just make us develop at high speed is
one is the command pattern right so the
command pattern is a really interesting
pattern because it allows you to
separate your response to those
responsibilities between code right it
really has a delegation type a type I
don't know how to explain it really it's
like you're you have a couple objects
that are delegating actions to other
things and this is really at the root of
flux like flux the architecture from
facebook this is the root of flux right
here so let's get into an example right
um let's say you're running a grocery
store okay and this grocery store has a
store manager right and we would
represent that store manager as an
object that has double methods right you
can request an inventory lists you can
buy inventory you can restock shelves
and you know they do there certain
things and this is this is a logical way
to approach representing a store manager
Walt why is this bad like what is wrong
with this right we
this store manager logically has all the
methods methods he could do right
logically everything is here what is
wrong with this thing hmm let's think
about this if the core API changes about
a store manager like he got a promotion
and he can do more things like instead
of buying inventory for him buying
inventory actually means maybe clicking
a button on his computer instead of
having to go to the store right the API
has changed underneath so anyway
anywhere we place the store manager and
his responsibilities we have to go
modify right and maybe we have maybe
we've mutated things here and there that
we we don't have the control over
writing test helps but doesn't like you
can write as many tests as you want but
if you break the API you're gonna have
to fix the test so i think my my advice
is to abstract the api away from like
from these interfaces so the command
pattern what you do is you have this
store manager and there are certain
tasks to be done right by inventory is
one of them right or you know request
the inventory list these are actions
that a store manager could do right it
doesn't mean that he has to do them or
it doesn't mean that the janitor
couldn't buy inventory it's just
something that it's just an action that
a object can do and the great thing
about that is you register these actions
to like a like a manager like lists like
like what like though what actions can
possibly be done and the store manager
can then execute those right and this is
kind of like flux right here you can
start seeing that where you have some
type of object dispatching some action
with parameters and then under the
underlying functions get called the
great thing about this is we can get
into some flux right so this is some
flux right here right
I work at costco i got my costco
dispatcher and a dispatcher is something
that sends messages it's like an event
bus kind of and there's a concept in
flux called a store right and good thing
we're talking about costco it's a really
big store we have this thing called the
TV store and the TV store here it has an
item called the TV it's very simple
right and like when you want to like
select the TV to buy right you would
dispatch some some action and this is
the signature here costco dispatcher
dispatch right this is the dispatcher
instance we're going to send some action
type this in this case I just said item
update a lot of you might be like
cringing at the fact that there are some
open strings here I I did too like
putting strings out like constants like
that like kind of like it seems kind of
archaic right but after you get used to
it and understand that these are
serializable strings that you like or
human readable that you can understand
you can start making some emails or
something that to help manage this
complexity but then you can have very
descriptive actions right I'm item
update to be honest I'm sorry guys
that's a shitty that's a shitty name for
an action I probably should have said
like update or like select the TV you
know something very descriptive so if
any other developer came and worked with
me they would not think I'm some guy who
speaks some random language right like
literally it's as descriptive as you can
and you know as as brief as you can and
that conveys a lot it conveys what is
going on you know note that we haven't
done any any business logic yet we have
not done anything yet so our selected
item that's a Samsung television I heard
it's a good TV and that's the whole
dispatch process that's the command
pattern that's our instance dispatching
something now we have to actually talk
about business logic here right well the
business logic gets registered to the
dispatcher rights whenever the
dispatcher gets some serializable action
it's going to do something with it right
and in vanilla clucks what you do is you
register business logic functions
whatever would have you to the
dispatchers so it knows when it gets
certain certain actions that it'll do
that and that's very reminiscent of the
command pattern right there as well so
that's some flux okay I could have gone
deeper but we have a lot to cover so
we're going to keep going let's talk
about readouts redux is really blowing
up right now and I fallen in love with
it and there's a lot of haters out there
that's okay but I love read ups and I'll
tell you why at work pop today or before
Redux we were using this like a
front-end framework called blaze with
had had no structure for client-side
data management seriously like it was it
was the wild wild west they didn't tell
us what to do which is okay and allows
you to make your own opinions and stuff
like but in reality it be nice to follow
some type of guidelines right and you
don't want competing architectures the
great thing about flux in general is it
stirred a bunch of different libraries
to achieve the same problem and they
solve these problems in different ways
but people are getting fatigued by that
right the great thing about Redux is it
seems to have been getting so much heat
in a good way that is starting to become
a de facto solution so if you guys are
interested in doing things the flux way
i really i really suggest you start with
redux you know and you probably will
just end with redux even peep hunt on
github he has this like learn react like
a couple steps to learn react week i
covered this on a bennett ave show and
he said you should just start with redox
it's the most popular one right now and
it's just go with it because that's what
the most people are going to be doing so
that's my advice take it take it take it
as you take take it whatever just take
it so let's we'll get into three decks
um
Redux flips this command pattern or even
a command pattern and flux a little bit
differently right so before let's look
at this flux example before we headed
dispatcher and a store and in redux we
just have a store and you really don't
know what's be where's the dispatcher at
that's because there is no dispatcher in
Redux redux handles things a little
actually a completely completely
different than a traditional flux
dispatcher set up right there is no
dispatcher there is no registration of
functions to the dispatcher there are no
mutations in the dispatch process and
let me explain why I'm going to go
through this example just so you can
visualize this just start you know look
at the picture and stuff so these two
gray bubbles like could confuse you
because usually they would be like
client versus server this is actually
though all on the client right the
bottom gray a rectangle thing that's the
UI layer all right this is the UI and
then this thing called the provider okay
I'll come back to that so the top here
is the I would is the Redux layer if
this is the state management layer okay
and we have this thing called the store
and let's start at the store the store
is where your client side state is you
can see the state right next to the
storage right here in orange this is the
state of the application okay now now
when you want your UI components
obviously need to know the state of the
application so they can render some
pretty screens to your users so the
store pushes this state down to this
something called the provider the
provider is like a binding to the store
it speaks the stores language and in it
also speaks react right it speaks the
storage language and speaks react so
what it can do is it can
translate what the store said and push
it into react views right and that's
just blue dark blue thing here is called
connect and that is this process layer
right here that says hey I'm speaking
Redux right now and the command connect
is like oh yeah i understand that let me
connect it to the reactor view so you
can see now now we've connected the
state of the store to our react view
okay let's go to this react component
right here now as opposed to having a
dispatch right from our dispatcher what
we're going to do here is we're actually
going to do the same type of dispatch
because I am connected and I speak the
stores language and the store speaks
react I can actually emit a dispatch
from the store itself that's why the
cool thing about Redux is there's no
dispatcher the store takes that
responsibility from dispatcher so that
means you're worrying about less
interfaces right you're only worrying
about this single source of truth that
has multiple responsibilities but the
way it handles these responsibilities is
very elegant actually um so the this
this component is going to dispatch some
arbitrary action at this point who cares
and it's going to go through something
called the middle where's so middlewares
are cool this is like everyone have
scenes anyone who's inches into Redux or
flux has seen this time travel debugger
if the the the react Jas Europe talk
where people saw hot hot time hot
reloading and time travel well what Dan
was showing was the middleware right and
we're enix comes with this thing called
Redux lager and redox lager is great
because it just shows you what
dispatches are happening and what the
result of them were so they hit this
middleware the middleware then says this
is really really intimidating red pills
here called the reducers now these are
super intimidating anybody I've taught
Redux to is so intimidated by these
maybe cuz they're red
I don't know or maybe because they
represent something that's very complex
a reducer in redux is a function and all
it does is it describes the state at the
current moment right and you can see
that there are multiple red ones because
they represent slices of this square the
state if I took a knife and I cut the
state into little pieces what would
happen is you would be and you would end
up with reducers you would end up with
these red things here each responsible
for a single part of the state tree so
let's say I have a state that opens a
modal modal open is the state and modal
closes the other states right if I've
sliced my state tree I would have a
reducer for modal open right or you know
for the modal process and inside this
state it would handle any state change
that could happen to a modal I can be
mortal open modal closed modal
reanimated all these states and once the
action hits this reducer let's say we're
doing the modal open okay the modal open
is hit this reducer it changes the state
the store pushes it back down to the
provider and now the all the components
speak the stores language and they're
they're updated to it so that's it also
a very unidirectional flow right and
that's what flux is all about us or read
X is all about is how can we make the
circle of life makes sense in the life
cycle of our Rui and the great thing
about this is you can see here the UI
the framework the react Janice level is
right here and then split by your
business logic which is here right now
that's awesome separation of concerns
and even within this state management
layer you can split your business logic
even further by splitting the this Redux
stuff with your actual business specific
stuff it's great it's it's and I think
it's the way that we should be
developing things alright let's keep
going
it's just a closer look at redux I
explained to you like verbally what
everything was but this is some code
right so I talked about a reducer the
scary reducers all right you can see the
reducer is just a function it takes a
state it takes an action right the
action is something that the UI
component sent say like hey I want the
modal to be open in this case we did an
initialization right so this is the
whole like people are scared of strings
things still read X does not get away
with that so flux and redux do these
switch switch statements switch
statements aren't all that dad you know
I I got used to them so the reducer is
going to take these actions right so we
have action type we have one for
initialization you have one for update
it's going to take these guys and it's
just going to return a new state you can
see that we haven't mutated anything in
this right we said initialization oh
okay so so some data came in from this
parameter and we're just returning it
nothing was mutated and even here in
this update case we're actually
returning a new object with the data of
the state and the action that data so
we're never mutating anything and the
great thing about that is that's how you
can really always tell the state of the
store at any given time so here we're
just creating a store there's a function
called create store you put in a reducer
bootstraps a store this is a very very
simple example that it like Redux is
very complex I just did a very simple
example so I don't want to fool you and
thinking it's like really easy it has a
learning curve but this is just like
some basic concepts then down here we
have a stateless react component and on
click the store is just dispatching an
update with some data right I gave it
the data sample data and you know what
would happen now is it hit this reducer
it would say okay I'm doing the update
okay great update section okay oh yeah
I'm going to return a new object we
sample data in it cool and then whatever
component was going to be listening to
this I thought I should have put that in
this example but whatever component
should be listening to this will will
then pick it up and then you could have
had that state change that said like hey
right here I should have put that in the
example my bad guys um okay so that's
the observer pattern hopefully most of
you guys aren't sleeping right now
because it's about to get a little
interesting we're talking a little
server side stuff because that was just
crying sighs stuff server side stuff we
could still like take take all this like
separation of concerns and like design
patterns into consideration so I'm going
to tell you guys the story that plagued
work pop for like three months when we
had this let me get back into it so you
just said you were gonna tell us a story
about yet the side effects slide up and
then you're gonna tell us the story
about yes okay thank you for three
months yes i will get into that I hope
everyone's having a good time um okay
cool so here we are okay so I was
telling you guys a story and all these
all these sides sorry guys it's so
embarrassing okay so had this job update
right this playing method it used to
like kill cpu it was super crazy Carl
from okay grow you know this method
because he worked with us man that thing
was crazy like it updated applications
collections it updated the conversations
and all the employers that have to know
these candidates in the in the messages
we had to toggle on certain like logs
that we were having like logging so
there's all these side effects and you
can imagine that server code has a bunch
of side effects in it right when you do
some stuff especially if you're like in
a no sequel world like if you're not
like if you're keeping things very
normalized there's a lot of side effects
to have that go down right and that's
just the nature of you know this is the
nature of software engineering you know
but
we can we can handle this you know we
can totally handle this like how do we
handle this though i don't know let's
find out there's this thing called the
observer pattern and the observer
pattern is a dope pattern it's a it's a
it's a pattern where like an object also
known as the subject it maintains of
lists maintains a list of like observers
that depend on it and like you notify
these observers anytime a state change
happens so for example for us we were
not using this pattern it would have
been very helpful to say ok when a job
is update updated the conversations need
to be aware of it the applications need
to be aware of it and any other person
who cares about this state change needs
to be aware of it and you know that was
just lacking a lack of a lack of
maturity and our engineering team and
there's lack of time and that's also you
know that's all so hard but here's a
like a shitty diagram of like what what
this looks like so you have your subject
here right and you have all these like a
you know methods we say like notify or
you're adding a listener you're removing
this listener and whenever a state
changes you call the observer and the
observer then call its update functions
right this is a very simple diagram I
also did make this diagram my
handwriting is not as bad as this so
just want to let you guys know that
let's do some code then so imagine we
have this system we have this thing
called hooks right essentially the side
effect is a hook of some server hook
right and so we have this thing you have
what's called hook star dad it's just a
function that you give it a call back
right you give it a function that you
wanted to run you give it a name first
right name in a call back and it
registers this name to a global
namespace right unfortunately as global
because this is like a meteor code right
here but if you're here another other
like JavaScript frameworks and stuff
you'd be using like yes
six or to import and export this stuff
but this is an example and so what this
does is it's going to first it's going
to it's going to attach the hook call
back to like the the overall list of
hooks that were we've added right and so
that's that and generally you want to
say like you want to have like one
description of the subject and all the
different types of callbacks right and
I'll get into that next so let's say
here's an implementation right so
imagine you have imagined you have a
like a blogging site where every time
you post something you want to like send
emails with attachments all right like
maybe the post that you just posted to
all your people have like a free coupon
code and you want to send that in an
email to everybody who cares about it
right so what we can do is we don't want
to like want to deal with all these
processes in submitting a post right
when you submit a post you should only
be submitting a post because that's the
best way to have a testable isolated
code right you don't want to submit a
post to do all these different side
effects for you and then when everybody
in your company leaves and new people
come in they're like why the hell is
submit a post actually doing x y&amp;amp;z right
so you want to keep these things
separate and so on the server we have
some API and it's submit suppose it
takes the post it inserts that into the
post collection and then it runs this
cool hook and it runs it asynchronously
so that's another method on that you can
create or you can run it synchronously
but we chose to do run a sink and we
register up here we registers thing
called post submit got a sink and that
means the fur this is our subject so for
every for any time that the hook is run
it's going to take this call back right
and this call back if the post has an
attachment will mutate the attachment
will send an email and we'll return the
post right let's I could have I could
have written five callbacks here all
put them into this hook and any time I
submit a post I'm going to run a sink
all my hooks right here I thought that
was great because I can actually take
this function here at the top I can put
that in a module I can test it
independently from any other process I
can dump it in this hook and now I have
a fully tested hook then I can unit test
this submit post to verify that my hooks
are actually running I think that's a
great that's a great way to deal with
side effects and hoops yeah so that was
it that's it thank you for having me you
guys can follow me on twitter and medium
i write a lot and I I don't tweet as
much but maybe I should start and I'm
pretty active in the meteor community
and react and you ever want to talk to
me you can and that's it alright thanks
hobby okay so we got some questions here
and go over those real quick okay um so
David asked are there any downside to
using a flux architecture yeah okay so
there are some downsides okay so couple
downsides one downside is it completely
changes the way that we've been doing
things right and what does that do to a
team it slows you down you want to be
slow probably not you don't so that's a
big downside if you've been used to
doing things for the last three years
this is going to be a big change for you
and you know unfortunately that is not
realistic for some companies and I
understand that so you shouldn't do it
but if you have like the courage and the
patients and everything you can get
through it for sure um another downside
is you don't know the future of this
pattern right it's kind of it kind of
just came out
like these patterns have been here for
years but this whole flux craze has just
come out and with the talks of all this
fatigue and stuff like where what if
it's changes and then you just spend
your time learning something that
doesn't even matter right so those are
some downsides other downsides are you
have to write a lot of there's a lot of
overhead to do simple things right if I
wanted to do a very simple thing like
like make a button blue in this system
like ideally you just want to mutate
some Dom but using the system you still
have to go through all the the loopholes
and stuff but that's okay because the
hard stuff becomes is the same process
right so if you're doing hard things
it's the same as like it's the the hard
things are done the same way as the easy
things are done so everything's done the
same so there's no like curveballs for
anything yeah hey David that's a good
question nice so Dave asks how does the
flux pattern compared to mantra from
meteor and then he points to a link on
Khedira's github that talks about what's
inside mantra okay have you looked at it
yet of course so where they actually
don't differ that much back back before
mantra or anoda and i both or attempting
to learn redux because we talked about
it and we said like hey we should
probably like let the architectural
decisions happen to other people so we
can focus on the BB ur stuff right or
what we're doing right now in our jobs
and yeah so I was like oh yeah let's
learn redux he actually put out a small
github project called learn redux I
don't think he ever published it though
and it was his learnings and Redux and I
did the same thing I went in my
learnings I actually fell in love with
it and our notice said well there's
there's probably something bigger here
with graph ql
something bigger here in with meteor
data there's something bigger here in
all types of other client data
management so that's where mantra came
out it's like he wants to have a spec
for for him to deal with client side
interaction and you can see there's a
lot of similar things there's actions
their state containers there's there's
the are noted twist on a lot of that and
he is coming from the reasoning of like
what he's done a khedira the map the
amount of state and amount of data he
has all his projects in graph ql like
mantra is very similar to flux but the
way it's different is because it's the
araneta twist exactly it's it's his spin
on things that also very smart and it
speaks meteor like people who speak
meteor that is perfect perfect for
mantra parsley for my company we did not
go that way one because I did I didn't
really see the point of mantra because I
i know i just went things the cookie
cutter way our team is very good at
meteor data now we've done a lot of
optimizations our client side data with
tracker and all that blaze stuff that
was our bottleneck and we resolved that
with flux and it's been great nice so
next
from daniel what kind of projects does
flux make the most sense for to me it
seems odd to add a lot of complexity
know a lot of smart people use it but I
don't understand why okay so flux is
best used for a complex application when
you have multiple tables like multiple
tables of data like jobs collections
like poor pup example work but jobs you
know applications may be a post or blogs
like anything that you have a lot of
data i think flux makes a lot of sense
because you're going to you're going to
want your users to interact with that
data manipulate it displayed in crazy
ways you know whatever the investors
tell you to do right so i think that
that's the best place for flux if you're
making a very small app that you know is
maybe like single even a single page or
something like that it's overkill if
it's a content driven site that's
overkill if you just don't if you just
need to hack something together and push
it the next day for something then don't
use that you don't need the overhead
like if you're trying to accomplish
something in a small time then like you
know yeah it's not for small labs don't
do it if you have a lot of data i would
consider it or use mantra or something
but you need you need an opinion on this
for sure so it is probably smarter to do
like once you find some product market
fit and you're growing your user base
and probably looking to it more would
you say it more you feel it it kind of
evens out your development speed it's
rather than like being fast with blaze
and then starting to slow down as your
app gets bigger it's more even-keeled
and kind of moving in an even pace for
development yeah so i think if i if i
were to like i were to like Claudia like
this you would actually your time would
go up in the beginning
for doing things and then it'll start
going drastically down and then it'll
just even out exactly what you're saying
you'll start getting fast then you'll
hit your plateau because that's just the
way you do things now and your crew you
just start cruising yeah it's great it's
great it's great stability you know it's
especially if you have tight deadlines
and you want your whole team's be
writing something the same way like
you're not in charge of documentation
right there's so much in the community
there's so much to read like it's great
it's great for that but you know some
people some people definitely have their
own opinions which is fine yeah and so I
think we kind of hit on the next
question here too which is is it not
overwhelming projects at the beginning
compared to other patterns like MVC etc
and I feel like maybe any new pattern
probably feels overwhelming because
you're just learning it but then it it's
not nearly the same later yeah so for
Redux in particular Redux is very
overwhelming in the beginner it's almost
like so overwhelming that you just like
you know that mean we're like people
just say eff this like with the papers
flying and they go away like that's it
seriously how it feels like the way I
learned Redux is I literally took my
like my like my computer and I banged my
head against it until I learned it
because that's how hard it was in the
beginning like it was super overwhelming
and I'll be honest with you a lot of
people shooting coat that they
sugar-coated because they want you to
use it like I'll tell you it's hard but
once I had this moment when I woke up
one day and I was like I'm just going to
build something today like oh okay I got
it and Dan's videos helped the videos on
egghead those helped a lot and then
reading the documentation helps a lot
and yeah it got easy and you know I saw
the comment by Ralph here like things I
agree with you like that that that is
true you know like the middleware and
what other people are doing to on top of
it those also make it more overwhelming
because you're not sure exactly what to
learn in the beginning hmm parent
and then NBC to answer Roberts question
I think NBC starts out really awesome
because it's kind of like really logical
in your head like it's kind of because
it's the way we've been doing things for
a long time and it gets it gets complex
down the road when you have so many
different like a different like new
things that you want to add to your app
it gets a little tougher to manage stay
like that yeah all right oh this is
going gavin wants to know would you
recommend redux or flux pattern for a
react native app particularly one that's
looking at react native plus DDP for
data so i have a mix opinion about this
because my company makes native apps and
we love like as sad as this we love to
use rest api's and stuff for our mobile
apps i know it sounds we used to do we
still do DDP right our native apps so
the DDP but our mobile developers are
just so in tune with the rest and making
rest calls that it's it's just tougher
to fight them because they're the ones
building that if they want to do rest
they can but we've been doing that a lot
lately if I were to build a react native
app today like right now I would do a
mixture of both DDP for the actual
server data and I would do Redux for
client data yeah yeah yeah did you did
you see that new speaking of react
native will go a little off script here
but did you see that new IDE yesterday
no which one oh gosh ah no it's it's a
great video it was on deck oh there you
go it was on it was on crater yesterday
it was the like building the uber you I
in five minutes yeah yeah I did see
though is that calling nuclide or
something ah I don't know oh dekho yeah
driver yeah did you should you just take
a look at that like I was super
impressed like that definitely caught my
eye yesterday
Oh not anyway so yeah yeah we answer
that question yeah what are we is this
all flux buzz name for pub/sub passive
you supervising presenter present
presentation model with much mediators
um pub/sub I wouldn't say it's pub/sub
so I wouldn't say that past of you
supervising no not really present your
presentation for sure right present your
presentation for sure Buddhist but i
think the flux buzz name is kind of what
i explained it's like it's the command
pattern so it really is the command
pattern i I didn't invent it so like you
should learn the command pattern because
that's essentially what it is it's
nothing more nothing less it's not
pubsub and it's not fast view
supervising so and Eric Elliott if you
guys know who Eric Elliott is he shares
the same opinion he's a big JavaScript
blogger so he talked about this on i
think the changelog or software
engineering radio one of those podcasts
Eric Elliott was on and he talked about
the command pattern and flux so don't
take my word for it take his these locks
of hair that make him so smart um okay
yeah we gotta do you have a preferred
library for setting enumerated strings
since the actions are a set of strings I
would assume we use some sort of
enumeration rather than just entering
the strings for each action is that is
that the case so there's there's not a
like I'm a preferred library for like in
the open source because that work pop we
created like an enumeration library that
just does WP different you know like
work pop stuff or our string so yeah we
do like we do do the B string
enumerations do not clear empties naked
strings in
or I will come and shoot you just
kidding this next day nice nice um so
Fabio asks if i'm not wrong you use the
Redux store only for the UI state and
keep the domain steht in mini Mongo how
do you use time travel for the mini
Mongo changes yo probably a great
question bro like so it's kind of
complicated but this will we do and it's
just how we do it so when our domain
steht hits our component via get meteor
data in the meteor example we then take
that data and we dispatch an
initialization to our Redux store that
we want to to manage stated and a great
example of this is imagine seeing a list
of form lists of table elements right if
you have a list of table elements you
all got from the server and meteor I
click on one of them to edit that right
i click it I open it it opens up a form
or something right when I open up this
form i dispatched to my Redux store the
data for the form ok now the form has
its data i can start messing around with
it it's not going to update mini Mongo
it's not going to update the server it's
purely in the client I could navigate to
another page and come back it would
still be there if you're not careful
it's kind of like session Josh it it
could creep up on you but you know like
but the difference with session is this
is namespace and the wall session is not
like directly namespace all right up
anyway but so now you can you can then
change all the stuff for your internal
state in the Redux store and you can
time-travel that and that's what we do
to track time travel that also you can
just do you know meteor methods right
you can just get your data from a meteor
method dump it in the store do all your
state changes and time travel that so
hmm interesting alright last question
ah be have you tried relay yet there are
talks that about relay incorporating
good bits from redox since the state of
flux is in flux would it make sense to
wait some more time until dust settles
so relay like okay belay I've answered
this question so many times which is
great I have tried relay it is pretty
awesome right I would compare it I
actually would think the meteor data
experience is better than relay but the
thing it's lacking is graph ql which I
think meteor will resolve pretty soon
but one thing the relay experience is
you're using your writing graph fuel
schemas you have these container
components that then these the data you
get from your graph y server goes into
pretty sweet but for me to grok with my
head around that took a took a while as
opposed to when i learned meteor I was
just like oh yeah pub/sub got my data
put in the UI good to go you know like
it was that great since the state of
flux is in flux I would not I would not
even think that I think the flux library
they can choose is better than no flux
library I don't think you should wait I
think you should always be learning and
you should not be static like don't wait
for relay don't wait for reactive graph
ql just just keep learning stuff and on
the side maybe try these things out if
you don't have the time right now yeah
definitely i would agree with them
that's great advice yeah alright well oh
thank you ah be for giving the talk
answering all these questions really
appreciate you having you on here thanks
man yeah hopefully everyone had a good
time yeah yeah I I learned something so
that's good I see you Ben Strahan I see
