remote cough given to a live audience in
February 2016 this video was made
possible by sponsors like modulus I oh
ok grow calm and space dojo calm if you
would like to find out more information
about upcoming conferences be sure to go
to conf crater on Io and put your email
in the form that pops up in the lower
left corner enjoy the video hey
everybody welcome back to the crater
comp the second talk so today for the
second talk we're going to have Dominic
with us from meteor development group
welcome Dominic hey how's it going hey
so you're going to be talking about
designing for a reactive you i right yes
yeah and so I don't for me like I just I
find it very interesting like there's
definitely like some paradigm shift that
has to happen in order to build a real
time you I and so with a lot of people
using meteor and react and those kinds
of things I thought it would be really
interesting to to get a talk on the
topic so i will turn it over to you and
we'll take Q&amp;amp;A at the end so have at it
awesome hey uh she wanted to say thanks
Thank You Josh for putting this on and
inviting me and thanks everyone for
being here so let's get started react
angular blaze ember mithril riot view so
you finally wrap your head around
reactive us in testing your apps are
snappy and feel alive with activity but
now your app is in production there are
thousands of folks using your product in
doubt as flooding
this is causing the you are to update so
fast users can't tell what's happening
layouts are breaking trying to track
down the cause of UI changes is your
personal Everest you thought you knew
how to use reactive you eyes but you
don't simply knowing the technology
isn't enough you need to design
specifically for reactive us in this
talk we're going to examine some common
UI challenges and present set of
principles that serve as the basis of an
approach to reactive you is my name is
Dominic nuin I'm a product designer at
media focusing on developer experience
before meteor I founded a software
engineering company called percolates
video we specialize in designing and
engineering real-time user experiences
you might be familiar with my work if
you've taken galaxy atmosphere or meters
of example apps for test drive I know a
little bit about real-time your eyes so
what is designing for real-time matter
the reigning web paradigm since the
genesis of the browser has been request
response so I'm going to views a web
page sends a request to a content server
and the server receives the request and
responds with the page this constraint
results in linear experiences punctuated
by page refreshes while it's perfect for
the irit for the Internet's original
intent of young content like static
documents we've actually come a long way
since then our technology and
capabilities have evolved in 2016 we
want the web to do more for instance we
wanted to tell us what to eat to guide
us to our next destination even to
adjust the temperature of our own homes
we expect apps to be connected and react
to changes in the system prior to real
time the provenance of actions was clear
they could be attributed to a single
user and confirmed with the page refresh
now add several users to the system who
act on the same data and whose interface
is updated reactively imagine the
difficulty in communicating system logic
to the end user when interface changes
in front of someone despite them not
doing anything they're in there in
action there's on an opportunity for
distrust to take hold in the real-time
world our challenges are not only to
build delightful features but to
translate complexity and illuminate
causation translation is to express the
sense of words in another language it is
expressing the complexity within our
apps in a way that is natural and easy
to understand in practice it's just
reassuring users that we have registered
their actions and that something is
happening causation is the relationship
between cause and effect our goal is to
eliminate relationships and data which
just means means to show how two data
points can lead to a new insight you can
harness the power of real-time and
reactive you is to deliver
next-generation experiences however
creating great apps doesn't just come
from having the ability but using that
ability well three principles guide how
we approach the real time these data
where expect change and preserve context
let's talk about being state aware the
user should know the state of the system
at all times our world is chaotic
frameworks like governments machines and
apps provides structure to unpredictable
systems our goal when creating real time
apps is to communicate that the world
inside of our apps our digital world is
in fact ordered so let's see some
concrete examples
connection status connection dropouts
occur frequently you're on the subway
you're on a bus go under a bridge let's
take a look at different ways to handle
this most apps don't notify you when the
connection is spotty when a user submits
actions without an active connection
it's liable to be lost even with
technology like optimistic UI there are
countless edge cases where the data may
not make it back to the server be state
aware by communicating the factors
outside of the apps control that could
lead to unexpected results for the user
loading users often wait on content due
to low bandwidth or wait II assets be
proactive by indicating that the system
is processing their actions and loading
new information this is a real life
example from a product that I've been
working on called galaxy we've were
watching a user scale a test app by
adding a new container to their
deployment when the container count
changes a progress bar appears so that
users have an idea that the system is
acting on their behalf
confirmation show that the app has
empathy for user goals many apps suffer
from under communication of state for
instance when a user makes a change say
deleting an item from a list they'd like
to know if it was successful show that
your your app is listening and cares
about the user by responding to their
actions this example choking showcases a
user flow that has both a loading
indicator and a confirmation message
when the user submits the support forum
they are notified that the request is in
progress upon submission a confirmation
notification reassures the user that the
request is in safe hands the second
principle expect change the product
should communicate what will happen when
a user acts surprises are terrifying
consider the mechanical precision of an
automobile surprises in that system are
flat tires and engine smokes and engine
smoke like a car a nap translates
immense machine effort in a
user-friendly manner unlike the car the
digital medium our apps allow us to
anticipate and inform users of change
communicating results is one way to set
expectations when drastic state changes
are possible foreshadow the results of
actions a common mistake in the design
of reactive view is is to render
interfaces without notifying the user
this leads to experiences that are
unpredictable
giving users opportunities to process
what will happen prevents surprises
skeleton templates Skelton templates
make an appt feel more responsive by
foreshadowing layout in many cases
real-time apps defer rendering layout to
all relevant data has arrived however
since the templates of isomorphic gaps
are already on the client we can show a
skeleton layout that foreshadows new
screens and sets the expectation that
data will fill empty spaces so what do
these skeletons templates look like in
the wild here we have an activity feed
when data has not yet loaded we show an
intermediate skeleton layout it's the
gray when data hydrates the component we
replace the placeholder content with
real content
what apply it at the page level instead
of at the component level layouts are
able to be rendered instantly
the final principle preserving context
the user should know where the content
comes from and where it belongs since we
can't possibly see or even consume
what's happening at all times in real
time apps it's important that we
establish and reinforce a sense of space
where elements exist relative to each
other doing so means that we create
landmarks in our apps that users can
rely on to get back to get their
bearings consistent placement new
content should appear in a predictable
location let's take a look reactive apps
can determine where items should be
placed through diffing however this
isn't always intuitive because new items
may not appear in the same place on the
example on the Left you'll see that new
items have entered the list at various
locations you can get users a couple get
users are customed to navigate into key
points in your app to find what they
they're looking for new items in the
example on the right only appear at the
top maintain bearings sometimes things
just don't appear in predictable
locations whether it's by sort order or
any number of things a classic example
is adding items to a list sorted by item
title reactively you can preserve
context by articulating state changes
that do not appear in predictable
locations what that just means is in in
adding animation or adding a transition
you can help by a user understand
we're an item is coming from and where
it belongs animation in this case can be
used to great effect to communicate
where new content is loading and slowing
an interaction so slowing the animation
can result in click and greater clarity
save scroll position when moving back
and forth between distinct screens we
often forget to preserve context by
saving a user's position ensuring that
users return to the same scroll position
preserves the continuity of the
experience and saves time users should
be accomplishing their goals not trying
to trace where they came from in your
information architecture
sometimes technology like reactive us
can blind us to the fact that we're
creating software for real people and
not just making something cool these
principles serve as the foundational our
foundational when crafting crafting
reactive us so I encourage all creators
and all app builders to discover what
works for them for a head start try
these three be state aware expect change
and preserve context so we'll have an
extended Q&amp;amp;A session after this thank
you so much for viewing and going
through the the reactive UI design
principles with me you can say hello on
twitter at dom yang let's take some
questions all right thanks Dominic that
was a good talk so um I'm gonna I'm
gonna interject my own question here um
you know you talked a little bit about
like saving not saving your place but
like using animation to kind of handle
handle like keeping like bringing in a
new item right that's sorted and maybe
in the middle of a list or something
probably one of the the biggest things
that I dealt with it we built a a nap
what are you like everybody gets on the
page and they do live voting and we were
sorting the list by you know how many
votes ahead and so yeah you know what
what's like everybody got in there and
you're like okay go and like all the
voting would start happening and like
everything was just like jumping all
over the page like how would you manage
something like that like it's not
necessarily a new item coming into play
but you know that list is getting
restored all the time
absolutely that's a really common one
and the the problem with let's add them
is jumping around and say something like
a leaderboard is that it's possible that
you as a user will accidentally click
something that you didn't mean to click
because the u.s. reactively changed so
often and that gives i would consider
setting a timeout so like a 10
millisecond delay before items were
automatically sorted I say or so that
that's that might be one at one possible
solution another possible solution is
actually slowing down that leaderboard
sorting experience by triggering by
having the user manually trigger like an
update so this is one of those cases
where request response is actually kind
of useful because you can that you can
get a sense of position and have the
opportunity to do submit a vote hmm I
see yeah so I think kind of wait you're
suggesting is more like the Twitter like
you have five new tweets and then they
click that and then like it would update
the voting essentially like hey the
voting numbers have changed would you
like us to resource yeah kind of thing
ok because up in a very large then this
there's this list items will be changing
sort order all the time like many times
a sec cool alright so let's take some of
the other questions that actually had
votes since I just interjected my own
okay do you use any framework sure
libraries to help build out the real
reactive layouts like galaxy or
atmosphere ah we pretty much have no bit
but this the short answer is no we've
had to build out a lot of this stuff for
galaxy and atmosphere however the
principles that we
is can be applied to any reactive you
you I our rainy reactive you layer so
for instance and I know in meteor you
can assign or you can identify when data
has loaded and when it hasn't loaded so
you can start building your like
skeleton templates for instance just on
that if statement on that conditional I
say yeah it makes much and in many cases
I would recommend building integrating
these going to visa recommendations
integrating this these principles at the
frame at the component level rather up
to begin with and then porting them to
to the page level that will get you
pretty far okay all right all right ah
the next question and so before we get
into this question I'll just say like
you know what what what kinds of things
are you working on at MDG right now like
what teams are you part of can you can
you talk about that at all yeah
absolutely uh it's it's no secret we
just haven't we haven't said anything
about it uh I work primarily on galaxy
okay alex is the major focus for us
that's why I have so many examples of
galaxies in action and what we're doing
is the challenges there for reactive you
eyes are deal deal with like containers
and notifying the user the state of
containers out there like container
deployment and since that doesn't that
is subject to change so containers can
go down or or any number of things can
happen when containers they can be
manually scaled we have to reflect that
in the UI so that's it's a big challenge
mmm
yeah it would imagine so mm-hmm all
right uh so I I brought that up not not
because I thought it was secret in
anything but I thought it might be
relevant to answer some of these next
questions because you're not necessarily
like working with reactor blaze like on
those teams kind of pushing that forward
so and again i'm pretty sure like any
answers here like your own answers and
not necessarily representative OMG so
these are my answers not mdgs answers
exactly yes yeah okay so the next
question from Robert is react native the
next big thing combined with meteor to
create iOS and Android apps I know that
we heard from Martin talked about some
of the Cordova updates and then at the
end like he snuck in this little little
bit at the end of meteor night that he
was going to be working on a react
native experiment so maybe you could
talk about some of that uh I am not
super familiar with react native
especially react native in regards to
using it with meteor and to create iOS
and Android apps so short answer is not
sure however I think that the idea
behind react native which is to write a
reactive view layer for iOS is really
cool it's something that iOS doesn't
necessarily have aa as far as i know and
react will allow it to have that yeah
yeah I'm kind of excited like I think it
could be really really interesting
because like the way that react native
actually has a bridge that will output
actual native code rather than like a
web UI wrapped kind of cordova
application seems super interesting to
me even with like the new web view
support coming out within 13 I still
think react native is going to be way
better absolutely i think that there's a
class of
of apps that it makes a lot of sense to
use meteors like inbuilt cordova
integration and those class of abscess
they compete on on coverage meaning how
many how many possible people have
access to those apps so for instance an
educational app that I worked on they
actually competed on the fact that they
had an Android integration or an Android
app an iOS app that was really useful
for our clients to our past clients to
get into schools and sell a solution
that could cover a wide variety of
students and while the solution might
not have been like the perfectly like
smooth it might not have been bodied
like perfectly smooth like animation and
and interactives interaction design it
was able to take them from from 0 to 1
react native is is going to be really
great for the developers who care about
interaction design and who actually
compete on interaction design so think
about a consumer app company for
instance ok all right so I'm gonna so
we're real quick there's one in here
like is react going to replace blaze I'm
going to kind of skip that one I don't
feel like it's super related to the talk
and I think that there's some good stuff
that's coming out of transmission as
well the podcast so what kind of salt
capacitors some screws doing a really
great job with with net transmission
podcast yeah all right uh so do you
think that certain interaction paradigms
like paging are outdated with the rise
of reactive apps
I don't think so i think or reactive
apps build the top the the classic idea
of a paging I don't necessarily think
that's going to go away I think there
are certainly apps that rely more on on
reactivity places thing are and those
apps I would classify as apps that have
like living interfaces and it things
like uber or slack for instance like
most of your interaction with those apps
actually occurs on like one or two
screens however there's there's
certainly like still need for pages for
like the about or the settings or what
have you well I think I think Pete Pete
Corey here was referring to actually
like pagination like you know listing
out a bunch of you know like there's a
hundred items in this list in order to
do 10 per page and you click here to
show 20 through 30 or something
server-side paging I'll click here to
show 20 or 30 uh yeah you know when
you're like browsing through amazon and
like you get to the bottom of the list
and then you click to see the next
screen type of thing yeah do you think
that goes away like do we move more
towards infinite scroll or is there
something else I think that's like a
question it doesn't necessarily have a
ton to do with like reactive apps
however I'll give you an example well it
doesn't have enough time to do with
reactive apps I think it has more to do
with just what type of experience we
want like designers and creators want to
provide for their users but I'll give
you a real example of paging um like
server-side paging in a reactive abso in
galaxy we show a list of 10 10 items and
those 10 items have a bunch of
subscriptions to hydrate entire their
component
these subscriptions render yield yield a
graph like a real time graph of like and
metrics in this case we actually need
paging because without paging the
browser tab just blows up if so we use
paging in this case to limit the UH to
mitigate slow and like non performant
like browser interactions yeah yeah I
would agree with that i mean i think
there's only so much the human mind can
consume and kind of one gulp off the
page so to speak so you know that that
you definitely have to think about that
and like if i put 200 items on the
screen there's no way in the world
anyone's going to be able to to
comprehend that quickly you know and i
think that's the goal of any app is
maybe two to help that comprehension so
yeah i'm reading the comments here i
think a ball does hazard as a really
great one I really hate when people have
to see more and you actually want to see
the last page items if its history based
that's that's a fair point yeah all
right so uh when are some good times to
use animations and transitions
animations and transitions help
articulate state ah so the difference
between 22 states so I'd like to say try
to include them all the time they add to
they smooth out a user experience so
instead of uh I so for instance list
items instead of a bunch of list items
like appearing on the screen
and it causing an instant browser to
reflow animations will will articulate
the 0 like the in and the out of that
node much better and in a much more
intuitive way than just instantly
rendering instantly rendering the Dom
all the time that's the answer or a lot
of time yeah there's a class of things
that but actually warranted so for
instance the most where I find it where
I find the animations and transitions to
be most useful is listed and lists in
general where I found them to be and a
nice to have in an added benefit our
things like when you open an overlay or
when you add a new field in a form okay
all right look looks like we get here
and I made all the things animations are
pretty like animations are pretty easy
though so let's say you and to get them
in there especially with things like on
there's a package in atmosphere called
momentum it's really easy it's like a
dragon druid it's like a one just
install the package and then follow that
the API and there's also plenty of
packages for react that will do it too
funny comments oh really all right so
yeah i'm curious your take on this to
like I've every designers a little bit
different so Robert asked when you have
to create a new UI what are your first
steps from scratch to the final result
are there some kind of techniques to
success for you and then I'll probably
add in here a little bit like I know
that the designer I work with she
usually starts in sketch or sketch yeah
and then she'll move like once that's
been approved she'll move into just
straight HTML so what's that look like
for you oh so this is like a design
process question yeah ah my design
process starts on paper first and then
we move into Photoshop I actually break
out the I know some people combine the
the actual design with the front end
implementation but I've tend not to do
that because i find that manipulating
something on a cannabis is much nicer
and easier and keeps my context only
towards only on that camp that canvas
and then once the final design is
approved we move into into engine into
application engineering in regarding
like building reactive us i first start
with a building small atomic unit so the
smallest component and then continue
building outwards from there to larger
and larger components and finally to to
entire views alright um yeah this is an
interesting one from will how long
should you show you transitions to be
sure you users see them like to use do
you set it to like 50 seconds ah smoke
she wrote an article I actually brought
an article on this ah on the percolating
and the too long didn't read is 150
milliseconds to 350 milliseconds the 150
milliseconds comes from how long the
minimum amount of time it takes up
brains and our are like visual organ the
eyes to actually process moving so
to attend to and notice movement or
attend to and like like understand
movement and 350 milliseconds comes from
this idea that have you ever looked at
Josh have you looked at someone and
you're speaking to them and their eyes
are shifting around as they were like
scanning at Lansky yeah yeahs mother
scanning the page yeah yeah how so so
that's what that's a it's called the
saccade and what that is is it's just
how we like humans like process like
visual information and we process it by
like tracing the outline of an image
with our eyes and we actually shift our
position of our eyes like three times a
second about so three times a second /
one second that's about 13 50
milliseconds so 150th 350 milliseconds
that's how long should should share
transitions to ensure that users see
them mm-hm okay good answer uh yeah
that's that's always interesting right
because like I talked to my wife about
like design and stuff and she talks
about how she went to art school and um
you know they always talk about like
trying to get you to go in a circle and
kind of stay on the page at different
focal points so um its interests I'm
gonna have to read this article when we
get done yeah 150th reconvene yeah all
right good question all right are there
any meteor packages that help delay
using air quotes here updates from
subscriptions but tracking changes at
the same time you know what I'll say
here is that I think there's a
difference you don't necessarily have to
show the changes on the page you know
there's David Burrowes had a great
article and I teaches them in my master
media course where you like you keep
track of a timestamp and then like as
that timestamp as new data comes in
that's newer than the timestamp you just
you do
render that onto the page until they
they hit a link or something and then
you update that timestamp so yeah um
it's kind of my thoughts on it I would
probably defer to you on which meteor
packages tease yeah I don't I don't know
that there's any good package per se but
yeah I think it's just something you'd
handle in the client side when you care
about it if that makes sense yeah it's
it's not super hard I'll try to find
that article and put in the slack chat
room for you guys all right um ok so
Pete asks lots of meteor apps seem to
have a lot of the same flaws data
appearing out of nowhere poor user
notifications etc that make them
immediately stand out as meteor apps do
you think there's anything we the
community or mdg can do to fight this or
is it all on the developer to care about
and address these problems on their own
I think it's we have all the tools that
we we need to provide these user
experiences to our to our customers and
it's just a matter and they're actually
fairly straightforward in terms of like
an implementation so I would say look if
you care about the user experience of
your meteor app the there's plenty of
material out there for you to like
improve it um I don't think anyone like
it makes sense for folks to try to do it
for you ok that's speaking as me Dominic
not reality G yeah yeah well yeah like
maybe maybe there's a guide article
waiting to be written there perhaps but
yeah absolutely Owen the guide um Elijah
you like is completely right it has a it
well I wonder yeah the guide actually
does have a UX section and it it was
written by a my partner on tom coleman
who
so work with me at percolates to do and
it is the most comprehensive source for
ya the patterns and in fact the
documents like almost all be all of
these patterns pretty wonderfully nice
awesome yeah so I would say like Pete
I'll challenge you to take these ideas
that you think or maybe problems and
bring them up in an issue in the guide
and maybe there could be some discussion
around that and we'll see if maybe
there's there's a missing guide section
that could be added which ought to be
super interesting alright so if Aldus
asked how many people should balance
reactive design versus non reactive I
mean does everything have to be reactive
as it has an additional development
costs it's kind of an interesting
question because for me like I do find
that there's times where I don't care if
the data is reactive and yeah meteor
doesn't really have a good idea for that
like maybe a meteor method or something
but I'd be curious to get your thoughts
on that as well in addition to look at
the comment of reactive having an
additional development cost i would say
it has a an additional like performance
cost as well you can't have like so many
active subscriptions and expect your
pages to be performing that's just the
limitations of not mediate not just
meteor but just the technology like
browser technology in general so it the
core of the question is how do you
balance reactive design versus not
reactive I first identify what type of
user experience you want to to offer to
your arm to users if you're building a
leaderboard app it behooves you to to
create a reactive you I if you're
building a Content site you don't need
reactive you I that's just not something
that that really matters that much
however if you're building the comment
section of a content
so things change a little bit there yeah
it mostly reactive kind of comes out of
the box in a lot of these and meteor at
the very least yeah all right so James
baxley oh my gosh this is I keep got
this stupid script that closes slack so
I don't stay in there all day but it
keeps closing in on me huh um okay such
James baxley asks have you run into any
performance issues with you I animations
on Cordova apps I know you guys did some
work on verso and that kind of thing so
maybe maybe I'm speak to that prior to
this recent into the wky view update
Cordova was running a version of WebKit
bed wasn't as performant as say Safari
so because of that we were lucky
animations weren't that great they were
perfectly they were fine for what we
needed them for but we actually had to
limit the scope of animations to provide
a better user experience because the
animations were could be choppy up in
some cases now with WK webview I think
that's coming out and 113 you're able to
have the same browser of the same uh
like browser and iOS as safari the
native Safari up so that kind of solves
many of the the performance like the UI
performance hiccups yeah I agree like my
so we've got an app that's built in
Cordova one of the clients I work with
and they're like super excited for
meteor 13 and the new Cordova stuff
because there's this definitely like
just it's just not quite as performant
yeah but yeah should should be good I'm
excited it's
the league's ahead of what what it was
it's I mean I'm very excited for it
Martin's doing some great work yep ok
here we go um so Pete decided to pull
the AMA and ask how how's it been
working for mdg give us some insight yes
some insight I joined as the first
designer here and my my fears when when
joining were this is an RD company it's
an engine and specific like ang heavy
company and when I got here I realized
and the people here they really support
the design process and but in supporting
the design process it allows for great
work to happen so working in MTG has
been been pretty pretty good that's far
yeah and you you know interestingly
enough you previously worked at yummly
too right yeah yeah so yummy for those
of you who don't know r is a recipe
search engine your its intended for to
index the world's recipes they have a
fantastic mobile app on both iphone and
android so i'm just going to plug my old
company now and it's really well
designed and you can search for the
rarest recipes and also filter by things
like allergies or cuisine whenever you
yeah yeah I actually found it because
they have an apple TV app so you know
maybe that's the next question is when's
mdg you're gonna have like Apple TV app
like platform support built-in probably
never they don't I don't have a web UI
view right yeah all right ah so we'll
take one more and then we'll do like a
10-minute break before the next talk so
people can grab some whatever they need
from break soda snacks all right Wow we
totally almost got through them um oh
okay we'll just say well take Ben's but
the other one was good too um what are
some good UX design resources that you
think would benefit standard dev types
uh so like what should I read since that
suck at design I would I tend to get the
most value from a user experience
companies like Nielsen Nielsen does some
really great research I it's I think
it's Nielsen group com and they break it
down break down like kind of advanced
user experience topics and ways that
that are very easy to understand and the
blog is fantastic and it's research it
back to so it's something that but the
nerd and all of us can get behind bad
because Allah God they do all the like
TV stuff right like tracking people on
TV Nielsen that might be a different
Nielsen okay we had to search for
Nielsen UX and yet some glue gun and UX
and Google and yo you find what you need
that and following designers on twitter
is really helpful so Luke Wroblewski
Luke dub a dub u has a fantastic talk he
works at Google now he came from he came
from my other ebay hmm yeah yeah he's
got um he's got a series of books too
i'm pretty sure was it the a like don't

fantastic book to you should that's a
that's a great one not Luke w lu w did
