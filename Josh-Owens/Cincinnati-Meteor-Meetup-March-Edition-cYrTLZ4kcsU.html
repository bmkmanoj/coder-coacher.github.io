meteor meet up um we're trying a new
format this month for everybody here yes
I'm over here your live streaming hey um
so we're gonna do a quick this month in
meteor which will just be talking about
some of that this week in meteor stuff
and then we've got to talk from drawing
see chai about react meteor and then
we'll do a quick demo of Mongol the
package so i will turn it over to Bruce
yellow man all right hey guys it's the
same three people we have just curious
00 forever so yeah it is pretty on
YouTube edited yeah hey guys my name is
Bruce Hubbard Bell Brett differential um
wanted to we're gonna try to do that
this weekend meteor section of the
meetup this is basically just going over
um we have a newsletter that goes out
and blog post which summarizes all of
the awesome things that are happening in
the meteor community from week to week
it's called this week a meteor you can
go to this week in meteor calm and sign
up for that basically so I just wanted
to spend like five or ten minutes to go
through the to go through the list and
point out some of the cooler things that
are happening so looking at the board
the so the new meteor forums so the old
forms kind of stunk and so they got
replaced with a new one um definitely go
check those out and see all the
conversations um p scroll down
another link to check out as this the
power of trapper so it talks about how
tracker can be used outside of meteor
and if you've done any meteor meteor at
all you know use tracker a lot 24
reactivity and to rerun things when
things change and then the other thing
that I thought was awesome from this
week was the windows preview yep so
they're getting closer and closer to
having meteor running windows I haven't
actually checked it out it may actually
run perfectly fine but yeah I don't I
don't have one of those in 1.1 and it'll
be like yes yeah yeah so Windows is full
of it yes so that that'll that'll be
awesome because then we good yeah then
you know whenever people come and show
up to like training and everything when
we teach the meteor we can actually they
can install in on windows because half
the people that show up or running
windows um usually that's to some of it
yeah all the dishonest and Oliver
correct all the dotnet developers and we
do get a bit that show up um alright
that was mainly what I want to do one
week for flip the week 3 yeah
let's fill talk of immediate a new
meteor version was released it just
fixed a bug in the meteor deploy command
that I never hit that somebody obviously
did the improved performance on initial
array there's a there's a performance
problem like when it would render a list
and it was an empty list and then all of
a sudden it went to render a lot of rows
at the same time there's a performance
bottleneck that kind of got fixed with
that um make template that body act like
a normal template so if you're again if
you've used meteor you know what
templates are they're kind of a
combination of JavaScript and HTML but
the any body tags we're always treated
specially because they all get combined
together and kind of one clump so that
this but you could ever target them for
like events and different things like
you could a normal template so this that
fixed that and then the blaze profiler
which is the next one down this was it
looked like it was a Chrome extension I
still were a major work in progress but
it basically did performance um just
performance in Anna meteor app so you
could run change some things and then
see where your meteor app spent most of
its time and then the other one was down
the meteor multi-core support so the
meteor hacks cluster package so that's
an attempt to help scale out media or
meteor um it got basically multi-core
support which is pretty self-explanatory
sets of those big news all right we too
yeah the blaze pull requests that these
aren't in do you know if they're going
to do for 1.1 or if this is just it
hasn't it hasn't got merged it didn't
look like he got merged I'm preaches
okay I didn't see I look I clicked on it
and I did not see that it that that pull
request was merged um yeah supposed to
drop the 104 okay the constraint solver
was not in 104 yeah I didn't see that as
yes it is yeah really big because I had
a lot of implications on other things
yeah I still think I yeah that hasn't
been perched in but it's pretty cool
features oh yeah each X&amp;amp;Y yeah what's
really in need like that's the hardest
thing when you explain to people like
yeah and runnin eh we magically changes
the data context yeah like explaining
data context of people yeah the hardest
yeah cuz I yeah exactly I think it just
makes it more readable yeah because
really it's doing the same thing yeah a
lot of times like instead of set like
the data context for me I'll just return
an object and like put a name in front
of it just so it's more obvious to
people in a ditch what if this helps
look if you're inside each and you're
inside of other contexts within each if
you can refer to that I think I think
not yeah cuz they're variable names
that's what they want to do yeah instead
of using dot dot yeah because you can
use dot dot right now dot dot slash
that's really weird yeah but means
standard handle wash it but it's not
even well-documented no it's not and
they do a horrible job of documenting
space yeah
yeah I actually like the index 1 also
because that was one of the first things
one of the first warts like I came
across with meteor but I'm like okay
woohoo I'm you know I'm displaying an
array of things all right now let's just
put an index on it what this is a hard
problem is the heart bomb because really
you know you gotta figure out which one
you've updated yeah update all the other
ones correct so now yeah you ever glad
to see that yeah so it's really nice and
then what what was what pretty little
utmost just introduce our delicious oh
yeah three name your variables basically
yeah that doesn't see you talking yeah
compared to the other ones the crap
Rizzo's yeah all right I think that was
really about it were weak too um yeah so
for week 1 which is our last and final
and I've got about ten seconds left um
just the applaud backlog which was if
sometimes when is tailing a backlog it
it gets behind so at some point it like
resets and then the windows preview
which you already saw that they actually
have already done it 02 on that and then
i'm told that mere 1.1 is expected by
the end of month yeah okay sorry
targeted for the in a month so that's
this weekend or this month in meteor
okay I sign up sign up for the update
set this week in meteor com I'll turn it
over to you are he's going to talk about
meteor and react
complexes okay there it is should I
think should I stand up or sit down well
um good to know it's just slides com oh
and that's another great job
thank you they're all right this is
recording this is recorded I'd hundred
five people watch him hell yeah no
pressure hello five people all right
Plus everyone here yeah all the dozens
of people attending long I can ask
questions and we'll answer them at the
end that's right yeah people watching
live we're taking questions in the on
google+ page edit and then at the end
there's time for QA and we can sir him
then so is everyone leaving my name is
Gerard CJ I worked for differential in
case anyone didn't know meteor developer
before that I had a brief stint and node
and rails and then before that I did PHP
for many years and all of you i'm gonna
guess um Ron his new is new to meteor
who okay so that's my first question
he's new to me you're okay second
question who's new to react Oh everyone
awesome excellent so I want to see risky
signal didn't they say that about meteor
naw nigger was once yeah he was a risky
technology I was really still do I know
and reacts not even one point out so
i'll go through a very brief
introduction to react i'm not like this
isn't a talk on react itself so i'm not
getting a tutorial react i'm just gonna
talk about what makes react react I'm
not gonna tell you how you actually use
it because I barely know so at its heart
react is a framework for creating
JavaScript
so when you say the word component it's
kind of loaded can mean a lot of things
people have been trying to do web
components released talking about them
like since the web was around in some
form or another but in a nutshell
component this concept of combined in
your logic your presentation and your
styling maybe into one piece or one
module has been around for a long time
and react is the latest attempt and I
think it's a pretty good job so some to
be confused with web components which is
a specific thing a w3c standard how do
you make how you implement components in
a web browser you know polymer is
addressing that if we have time we might
be able to talk about it but we'll see
react is also focused on the UI only so
if you go to the home page it says react
is the V in MVC which i think is kind of
confusing because then people think it's
like about template mean but it's not
really about Templeton um the same way
that blaze has templates HTML templates
and then JavaScript logic react is the
same you have your presentation and you
have your business logic the only thing
it doesn't dress is your data you know
doesn't care how you say the data where
you save it where you send it strictly
on presentation and the logic and react
is opinionated which is really there's a
couple things about that one is they
they reject two-way binding so react is
one way binding and always will be
according to them and they have this
this concept of the mutable state which
I still not quite I know the mutable
state means but I'd put in react you can
change the state so not quite sure and
practice it on what that means but in
the docks that's a big principle when
needle state gets you is is simplicity
allows you to render things over and
over and over without worrying that you
know something's changed because your
state is mutable
so we'll see a little bit that oh ok a
little bit of code world's simplest up
there the big enough ok yeah really big
enough bigger like me Nick this files
okay but the next one won't be love to
go with that so this is um this is the
world's simplest rackham put um the only
purpose here is that you know a
component by large is called is created
with this react class method and then
you just patch the pest of the hash the
only required field as far as I
understand is this render function which
gives you your template so I won't go
too deep into it but react react
promotes this this thing they invented
called jsx which lets you embed HTML
into your javascript and they have a
tool that will parse that and turn it
into javascript so then it will run just
like normal a lot of quirks and gotchas
with j sx i won't go into them it's not
they're not too bad butts definite it
takes some getting used to so in your
render function um they'll give you
things like data no data variables i
give you event handlers like this on
click event handler which just runs this
duck click which is this function so if
I load it up here yeah um so this this
div is basically I'm rendering here and
then huh there you go so the whole point
is you know this react component is
actually there's not a lot to it it's a
hash and has functions as we'll see as
lots of handles on data
so so who cares right what's what's the
big deal um so I had a hard to explain I
was trying to figure out a good word to
describe this this this quality of react
and then I read the percolate blog and
they use this word which is disciplined
and I think that's a great word because
the goal the Charter react is to make
composable web apps great things in the
little tiny components that are easier
to use and easier to think about and you
know that's composable that's one but
then they sort of enforced little things
here and there that aren't obvious up
front but taken as a whole it's a very
disciplined approach to composability
it's a little loud enough that eggs
complete sense um but react seems little
cleaner than other components I've seen
to pass like I haven't seen a react
component that's very big maybe it's
because like could because J sex is such
a pain to write like you don't have a
lot of it in any one particular class
because they're all really small Oh so
another big reason is as well as
Facebook it's hard to tell with react is
so popular because of technology or if
it's popular because you know Facebook
has a team it's working on it like all
day long and they have you know Facebook
can oh let's have a react conferences or
they'll have a conference not many
open-source libraries can do that
technically speaking the big game
changers is the virtual Dom so let's
talk about virtual Bell it's really
virtual Dom is not a good term I think
because Dom makes you think a web
browser police it makes me think web
browser but it's this divider thing
about is just an abstraction layer
between whenever you're rendering to and
your JavaScript code so it's just an
abstraction layer that's all it is so
when you render when you call that
render function in the component react
is the storian is maintaining an
internal representation of that
structure
and it hasn't rendered it anywhere yet
until the right time so the cool thing
is since it's abstract you have up I'll
just do all so it's called the game
since it's an abstraction layer it's
agnostic to your render target so if you
want to render to the doll you can do
that if you want to render to a string
on the server you can do that it's
trivial if you want a renter to a canvas
element so Flipboard recently released
this react canvas library that lets you
create basically web pages with canvas
you can do that with react and of course
there's react native which lets you
render to you know not render but
compiled down to native iOS so the cool
thing is like reactors just JavaScript
it doesn't run in the browser which is a
JavaScript library so you can run it
anywhere you go around the server client
you can run it on device running on up
you know hardware so it's very flexible
I think that's kind of a lot it's behind
a lot of the popularity and then they
say it's very fast there's a bunch of
technical details around that so so you
want to use react with media that's the
react portion here comes into your
portion few times its I think it started
a little late hmm okay um so when we say
react with meteor what exactly we mean
so I'll go through a couple scenarios
two or three scenarios one would be if
you want use react components within
blades so someone hands me a component
react component and I just want to stick
it what's so useful but I don't to be
right in blazes gonna stick it in there
that would be one way you want to reuse
reactive instead of late so blazed
reactor or they basically compete in my
opinion you could in theory do all react
on the front end keep your meteor back
end and not touch plates
although this is kind of nuanced all
that blaze stuff will be loaded it's all
in there it's running you're just out
using it which brings us to the last
scenario which is due when use react
without meteor at all in front end and
we'll get to see that hopefully with our
asteroid example and you can't see the
he says oh really kappa chopped off all
right really ok um i go through a couple
packages this is one I had I have a co
example but I'm going to skip it because
you get the idea um so I'll be wrote
this package it's like really small it's
like 20 lines it's as a bottle ah be
works for the new year development group
below lobby we met once actually you
know you may not remember but we've met
I'm here with this this package it's
really small as a single file let's let
you do this if you have a react
component called hello world in your
blaze template you can just kind of do
the inclusion helper to it and whatever
it renders will appear there so um
that's kind of cool he has a actually
pretty thorough example something called
rectangles which uses this but you know
it's interesting but the package itself
is pretty simple so yeah I'm gonna skip
that one and do this which is a little
more interesting so this is probably the
favorite right now this is a favorite
react media integration package and the
approach it takes to integration is like
this so this they they use this react
react mix in to establish this get
meteor state hook and that's your your
hook into react from meteor so get me
your state basically returns a hash oh
and those values are reactive in react
so yeah so for example this one we're
returning a hash with the key of value
if value changes then react what we
render that component separately trusted
you know who's doing this um it's again
a man I know he works for was that your
been oh oh I know switch from meteor he
wears your meter yeah so that's
interesting i'll talk about that yeah um
but let's see like I skipped one so
here's two okay good so in this example
so this is hello world and then we're
going to just render display number of
seconds in the number second starts at
zero this component didn't malfunction
is kind of like a ready that's like
where you put your life you know once
your component is ready to be
manipulated you put that stuff in there
so all I'm doing there is setting value
to 0 and then incrementing it and then
we have our get meteor State hook which
is that bridge between meteor and react
so we act as know anything about session
variables but we can use session
variables to drive react so I need to
start meeting or wait
this won't work this will break there we
go so this package is its kind of screwy
it's all over the place I have to run a
developer and meteor to get to work here
we go so that's it um can you blow that
up so that you guys like a million of
those lines yeah hi very good right i
mean like here um how I reacted emma is
it the performance I cried do something
I don't know what am i doing you're
scrolling it's smooth you're fine oh ok
even do that a meteor it's fish even
just hung it desktop Chrome yeah j-jake
free what school huh bit of it which I'm
very a compound yeah did you see the
year version of that yeah the interest
rate the media version like that memory
counter and it just sticks at my legs
real strike creeps up a little different
react great opening right maybe there
was creepin emerilla member who's ever
had a huge block in it never just fixed
up suppose I she'd been fixing it daily
ashamed they say look like the day
before the guy yeah sure they did okay
as I was saying maintain my MTG ? so yes
the guy I guess been something rather
maintains it ben newman um but it's
interesting so he works for meteor and
he's maintaining this but it doesn't i
don't know if it's officially used to
work at things and he works at you sort
what yeah and he used to wait any z's
des six guys I hire because they want
like I want to be thinking about the
future of okay there was the one girl
that we do you think about him then
we're out there nobody Pete on ya peeps
Pete's the face of reacts do you see him
everywhere um no this kind of in Soyuz
work a facebook now works for MTG he
maintains this and get help um you can
see all those commits but I don't but
it's not in its not under meteorites out
meteor / yeah yeah it's under react so
I'm like and he doesn't his updates are
kind of sporadic its prime nesting he's
doing you know one hundred percent so
that's why the question mark I don't
know if just because he works for me
years I make it meet your parish I don't
know but you could bet on that um okay
package number three this is which is
called route court and they take a
slightly different approach which is put
a render function in a computation so
this is I'll just move my session get
value into the render and every time
session I get value changes it reruns
it's interesting i keep i have an
example but i won't show it because the
results the same you get you get the
idea there's a counter um because this
function this package I don't know what
no one talks about it I've been looking
at the forums and github mouths crown
everyone's talking about that previous
package no one's talking about rock or I
don't know why because it does like like
five times as much it's for example
rallying so it has its own router and
which is cool but I think the reason
they do that is for server-side
rendering so the Surfside rendering
works flat out like it just works and in
the previous package it's like
experimental it requires a for cove
meteor and all this business
everyone's like when are we gonna have
service I rendering in this package re
provides it so I'm not quite sure what
what to do is and I've asked and
everyone was ignored my question so so
what did this start as a reactant yep
smash up full-on yeah the only the only
issue with this package of that is that
it hasn't been updated since like I
think Alaska Mabel like November so I
don't know how active it is but just
from a feature sandwich from a complete
completion standpoint it's all there and
there's even a to do NBC example using
this package and like yeah yeah it works
great well so I think well yeah I don't
I actually like the mixing approach
better I like that meteor state function
and this but they'll easy to look should
combine so all right oops times it five
minutes over where I wanted to be right
um so we're not actually gonna build an
app I built it already we'll just look
at the code and oh yeah this is it this
could be a funk it up a knife um yeah I
can do that okay although it's not right
now yeah I think it's not gets all over
the place so we're gonna build is is
this to do zap was gigantic now
okay we'll just leave that there so I'll
become a kit that's good like it sort of
polymer in there um this one is not
polymer so this is a no so I built this
app four times um some of it two of
these polymer two of them use
materialized CSS this has materialized
so we we can add it to do we can cross
it off and then we and then we can we
can delete it and then have these
filters at the bottom so we can filter
active-active to do's completed to dues
or just all so it's kind of to do NBC
you only dumb down and use the three a
code and so else I'll start there so
it's not really that's pretty
straightforward you have to look past
all the material I see is a cell just
for fun so here's our if you read the
react talk still want you to put so I
have my input for my input field I'm
here and you know if you read the react
ox will tell you put that in its own
component but for this purpose I'm just
going to want it all together the only
interesting here is this here's our two
views where we do this that's they've
got to do's and then we just do it right
over them and then this is my to-do item
react component which we can look at if
you want I think I don't know might be
useful we don't need to um cuz you're
stuck out here don't look at ya wanna
see ya all right you said it they ready
when you put the button they would want
you to put like the
form not the button input field and then
like the filters at the bottom would be
a separate component so like that's
their philosophy okay well this is good
so then here's our to do component which
is a list item and when I created to do
so the collection is actually held like
up in the parent component and when I
created to do I pass it props the actual
text and then I have the two icons which
call these two functions it's not
completing this that remove and so it's
pretty simple so for example in this dot
complete all I'm doing is just so that
at that point is to do is that update is
just mini Mongo that's just meteor and
the same for remove it's just meter now
so the cool thing is once you call it
there the parent component reacts and
rear enders and then updates page so we
can actually see little bit more that
there's actually um so up that first in
that first function again initial state
so that's where you put your initial
state for react so here I've initialized
it a state to have one field which is
going to do's which is just your your
collection that's a media collection
right yeah just values I fine just fine
old mini Mongo to do is not fine but
that's where it's where reacts on so
every time it changes like when we call
to do is that remove then the rear
enders so the submit function you can
kind of see the idea we're going to do
it to do that insert again it's just
regular meteor so here's my filters down
here and that's pretty simple i'll call
this that set state on react which
updates is to do is key with this query
results of this Creek and in the rear
enders
oh that's why to do zap see you next so
yep so again this is just standard
meteor render by reacts if we do this by
a lot of crackers crackers um if you
cross it off you know I can do well that
won't do anything but if i delete now
you do but it won't it's just well check
off crackers on the other side oh yeah
I'm saying when I filter it doesn't
change the other window cuz it's not uh
on my mind if I need data so it's a bad
example um but yeah but everything works
as you would expect so here's a really
cool thing right so weird its react
right oh so I'll do a hard reload data
is still there and yes sir you have you
source your source is there was it
command you you pictures yes you have
well let's let's pull this up now this
is this is meteor stuff here it is um
Jeff server rendered server under HTML
page so when it renders the first time
everything's bootstrap but then it just
meteor takes overland and there's all
this react these weird react data
attributes which are supposed to go away
at some point but yeah that let's forget
yeah it's ugly but it's all there so
like here's my filters um here's mine
here's like you but that's one of the
two dues yeah that's I mean it seems
like a small price to pay for server
render thorough yeah for like sir encode
for free yeah you sourcing
yeah yeah to steal um yeah so that's
cool right so that view source party I
mean they're surrendering obviously I
works for any parts of the page um it's
good fries a good point probably but
yeah that other chrome was missing right
it's just the to do spark that was
showing in the view source it's probably
yeah that's probably good that's a good
point oh so yeah I don't know what you
do and you can't like um no I should
that you mean to the title and stuff
like that that was in there yeah yeah
nice today so here's the title oh okay
so here's my library just kind of like
well do you need any HTML that isn't
inside of reactor um so in this example
know so goes right renders right to the
body and then that's what they say look
not to because your finger like a like a
you know desktop app is on this the body
is your frame and you just start there
we could try that though I have a
feeling that you're right only the react
stuff would come through um seamstress
yeah he's a heavy like download wise
reactors versus meteor well react is
just a in this case I'm including the
package I don't know we could puncture
what rappy repeat the question what's my
IP address no right ok watch it is what
what is yes is that a one-ton 263 I
don't not seen yeah they're just wanting
to question is um how how big is it yeah
like in size yeah free accident big
think you're a little thing I really
don't know let me check on okay I got it
right here all right Josh Foster
checking it so in this example it's
include
by the package I'll just tell me that
but you can like you can just they have
it on a CDN you just use a script tag if
you want included web page why do you
want your life so just trust Facebook do
the right thing yeah i'm looking yeah
i'm cool facebook took yes standard
security security measures apply don't
see which which library would be it's in
that the mice
like 2.6 Meg's gee it's pretty big well
that's around bored yeah maybe it has
loading react it does include rise I'm
not sure there's three parts reactors
reactors react add-ons and then there's
the j sx compiler new mom no it's pretty
big for what I'm saline we're doing well
oh I have well what's the next words
minified gzipped is 26 k it's just
gzipped it's not even if it's on
minified and not gzipped it's four times
okay let's have a man gruffly so that's
good a nutshell what do you get I mean
basically theory here you get faster
rendering performance you nearly
advantage this over but don't be hearing
well i guess it was Tom mcdonough
mcdonough get code that's easier to
reason about how the updates are just
applause always do you like this is
disciplined yeah exactly it's all right
bit just because blaze is looking for
places are kind of the same way you can
think about blaze like components but
you still have you have two files your
HTML and your JavaScript and then
there's no like when you kind of include
one and the other doesn't feel weird
component eyes it just feels like feels
like an include doesn't feel like a
component you're looking way too oh yeah
not recomposing with reacting is the
correct nixon's just like this yep
there's mix-ins and there's components
using components like i don't know if
i'll explain that well nothing blaze is
very close track component see them that
really just get mixed into other
components just like you would do mm-hmm
colic inheritance
and which we talked about um like
reaching I talked about server-side
rendering a lot and it doesn't like I
know they can put blaze on the server I
don't know why they haven't I don't know
if it's ten quid or the just you know
priorities but if they did I think it
would be it would bring it you know very
close to react yeah I wonder your side
remember look if you curl that I think
you look like the resource oh ok hey try
oh yeah the javascript in the park my
JavaScript you crawler oh well though no
it's already the process you're going to
get the result these usual results yeah
its process on the server but ya go
crawler requested just get this girl HQ
we try each girl yeah
whoops still kickin oh you crashed oh
good timeout floated it since I i saw
this next rule Irish brothers a stable
downloaded secrets still not working oh
my god was 42 actually don't know well I
don't know why it's not working crashing
everytime forever no still running
that's like I think it most oh oh here
we go that works that's what you get
faster anger oh did you install veteran
now around core depends on it I think I
loses some of its like injection stuff I
see Jack positional is about for
leverage ring ring yeah rock or so if
you look at the package there's a
there's a there's a connect middleware
that intercepts like routes and then
calls react calls rendered astraying and
then just returns the strap and so like
Burke collected some very similar with
that other package but it required a
couple hacks they've hacked though that
package of the heck meteor and one and
then it like somewhat worked like it's
like it's like meteor self could take
over do this I think they could maybe
they're just happen all right let's keep
going this is for I
okay asteroid um so if you don't know
let me see I have to run this I'm so
asteroid is a plain old JavaScript DDP
client so you can rate interface with
meteor back end um with a plain vanilla
JavaScript front end and I think I want
to
so so i'll just show you first um or are
we here I'll start at the bottom so this
is the same app same to do that same
functionality using asteroid so this is
at this point it's this is a plane this
is like static a static site this is a
static HTML table so that there's no
server anything here I can show you
actually need to show you the first so
here's why index.html I'll have to have
to script source loaded well jquery
under school or materialized so asteroid
has three files DD ph is the DS is q4
promises and then that ask your browser
that is then we include react itself
which again is East few files and then i
have my app and if i guess if you keep
going down that's the whole body so in
my jsx file oh this is like this is just
normal jquery already i create a new ask
a new asteroid connection which is the
DDP connection and I have to call
subscribe that's where the promise comes
in where when you subscribe you wait
till it's ready and then you can go into
rendering here at so again coming from
vetta react ism that's well let's just
jquery promises yes or asteroid return
to promise and i'm using jquery to
consume it and then so here's my app
right here this long years app now
passing it this meter DDP connection
so where's this is kind of this
component didn't out is the interesting
part so when the on component did mount
which again is like your Dom ready I
have this connection and properties I
passed in so I called gift collection
that gets me my meteor collection and
then I call reactor query on it which is
an asteroid thing and I just say give me
all of it to do this in this example so
that does is give me this result object
which has its unchanged handler which
will run any time v gps and an update so
one change all i'm going to do is update
reactant the state of the react
component so so here's the test so this
is my have to start the meteor app in a
different directory because i'm on this
branch yeah
okay okay so on the on the right hand
side is meet here on the left hand side
is the asteroid out which again just a
static HTML side and you get the exact
same thing so oh I had provide an
example in here start over milk bread
cheese and then from the meteor side I
can complete it click these to delete
that so have your non meteor front end
reactive app yeah that's yeah that's
cool so thank you thank you that's good
question I don't know don't know so
consumed so that espera que tal have all
in one repo at home project is the front
end piece which separate from the
asteroid back now well there is an
asteroid back in so yeah it can be
separate that's what I was just running
so I was running a meteor app and up
from another repo in my asteroid version
which is just just the front end second
he goes I don guessing on yeah amazon s3
dropbox you know google github github
pages so yeah I don't okay let's get
that um I built the same app in polymer
with me here and with asteroids cuz for
this talk all right are you another unit
well it was before the talk it kind of
form and I was trying to just explore
things to talk about plus well I haven't
I do have a blaze version actually hows
it asking you like but particular in
polymer I didn't do an angular cuz I'm
no angular and do am hurt
what I want all this yeah so uh yeah
what actually question is what does it
mean inches I don't know what does it
really what does it all mean like Jess
likes I think I'm getting used to it I
think it's weird at first but it's
really i think the only way you can
combine mark up with javascript that's
what you want to do you want to have
them like well I guess papa that's true
Palmer doesn't to kind of like but it's
better cuz it's like right there and if
you have to deal with j sx to do that so
be it um yeah powers it's got the same
thing you can mark up you got JavaScript
but it doesn't feel this guy's I don't
know why is that which when you say it
feels polymer web components doesn't
doesn't feel like a colander we're
making mm-hmm I do yeah well is this I
don't mind it and this doesn't require
like but Palmer has issues with rather
browser support react have issues with
browser supports it no because it's it's
own library there's no I mean that
standard but right so it's kind of like
two polymers right only runs in the
browser because it's the whole purpose
Ridge react will run anywhere anywhere
they're going to JavaScript was like
HTML chunks right in this hello it is we
to do that ground it was a litter the
bad thing to do now it's good it's good
yeah I don't know there's reason to come
in it what's the new hotness for sure oh
yeah so like yeah before jsx you had
with you had to like um and before jsx
like instead of this div
um like just plain markup you'd have to
do something like react dot create
element like almost like jQuery do and
then give it like ID let's our place
works really um yeah but you don't have
to type it like her ablaze template it's
just HTML right how would you say it
converts it into an object like that
yeah probably i apply your data such an
easy I think they could what did I see
that's where no actually rad court does
that you can serac or rock or you can
include it says like use with caution is
it's a hack but you could include blaze
templates in your render function yeah
well something like you know plays dot
to react or something you give it a name
it was like holy can't you google it
stick yeah I'm not sure yeah any
questions did anybody have any questions
/ uh just people were asking about the
code good the of it will just slides be
up in that cup so yeah i'll put up the
slides are already up some slides com
okay so let's just put a link on you
something yeah I can do that oh man out
with the cut up tomorrow yeah the
display yeah
I don't gimme the light pass the mic is
alive that's mine
you
I needed i muted haha I was clicking
around and hitting keys I'm like its
command D all right well anyway again
this is probably the worst act MOS
all-time collection telefona what should
work let alone enough sleep it'll work
on the city for time basically it's
exposing like all the data that's in
mini Mongo for you and then you can
actually independent of the allowed and
iron rules you can manage the data and
like save it and the great thing is like
it's got the debug only flag on it so
you can install it and you don't have to
worry about getting in production so
it's a nice developer tool there you go
reload okay so this is like the the city
for sir that I built the other day and
then it finds where we're at and then it
finds all the food places around us like
organs you can go by through their
subway shanghai mamas it doesn't have to
be good for you and so if we click here
you can see we've got places down on the
bottom left-hand corner there when i
click on it you can actually see all the
data thats related to it there's like
ratings here we're not exposing you can
see all these different types for saving
off so we could actually probably have
filters that show only bars if we wanted
to
um and you've got all the like latitude
and longitude points here so it actually
change this i change this guy yeah
actually i haven't yet but I plan to
does I actually think this is pretty
good so you can see like I had save and
it disappeared because we're actually
asking but Mongo here we're asking we're
giving in our location saying only give
us stuff that's within a certain range
and so you know dropped out because I
moved it like probably a state over by
changing the latitude there um yeah I
think like this is important to me
because like it's an easy way to do a
security audit because all of a sudden
you see like what data is flowing the
front end as you're clicking around and
maybe there's more here than we intended
right so that's kind of interesting and
then it's also nice because I don't know
maybe it's a crutch that you're going to
like update all this data even though
the allowed and I rules won't let you
yeah I no no no he's actually got a
server method that bypasses around and I
yeah but again like oh it's yeah it's
lesson shouldn't security concern
because he's only doing it in
development mode and never gets bundled
into production except it doesn't nice
travel production huge site so anyway
interesting package is called Mongol
except when it doesn't work on yeah
alright well thanks for tuning guys uh
next week oh I'm not even share my
screen now explain myself hi thanks for
watching me talk about a bad bitch uh
you better next one
alright instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
