2016 that's weird it is weird yeah so
first one of the year actually you know
what's funny I still don't think people
a lot of the podcast subscribers have
heard the last one because there seems
to be some kind of bug in the podcast
caching system with the site so gonna oh
now today oh I it's gotta have something
to do with the year change or something
I don't know weird yeah do we have a
large percentage of listeners that
listen through the web browser through
the browser the browser is fine it's
it's anyone that listens through the
feed itself so itunes or any that cost
Oh interesting yeah so we wrote a little
bit of code that caches the the RSS feed
from simple cast Andrey serves it and
for some reason it's not grabbing that
I'm looking at the stats here to see
what probably pretty pretty uneven from
the web yeah Apple Apple makes up thirty
two percent of our listens that's
awesome that's a good number the browser
is twenty percent that's good on my
other podcasts I've been trying to get
the browser down like like when it's
like over fifty percent like there's
some alarms there like subscribe
subscribe yeah so but any whatever
anyway everyone welcome to 2016 no joke
well cool uncle yes glad to be here
thank you for the support thinking
subscriptions need who love it alright
so let me get over yeah 2016 is starting
off of the bang lots of good resources
out there and we're gonna be covering
four of them today yes and ironically
all four come from medium yeah I thought
that was funny when I was putting the
list together yeah I think I think
mediums like squarely one like you can
just
just write that down and move on yes yes
Lee I mean they've added feature slowly
and it's like key features and and it's
good stuff we saw we saw the big ones as
custom domains yep that was a big recent
one and frankly like that just generally
though the viral growth mechanism that
they have makes a heck of a lot of sense
for writing something so like if you
join using your twitter account or your
facebook account like it like auto fees
all those people yeah that are already
on there and then when you recommend a
post if they get a daily email or
something then someone you recommend a
post can show up in there yeah that's
great syndication um and then they
finally got the comment thing figured
out like early on they were like doing
some funky stuff like trying to make
their own inline comments or whatever
yep now they put all the bottom and it
just flows better yeah so good job
medium yes indeed so bloggers get down
there yeah yeah I'm gonna be moving my
stuff there alright so this week we're
going to talk about mantra we're going
to talk about redux thing in your meteor
app for strategies to survive meteor in
2016 and angular 2 versus react the the
war will begin indeed that one's got a
fun picture at the top to want to talk
about that so mantra this came out like
just this morning and I was I'm number
one like I'm happy that we're seeing the
changes in meteor that we are and I
think that it's easier for something
like mantra to exist because of the
changes that are coming in 1.3 so that's
super exciting but basically it's an
application application architecture so
you
there's some thought that comes along
with it and a little bit of wiring that
comes along with it but basically it's
it's like thinking of how to apply a lot
of the Facebook architecture style your
app yeah I think of flux but this is
kind of like something built for meteor
yeah in fact Aaron notas in our private
chat and he was saying that the reason
why he made this was because he thought
like redux wasn't wasn't particular
enough for for meteor right so yeah this
is interesting and it's cool that's
coming out with by Aaron Oda and his
team yeah I you know I it almost feels
like it's not a fork per se but it it's
sort of trends that way right like it's
this idea of like you know someone other
than mdg is going to be a steward of
something that's media or ish and based
on meteor and I think in the future
we'll maybe see more of this right and
so as we start to get more first party
integration with NPM and you know
working with libraries like react and
making that easier to do I think it's
going to be easier to accomplish things
like this as well so you know I look at
to me like I draw my experience from the
Ruby system and we had gems at first you
had rails and it was his own thing but
then you had well i guess it was it was
always gems but then you had like a
package system that was separate then
all of a sudden later i think with like
23 or something we got gem support and
we could write packages as a gem that we
could bring into a rails app and like
bring in a little bit of functionality
and i think that you'll see more of that
and so maybe mini Mongo becomes just
just another NPM package right and some
of this other stuff becomes NPM packages
and we're no longer relying like if you
look at meteor really all it is it's
just a collection a package
mmhmm yeah and and a build tool yes yeah
yeah yeah well we'll see what what this
is like okay so if you go to the repo
for mantra it's like it's just an image
it's pretty slender right now yeah it is
just and so um so Aaron Otis trying to
like drum up some some excitement about
this but there's really nothing to look
at right now what do you feel like when
someone does something like that I mean
I personally wouldn't do that because
it's like set myself up for failure
maybe but I mean he's delivered on a lot
of stuff before um and I yes you know
here's the thing like i don't i don't
know that he's necessarily trying to
build mindshare I think he's just trying
to be open and transparent about his
work that he's doing you know and
blogging is a great way to do that and I
would love to see other organizations
maybe do that as well um I I think he's
smart you know i I've been working on a
blog post about CDN that's work i did
months ago i wish i would have got it
out sooner and then you know maybe next
week I'm going to work on like
production hosting of crater that I've
talked about a little bit on here it's
just I think it gives people a little
bit of transparency about what's going
on stuff hmm so that's my take on it
that's cool yeah that's opposite of how
I was raised but I'm gonna keep track of
this and like my mind could be changed I
respect it Aaron OH degreat least so
yeah I mean I don't can do it I like
flow router you know like we we recently
did a meteor club apprentice series
where we went from my router to flow
router and it was like you know stupid
easy yeah and the code got better so
yeah exactly you move more your stuff to
the template or you're forced to and
this just yet better app good stuff yeah
it is good stuff how else can we
rearrange our code and make it better
bin it's interesting because in another
one of our boys avi ire from work pop
has been doing a series on medium
about redux and I think he's up to part
4 right now and a good introduction is
most part 1 and part 2 and right now
we're going to be like no no we're just
like kind of showcasing the whole thing
so redox is another way how you can
structure your app and this is something
that Facebook has come out with and
Redux is is kind of like a break away
from flux and I know a little bit about
redox I know nothing about flux so I
can't like compare the two I just know
that as a reference what they are and
people love Redux I know Abby does
greatly so the his his parts are like
totally dumb down like he is going step
by step to get this thing set up in
meteor so there's like almost no excuse
for or any level of a developer to not
go through this the steps that Abby is
laid out and then after you get it
inside your your meteor app then you can
go over to egghead and they have a free
Redux course created by the creator Dan
and it's it's you're going to get a
better app at the end of the day if if
you have a habit structure at a certain
way so like we got Montreux coming out
but Redux is something that has a lot
more horsepower behind it right now and
now I be actually made a prediction in
our last show that flux was just gonna
like it wasn't going to have all these
branches anymore all these different
versions or Forks it's just going to be
known as the way to compose apps in the
future and the way which is pretty bold
but I eat you know he's probably not
wrong right I mean if you look at maybe
it's not going to be a hundred percent
the way we we build apps in the future
but at the same time you know when rails
came out and even before that like MVC
was the leading way to start building
things at the time and right everybody
kind of looked at it in an
object-oriented way
and I said oh yes yes the MVC pattern
makes total sense let's let's do that
and started applying it and then I think
that's that started to to to fade away
as we move into like oh wait we've we've
got like the server side stuff and this
client side stuff now I need to figure
out a better way to do that mmhmm yeah
absolutely Abby's been killing it on
this I know that he's been getting a lot
of positive feedback on it and I'm just
going through it I'm just surprised by
the detail that he's done I I love
little images that he has in there but I
mean there's like here's the thing like
you can you can go through a setup or
try to get something going in meteor and
a lot of times the X shave will be at
the setup there's a great it or like how
to get like these NPM packages loading
right and things like it this is where
the value of this article's come from
like ah he's like shave that yak for you
yes literally step by step and also
knowing um he takes his stuff like he
has he has like a certain level of
performance that he wants to like be
known for and so if something's like out
of date or someone like has a comment
like I was the type of guy that's going
to be responding pretty quickly too so
that's another thing like adds this
tutorial like gets out of date and
people are like hey it's broken obvious
a great guy to write this thing because
he's gonna keep it updated oh good
that's for you bro if you're listening
and never if everyone knows Bobby's my
other podcast brother another other than
Josh the bend and Abby show so it got to
give him some love where where can
people find the been in avi show I think
it's like Ben and a B dot simple kfm
okay but we're everywhere syndicated so
go ahead on on a Apple podcast in iTunes
overcast mom all the play it all stuff I
think we're like up to show 15 now
medium re on medium everybody's all
medium been
we did start a little like company over
there I think or whatever a group thing
yeah yeah and it's interesting we're
wondering if you do want if you since
you brought that up we got we iterate on
this thing right so like everything's
MVP what we're wondering what the next
step should be we're thinking the next
step should be making a mini blog post
for every every show I mean that's
interesting yeah that's one option yes
yeah that's an interesting idea mm-hmm
rather than show notes that no one
listens to because everyone subscribed
they don't really look at the show notes
they just play it yeah so that's
something if people want to hit me up on
Twitter and tell me what you think about
that idea I'm just gonna all right steal
it now it I mention medium and you
mentioned that like well that's great
cuz i'm gonna steal your podcast
template off github then although i'll
say you know if you really want to do
that we should we should probably like
clean it up a little bit i'm in the
process of i switch to slow router i'm
gonna switch it to react and then won't
have it have it all have some server
side rendering for the SEO purposes
mm-hmm think it'd be good we can do that
I'm up there that uh I got a little bit
of experience dude flow router
server-side rendering branch makes it
stupid simple yeah nice yeah all right
so angular 2 verse react yes and i love
i love the picture at the top i
mentioned it at the top of the show but
it's got the what's that like gangs of
new york yes like standing against each
other and like the one sides holding
like swords and knives with react Blake
you know yes on them and then the other
side's holding the angular html5 looking
symbol as well
they look like they're gonna fight I
gotta say this this guy must be getting
tons of reeds on this because I have the
year ago or over a year ago I wrote the
meteor Jas verse react or verse
angularjs ain't a thing yeah medium and
I still get like 3,000 views a month on
that thing I think it's tweeted all the
time and I know this thing this article
I've been kind of like holding off from
reading it because oh no I would I would
everyone's retweeting it and it's like
clogging my twitter feed and I'm like uh
but now forced to read it cuz i have to
report on it and it's good stuff so i
think you know the interesting thing to
me here is that reading this guy came
from angular 1 switch to react and now
angular 2 is coming out he's kind of
taking a look at it and he's talking
about the fact that um angular 1 and
angular to have a much more HTML centric
approach approach to like how they're
doing things and so like you have an
HTML template and then you apply some
behavior to it which you know if you're
if you use meteor like that might sound
familiar please um and you know he his
point is like you lose some of the
greatness that you get with react in jsx
and the fact that you know you're you're
you're you're writing JavaScript right
in your HTML and there's honestly
there's no I'm not sure I see a super
compelling reason to separate the HTML
out necessarily I don't know that you
gain enough because in the end like if
you look at something like blaze you
still compile that HTML string or
snippet or whatever into JavaScript code
which then gets executed so I'd rather
get the tooling benefits of like you
know jss rjs linting and
you know there are other nice tools that
come with react as well so yeah just
think that that's super interesting i
also think that he brings up the fact
that they use typescript for all the
angular 2 stuff and i think that might
cause a little bit of heartburn for some
people like all their examples are
apparently for angular 2 are all in
typescript and they're trying to push
that a lot more yeah um oh my god i just
got a prediction 2020 google buys
microsoft this is the start with
typescript yeah to me that's your
perfect vision anyways I know it's not
perfect didn't get it done you clean
although I gotta say Microsoft is you
know what's the changing of the guard
they're doing some good stuff yeah
you're getting rid of all that crap
anyway sorry sorry sorry for taking this
car optical cliff let's get back on the
road train off the tracks that's more
epic oh right here yes so I think the
other thing you mentioned was churned in
the fact that you know he referenced the
JavaScript fatigue article and said that
react was a key contributor which I
hundred percent agree with like a lot of
the trend that's happening I think it is
happening over as like react is coming
of age like people are trying to figure
out what works best and what doesn't and
in in the oven on the opposite side of
the fence you have angular 2 which you
know angular 1 was a fairly well
thought-out framework but now they've
kind of completely reworked it and I
think that it's likely much better
thought out I don't know I mean it if I
look back historically like rails 3 was
better than rails to but it was hell of
a painful to make the switch so I mean I
understand some of that but in the end
it did get better
so yeah yeah that's all you got yeah I
honestly um haven't messed with angular
for in a while three years yeah yeah I
haven't even looked at angular 2 at all
i think i did read like a really basic
tutorial that or no i watched like a
talk when it first was released at one
of the ng comps or talked about at least
um but yeah that was way out there and
my prediction was uh we did a prediction
show on been an AVI and I was like yo
react aight up too much of of the view
world uh and now angular 2 is going to
come on the scene and you know they've
taken up too much of the other share
already of the pie and people aren't
going to move away from react I don't
think now you got Riddler one guys and
they're going to go to angular 2 but you
gotta angular 1 was like wildly
successful I you know I mean it's still
I mean is still huge on github right
like ours wise it's like four times the
size of meteor and yeah don't look at
stars I don't well I I'm okay looking at
angular stars as a measurement yeah I
mean here's the thing like I might have
start something two years ago right am I
gonna go back and like unstar it cuz I
don't care about it anymore okay well so
my new measurement then we'll use my new
measurement uh interesting I know what
it is well I told you yesterday that is
not it so I go on reddit and oh okay
reddit sub reddit and for angular they
have 14,500 readers that are subscribed
and 27 or online right now right and so
then you go look at react yes they were
like 770 332 are on
right now no strong readership and then
you go look at meteor oops just Armenia
which is gonna be ridiculously lower
right 3400 readers with 5 online and I'm
assuming I 125 there too um so yeah I
think it's it's you know like that
that's kind of how I measuring things
like I i would say that yeah that's a
good measure but you know that that's
the number of people that are interested
in it and i also think that honestly
there's probably a lot more businesses
that invested a long time ago in to my
video stop yep I did invested it a long
time ago in angular and they're probably
still somewhat invested in angular and
they'll likely make that upgrade path as
well yeah yeah it's purely a prediction
and I'm curious done where how the dust
is going to settle by the end the next
year yeah but this is a great article um
here's why this guy goes into detail and
as a developer you need to like know
this people are going to be coming up to
you you're going to if your consultant
you got competitors that are going to be
proposing a you later well you need to
know how to talk about that if you're a
react developer or vice versa sure and
if you're in a product company you know
you're working on one product you have a
decision to make you need to be educated
about it you don't have like all the
time in the world to learn something new
right if you guys start up or learn both
of them so yeah absolutely it's a lot
effort to learn that kind of stuff yeah
so Corey house good article thanks
mm-hmm right on so we're only doing for
today yep and the last one today is for
strategies to survive 2006 with meteor
2006 2016 there you go what the heck
so he said 2006 if I did I think I did
it's wild man oh I'm instead of writing
like 2015 outright 2006 everywhere yes
so this is this is an understandable
title right like not only is there j/s
fatigue because of react and everything
but like that fatigue is like coming to
meteor and then on top that meteors had
its own drama add it to the fire and
it's like what do we do now with meteor
in 2006 you know mute me Josh I've done
yeah you know what I found interesting
about this article is maybe not even
this article just the fact that like
we're talking a little bit about the the
changes happening in the meteor
landscape the guy was talking to someone
yesterday and they were like whoa I
don't understand why would you use react
for new projects especially when it's
small shouldn't we just use blaze
instead and I'm like whoa I mean you
could could maybe we're adding an hour
hour and a half onto it because we're
easy reactants late right now at the
current state data but the reason why in
the future is because you're gonna have
components that you can drop in right
away components plus i mean like they've
just straight-up come out and said blaze
isn't gonna be around forever right so
like meteor two comes out my my belief
is it'll be meteor too because blaze is
gone look did I miss something Jeff said
that he was going to like release an
update on what they want to do with
blaze because he got a bunch of feedback
did he really set up there yeah not that
I'm aware of no as a matter of fact so
that the thing you have to do is go
stalk Evan you on the forums and you see
little snippets here and there and
various threads when he saying that it
looks like blaze react like blaze to
whatever you want to call it likely will
not be built so
mmm that's a sure indicator that you
know you should really be looking pretty
hard at reacted this mmmm hmmm that's
interesting yet because Evan was the guy
that was originally task to make blaze
react exactly exactly yeah that's good
insight Josh yeah so but that you know
that's part of this is with this article
he talked about blaze to react and you
know the other parts of blaze or even
react ecosystem I guess well so this
article really great because not only
does he talk about blaze react but he
also talked about the other thing that
you need to be prepared for things that
are coming in a 1.3 better npm support
modularity because you're going to be
having import export of ECMO script 2015
being brought in you need to know that
and then he went in to talk about app
structures like flux redux relay is not
an obstruction but uh you need to like
learn that because that's coming and
then he was right because now look where
anoda came out i came out saying that we
just reported on yeah you know so
there's going to be some 2016 is going
to be taking all this javascript fatigue
that we had up and people are gonna be
packaging it up and and making
opinionated um opinionated libraries on
how to use it how'd it go apps correctly
that's what 2016 is going to be about
right dust is going to be settling so
you gotta get used to that learn redux
now yeah yeah and then graph ql
understand understand the pub sub a
little bit more it's good stuff aaron
oda has free free class that you can go
on uh to learn graphic you oh yeah learn
graph ql doc conversing like that yeah
and he's got some libraries as well my
guess is you know down the road he's
going to be instrumenting graph ql
sources in a way that looks good when
Khedira and hope she understand what's
going on behind the scenes yeah probably
grab trail is not hard to learn guys um
uh one good thing is a that i want to
point out as a
source PE hunt released a little repo
that's just a one read me that p hunt is
one of the creators of react and a lot
of people he was hearing a lot of
feedback that react was hard to learn or
the whole ecosystem react people were
confused so we released this roadmap and
it tells you step-by-step like what to
learn in what order and if you guys want
to you guys can go to github / Pete hunt
and i think it's it's one of his top
repo so if you go to his his profile
page you'll see it there it's like react
dash roadmap or something like that you
know that that's really interesting too
because i don't he's not at facebook
anymore he's like doing his own startup
thing now yeah but he always was a big
voice for uh really act ya next year
agree i don't know what next what this
year's looks like for him but he put
that thing out and and it's good we
covered it in a show on the been a
knobby show that's yet to come out step
by step so yeah I liked it and it agree
with it at first and then ah be kind of
suede me a little bit in the show you
know what the other thing I liked about
this article too was just he talks about
like avoiding premature optimization and
like honestly like you can just take all
this like teeth-gnashing and like
infighting and general BS that that
people are kind of upset about and just
realized like at the end of the day
people are building businesses
businesses that operate and function and
bring an income and hire people and
continue on and like as a developer
we're really just here to either support
that or create that and you know I I
think that it takes time to get there
and like software is a living thing
you're never going to be done with it
like no matter what you do what you
write today likely may be invalidated
six months from now and whether that's
you know because react is slightly more
performant in the browser or it's the
fact that you learn something from your
customer base like it's still going to
happen and so like these things happen
and so you need to have
good grasp on number one just building
something that's profitable as a
business and then to how do I refactor
that and make it better mm-hmm and those
are important business skills I think
and three right you're right in the
business of software I think people get
up in arms about a lot of stuff and some
of this stuff doesn't matter like we're
gonna have a good path to get out of
place mmhmm yeah yep yeah and I just got
a tip my hat to people who are like
creating resources like what Otto
created here yeah you know to help but
everyone through it yes and I love the
pictures like yeah this is my horse
picture at the end yes that's good well
are just long for sale call Luke and
it's like Luke Skywalker that's
hilarious that is alright guys this is
the first crater podcast of the year d I
don't know we might stick to four how do
you feel about that I liked it yeah let
us know tweet us something let us know
if we should do for keep it at five to
six it's pride too long alright guys
well thank you for listening and if you
haven't yet be sure to check out crater
conf it's comp crater I oh and a lot of
great speakers like that guy to my left
yo and happy will be on their obvious
noda will be giving some kind of talk I
think around graph ql but maybe he'll
change it up to be mantra I told him you
have the floor sir that's cool yeah so
should be good yeah all right and as
always if you want to support the show
you can go to patreon REO n-com / meteor
club and you can sign up there the ten
dollar reward level will get you into
the soon-to-be-called space dojo slack
mmm i'm part of a lot of slack groups
and yours is by far the most active and
most exciting most engaging so whatever
the name is going to be I know the guys
are going to follow you and it's still
going to be still going to stay number
one slide
it's the best really is you guys yeah
yeah all right well thanks for tuning in
