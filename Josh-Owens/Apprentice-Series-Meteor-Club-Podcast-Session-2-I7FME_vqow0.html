apprentice series I am back with Colby
and welcome Colby so okay so we're going
to continue working on the meteor club
podcast site we've got a list of issues
in github our repos open source me go
ahead and share my screen we'll get to
work here alright so I think we'll get
started with the pull request Kobe
actually did a poor request off camera
so I thought we could review it and just
kind of talk about how these things
should work so yeah there's actually two
commits in the pull request can you see
my screen oh okay cool okay okay um and
I think the intention here was actually
to submit two different pull requests
but the way that it happened because
they were on the same branch it just
came across as one pull request yeah so
my suggestion would be to put your code
in a branch because like this one's just
the first commits fixing about but then
the second commits adding functionality
new features i guess around security and
then the other thing is in your commit
message you can actually reference like
number two like this is related to item
number two so you can reference that
there and then the nice thing is that
actually that'll give you oops click
tomorrow one kind of a link from the
issue okay miss easier to get to the
pull request yeah and so the other way
you can do it it's just by putting it in
a comment as well and so then it started
it was up in yeah and then like right
here in the
it links back to you know pull request
issue number eight which is the pull
request so it's nice to kind of have
that cross reference as well when you're
working on things good stuff uh so yeah
we'll just we'll take a look at this
this was a one liner that was pretty
easy yeah good kind of like all right
not too bad yeah so the I think the
designer maybe just didn't realize that
the yield would take care of what we
needed and so in the index they were
calling in the layout but in reality we
just need the what Yuma call it sorry
move this off camera turn off my
notifications be a good pair there we go
um yeah so the the the layout really
shouldn't shouldn't have been here like
I said the the yield and the global
router configuration should have taken
care of that so good find cool uh and so
on this one looks like you added roles
and then you updated the allow and deny
mm-hmm I guess they allow rules to check
to see if the user is an admin prep okay
and then on before action oh this is
interesting okay so you're running it on
before action in the iron-router you're
looking at the user and seeing if the
user is an admin and if they're not then
you're redirecting them to the home page
calling stop and then throwing a coffee
alert air that's saying you need to be
an admin to access that page and if they
are an admin you just call next and
return true which looks right to me this
is just a white space commit and then
you also it looks like you've
essentially added in like a seeds file
because I was like well when I pulled it
in I guess you had your user already
created but I didn't so I figured just
44 now we'd have a seed to be able to
get in there and tested yeah yeah that
makes sense and so this is pretty common
I've seen this idiom before where you
just check to see if the users
collection is empty then you're going to
run this code and this runs on startup
every time so um yeah yeah I think this
is good like I said this this probably
won't even kick off on my machine
because I've already got a user Brian
it's true but i will i will need to go
in and add a role to my users so kind of
see that working what's this oh that one
i think i was playing around with
setting up some more things for the
roles so that may or may not be really
necessary but it was like a way to
create a function to develop me oh I see
okay so you're looking to see if the
person that's logged in is an admin and
if so they can create a user interesting
ok so my inclination is probably like I
don't know if we need this code yeah
probably not I was just kind of I
probably should have removed I think I
removed some other stuff that was in
there or that I just felt we missed that
one yeah yeah my thought is like we'll
probably just turn off client-side user
creation and I'll just like either yeah
I'll probably just in the server I'll
create my user or something or I started
I started building it up and then I was
like yeah guinea you know like don't
need to do all that yeah
alright so I think this is good to go we
can hit merge woot all right nice work
ah yeah so I think where we left off was
just on the finish wiring up feature
episodes yeah um alright so let's dive
into that we kill off what I had running
on port 3000 oh you like that running
just run on a different port city code
media club
Oh looks like my database got messed up
weird so you can just issue a meteor
reset it will you say database ah that's
funny no no my that seed file will kick
off haha there you go nice easy easy yep
what are you using the mailchimp for
right now ah that should probably
actually be removed I think the way the
designer worked is she took the media
club website and started editing that
and turning it into the podcast site
okay I mean since so like that's
probably another good thing to do is
just audit see all right so whadda tab
before we launch um but yeah that was
just there early on to get people on the
meteor club website like when they fill
out that form on the front page it
submitted that MailChimp through the API
okay which I've actually even like the
media club websites moved away from that
i'm using drip so ya know be an easy fix
i see i see militants in there we can
just remove that and then do you spy
durable like pretty much one everything
i do i don't i haven't like consciously
worked on many of these websites to
ensure that the page titles are correct
in that kinda a better but that would
probably be a worthy effort at some
point to yes we'll just do well first I
need to pull your changes and then we'll
do meteor remove mrt MailChimp there you
go there we go no we should stop getting
that air oh there we go look it made
those users uh so did you put a password
on the admin user uh-uh for now they're
just Apple one Apple one okay yeah i was
just kind of following a convention they
used on the accounts or the rules yeah
that's fine there we go I remember
seeing that picture on that website
looking for some pictures on one of mine
I was like hey yeah it's actually a
really cool speaker like phonograph
looking yeah thing like it's really see
yeah it's really expensive to get this
guy I can imagine it's like 400 bucks or
something yeah my roommate has some
insane speakers he does all that audio
step 2 oh alright so we signed in
that all looks good oops to episode yep
there you go okay so that looks good and
if I sign out I should be there we go
let's be logged in mm-hmm and then if
you log in and try and go there that's
my little kick you back out if you log
in as a normal user yeah what was the
normal user again uh no it was just
normal at example.com ok it was yeah
normal like example calm and then there
we go yeah so must be an admin access
this page that looks good nice work yeah
like coffee alert it's like an easy way
to just kind of get that stuff taken
care of yeah yeah doesn't seem like it
needed any kind of custom solution for
that no not really alright so let's sign
back in I've been volcom ah the one
thing I would say is you might want to
add another check to make sure that
you're in like the dev environment or
like not in production basically before
you add users because I think that can
uh we don't want that to run a
production right and that's right
exactly cuz like on first deploy we're
not gonna have any users in that would
run so okay so I'll look at a look that
okay all right uh so we're gonna finish
wiring up all this kind of all these
links and whatnot oh yeah we lost
I had a real piece of data in there and
we lost that so Oh what to go back and
all the one we were creating last time
yeah best one yep yeah that wasn't put
in them the seed yeah yeah we should
probably we could probably change the
scene file actually and do another reset
see fixtures here we go so 42 why is 39
coming out as the one on top there 30 oh
that's weird yeah maybe the dates are me
to eat how are we sorting that maybe oh
those dates are strings that's probably
why okay yeah they're not actually the
date format from the object yeah yeah
all right I'm just gonna but we'll make
a new one for now okay fair enough oh
the fun of seating yeah
that's not right simple guys want that
guy just copied it what the heck here we
go good so that's the mp3 and then what
the dark iframe once you have this in
there can't you go into your Rumble
Mongo and just grab it from there does
it show up as a object format for you
yeah yeah we could probably grab all
this and then that way it'd be easy to
throw in seat belt yes yes exactly you
got a claw key keyboard man no yeah I
had a better one but it doesn't work
with my Mac because it pulls into the
ps2 slide oh that's funny I I was
explaining to my son like I gave him an
old computer to play with and he's like
what what's this round port for this
never seen ps2 yeah all right i mean
it's it's like one of those gaming
keyboards it's like Oh use the ps2 port
cuz it's so much faster like it's
matters or something but I mean this one
is a gaming keyboard too and it's
expensive but it's just the ones like
some people like to really cliquey
cliquey ones and this is like my room it
has like three or four days as we get
home we could only do reviews on
all right okay so we got this guy yet
there we go play bars work in I so this
stuff shows up this shows up which prize
moments or something to make this
prettier yeah so you're even have that
added problem on amazing Oh minutes uh
yeah we don't have that in there so yeah
let's do that oh man my machines getting
all weird on me yeah Oh meant all that
screen recording yeah I guess so
so if anyone's watching this and you're
not from your moma j/s is like a very
well documented client-side library for
working with dates like parsing them and
manipulating them and dipping them and
that kind of thing and also just
displaying like it's it's it's like
string of time for most languages
unfortunately JavaScript does not do a
good job with that so moment is like
pretty awesome for that kind of thing
yeah for me coming from rels it's
basically like the active helper portion
that handles making everything pretty on
dates and times and oh man yeah all
right so client views that episode yeah
so we could do something like pretty
date or something you sure are a pretty
date mirror priority all right we'll
make that look better and then we got to
give it the format I guess
you can see the box all right so we can
do like template episode helpers will
probably make this like a global helper
actually because there's gonna be
multiple spots we need it but which
isn't here to start yeah pretty date see
just one function Wow in CoffeeScript
mode in my head apparently lots of
coffee script writing on your end I
guess outside of wine well not really
like I do all my public stuff in
JavaScript and so like my head's kind of
their most of the time but I'm gonna
client project that's all in
CoffeeScript so okay it's like clearly I
was just working on the client project
right like an hour ago um pretty date so
we just do moment and then you could say
this dot uh date and then that's gonna
basically convert it into a moment
object and then from there and i gotta
say like one of the great things about
moment is it's just documentation yeah
in general they do a great great job so
then we can just call format and we can
either give it a string because by
default it's gonna spit out the iso
string so we probably want something
similar to this guy will just copy this
for now modifying yeah just delete that
a time part of it yes for sure alright
oops ok so my Coleman don't make the
lint ramed
you have you have like GS lantern on for
the whole project uh yeah it's turned on
for like my not the project but actually
for our for like my any JS file it's
gonna run the winter okay is that like a
van plugin ah yes but I don't know which
one I'd have to look okay okay I was
just curious how that yeah uh so that
didn't work let's look here make sure I
think maybe our context isn't what we
think it is or something mmm me didn't
actually fire our code why not mostly
see pretty beads episode helpers this is
episode template wait i probably i don't
think i have a console open maybe hmm
there we go so did fire alright okay
alright so it's doing that right hmm off
cha again oh the return Ruby Josh
nobody's a coffee script ah let's do
funny there we go so this is looking a
little better monday april twentieth
2015 okay and so like i said i think
what we really want is register helper
Global yeah we'll get a global helper
that we can call on any template I don't
know if you knew this but you can just
start typing here whoops Richard bullet
right like when you're in the docs like
doc stop meteor calm if you just start
typing just like randomly talking yeah
yeah it'll it'll catch that typing and
then use the arrow keys and then when
you select one and hit enter it'll take
you right to that oh my gosh yeah it's
pretty awesome oh my gosh magical
alright so i'll call it pretty date be a
function it's not my opinion messes with
it a little bit alright and so I think
we have to pass the date for it now cuz
i don't know we should get access to
context i'm pretty sure actually so yeah
it's not pass the date let's just clear
that guy save it no we should still get
pretty dates oh there we go we do okay
cool oh that's good that's really
interesting yeah it's totally parsing
the string and turning it into a legit
date yeah a moment in using yeah well
and so um now what we want to do is fix
this guy up here right yeah yeah that
one's not since we made this I use
predate for that too yeah we can now
reuse that and so my suggestion will do
this in a minute we'll move that
register help her out to like a helpers
file or something mm-hmm because I think
it should be oh there's already one
there yeah Oh old small version does
we'll fix that too while we're in here
nice
okay Oh easy all right and then we want
to update the featured client use
featured episode oh yeah I wish so I've
also liked it automatically runs the
HTML winter as well yeah I had to turn
that off a tank yeah I really wish or a
way to like make it work with I should
look into that because I'd look what to
still run the linter and throw kind of
warnings but you knows yeah because it's
dot HTML instead of diet space bar or
something you know yeah I think that had
been better for art for been editor but
SVG's have to maybe numeric plugging
planners yeah all right so we've got
that so now we need to get the download
link in place which is this guy think we
just call it download so again we just
use the space bars mustache there mm-hmm
and it totally didn't work what did I do
wrong that's just pulling the download
link that you have from the collections
mmm should yeah it's looking Robo Mago
actually installed if you have it
selected on the the most recent one you
created okay you did okay I wonder if
this is a triple stash problem does it
not show when you mouse over it on the
bum it it's down in the river bottom I
don't know if you see it okay huh it's
like it's not oh you got an error I
think oh I see the problem we've got two
different styles here that's the mobile
interesting and this one is tablet and
bigger download don't know if I like
that mmm a little bit of duplication
good they couldn't get rid of the triple
stash
ah there we go that worked all right and
so can we link directly to an itunes
episode you should be up to right let me
see just get up you have to link to it
there and your collection so there is a
view and iTunes right here but I don't
know if it let's try that was that do
for us just takes us right here anyway
yeah so I'm thinking maybe we just
linked to the itunes in general i don't
i don't know that we can link
specifically to one episode over the
other so we just make this a general
probably hard-coded link to yes all
right
I'm making it says when you link to the
drag up so it'll show the list but that
it's highlighted in the list oh and part
of that the settings in the URLs but how
do we know like what's what skiing the
particular episode here I guess because
we only have one maybe that's why you
look in the URL it's this young deploy
meteor oh okay yeah so if you had more
episodes it would be highlighted hmm the
others all right so what I'm gonna do
for now we'll just we'll put an itunes
link helper in here and when we get
another oops we get another one will
come back to this and see if we can
figure it out 3 i'm guessing it'll have
something different functionality if
they click it from your phone that has
attained it yeah yeah but my preference
would be to figure out yeah if the jew
offices but for now we can just return
the string get an itunes link over here
and we're in here there we go
and that'll link to that one specific
episode too right and we've got another
one coming out tomorrow so we can prime
the next session play with that and
figure it out how we can get that you
know what I wonder if the RSS feed gives
us that this simple gasps okay yeah
sharing just get it my tunes ah well
that's just how does this kid put up on
iTunes does it do it automatically for
you yeah iTunes parses this feed okay
yeah I don't know we may have to grab
the spy yeah hi changes parts on his
feet of course it won't be being created
the link won't be in here my guess is
it's it looks like it's keying off this
title here mmhmm yeah cuz if you look at
the URL that you got a head like me or
twice in the URL this thing it's getting
and deployed with me or me dr see he's
getting to pulling me over here yeah so
my guess is they're they're like yeah
they've got like some kind of algorithm
that's stripping out stuff they don't
care about like the spaces and whatnot
in the title yeah it only grabs partial
title is what it was saying yeah yeah it
looks like it truncates so it looks like
it's grabbing this much right here and
then stripping out the dash ripping a
hand with yeah yeah it's really
interesting they're stripping out and
with
I get the dash but the and in the width
is kind of odd yeah all right yeah
bizarre that's what it is so the
transcript I think everything's hooked
w's have the play button in the
transcript all right transcript goes to
show new are you gonna keep that to say
transcript you're gonna make us a show
notes yeah let's make it to say show
notes all right but make more sense to
me is it the ER i mean you have to
change it twice since it's another one
yeah what's fun yeah there's probably a
way we could like merges us into one
yeah let's see what are they changing
just the div class yeah it's the dick
not just the div class looks like the
links themselves are getting extra
classes she's making them buttons
basically when they're bigger um I just
it don't actually look like buttons here
uh let's see when I sighs this guy down
yeah they just kind of become this link
list here huh okay it's interesting it
becomes blue though I was like as I go
maybe the color cut I don't know if I
was the intended I don't think so
probably not doesn't look right it's
like the default blue that you get
whenever you don't do any styling what
is that modal coming from transcript
modal data target and blue track yeah
but where is that defined you know I
mean oh yeah good point right where is
this model luisi surprise that works
when it's not in the template
the model yeah um it might be the upper
level template me City where's Anna
where are you model it's in home okay
just did a crap foot okay yeah there is
that as I should keep mine on my app
that I'm doing I feel like this should
be in the same I wonder what happens if
we move this I guess it depends on if
you're gonna use this model for other
things let me see I don't see any other
yeah I don't see any space bar template
saw it should be fine put it there come
on you know guessing that was the idea
to give you this design you can remove
the massiveness of it as you build out
the template what did we call that a
database make it the habit of looking at
Mongol just shorts very useful if you
draw out the one with the sessions I I
haven't but honestly like you know
generally I there's very few reasons i
would use sessions because they are
global you have to remember to like
unset them and yeah it's true if you're
going to be relying on them you have to
i was actually looking for a way to do
with like thought i saw an article about
doing like sessions for just template
level sessions that auto destroyed
oh yeah reactive VARs be the way to do
it and yeah that's that's pretty much
the way I do it ok now I mean it's it's
still a newer concept though right like
it's only been out since 10 yeah I
factory when I said using media or
anyway so I'm kind of like decipher
what's new and what's not yeah I just
remember like littering our code on
early projects with like all kinds of
setting sessions and then like having to
remember to unset them and it's not like
I'm here yeah alright so I'm curious we
edit this guy yeah okay so we do we get
the show notes here and it's mark mark
down supported um so what I'm gonna do
is well we'll use something to render
out that mark down I think it's showdown
maybe okay so we're getting so that's
that's what it's putting in a collection
so I haven't actually tried to run amok
alone in me organ there's a package that
they have oh it's just called mark down
I thought was called showdown okay maybe
I change it maybe they did they always
change sniffing well that makes it more
simple and it's like you're going to
look for mark pounds yeah yeah so I
think it under the covers I'm pretty
sure choosing showdown today rendering
but it just gives you a new kind of
markdown block helper that you can use
inside space bars oh cool and it still
works just like it normally would right
so you can the doc say there you can
still use like each and all those kinds
of things I guess this is just the
github flavoring markdown you'd have to
look at
the package and make sure it's showdown
and then go see what showdown supports
and so I you know that's probably an
interesting to look at two um I don't
know very many people have looked at the
meteor source code but yo when you go in
here it's really just a huge collection
of packages yeah um and so we can find
mark down on the page and look at it and
the package Jer should tell us most of
what we want to know yeah there you go
yeah they add showdown and showdown Jess
that they export the showdown space
there and and showdown Jess Jess Porto
Morgan yeah I don't really say do they
quick example is it for mark damn that
you expect you know most mostly parses
esky nowadays are get home flavor so
yeah I'm pretty sure like if if we don't
like this one mmm there's a couple other
ones on there as well yeah cool yeah
that still didn't save I oh we gotta
start back up after I yeah oh yeah what
did I do did you try and you forget to
running on the other port de fun nah
background in my my running task by
accident oh whoops so I suspend usually
i suspend in vim like when I'm gonna do
a gay commit or something I'll just
suspend them into the background oh
there it goes okay all rather than doing
t mux yeah yeah I should probably like
figure it out yeah I've got a little hot
key I just do control aah and it makes a
horizontal pain i can type it in down
low and then i can zoom in yeah I should
learn to mux better I really just use it
for a window switching more than
anything right now yeah i'll show you
some other time i guess i could doing
talk on team Oakes and them at might
meet up here pretty soon nice yeah there
we go we're getting the rendered
markdown now its jaw so the other nice
thing about moving this inside the
template is we could actually trigger
our events off this guy right so like if
we had a featured episode events we
could catch you know BS open and bs
clothes which drive motor yeah and we
can be a lot of that in my current
project I'm working on yeah it's kind of
handy but you know it requires the modal
I think to be inside the template where
you where you want to catch those events
all right so is that everything we got
those three buttons clickable now yeah
not cool that was everything time let's
go easy so I usually do when I do a git
add i'll do a dash p it allows me to go
through line by line and decide if i
need to commit that particularly
mailchimp we added two packages yeah
stuff looks right we changed that to be
register helper and it's more helpers
call the helper is less you kind of just
review the work he just did yeah
whitespace used to help her
move vancha links in the modal Oh are we
gonna put that deal on the seed or oh
yeah yeah we can do that to remove to
the Moodle ok so just commit this and I
won't work on the seed we get the
featured episode all wired and fixes
number one is so if i say fixes number
one here and we just do get my wish yeah
plus it'll close it'll actually close
the ticket for we could you please right
yeah oh that's that's legit ok yeah and
so if you're not fixing it but you do
want to reference it you can just say
refs number one in that would just like
this refs number one mmm okay and that
would that would make this link but not
close it good stuff yeah and then it's
kind of nice because then you come back
here and say oh like this this guy
closed it and you can pull it up you
what commit did all right nice
cross-reference all the things all right
um okay that is totally not what I
wanted three a lot of stuff I just tend
to run I just have a bunch of these up
basically mm-hmm let me connect in two
we don't have to reopen all your project
each time yeah or i can run them all on
different ports if I need two episodes
seven this is the guy who copies JSON
yeah nice okay
ah you forgot your pace mode yeah is
there what I like just make that default
paste mode yeah like whenever you're in
insert mode you want to go to pace mode
yeah I guess so I mean I just thought
well I basically have mine set to f2 and
it toggles it that's not good yeah yeah
because you don't want it to do it every
time yeah I could probably send you my
quick little thing that does it let's
try that guy and see how it looks like
something on this file error data can we
added that yeah great and the linters
complaining about line 12 here is it
because you have quotes around your
stuff like actually I think it's the ISO
date here probably will it work with
their quotes around the time on lockdown
yeah it should that's that's about it
okay json should work I notice how how
Mongol makes you tuck it in
we can try removing it used to round
them ok that works dude yeah the problem
is there's no easy way to do this yeah
these surround them and then you have
you just do it on the first one to
remove them and then you do a dot going
down all right well it's very confusing
as I said if it Lana made sense to me ok
ok anyone who doesn't use been we're
like what that still isn't it though um
it's kind of things you can playing it
out I don't know it complains about the
parenthesis is what it's complaining
about unexpected token so it claims it's
not expecting this guy right here mm-hmm
why not and so weird we missing I'm
something missing but I'm bad word
searches so maybe yeah I don't know kind
of it a loss here no winter still
complains you can try to delete some of
the fields underneath description to see
if there's a problem of those
just like Adam back in one time and then
we'll find out if that's the case you
know what we'll just do this episode's
that insert okay so that guy works
uh-huh oops i was thinking like the
other ones they do all the way up to
description so let's try the one you
have all the way up to description and
then okay see if it works one at a time
until we figure out which part of it is
messing up so we don't want the ID brute
force fix it oh no it's not thrown in
there Batum so as one of these so let's
try it right now this isn't thrown in
there either I must have had like an
extra add an extra bracket sitting
somewhere I think hey I didn't see
anything I didn't either but okay well
I'm not gonna complain if it works that
works right let's just try meteor reset
make sure it imports right to ma so your
link real fast oh I so data's not to
find ok let's try to bring that in then
all right you can check that out later
on lineman oh you da baus yeah thanks
mm-hmm I'll show you the part it gives
you the F to command or how we specify
that this is gonna be a date can you do
new date yes a good point new date
that should work okay that'll be
available in JavaScript yeah because
we're creating it here and the one with
copy phone was already stored so I will
try again media reset run hopefully no
airs awesome-looking gers life yay we
have such alright so now we just have to
decide what we want to play episode
button to do it could be a download link
or we could try to like use javascript
to activate the play bar up top yeah all
right what's the yeah if there's a
simple hook to it that would make sense
to me against you just wanted to you
don't have like an individual page for
the for the episodes when you click on
they just pull it into that frame up top
the past I guess we meet in the dogs api
docs pop cans a nice she found api docs
ah ap I got simple cast i FM schweet
yeah see if that helps this here is a
bunch of like get stuff want something
for the player while we going to use
something like this for the auto info
yeah yeah okay well we're gonna look at
grabbing the RSS feed but this might
actually be much much easier yeah cuz we
can just we'll just like set an API key
and we can make a consumer for it to run
every few minutes and consume the JSON
yes doesn't help us with the kind of
player yeah ah we do get ya know there's
nothing about player in bed yeah this is
all for an actual grabbing the info
itself ok well the embed is just a isn't
it just like a media player like a HTML
via player is it not just be control the
normal let's look it is an iframe
scott in sgv here answer the graphics
controls class 1 your speed time trend
time you rewind pause pause pause pause
play it is audio right there okay Oh
none now we're talking about an html5
audio tag of audio video down reference
um load plates and just play that's it
huh yep just play with parentheses on
the on the dominant element audio and
video elements you can use down the Dom
element you can just use play and it
starts playing an audio video and then
there's a pause a load but can we target
that because it's in the iframe um be
able to think so you go JP not to pound
JP audio 0 you see I can't find it using
jquery it is what let's try an iframe
iframe so we can find the iframe
whoa whoa p that JP play and see I can't
seem to find anything inside the iframe
let's see Kobe the Furious typer yeah it
seems like it right what if you type
fast I like 100 words a minute but I
that Tigershark when I was in high
school life I'm mudded got contents what
weapon when you call contents on it my
frame hmm content search to be needy
children looks like i can just call
frames select on inside an iframe
geez why is this complicated yeah let's
try it will try contents we may get like
a Miss cares what return via cross
origin policy issue here or something to
get the window object for frame you can
use window frames array ya hear your
failed to read the content document
property from HTML iframe element
blocked a frame with origin localhost
3500 from accessing a cross origin frame
what if what if you do yeah so they say
something about you can you can use
window frames array I don't think it
matters though because I'm pretty sure
the cross origin policy is set on the
iframe let's just hit this guy and see
what it looks like the security built-in
security feature is yeah yeah by default
like you can't just control one I frame
from your window unless that unless they
allow it um yeah I'm gonna I tell you
what we'll just stick a pin in it right
here and I'm gonna for now we can just
make the play episode be a download link
or something and then only no support
and see if there's a way for us to kick
off programmatically golf that and they
can tell us yeah that sounds like a
plane okay all right well thanks for
tuning in guys and we'll probably do
more early next week or later this week
I don't know we'll see let's see how my
schedule goes but thanks uh thanks for
