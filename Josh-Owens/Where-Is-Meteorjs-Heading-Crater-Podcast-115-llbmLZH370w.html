space dojo show and crater podcast we're
going to talk about where in the world
is meteor heading stay tuned so does for
Friday December night 2016 welcome
crater fans i'm your host josh owens and
this today we have a special edition and
i have two guest host with me Dean
Radcliffe welcome Dean hey good to be
back Josh and Chris Pena yeah how's it
going you yeah so yeah I don't know let
Chris reach out to me so you you have a
youtube channel right Chris yeah it's
called out a dead coffee dev coffee yeah
so I don't I'll probably like if you're
listening to this will put the link in
the show notes but if you're watching
this then down below it's just gonna be
a link to that but um yeah you reached
out to me and just said like hey I want
to come on the podcast and do something
and like I wanted to do something today
and uh Dean actually like I just hit him
off at the last minute and said hey I
want to be on a two cuz I totally gonna
talk about like the direction that
meteor is heading and and how things are
going and he had just listened to the
episode where we talked about or
not--has goodbye post and then I said
some things and then he he wrote a blog
post and response to that like a bee
Bobby were around but yeah I'll be busy
today because he also wrote a relevant
posts so rather than just talking about
a specific news post I thought we'd talk
about like where things are headed with
meteor and like I don't know I've had
this a lot of thoughts brewing in my
head recently uh with everything that's
being said and you know things that are
being said in the forums I you know I'm
I'm increasingly I guess turned off to
meteor and I think clients are as well
from what I can tell um I've I've had my
last couple clients asking like what
what should they be looking at like what
what's the right solution for them and
we even have you know I've been working
for a foot cardigan and we have a site
ready to launch and you know that we had
the same conversation like a week ago
should we scrap the whole thing and just
start over and my thoughts are like the
business benefits it doesn't make sense
to scrap it and start over I think I'm
of the mindset that it makes more sense
to launch it and then slowly migrated
over and try to try to slowly move it
over piece by piece but you still get
like that business benefit of having
something that gives you more control
over the internal processes that they
need to have control over for like
charging people and shipping stuff and
that kind of thing yeah so back up a bit
Josh are you talking about incrementally
migrating Out of meteor kind of service
by service yeah yeah definitely I think
it's probably along the lines of the
article that that Abba just posted which
is to say like you know um change out
the pieces that you can wear you can and
then hopefully start to minimize the
amount that you have to do all at once
you know like in that way like if you
can I don't know I guess there's no good
analogy for it i was gonna say like
ripping off a band-aid but mmm you
really want to set it up so that the
band-aids like soaked or something first
right like i don't know that's terrible
analogy but see like you know with with
meteor it's very hard to do that so if
you want to take it piece by piece and
you kind of replace it as you want
here's the one you know come on come on
come all packaged so it's hard to you
know be like that's why I think meteors
excellent for prototyping for the sheer
fact that like man I had to do a site
last year for a real estate company in
basically you know how to show these
properties have a login you know it's
kind of a simple thing but I was able to
do that in a weekend whereas like I were
to do that in c-sharp I feel like that
would have taken me maybe like three
weeks just for the sheer fact that like
I'm able to get you know something that
i love about meteors their accounts of
some man you're able to just have login
and all
education done without even thinking
about it that's like that's probably my
favorite feature of meteor legal grow I
would agree with you uh like it's a cool
feature but at the same time it comes
with its own share of problems like I
don't I don't do blaze anymore I feel
like there's like maybe there's a team
working on it and that's great but it's
like never really been that speedy for
me and like moving crater like when
Sasha redid telescope to go from blase
react like that was a significant speed
difference on the front end and then it
made it significantly easier to do SSR
as well which then is a perceived speed
difference for the consumer and I just
think like
I know what was I gonna go with this
plate thank you it's just I i don't i
don't think oh they account system and
so uh react like if i want to include
accounts facebook then all of a sudden
i'm getting blazed bundled into my front
end like that's actually pretty terrible
for a react develop early we're already
at this point where we're trying to
minimize the amount of JavaScript you
have to download before the client side
becomes functional and you know here we
are we're going to tack in like an extra
half a meg or whatever yeah well want it
yeah I want to back up a bit and
consider like if if meteor is something
that you have a current investment in
there's there's definitely some question
about is meteor going to be a platform
that people are choosing for new
development and if not what are the
alternatives I'm interested in to that
question I think I've heard a few
frameworks thrown around and I'd like to
kind of discuss what people might be
starting real time projects and to get
the kind of experience that Chris just
said he had where you can spend a
weekend getting a real-time web site I
want to know what other tools can
deliver that well I also have questions
i also have questions about if you have
an existing investment in meteor how to
kind of make choices like you said you'd
make a reacts to choice instead of a
blaze choice so that at least that part
of your code base is no is not you know
dependent on the further existence of
meteor well my question would be to
chris like when you work on that app
what did you need real time
I didn't necessarily need real-time know
so that again that wasn't something that
I needed with yeah yeah and I I feel
like that was a unique selling point was
was yeah you know I just gave a talk on
Tuesday at the local Ruby meter meetup
where I'm i'm selling real time a
hundred percent because i think that
that is the viable platform to start
exploring and you know as a developer
who wants to keep my skills advancing
and current there's actually a lot of
interesting things that once you take on
the notion of having an indefinite
subscription an observable of results
like once you take that on letting go of
that I think starts leading to the kind
of bad web user experiences that have
proliferated for you know the last
couple of decades i don't know i mean i
just i see like there are use cases
where it makes sense for real time and i
think there's a number of places where
it doesn't make sense for real time and
I feel like you're paying a heavy
hosting penalty cost choosing meteor and
trying to build something in the long
run that works with the systems that
they have available so I mean I just I
just I spent a lot of time recently
convincing businesses and myself and
people around me that like you don't in
general applications don't want a
point-in-time snapshot of data inventory
goes to zero you want customers to be
notified about it you've deployed new
code push that code up from the server
into people's browsers I don't see any
other framework that has sophistic how
many how many customers are actually
gilt groupe right like how many care
about like telling you at the point you
hit zero that you hit zero like as long
as I'm protecting you from buying the
product when I have none to sell like
isn't that good enough I don't know I
guess that is a call right like
customers still have a lot of calls to
make I
I can't make calls for the customers and
and and for every consultant but I can
definitely say that when I looked at the
history of of computing where you
assumed like before the web where you
were doing sockets programming
bi-directional communication and agency
on both sides in other words the client
is capable of initiating things and the
server is capable of initiating things
to code with servers that are not
capable of initiating things back to the
user is a historical anomaly and I think
that we're forced into it to serve up
documents at URLs but a rest endpoint to
a particular record is not a document it
is a stream of updates to that document
and to not have some kind of protocol
support for getting updates on that
document i think is kind of an excusable
at this point I know I I also say that
like I had to work in a non meteor web
framework just regular Express doing
direct database queries and you know
basically implementing rest endpoints in
that and it's it's not that it was like
a terrible experience that I couldn't do
it but it really felt like you know I
wasn't able to deliver a rich experience
that the server can enhance the users
experience in the context of the server
so yeah I i I'm not looking for
solutions that roll back my real time
and my customers aren't either ie I
guess I'm more of a fan of like a
solution that offers you the ability to
add on real time when it matters that's
more interesting to me right and that's
why I think in the long term relay or
Apollo like adding real-time update
subscription support like that's
interesting or looking at Phoenix and
channels and like you know if things get
more interesting in that space like I I
think those are very very interesting
things to
for the situations where i would
probably care about real time wha you
know that's so a product that I use it's
an alternative it's not just really full
alternative the meteor but it adds that
real-time functionality is pusher I
don't know if you guys have ever used it
but with C sharp you know it has like a
really bad react native support it's
something that you can literally you can
just see a function that like I agree
with Josh on the sheer fact that there's
certain there's certain things that you
want to be real time to certain things
that might not be an official time you
know if you're sacrificing performance
just because you want everything to be
real time you know it's you're not
really utilizing you know everything
that you needed to be doing there so
with what pusher you can see full
analytics of everything that that is
real time with your application I'm a
huge fan of it I'm a friend that works
there and he's uh he's a huge advocate
of it as well that's why I decide to
work over there so so is it like a pub
sub system where you might use a Redis
you could use a pusher yes yes exactly
like a paid service and you just you
push your notifications to them and then
they there's a client library you
install a little yeah you subscribe to
channels yeah the reason you subscribe
to future yeah yeah so I'm curious you
know like that there might be some
applications for that oh yeah and again
like that's gonna come down to cost I
think right but then like you've got to
compare the cost of that to the cost of
like hosting was the cost to host all
these people on a real-time meteor
server and what is what is the level of
support that you get if you have like a
dev ops team or whoever is ultimately
going to be operating it they sometimes
have their opinions about how things are
hosted and where things are hosted and
it when you tell them that they're going
to be hosting a meteor app and maybe
they haven't even ever hosted a node app
before there's a there's a learning
curve there it hasn't been too steep but
there's there's been some snags in that
department for sure yeah yeah I mean
it's definitely like there's a lot of
moving parts like so
the thing I'll say is I think meteors
good at a couple of things right and one
of them is real time one of them is just
giving I think what Chris was getting at
was like an easy dev environment that
just kind of operates and there's even
like a known deployment solution at the
end and you can point your customer to
that and put it on Heroku and have them
pay for it like that's an easy story or
silently with galaxy if that's you know
what matters to you and I think that um
you know that that's another piece of it
right so you've got ease of hosting
perhaps or known hosting you've got easy
setup for development you've got real
time support like those are great things
and I think that there may be going to
be hard to find our understand elsewhere
right like if you go look at feathers or
something like that like the story
changes slightly and maybe it's not as
easy right because feathers supports a
whole host of backends therefore the
scaling story is going to be a little
bit different than it is for meteor but
at the same time I think a lot of people
are just straight up turn off to meet
here because you only have Mongo yeah as
anyone heard followed the the guy in the
forum is diacono Theodore who made a
something called meteor reddit Redis app
log oh this is yeah let's see the poster
though ok yeah it's a supposed like drop
in for meteor that kind of cuts off the
OP log tailing as the source of
reactivity and it installs a Redis well
it assumes that there's a Redis that can
be used to create channels like Phoenix
channels to create topics like you would
I think in pusher whatever the
terminology is so there is this
interesting it's only about 24 days old
but it's gotten a lot of activity on the
form I'm very intrigued if performance
tests once we get our performance
testing set up I certainly want to try
I am attracted to this because it is a
drop in kind of speed up and I think I I
wonder whether it helps people get a
little more comfortable saying like oh
so you know reactivity doesn't have to
come from Mongo I no feathers defines
these notions of services and like they
automatically emit notifications when
when they're changed and I think that
map's a little bit more on to this Retta
soft log implementation so I think
people are playing around with where
your reactivity comes from and that it
certainly might not be Mongo a blog
tailing for the four co2 I don't know so
if so last time you know I again I
haven't been following community as
closely as i was earlier this year I
know I know the initial plan was to
basically take Apollo and replace meter
back in that way everyone can have their
support for any day basis that they want
is that still the plan where where they
kind of hat with that so what I'll say
because I actually brought this up in
the forum's the other day with sashko um
you know I don't I don't understand why
there hasn't been more communication
around this right like I feel like this
is a failure on their part because they
announced like 1.5 is gonna be Apollo
integration and he came back and said
like um developer like restart speed was
more important so they've been focusing
on one point four point two and for
those that maybe don't know like if you
listen to show you probably know but if
you don't know like there's basically
one guy working on a meteor at MMD cha
um and that's significantly slow down
speed and so if you read between the
lines right like it's they're saying
like him working on speeding up restart
x has kind of shifted the focus away and
I'm a little I'm a little surprised to
hear that answer because I feel like if
they care about Apollo in the long term
and they feel like they could shift
leave your developers into it because
it's clearly their long-term play at
this point um I would think that they
would offer more in the way of
documentation and like they're there
saying like the response from sashko is
like oh people are already doing this
but no one's documented it no one's put
it out there like here's how we're doing
it here's the things we run into here's
how like apparently there's a repo I
haven't even looked at it to get to work
with the the login database setup with
Apollo with the with the meteor kind of
schema and so I I feel like that's
really kind of where they might be
falling down um so I don't like Woodall
to make of that post from sashko but to
me like it wasn't enough right because
you're telling me well we took time to
release one point four point two but one
point four point two is out like we
appreciate that and that's great but
like what's what's next what's 1.5 look
like is that a thing are we are we
saying that's not a thing like there's a
lot be little more communication about
the the migration path for existing
customers yeah yeah exactly yeah I mean
I I certainly have been spending a lot
of time trying to kind of hedge my bets
so to speak trying to ensure that you
know the largest possible fraction of
our development efforts are going into
code that is basically reusable across
potential disruptive technologies I'm
not trying to say that I can see the
future or future proof it but there's a
few technologies that aren't hard coded
to a product so like you know I've been
looking a lot at redux because it kind
of encourages your your business logic
that steps you from one state to the
next of your system you know I've been
picturing like systems as these like
state machines and you know actions come
in and then they either move to a new
state because the action was valid or
they throw an exception and you know
invest I've been investing my learning
resources in like actions Redux reacts
you know very purely functional things
but I've definitely got my ears eyes and
ears peeled for anything that I can find
out about Apollo
I was in the slack channel I've read
every medium post i responded to a few
but um yeah I don't feel like I could
speak very intelligently at my company
yet about Apollo but I can speak to some
of these technologies that have been
very easy for me to pick up and seemed
like a very sound investment in you know
in learning that that is is not vendor
locking
yeah I'm sorry like I was half-listening
I was actually like looking at this post
so it has been updated since I said
something three days ago there was a
further discussion from sashko and Thea
about their they're going to maybe write
a blog post and have some examples of
how to use meteor and Apollo together so
that that's certainly good to hear yeah
I think it it definitely like leaves us
in this weird state and I agree like we
definitely want to avoid the vendor
lock-in I think you know to me the
biggest piece were missing here and the
piece that was supposed to be 1.5 and we
talked about this a little bit before
the show with with Chris like I really
think that having full NPM support would
help tremendously here and what I mean
by that is actually moving the libraries
themselves to mpm and therefore or yeah
to NPM and then I can do like yarn or
NPM install meteor and get everything
that I need and you know we've become a
real like no strings right like no
longer Pinocchio like no yeah package
system like we've we've officially
joined the node community and I think
that could potentially do good things
for the community in the long run but
again like a lot of that was placed on
hold and now we're hearing weird things
like you know one point four point two
was needed so we took time for that and
like there's really no need for any
Apollo integration it sounds like they
really just want to do a couple blog
posts and it'll be good um I just I
don't know they could today it feels
weird because they they took a lot of
money and I feel like they aren't
talking about a whole lot yeah well and
I don't know what the best resources are
hopefully people will respond to the
show with some of those things and if
anyone wants to respond to me to this
point
I'm curious if there's going to be with
1.5 is everything going to be through
Apollo or is it going to be Apollo plus
the existing stack I'll refrain from you
know expressing my preference for which
one it is I just kind of want to know
what what they're going to say again I
kind of feel like the existing DDP stuff
is pretty good for shuttling the
messages around that I think my
educational classroom-based
collaborative application requires I
think DDP can get the messages around
and that's kind of what I've been
focusing on but you know I'd love to see
more guidance on what the future being a
meteor developer looks like with Apollo
yeah it's something I kind of want to go
back to your talking about catches
everything how so when I left off with
meteor this more more than likely last
year I was going I don't know if you
guys from heard of mantra mm-hmm so
that's something that I was like
following pretty closely cuz I thought I
thought it was super interesting to be
able to have these kind of set of rules
like this is the way that you do things
and have more structure because you know
I remember the day when you said you
know start a vanilla meteor app it would
have no structure to it and you know
there's all these different people doing
different structures good mantra kind of
set one way so it's sort of getting kind
of you know I went and looked back at
the mantra get help repo and see that
there's like no activity at all yes so
that's that you know whatever whatever
projects like that's you know they take
up a lot you know they get a lot of
leeway towards the beginning and then
they start to slow down a little bit
disheartening you don't want to come
back to the community when you see stuff
like that happen I know what happens all
the time but what I mean this switch
from you know NPM or from from
atmosphere at 10pm well you know
atmosphere still there these all these
packages that you would use it started
slowly dying because I'm camp support
there are alternatives and stuff so yeah
yeah so okay like and maybe this this
has led to my philosophy of preferring
the libraries over frameworks um like
looking at how well react has done right
or angular or I don't know like any any
number of whom right like you can you
can argue they're all doing really great
um I think to me the problem here we
still have this ivory tower approach of
you know I I said something about the
problem with accounts Facebook back in
July I don't want to say like okay I can
look up the ticket and see what it was
and actually spent a lot of time doing
investigation work to pinpoint where the
problems existed and that led to a
conversation that happened over the next
couple months like we only got i want to
say sometime before thanksgiving we
finally got the approval to merge the
fix for accounts facebook i mean this
wasn't a huge effort um and the problem
is like it had to be approved by tom
coleman um you know there was discussion
with uh Zoltan and I think sashko was in
that like it just turned into a huge
thing to make a simple change to get
blazed out of my react and like I think
that that just speaks to like even
though they're asking for core
contributors and everyone's like oh yeah
we could only want to help um like it's
just not it's still not easy because
like you're usually faced with all we
need to have some internal conversations
or you know like you just can't
participate in the process very well and
I think that that's it's really
interesting to watch the dichotomy
between the two projects of meteor and
Apollo because I think Apollo has taken
the opposite approach like let's be open
let's let's give you people to commit
rights right out of ya let's get all the
graph ql people together for a summit
well yeah yeah again that's another
point that I you know I told them they
needed to have a conference you know you
I just had the second one that was I
wanted to have in San Francisco i just
had space cam 2 point 0 like that was
supposed to be
meteor conference and they said no we
want to do our own and I said okay I'll
do like a regional one I just don't I
don't think in the long term like
they're super committed to meteor I
think we're gonna see galaxies shift
into something else like either Apollo's
gonna spin out to be its own company
with a new cap table or galaxies gonna
spin out to be its own company at some
point like something's gonna change um
and I think that meteors just gonna kind
of get like in the split just drop to
the floor right because to me and I said
this all along like show me a hosting
company that that's paying for a
framework development or even language
development right like joyent I guess
did for a while but that didn't go good
places right yeah well engine yard with
uh kind of rails helping out I mean that
that like there I don't know like Ezra
created merb an engine yard but it I
like I say I share your doubts and like
the rate of the velocity with that they
accept pull requests like lets you know
we've definitely seen that that has been
sticky at times I mean I think I am last
year I got a five at least five projects
merged you know minor contributions of
mine and then I still maintain like I've
had more contributions accepted to rails
than I have for meteor hey lack of
effort I had the one where a matar was
kind of described a similar thing to
what I wanted and like we both submitted
a pull request at the same time and he
actually said oh you want this one like
i'll i'll let you have this one it took
nine months but i got it in but i don't
want to be labor like that necessarily
but you're right like the community
involvement like it it sets a tone for
the community and i do see things going
well an apollo and like community drive
so i mean i'm optimistic and sashko
knows the live data and DDP kind of
protocol i can just I can put myself in
the shoes and just imagine you know
after you he'll like Dan abramov
three act or redux and react you know or
he he gets something out there and it
gets popular and then he has all these
thoughts in the back of his mind and now
they've got to be a two point oh it's
got to be rebuilt from first principles
you know and I'm sure that the first
principles are going to be really good
in a Apollo um so you know hopefully
with the right kind of community
involvement um it'll be easy to adopt
that's what I really like about danam
like a huge fan of him he's always
communicating non-stop you know he's a
huge figure just for the sheer fact that
like not only did you know he'd make
Redux but he constantly has blog posts
out there he always keeps you updated
you know he's hugely wealthy you know
yes a few um tutorials on egghead do you
know he's really taking advantage of all
of his resources and I really do you
appreciate that from him Danny broomall
for president yeah oh it could be better
than that current yeah he's a really
yeah wonderful communicator and and in
the end like I've had a hard time
explaining to people sometimes that like
when I've invested time and Redux and
explaining it to people and coding up
projects in there it gets evaluated kind
of in the same breath as like any other
framework but what it's forced me to do
is write more of my logic in pure
JavaScript functions in functions that
can be tested without mocking them and
etc and that are not database dependent
and that has been a godsend and the
whole principle of functional core
imperative shell has been pretty
unpracticed before me and web
applications until until now so you know
I maintain that like good architecture
and you know using being able to use
pure functions to control each state
transition that your app takes is is a
really nice way to work and it's
actually very similar to a game I
haven't done a whole lot of game
development a little bit in college then
I like put it down to make crud
eps and like I feel like I'm awakening
from a dark you know place of crud crud
ups where things don't come at you it's
all client initiated you know and like
the server has no agency and that's you
know that's it's not how a user gets
installed into a game and a game things
come at you and I think that like in the
web thing should should come at you and
I need to be able to deliver those come
at you experiences so I you know one of
the things I've tried to do is invest my
energy and things that are not going to
easily be deprecated right so pure
functions won't be deprecated another
thing that won't be as 2019 and you know
a josh like I spoke at your first Space
Camp about promises because I was like
you know this is a technology that
doesn't matter which JavaScript
framework you're using knowing about
them is going to be super valuable and I
have a have a Deans tip for what you
should study next now that everybody's
like mastered promises and you want to
know what that is observables oh yeah
it's the one step up it's the
generalization of promises to multiple
values it has a lot in common with
meteor DDP subscriptions but it's
slightly different and it's the the kind
of core data type that um you know I've
meteor wasn't described as a system of
observables but in fact it is right and
when you can understand that you know
you're looking for a solution if you're
if in like in my case you need that kind
of real-time eNOS and I know every app
doesn't but um didn't you know
observables is a kind of keyword you'll
want to include in your searches because
increasingly it's going to become
potentially part of JavaScript language
just like promise did and it really
embodies this notion of you know getting
multiple notifications from a server
over time for example and a whole bunch
of other things so that's my tip yeah
so are you using like our xjs or what do
you yeah I am because it's just the
Camino completest implementation it is
not the smallest in your bundle though
the new version 5 is is is better about
that and if you're using webpack you can
tree shake just the core parts that that
your app needs and the Combinator's that
it offers are really really excellent
it's like if you know you used Ruby and
you know the Ruby innumerable methods
are just super handy and so you have
that and more coming to you courtesy of
our xjs also I don't think that's a bad
technological investment because the
principles of our xjs if you look on the
reactive xio website you'll see that
reactive x is a family of technologies
that is been ported to python ruby
dotnet it came from dotnet i learned
about it in the under the moniker of
link when I was a c-sharp developer and
it's been a you know really put forth
with a lot of careful planning as far as
like the API to be adequate and complete
mathematically airtight and so it's not
a bad investment because it's a way of
thinking that is portable to not only
other JavaScript frameworks but other
languages so yeah yeah and there's I
think there's definitely a lot of things
you can look at right like ma backs or
redox or or xjs or and it looks like i
was even just looking at my back's David
have like an RX mob X interoperability
package that you can install yep I mean
you're talking about like replacing
tracker a mini Mongo to some degree
right yeah tracker I'm done with track
after all of my like 10 minute videos
diving into its internals and and them
and writing you know ways to go from
reactive ours to promises or reactive
ours to observables like I'm just like
you know reactive are and and its ilk
it's been outdone by observables you
know like that's that's the that's the
abstraction you guys
we're looking for yep yeah Emily and you
know I I'll say this again I think to me
a lot of this boils down to and this is
why I maybe lean towards libraries
versus frameworks at this point is that
it's it's easier for a four-person team
focused on our xjs or observables or Bob
X or whatever to outpace anything that
the meteor team could have done at its
at its height of people that I had right
like it's definitely down here now and
they used to have a huge staff um and
like you know if it's great greens fan
smart smart guy like that guy i could
sit down put his mind to task for two
weeks and like come out with awesome
innovation and really push things
forward that was great but at the same
time lake he can only spread around so
far you know and so I think to me some
of these things are just better handled
by other other teams other people like
it doesn't make sense to put all your
eggs into one basket and you know the
meteor community built everything from
the ground up and it did it happened at
a time where I think maybe you had to I
don't know like I don't I don't I don't
think you could have had something as
polished and easy to use as they had
when they launched one point oh um if
you did you stun something off the shelf
I don't know I think it would have been
it would have been tough you can see
like that's why I think meteor was like
you said so successful at the beginning
right from a time where people were
looking for that one you know one answer
that does everything for you right now
it's very modular you know you pick you
know your mob X you get you react you
get your back end what do you know it's
great it's kind of settled out which is
which is different than than the time it
was back then you know everyone was
looking for the answer so I think meteor
didn't like kind of going back to you
know the longevity of everything is
meteor took too long to start siloing
things out yeah and I think they're
doing good job with Apollo like I said I
that's my next thing that I'm going to
like learn from start to finish because
I love graph ql I've used it several
times and I just I just like the way
that you can get data to the front end
uh you know having the right API
controller after API controller to do
small different things you know cig data
I think that craft ql is works excellent
for it but yeah just kind of going back
I think meteor was the one-size-fits-all
at the beginning it was good but they
didn't move quickly enough to settle
everything you know yeah I you know and
I would say this like I'm gonna I'll
give a shout out to Sasha here too
because he is working really really hard
to get a version of telescope out that
is using graph ql oh and replacing the
meteor piece of it I think he's still
using it as a build tool maybe um but
there's no reason to say he couldn't
replace it with something like crea trap
create react app um and then have Apollo
on the back end and just kind of
consuming that and you know he's done
some interesting things like he's he's
got all this schema already written up
for how telescope functions now so he's
actually written I think he's written it
someone's written it but it's a simple
schema I think he's just using this
simple schema NPM package to consume the
simple schema he already has and then
he's generating all the the kind of
schema for graph ql off that mmm yeah
that'll that'll go a long way in terms
of like helping people who already
understand the telescope app like kind
of convert that idea over can I Chris
can I ask you like how you use graph ql
a couple times do you feel that you know
you get something more from it than
could be accomplished with like a couple
different meteor subscriptions like
though the paradigm where you'd like
subscribe to like a parent collection
and then a child collection and just
kind of change your subscription
parameters like what can you help me
like the value that you feel ref ql
delivers above that
so I think you you essentially could
accomplish the exact same thing just
kind of what I what kind of felt right
was being able you know throw a
multi-tiered object at your server once
it's set up in getting exactly what you
want back so i think that's that's the
difference that you know if i need a
view i need a very you know very
specific things you create these
relationships to everything and you
haven't come back to you exactly like
you want it i think that it feels a lot
more natural that instance oh yeah
totally totally and i think you know the
other thing and and this is a thing that
maybe you don't care about when you're
launching or when you're putting out of
the first iteration of a product for a
client but it kind of matters too
because if you if you care about scaling
like it's there comes a point where
Mongo like isn't necessarily the right
solution for everything you need at your
site right and the promise of graph ql
is that you can change out the resolvers
on the back end to work with whatever
database you need and so you could move
part of your app off into postgres if
that makes sense for you you know and
you can move you can have other parts in
Mongo if you wanted to so like you start
to get this structure in this control
over the structure that allows you to
easily kind of allow the backend team to
do what they need to do for what makes
sense for scaling on their end and you
don't necessarily have to worry about
things like versioning or changes on the
front end like as long as they know the
data they want and you figure out how to
keep delivering that to them yeah well
it's an entry it's an interesting it's
an interesting firewall right like
between the implementation details of
how the data is provided and the one
that constructs the query so that's you
know generally speaking a good idea to
yeah well I guess at that at that point
you're talking about like a contract
between the front and the back end right
and like the data you want is the
contract than being like REST API
endpoint calls that change or need
versioning or anything like that yeah it
certainly sounds like a step in the
right direction
I think that like from the when you when
you zoom in to a running meteor app and
you you know go to your chrome dev tools
and your network pain and your web
socket and your frames and you see those
individual messages going back and forth
mmm like those kind of convinced me that
like that's those messages themselves
the wire protocol DDP is is independent
of which database those things are
coming from its always but at the same
time like the only practical production
and implementation of that is still
Mongo right yeah yeah and there's
there's Evan Lee some quirks with it
like the fact that like you only sync at
the level of top-level fields so you
know there's a that can potentially have
impact on your either your document
structure if you cave in that way or
your network performance if you you know
except that's I'm sure there's room for
more intelligent patching than GDP has
that I'm sure graph qo because it lets
you custom fit the query that you're
making it can probably convey those
diffs in a smarter way I'm just looking
forward to getting to see some tutorials
on that that that kind of really show me
the the guts and not just the high-level
benefit if i'm not using multiple
databases or don't have a very deep
query tree yeah yeah yeah I think so to
me it's still a lot of overhead if you
have a small project that's hitting one
database and you're not like if you
wouldn't create more than one or two
rest endpoints then it might feel like a
lot of overhead to create the schema and
the resolvers and like go down an entire
path yeah I think you're talking about
like one time kind of pain points so
yeah I can think of a client though like
when I was doing that node work that
wasn't meteor and we were doing it would
sway ger and points actually oh my god
creative like you sure yeah a dozen you
know would I rather create a dozen
swagger and points by copying and
pasting config file stuff or would I
rather like write a graph ql resolver
I'd rather write a graph to that
yeah yeah totally and that's see the
latest shop that I was doing I was
working on coding boot camp software I
here in Houston and the amount of API
you know different API comes we had to
make that were just you know something's
a lot of them were son lawyer a lot of
you know and just having to do that was
so repetitive like you said I was
copying pasting constantly and I would
be like man if I could just do this one
time and then be able to you know create
relationships and everything I would go
through that pain instead of having to
write all these small different crud
calls it was ridiculous yeah so it
sounds like I mean I'm feeling a
consensus here that maybe the data layer
makes sense elsewhere would you guys
agree with that
elsewhere outside of what meteor like
live query not being Mongo and like the
entire stack I'll just say that there
there are a lot of options right so
there's that option there's this you
know Retta soft log option that's
emerging that's kind of a you know
bleeding edge thing but you can try that
there's definitely Apollo which has a
lot of backing and community support so
you know as far as that like this other
you know what's your plan B and C like
you have them you have them yeah so I
think the other piece is the build tool
right and like I don't I don't think
anyone would argue that meteor has a
great build tool yeah you know what I
here's one of the investigations that
that was really a journey for me so I
wrote I was fond of meteor packages so I
wrote a thing called up a package
generator a package boilerplate
generator that was like reactive and
stuff I was like hey this is how I'm
going to deliver my assets and then you
know NPM integration was coming along
and I'm like well why do that unless I
if I write an NPM module it you know
just has to take in a few variables the
dependencies injected and then I can
keep it in NPM and feel you know less
you know locked into for an ecosystem so
that I was looking at NPM generators and
sure enough Aaron Oda and Khedira had
published an NPM a boilerplate generator
then I was using that for a couple of
things but then I just went back to
yau-man yeoman which I hadn't used for
two years but sure enough they have a
really sophisticated uh you know right
at es6 based npm library with all the
bells and whistles of linting and
testing and and the tests ran right away
which was refreshing my meteor tests are
a disaster they still don't perform as
quickly or as predictably as I require a
test suite to run and this npm write
your own npm library boilerplate it's
called generator a Babel boilerplate I
believe and it the tests run it uses
what
pack to build and run your tests it uses
mocha and it just it just friggin works
you open up test runner HTML and you
don't even have to run a server other
than webpack to continually lint and
test your code and that experience as a
library developer like you asked me do I
want to invest my time putting my stuff
in atmosphere or on NPM well that's a
clear answer even if I'm going to
continue to use meteor I want to invest
my time writing libraries for NPM and
and you know the solutions there's just
a story of my moving farther and farther
from what the meteor core team offers to
looking to then Aaron Oda and then
looking to you know the general
JavaScript community and who's the
winner well it's the largest pool right
Josh it is I'm very much of that opinion
right because if you look like still to
this day I think there's more articles
more thought share more books about our
spec versus any other testing framework
in the rails community and I just I
think that they ultimately had slightly
better tooling but only because they
were out there like grabbing that
mindshare and getting people to
contribute and welcoming that
contribution in a way that the community
move forward with hopefully better code
right and so I I'm definitely of that
mindset and I gave a very similar to
talk to what you're saying when I was in
New York at meteor camp NYC which was
you know now's the time embrace embrace
node embrace mpm ecosystem like get your
dependencies from their use react router
don't use flow router right because I
mean like I had the conversation there
and with Aaron Oda privately and he said
yeah I don't think we're gonna update
flow router anymore yeah and Chris
mentioned the mantra solution also
looking a little old and and and left I
kids call it abandonware but it's really
just like left to the community to
decide if anybody wants to maintain
you know right and in I appreciate that
he came out and said like hey someone
take over this but at the same time like
I think the practicality of that when
you let a community kind of wither on
the vine is is it's less and less likely
for someone to step up and kind of
become that in into that leader role you
know like now I think that there were a
number of people that would have been
super interested in regards to meteor
and helping out and taking over in a
leadership role probably a year ago even
two years ago um and and they could have
involved the community a lot more now
and that's what I feel a lot of that
ivory tower stuff comes in and to me
like I don't know it's it's hard because
I you want to see meteor kind of like
hug all the latest and greatest things
like ah yes we're a big happy community
but at the same time like you do have
this established community of people
that have an application and they don't
necessarily want to see breaking changes
come out um and you know this this kind
of goes back to 1.3 as well like that
that should have been meteor to point o
my opinion I know because it was such a
huge departure from how we made
applications like before and after and I
just had I just had a guilty pleasure a
week where I wrote a bunch of code in
lib like the old days I used imports
between um which was nice but yeah I was
I was so overwhelmed by trying to keep
up with like you know fast forwarding my
logic from the first media rep I made a
0.9 that chess board thing that I've
presented on and then and then getting
that thing up to 1.4 point2 I had so
many decisions to make along the way and
then I said hey I wonder if limbs still
works and yeah for now and we'll see
like it for if lake limbs should break
if we get things like tree shaking and
code splitting and that kind of thing
and
it should break right like I think it's
probably the wrong decision to model
load everything I think the imports
folder was a terrible punt but it was a
punt because you have all these at this
point you call them legacy applications
right and that's the same reason don't
have web back in meteor today as a quick
build tool is because like you gotta
support all these applications over here
and even though there's new ones over
here that want to be built like I think
you start to get into this like it's
really hard for you to innovate and move
forward as you have a lot of code like
it takes a lot of effort and at this
point we've reduced the team to one and
therefore you know I'm much more
interested in things like create rack
that react app or and that is hard thing
to say five create react yeah or um if
you say it really Jess fast it sounds
like crap react but so don't drop any of
those letters Oh next Jas explain a
little bit about that and feathers too
if you've heard about that Josh yeah so
um feathers feathers is probably closer
to a meteor as it stands right now in
the fact that they have a bunch of
integration points in the back end and
then you can create services in the
there they're just basically pushing the
data out and then they have a library
similar to do you want to go with
tracker on the front end that's reactive
and so then you can use something like
react or angular on the front end so
you're really just kidding like that
that bridge in that back end um so
they're just kind of providing harnesses
but they've got a lot of them right and
so that's kind of interesting I've
actually been working on the next crater
cough and Eric Chris key from feathers
is going to give a talk on building in
an API in 30 minutes yeah good API in 30
min um inning real-time and rest uh yeah
yeah I think so yeah I mean that's
that's where i think you know things
should go rest should be an edge case of
real time where you're just not
interested
um yeah with with feathers though i did
a video / feathers actually about back
in march i don't know if you ever saw it
but I am the the fact that you can get
AP is up and running that fast with
others is awesome and you still have the
broad the real time that's it I said
yeah yeah I totally agree uh it is it's
very very intriguing to me I still think
like it's one of the interview with the
feathers team is one of the biggest
traffic generators on my youtube channel
which I mean if you think about it I
have how many meteor videos and like
that one still drives in more traffic
than some of the meteor videos um and so
I think that's that's maybe another
piece I've used to gauge this like I
decided October of last year to move
away from meteor slowly but surely
positioning things and that's why you
know craters tagline started to change
and like I've I've been slowly
converting from meteor jazz club to
space dojo and those kinds of things
because I knew like the longevity of
meteor like I could see it start to
trend off and Google you know um so yeah
I've definitely been thinking about this
a lot haha but I did think about a lot
but um the other one that i mentioned
next j/s is kind of interesting it's
probably more along the lines of create
react app in the fact that it's it's
more of the front end when you install
it it does it comes with its own router
which has been interesting and it's
generating it's universal so in that
aspect it's a little bit closer to
meteor and you're you just have to make
sure that your what's the call now
there's a call that you start when
you're
react app is mounting up and you want
eject initial props mom so as long as
you put your your data fetching and get
initial props it will run you'll get
initial props on the server and then
build your component and then send it
down as HTML for the page in question so
it's it's doing SSR by default and as
long as everything's packaged into that
get initial props then it'll it'll run
right there and deliver the data with it
the other upside is with using it it can
detect when links are on the page and it
will use a service worker and go pre
fetch the data for the links on the page
so that it's ready to go when you click
that link it should be like that you
know nice that's a big
sorry my honor is taking the dog next
door um so yeah I think that's a big
piece of it that it's interesting as
well I think the thing that that is
maybe weird at this point is like you do
have to mak your routes to like actual
pages underneath so like if I want a
page i need to create it in the pages
folder and that's how the router works
so i don't i don't know that you could i
haven't tried it yet but i don't know if
you can have dynamic routes necessarily
right now but that is something that's
on their list to work on and I think
that's a big piece that like once it's
done it'll it'll be a big thing and like
it'll be don't make next Jess way more
useful in my mind so yeah I'm just I'm
just now hearing about next I as I so is
this gating yeah a lot of a lot of
traction you see you kind of see I see I
see other people talking about it like I
I spent a day and imported a crater comp
from it was just static HTML and i was
using Jekyll uh and github pages to host
that thing and the problem i had like
and this is maybe gonna be the laziest
thing i say but I hate editing HTML like
it's not my favorite thing especially
just like straight HTML and when it's
like repetitive like that's annoying to
me um and maybe that's the most
programmer ething i can say but so i
ended up spending time like putting it
to next so that i could just create a
JavaScript object that I would hand to
the page like anytime I want to create a
new conference I just fill out this
JavaScript object with the relevant info
and you know create a new page and tell
it to import that object and I'm done
you know like it it just works and its
server side rendered and all that kind
of stuff so it's it's nice and I think
that it's unah pinion ated on what the
back end is right like you could bring
in
observables and I think our xjs works
easily with Falkor right um so you could
use something like Falcon on the back
end if that made sense you could use
Apollo I know I think sashko has had a
conversation with the next team maybe so
but I I'm very very interested so that's
where my head's at right now like I'm
looking at graph ql on next Jess and
kind of paying attention to the issue
trackers and if if they can tweak the
router to work the way that I need it to
work then I'm gonna be super excited
about using it for a lot more things and
it comes with webpack under the covers
so I don't even have to worry about
messing with web package just kind of
works yeah yeah i think the the build
tool stuff that that you can get with a
web pack like when i was writing that
standalone npm module I didn't even
think about my test suite where the fact
that the test testing and stuff was
written in gulp i've never written gold
before but again i was just the library
author like writing tests and watching
them past reactively in hundredths of a
second which is ice versus like you know
the rebuild times and stuff so there's a
lot a lot of things have moved on
definitely since like the one point 0
days where that fight for mine share is
is an interesting one yeah it's been a
good hour already huh yeah I think we
should definitely call in here heading I
don't want to go beyond that but this
has been an interesting talk I think you
know my mind I guess advice to people is
probably along the lines of Bobby's
posts which is find ways to minimize
your reliance on meteor itself and try
to embrace the ecosystem at large um and
and you know
just slowly replace the things that you
can wear you can if if you have an
existing app right and like that's the
biggest question that I get a lot is
just should I move off media well I
that's more of a business question than
it is a technology question in my
opinion like if your business is running
and profitable and not suffering
problems because a meteor like
absolutely you should not move off of
media right now um because it's not it's
not broken it's not impossible to make
changes to it it's not like I think it
it also works the same way it did you
know you can roll back to one point 0 if
that made you happy or go back to 1.2
and like those are totally options that
work fine and if it's functioning then
great but I think at some point you'll
hit problems and i think there's less
and less people around to help you with
those problems so yeah adding adding on
to pet I think again a lot of people get
caught up in the technology like you
just said there's a time place for
meteor for instance I'm having a friend
come over this weekend and we're going
to be working on app and we're probably
going to use meteor just because again
it's fast it's it's like an easy way to
go but hey if I'm gonna write banking
software I'm probably not gonna use
meteor for that you know if I'm gonna
write you know some some really security
you know needed a application that that
look like if you said in banking
software I'm not going to use meteor for
that but hey for a prototype for for
something that that needs to be done
quickly and fasting and needs that
response that a real time functionality
I'm definitely gonna use me or so but
definitely look at look at um what
problem you have and pick the best
technology for it yeah yeah I would
agree with that and just to say my my
final advice is that the three three
areas to invest some research in the I
distributed logs systems that
communicate by sharing a distributed log
append only systems I'll have some links
on that looking at putting more of your
code in pure JavaScript functions for
the way
and observables for the win yeah all
right awesome well thanks guys for
coming on and taking the time to chat
you know what i think i'm gonna do is
actually put this put this out twice
we'll put this out as a space tojo show
as well so don't go to both feeds so
everybody gets to listen to it yeah yeah
awesome all right thanks Josh yeah all
right guys tune in I think maybe we'll
have one more show I gotta talk to Ben
do good and see if he's available next
week maybe but tune in next time guys
and we'll have another news filled show
next time this video has been in space
dojo production you can click the learn
more button to find out more about us at
space dojo com or in click the subscribe
button to get notified about new videos
who put out each week thanks for
watching
