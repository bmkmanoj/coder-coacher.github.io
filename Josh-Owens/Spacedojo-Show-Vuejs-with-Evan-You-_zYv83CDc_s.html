host josh owens along with my co-host
chris alloy welcome Chris do you forget
my name no man and today we have a
special guest with us Evan you the
creator of UJS welcome Evan hello how's
it going good yeah yeah is that a view j
us t shirt you're wearing yeah i was
pretty spiffy need to get one of those
yeah the campaign is over but i can
always make more yeah nice so yeah today
I really I've been kind of interested in
view I haven't had a chance to play with
it I've spent most of my time either
doing blaze with meteor or recently
playing with react and I curious like I
know view is a front end kind of
framework can you tell me a little more
about it yeah so view itself is the core
library is just a view layer um similar
to reacts in the sense that they're both
just a view and if you want to so
compared to like something like amber or
angular on the the bare minimal version
of view is really lightweight and it's
super easy to getting too because it
doesn't bring about too many concepts so
you can start with the simplest example
possible but then when you need to build
more complex stuff you progressively
getting two more concepts such as
components and when you need to build
single page applications then you
introduce the router and when you need
to manage complex large applications
management last stage you introduce the
flux implementation come dukes so the
whole idea is the the framework is
designed to be very incrementally
adoptable it focuses on the approachable
Ness approachability
a for new colors and you should be able
to get it get into it and get productive
with it really easily and only bringing
the additional pieces when your apps
complicity seems to be growing so um
that's the high level vision for the
framework so um and they are also
obviously some technical differences
with the other frameworks and we can
getting to that if you feel that's what
want to do yeah definitely we will um
I'm kind of curious like I think maybe
maybe I'm remembering this wrong like
I've certainly been developing for a
long time but I seem to remember view
like the first time I saw it it was more
of like a validation framework perhaps
is that how did you start with that it
is it was a view library from the
beginning I mean it was too if you
extract according to just two ideas its
data binding plus components and that's
it um so the same text template syntax
was kind of inspired by angular 1
actually it started as an experiment to
sort of just reimplement angler one
myself ah but the internal
implementation is still a little
different because i was looking at
angular 1 code and was using dirty
checking i was like is there any other
way to do this maybe we can um i use
getters and setters to get you know you
use a different reactivity model which
turns out to be very similar to what
blaze is doing actually hmm yeah you
know that's kind of interesting like I
know we talked a little bit over Twitter
and um you don't want to get too much
into like meteor a lot like you work in
there and stuff but I am curious like
was there ever a conversation around
like having view be kind of a more
officially integrated library yeah I
actually um proposed to do that um but I
guess the
yeah the idea is media as a company
wants to bet on something that has I
guess at that moment has a huge momentum
which is react it has facebook behind it
it also has react native so it just has
a few things that he doesn't seem to
have at the moment it was really hard
for me to prove their view is eventually
going to you know maybe be on the same
level with react someday um so I guess
for this company going with react is
kind of like a safer bet mm-hmm no so I
obviously understand the decision
because if I I'm running a business I
would have to be really careful about
things like that but um so that's also
part of the reason why i feel it's
probably better for me to work on view
alone because um then I'm not can strike
constraint to align it with meteors
vision because it just doesn't seem to
overlap very well yeah yeah but you are
working full time on view is that
correct yeah and how did that come about
oh so it was kind of like eggs I'm just
exploring the possibility I want to see
if it's possible to just you know work
full-time on a open source project and
so I started a patron campaign it is
going reasonably well um there's like
thirty eight hundred dollars a month at
the moment i believe almost 4000
probably um so the community is pretty
like enthusiastic about view like
there's uh there's it's rapidly growing
saying smay this lack seems May last
year that was when the laravel community
started adopting it hmm so um so that
was kind of a turning point of growth
and he just kept just going up from
there uh and it was kind of like a
position where i feel like the the usage
of you has grown so much that it's
probably enough to for me alone to make
a living off it so it was just one i was
like i'm just i just want to give it a
shot so
and so aside from the patron campaign
there will also be some you know
contracts for consulting in people
making products with view and they're
willing to you know pay my pay money
also they are some of them are just
willing to sponsor the project in order
to ensure it you know it's sustainable
for the long run and so that their
product is also based on something that
will be maintained in Talara yeah yeah
it's working out reasonably well so nice
that's awesome yeah I i run a patreon
account myself so it's uh that's pretty
impressive to have it at 1300 a month
thanks I noticed uh I remember looking
at you maybe it was last fall's it was
at one dot o when it kind of popular and
kind of everywhere for a little bit and
it was in the meteor world a little bit
that's where I kind of come from as
developers in land and I started looking
at it again recently when Josh mentioned
this was coming up and I noticed the the
github like the awesome pager that
clearly with all the information was
really surprised at how much traction
you've got there's a lot a lot of
projects a lot of plugins a lot of
there's a lot of components like
ready-made bootstrap and material design
and its really impressed with health how
much you know how far you've come don't
yeah it's been quite a long time
actually I mean uh the initial version
of you was I think I started working on
it at the end of 2013 um as an
experiment and the first official
release public release was in
february2014 so it's like over two years
now since it's it first came out
although it remained a kind of like side
private for quite a while but it was
probably in around at one point o time
that was when I felt like it has the
potential to become something bigger so
I kind of made made a push for it to get
a 1 point 0 get a big release out get
the community more involved in all that
so yeah it's uh I think it's it's just
being going really well for the project
since then
awesome you mentioned that someone that
the principal's was the you know being
able to start small and kind of add the
components of the building blocks as
anything you as you go on is there when
you do that you kind of introduce like a
you know if I'm starting out and I'm
just going through a to do you know
hello world application that i need to
add a router or something like that
right am I am I recreating a lot when I
do that like as I take those steps of
evolution through you know from a small
example to something larger is it do a
lot of things have to be reworked ORS
are you kind of because you plan for
that along the way right so you
definitely need to plan along the way so
bye-bye talking about incremental
adopting stuff it's more like um it's
it's about it's about the learning
experience so when you first learn
something I feel like a lot of these big
full safran words they throw all the
concepts as you all at once so they come
big jump directly into an application
mindset where um so we start with this
application instance it has a router
then you go into this view and all that
um which view takes kind of the opposite
approach so we start with the bare
minimal of a component right we don't
even tell you it's a component so it's
just a view it has you have a data
object you have a piece of template you
want to buy these two together so the
only thing you need to do is just create
a view instance so that's the bare
minimal and then we kind of explain the
concept of how data binding works and
the reactive you will see how the
reactivity works and kind of get like
the core of the library instantly and
then we tell you hey this thing is
actually a component now you can just
wrap this up make you reusable and you
can desk them so now you have a view
hierarchy you can get more complexity
interfaces and then we tell you hey now
you want to manage routing and in fact
rowley is basic just mapping the URL to
a tree of components so we already have
a tree of components we just you know
teach you how to map them
so I think that's so the whole thing is
more designed around how to make people
understand how the framework works and
how each piece what each piece is
designed to solve what problem instead
of telling you here's our other pieces
you will likely run into all the
problems right you figure them out oh I
once I feel that some it's not the best
way for people to learn things right um
and so after you've sort of understood
the whole thing obviously in the process
you'll probably have to recreate
something but now you have a much better
understanding of the whole stack now
when you start a new project you have a
better intuition of deciding what pieces
well I actually need for this because
you know I understand like if this is
simple I probably don't need a router
right if this is going to the complex i
probably need the the state management
solutions from the beginning so i think
that helps even when you're working on
none of you projects because it's
important to understand you know what
front end applications it's it's
something unique to from an application
because the the complexity it covers a
wide spectrum right so having good
intuition on the projected complexity of
the project and and picking the right
tools for it is important for evident
everywhere I that makes sense and I like
that just going through your
documentation which is very well very
well laid out very clear very concise
thanks you know that's it's very good
flow starting smaller and working your
way I noticed that and it the mental
model of that works it's good thanks so
I'm curious like talking about the the
docs and that kind of thing like I think
a big part of a project taking off
especially like this one like to me it
seems like managing an open source
project is kind of tough and it's more
about building community and people that
want a contribute more than anything if
it's going to be successful like how
have you kind of approached and handled
that part of
of this hmm I think it kind of King
naturally so I definitely have a lot to
thank for the larva community because
they are a big driving force so ever
since the adoption so thanks to taylor
who is the author of laravel so he he
basically started using viewing some of
his projects and he treated about it and
then the law of a community discovered
view and there it turns out because um
view is like a perfect fit for backends
frameworks like that because um a lot of
the applications built with rails alara
though r relly single page applications
so um big frameworks are oftentimes
overkill for the need of those specific
apps and DJ s fills that gaps really
well because it's it's not it doesn't
force you to adopt the whole stack right
you can just take the viewer and just
fits it really well in those
applications so I Salerno community
jumped on it and it's really like um
very active and other people are really
enthusiastic about sharing and you know
I should the community forward so uh
there are a lot of contributors I mean a
lot of the plugins in that awesome view
page are from laravel community members
uh it's also growing pretty well in
China Oh partly due to you know my
section so uh you know I've been on the
Chinese Internet as well there's a
chinese version of twitter cut weibull I
kind of you know tweet about it and
there is a chinese version of Korra as
well I answer a lot of friend
development questions there and you know
um so it's kind of like um I guess I
didn't really try to treat it as a you
know intentionally managed in the
community or anything it's mostly just
uh I don't think I have any like
specific plan or or like I designed any
you
no specific way to to boost it or or to
you know kind of I just really grow
really naturally and I don't want it to
change because I feel like it's really
about making um I guess I took it from a
different angle instead of instead of
just like trying to directly you know
make it more like a community thing I
always try to make the library itself
designed for the users so for example
during the 1 point 0 process it's kind
of like an open open process where um
there were a lot of applications right
so I before I actually start working on
it I open issues about what's going to
change in one point 0 and then people
chimed in and they were like really
really long discussions about how the
templates and texture change and all
that and people would just make really
good points and some of them change my
mind about how things should work and
all that I think that's the part where
um it's really important let the let the
community chiming about where the
project should be going um and give them
the opportunity to sort of offer what
they think it's important because
sometimes uh you don't fully understand
what they actually need especially for
me like I don't you know I probably make
simple single page applications so
sometimes I don't really you know
although I i tend to prioritize the
experience for all kinds of numbers but
um you really need to listen to them to
understand what they really want um so I
think that's the important part and
other than that I'm just most famed
tweeting and you know we're eating good
stuff from the community nothing much
more yeah yeah I kind of wonder like how
interesting it would be to do like
YouTube videos where you show like
here's a view jas app
and like I've built the front end and
I've connected it to this back and be it
Laura Bell or feathers or meteor or
different places like that I would think
that would actually do pretty well to
draw in people yet the set up Phylly
yeah but um you know I'm also kind of
curious to like are there other people
that have commit or rights to you know
the the view Jas repo and like how do
you make that decision to kind of bring
people into the fold there yeah so there
are currently run ten people on the team
I believe they all have commitments to
it but um I guess the policy is if you
want to submit something always submit
as a pull request I gave them commit
rights mostly so that they can manage
issues um um and it's not from there so
uh I opened a call for contributors back
when I mean that was kind of forgot when
I did that but a while ago so I receive
almost like 50 applications um and I had
to basically I was just picking people
who have already being actively involved
in the community like I've seen some of
them I've seen them are helping me
diagnose issues or fixing bugs some of
them having answering other people's
questions on the forum or in the killer
chat room um someone have been making
really good tutorial series so um people
like that who who have already been
showing the track record and the
willingness to contribute to the
community I think these people are the
best people to taking ah even if they
don't directly contributed to the code i
feel it's available to have them you
know in this turn it small team where i
can get more input from them they can
get more you know exciting to the code
base from me which i think is a great
thing I don't so the team is not really
organized as something like someone is
affine to work on something like that
it's more like a lose team concept where
are you are just
free to contribute to what you see fit
the most important thing is just you
know help the project Ricky what what is
it that you're like focusing on now and
in kind of the near future like what's
what's coming what's down the what's on
the road I guess though the road map
right now is pj's 2.0 which I actually
wrote the post a while ago so two point
O is a completely rewrite but retains a
largely compatible API and the major Pam
the major changes like the underlying
implementation where the render layer
are is greatly improved using a very
lightweight virtual town it's a fork of
snap Dom which is uh grapes like really
lightweight tiny implementation of
virtual Dom that's efficient and modular
so that's why I picked it because it's
um kind of serves as a really good base
to build a more customized system on top
of it um so with that in place we now
have a much faster initial render for
really really large pages and also on
server side rendering um so we also
implement a streaming server side
rendering on so overall it's a also
because of the virtual Dom we now on
have we not have the ability to mix
templates and virtual Dom render
functions so you can you can either use
templates very components or you can use
react style jsx rendering you know or
you can just do you do hyper squared
which is just chronic functions to
create your virtual Dom and even you can
even mix them so that you can embed a
render tag inside your templates and
drop down to the virtual Dom layer to do
manipulations where high flexibility is
required but for other more you know
interface like places you can just use
templates so I don't know that this
sorry I think these are the major things
about two point oh um and also
performance wise it's it still carries
over the same react
tivity system that view 1 point 0 haves
and addresses the few cases where the
other mainstream virtual Dom
implementations I tend to suffer from
which is over we rendering large
component trees because so similar to
blaze blaze is actually a good example
of how reactivity knows precisely which
part of the view has changed instead of
having to trigger a rear ender from the
top and try to find out if anything has
changed we now know precisely what
component in the tree has changed so we
directly rear ender from those nodes
instead of going from the Bob going from
the top and try to rerender compare
everything what this means is to
optimize your app you no longer need to
do should component updates or using
medical data structures because system
is already built to to handle precess
updates so you don't need to worry about
your components being overly rendered
yeah how does the you mention the
server-side rendering how does how does
that work in swirly this is the front
end client-side framework right in my
right on that and how does the the how
is the back end where's that how does
the server-side rendering so the
surfside FL uses nodejs obviously and
the way you do it is you will creat
eight so so the Sakura codebase um is
now divided into two parts the compiler
in the wrong time so the compiler
actually can be detached so you can you
catch precompile oil templates and to
render functions and shift the wrong
time only on the server you would so the
runtime also runs on no Jas as well
because it's a it's actually decoupled
from the actual dot parts that touches
the Dom so in the server-side
environment you can just disable the
real down operations and create a view
instance without the DOM so when you
create that it only has a virtual Dom
representation of what it should look
like
and now you convert that virtual down
representation into a string and I again
server-side rendering so that's kind of
how it works in the gist there are
obviously more details when you combine
it with a router or combine it with
other stuff but the core idea is you
would just almost do the same thing you
import a component create an instance
event pass it to the render lying render
tree string function and just give you a
string back now you mentioned that it's
going to be streaming server side
rendering what's the difference there so
streaming service I rendering instead of
giving you back a string it gives you
back a stream object so energy s streams
are used in a lot of places like HTTP
requests HTTP transport file system
interface thing and all that the
benefits of stream is that it has all
these like congestion control and back
pressure controlling all that so
basically I imagine if you are doing a
synchronous render which took 40
milliseconds or 100 milliseconds let's
say that would block your whole server
and that looked for 100 milliseconds so
during that period will be completely
unresponsive um but with a stream the
system basically knows the stream is
impossible by default and when when the
when the HQ cell you pipe the render
stream into an HTTP response object and
you would only umm so so it kind of
divides up the whole rendering process
into little ticks right so every time
the HTTP response say I've I need more
data then we would do do some tix until
we have enough data to push and we push
it and now we yield the event loop to
something else that's going on and we
were just we will just stay idle until
this HTTP or small says now I need more
data again now we keep rendering doing
more ticks and we send more data back so
this way streams can allow your server
to stay more responsive because between
reads you actually the CPU it gets time
to do other work that might be going on
it's sort of like the asynchronous i/o
of how the node system is designed to
work so it also because of the streaming
the initial response time will be faster
because let's say a hundred millisecond
instance to render the stream widow with
a streaming mode you probably get the
first by back at around like 20
millisecond and now you get another few
bytes in another 20 millisecond so you
you'll get this gradually sent over the
wire and overall it just results in the
client seeing the data earlier faster so
they see the contact faster as well
that's pretty cool I'm I'm kind of
curious like coming from meteor lake
looking at blaze and how it works like
you have really the whole stack right
like you have DDP and that shipping data
across and getting pushed into mini
Mongo which is like wrapped up with
tracker so that you can do like you can
detect when new data is coming in and no
one validate and kind of rear ender that
data for you how does that work like
let's say I'm using Laura Bell or
feathers or something like that like
what is there a way that you easily kind
of get that reactivity on the view sign
yeah so the core idea about these
reactivity is everything is just playing
JavaScript objects right so um the way
you think about a way after you create
your app um your app will be observing
your state of your application and the
state of the application is just an
object that's being made reactive um so
to get new data into it you just set
things on the object though so it's it's
really that simple so let's say you're
integrating with a WebSocket data source
or like firebase or something like that
you just subscribe to the database and
for example you subscribe to a list of
items
and on every change you probably will
get and from you you can either get the
whole you know updated collection of
objects or you can you know get
information about add or delete all
things like that um so for example the
five days firebase binding essentially
does this by listening to a fibrous
reference and which is similar to a
Mongol cursor that gives you information
about item added add some deleted item
you know the whole collection was
replaced with things like that so you
just do the corresponding data
operations if an item is at it you just
push through the array if an item is
Lydia you just remove it from the array
you splice it from the array so every
the real like data operations of us or
all just plain John scratchings you
manipulate the data you get new updates
that's it um so that's that's kind of
like the the low level low level way of
doing things and on a higher level show
the state management and convict which
is similar to redux for react kind of
abstracts over this layer on so that
your component no longer directly talk
to the data source anymore they all talk
to the bookstore so the store abstracts
the the what is that word it with the
well it was a group fuchs Luke sleeve
yes so it's just view appended with an X
ok ok well sure there's AK or I wasn't
gotcha so um today is uh when you use
Fuchs your app would have a store
centralized store that contains your
application estate and I kind of like
made it mom go on the client side it's
like this mini database all right so um
your components would get data from the
store using getters there which are just
pure functions you know you get the the
state route state object and you return
some part of the state to the component
the component would bind that as a
property on the instance which you can
then bind to in your templates on the
way to mutate the store is by
dispatching actions which is similar to
how it works in flux
ah similar to you can also sync think of
it similar to meteor methods which is
you just you know call up call function
which dispatches an action that action
causes a mutation in your state and
because of the how the reactivity says
the work when the mutation happens your
view will be updated you don't need to
worry about you know what happens after
that um so uh the good thing about using
a state management to patent like this
is first the whole thing of interfacing
with state is is normalized into the
scatter and action interfaces interface
so it doesn't matter what data source
you're working with they're all talking
to zoosk right you can even swap between
web socket data source or a firebase or
anything else as well as you make sure
your components are talking to the to
the store and then the store I will be
talking to the actual data source so
there will be a it will need to be a
sort of like adapter layer restore to
talk to those services but that's
relatively relatively simple to because
the store itself is also you know just
holding a plain object so you do the
same thing right you listen to a website
asaurus and on a new update you just you
know when you play the array or push
stuffing to the array and that's it so
um it's really easy to write adapter the
adapters yourself um and in a typical
example if it's a REST API is even
simpler you just you know make an AJAX
request get a response back and shove it
into your store and that's it yeah so
I'm curious like what is the advantage
or why why build buchs is that how you
were saying it why why why build that
why not use something like mob X or
redox directly so the thing is uh mob x
is kind of overlaps with what view does
because so it has exactly the same
reactivity mindsets with viewing that
you should just be able to manipulate
your objects and things
um so there's an overlap and view
basically a few cool already implements
what my back's does it's kind of baked
into it so you can so let's imagine if
you use view without pukes and you just
you know manipulate stay directly inside
of components that's what that's
basically what mob X is like with me yet
the problem with that is your state is
will be naturally scattered around the
place like you still need to centralize
patent to to manage cross component
state right a common scenario I've seen
from beginners when they use view is
they tend to put a lot of states
directly inside components right as a
result the stage of application is
scattered between components and what
they want to when when a piece of state
is actually shared by multiple
components if you don't attract it out
into a standalone store layer you would
then find yourself trying to synchronize
between components and that becomes a
really hairy problem right that's not
the place you want to go so that's why
you need to cause stayed out into a
store layer um and the reason why we why
view doesn't play well with redux is
because Redux is you know after all it's
designed for react so it kind of favors
this whole you know get the whole state
object back and update from the root
concept um and with books it's more
different because it with views
reactivity system you want to be able to
pre say precisely track with has changed
right um the instead of retained
returning a whole new state tree on
every update we simply mutate it um so
in gets when you when the mutation
happens you really just you know change
your object you just set you just set
the property to something else or you
and you manipulate the array um and and
the reason we are able to do that is
because you know few converts stuff to
be reactive and knows what has changed
and it's able to then more precisely
update your Dom as
well um so with a with a view plus fuchs
application everything is pre optimized
without having to do things so Rhea so
Redux would react it obviously has some
optimizations in the integration as well
but still in a lot of cases you still
need component updates in order to you
know fine grain manage ah how your
componentry updates but in dix it's
strictly a no problem um it's a
non-existent problem because um the the
DA maps updates is directly tied to how
your data changes um and aside from that
I do want to obviously recognize that
Redux has the advantage of because you
have you returned a new state tree on
every mutation it's easier to do you
know I'll do redo because you basically
have snapshots naturally so I weeks
because things are actually mutated you
would have to manually do snapshots
yourself if you need that but in most
cases you don't so it's kind of
optimized for different use cases right
so in most cases you want your updates
to be as efficient as possible and
that's what gives prioritizes on but if
you want to do snapshots you can't too
and as long as your application is not
overly complex the performer is also
acceptable you you basically Jason
serialize your state sync your string on
updates and so it's also totally
possible to do us a time-travel
debugging with views which is a built-in
feature in the view devtools chrome
extension so if you use um Dukes and you
install the chrome extension you are
every mutation of your state you will
see a record you can just time travel
between them and you will see your apps
your address update jump between those
states not as you step them and then you
can say revert to the state or commit
here and then start tracking new changes
and all that this era is there a back
end or you know what
way if I was just getting started you
know I like view i played with view is
it looks good is there like i preferred
or a way that you know kind of works
with a box you mentioned larva hmm is
that kind of work where a new developer
would would go um not exactly from from
these perspective there is no preferred
back end um I tend to believe the
project should be building a back-end
agnostic way as much as possible we
don't subscribe prescribe you to using
anything but ideally so my personal
preference is no Jas obviously so that
you also get easier to understand
rendering what two point O comes out but
the idea is that in most cases the
integration should be trivial but if you
so so there is a project of UCL I which
helps you scaffold projects but that's
for complex single page applications
because you build something like that
there are a lot of moving pieces on the
recommended setup is using webpack so
when you use web pack you run to a
traditional you need to configure a lot
of loaders you need to do hot module
replacement during development which
view supports you need to build for
production you may want to you know
split routes asynchronously and minify
minimize your stuff and extracting the
components the SS into a single file and
all that so it can be a lot of work
workflow things to to go through so view
CLI basically abstracts that away from
you you just empty have installed GV CLI
then view in its web pack project name
and if scaffolds project for you and
then you just go into the project npm
install and PM run def and you get the
app running I with webpack
pre-configured working out of the box
and then with hot room module
replacement working out of the box if
you edit the file you will see the app
just update instantly without reloading
the page yeah cool
so I think the other thing that's kind
of interesting to me is watching like
angular 2 has now come out and kind of
disconnected the Dom from you know what
the renderer so to speak and reacts done
the same thing to get react native to
work has there been any thought about
like changing up how've you work so you
can get something like you native or do
you think that's maybe not as
interesting to the community that's
actually exactly what we've done in two
point oh so virtual Dom is basically
what allowed look what allows us to
decouple the core implementation from
the Dom so when we say virtual Dom maybe
we should stop ecology virtual Dom
because it's more like a virtual it's
like a data structure that describes
what your interface should look like
right ah it doesn't necessarily have to
be rendering to the Dom it can be rent
it can be made to update the Dom it can
be made to render to a string and it can
be made to render to a native back-end
on so theoretically you can use view 2
point 0 and render you to react native
or native script or things like that so
technically it's all possible so
currently there is also a project kind
of weeks which is a project from alibaba
which is the biggest e-commerce company
in China I sort of like ebay paypal +
amazon combined for china um and so they
are using V so there is a the the mobile
department of their company uses viewing
some of their internal projects and now
they are investigating so so they've
always they previously had worked on a
native rendering framework similar to
react native actually really early on I
but it didn't catch on because they
didn't find a really pleasant API for
people to use it and now they are
basically a combining views API with
their native rendering back-end to
create something that allows you to
to write a view component that renders
to native apps which is called that
projects caught weeks the view eex on
its I believe it's in invitation ala
mode right now but they're planning to
open source later this year and I'm
actually working with some working with
the project lead of that project to
coordinate that between that project
between the 2 point 0 because they are
actually using directly using view 2
point 0 core as the JavaScript runtime
and so essentially we replace future
point O's patching up operations to
instead of manipulating the the browser
Dom we are now making API calls to the
native rendering back end so it's not
precisely view native but it's pretty
close awesome oh so I guess that's
that's all the questions I kind of uh do
you have a more Chris no no I think you
know is the best place to get started
would be right people to your doctor I
mean kind of you kind of got them
through that's it's already and I was
going through that I was up on the phone
um good so awesome well thank you for
coming on the show I mean we thank you
for learning so uh been there barking
today over like um so uh yeah been
started this thing when we first started
the show like I think he stole it from
JavaScript jabber just saying like you
know go around and pick something that's
that's kind of like been pretty awesome
for you lately doesn't have to be
related to tech but yeah so let's uh
let's do that real quick and into our
picks so wanna go first sure I'll go
first I picked up on your camera this
week a cannon a DD
and so far only a couple days so far but
it's it's an awesome it's it's also
definitely recommend it I'm kind of a
photographer here and there and have
been enjoying it for last few days so
that's what I've been playing with
lately nice wait so um i recently picked
up the ps4 and got a Gamecock dark so
squeaky it's a very very hard game ah
I've been dying so many times but it's
also really really fun um so if you see
you two point O release delayed it's
probably because of that game nice nice
so i'm gonna i'm gonna go maybe a little
lamer i don't know if this is making my
life any better but i'll go with Game of
Thrones so cool like it's still just on
my brain from yesterday I like i don't i
don't know if you guys watch it or not
but like i have it could you could you
don't talk about it yeah the only thing
I'll say is like you know it's in season
six you meet a character that's been in
the show off and on since he's one and
like his name is Hodor and like you
don't like all he says Hodor and you
don't understand why and like the
episode last night very very sad and you
like learn why he only says Hodor and
that's oh okay he's like it was like I
get a little misty-eyed there so kudos
to george RR martin as six seasons in
like you know i think someone tweeted
like i didn't think i could care about
another character died yeah you know
here we are in season six and like it
happened again so I'm funny it's
impressive
so that's it oh all right and if people
do want to like try out view where do
they go for that I go to the vue de esto
