very simple JavaScript sandbox escape by
abusing the constructor property of the
scope object to get an instance of the
function constructor which we then used
to generate a function with alert and
executed in this video we will have a
look at a different sandbox bypass for
the version 1.4.7 a lot of internal
stuff has changed between the old
version 1.0 to 0.8 and this one but
people figure it out again credit for
this bypass goes entirely to all those
amazing researchers who looked at
angularjs in the past and the bypass I'm
showing here was found by Gareth Hayes
so let's move on to this new angularjs
version and try to use our old bypass
and let's see what happens hmm no alert
let's have a look at the console error
referencing function notice the capital
written function that refers to the
function constructor you know that we
use to call alert in angularjs
expression is disallowed okay
crazy angular refuses to work with the
function constructor that we got by
following the constructor from the scope
in the stack trace we can also find the
function where this error is coming from
it is coming from ensure safe object
click on it to see the function this is
it and here is quite a clever check if
the object coming in as a parameter obj
is the function constructor I've briefly
mentioned that the highest constructor
in Java Script is a function constructor
this means that if you try to get the
constructor of the function constructor
you will end up with the function
constructor again so when obj is already
a function constructor the constructor
of that will be again the function
constructor so the ZIF will evaluate to
true and throw this error and as you can
see I have also modified this angularjs
code and added debugger statements as
breakpoints in multiple places this will
stop the execution when you have to
develop a console open now I will take
this end
cocks bypass from Gareth Harris and we
will step through the JavaScript code to
see how it works and why it works but
that might get a bit freaky so we will
start by looking at this expression and
try to get a first understanding on what
it tries to achieve and then a following
up video we will then see how this
actually works inside of angularjs first
of all I will modify this a bit and
instead of array dot join I will use
string concat I think that's a bit less
confusing
I will also modify the actual payload a
little bit to make it more clear and
also add a breakpoint into it before we
call alert so as you can see this
expression has actually two parts the
first part with some weird prototype
stuff and an assignment and separated
like JavaScript with the semicolon is
another expression with and dollar evil
I hope you remember the first video
where I explained that
dollar eval is just evaluating an
angularjs expression it's equivalent to
double curly braces so this whole thing
is basically an angularjs expression
with another expression evaluated inside
let's have a look at the first part so
it somehow does something with char it
charges a standard string function it
returns the character at the index given
as parameter so char at zero returns the
character a and char at 1vs but what
about that constructor prototype stuff
so the expressions start with a string
and reference the constructor of that
which obviously gives us access to the
string constructor know that this is not
a dangerous object yet like the function
constructor I mean what harm can a
string constructor do that only allows
us to create new strings from the string
constructor and now references prototype
and prototype is fancy JavaScript every
string we use is a descendant from the
string object and prototype can be used
to reference the actual function or
method that is inherited to all string
objects so we are now referencing
the charity function that all other
strings inherit and now the exploit
wants to assign something different to
that method what the fuck
it wants to assign the concat function
so let's see what Concord does string be
Concord is also a string function or
method it concatenates another string so
for example a Penta string CCC to be
which returns be CCC so now let's
alright the prototype char ed with
concat and now the string ast Charlotte
suddenly returns the concat function
instead of charrid what the hell and
when we now perform the char ed like we
did at the beginning we don't get the
first character we append zero to the
string so that first part of the
expression attempts to completely
destroy how string char ed function
works if that is successful you can
imagine very very weird things happen if
something is relying on char it and if
we look at where our first breakpoint
hit angularjs uses char it to do
something so what will happen find out
on the next episode of the caesars to
step through the actual angularjs
exploit and see how it screws the
internal state of angularjs
