of the YouTube channel and that's why I
created this survey which would be
really amazing if you could fill it out
I do want to read as much feedback as
possible but all the fields are optional
so whatever you give me is amazing I do
want to hear from you because I do
create this videos for people and so I
want to figure out who is actually
watching and what would you like to see
because it would be a waste of my time
and your time if I create videos that
nobody wants to see or you know invest
more time into the areas that people are
actually interested in so if you have
ideas or general feedback that is
helpful or some criticism that would be
really amazing it's all anonymous so I
have no clue who writes something
obviously you can leave your email
address also in there if you want to
hear back or whatever you can also write
me obviously directly at left overflow
gmail.com if you fill out the survey as
much as you want it's awesome thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
