exploit exercises protostar these levels
are a little bit more developed and are
on the level of very easy portable CTF
challenges let's have a look at final
levels Europe the network setup is
basically the same like from previous
challenges so if you are not familiar
with these custom functions you should
wash your previous videos where we
figured out what they do so when a
client connects to the service running
on four to nine and five it will call
this function get username this function
has a local 512 byte big buffer which is
all written with zero then gets is used
to read data from the user into the
buffer and as we have learned many
episodes ago gets is a dangerous
function so this is obviously our buffer
overflow then it checks if there is a
newline or carriage return and if so
would overwrite it with a zero after
that is a loop which will go over the
buffer and call to upper on every
character then the function returns this
means we should be able to overwrite the
return pointer off this function and
redirect code execution we only have one
issue and that is that the data we would
use to overflow would be transferred to
uppercase this means our shellcode as
well as the address we use to override
the instruction pointer on the stack
have to not change when two upper is
used meaning you cannot use lowercase
ASCII characters or is there may be a
trick how we can get around this
restriction let's think about this and
work our way backwards so what condition
has to be true in order that two upper
is not used on our input well the for
loop uses St Arlen to determine how many
bytes it will do this and stln counts
all bytes until it finds a null byte so
if we manage to somehow get a null byte
before our actual overflow and the
shellcode would be fine okay how could
we get a null byte in there if you check
the main page of gates you will see that
gets
treats everything until it gets a new
line or in the file
this means gets will have no issue of
reading and no bite
easy so we can completely ignore the to
uppercase stuff and just for creativity
reasons you could also abuse the no bite
replacement of the carriage return let's
say the input would use string copy
that's also stopping at a null bite you
could use a carriage return instead
which will then afterwards get replaced
by a null byte so that would also work
the buffer is 512 bytes big so let's use
that knowledge to create a simple
proof-of-concept buffer overflow we can
use Python with minus C to directly
write a short script in the argument so
we could print like 510 lowercase a's
and then we can later see that these
were modified to will be uppercase then
we append a null byte and continue with
the typical alphabet so we can recognize
how to overflow the instruction pointer
you can also make the alphabet lowercase
to prove that it will not be transformed
to uppercase after the no bite like with
the previous networking challenges we
can connect to the service on port 2 9
and 5 with netcat so we can simply pipe
the output of our Python one-liner to
netcat as well we don't see the output
no such user like before and the code
shows that it would be printed after we
return and main thus we can assume that
we successfully overrode the instruction
pointer and crash the program but how do
we debug this now if you look at the
description of protostar vm you will see
here a headline called core files it
says that the file name pattern is set
to TMP is something this means that
columns are stored in TMP and we have a
look at the content of TMP we will see a
core file which was produced they belong
to root so let's switch to root so we
can work with them but what are call
files let's ask the Linux manual with
main core the default action of certain
signals is to cause a process to
terminate and produce a core dump file a
disk file containing
an image of the processes memory at the
time of termination this sounds good if
we get the state of the memory when it
crashed we should be able to get a lot
of information about our buffer overflow
this image can be used in a debugger for
example gdb to inspect the state of the
program at the time that it terminated
oh wow
so we can't use gdb to look at these and
we are already very familiar with how to
use gdb a list of signals which cause a
process to dump a core can be found in
signal 7 ok interesting
apparently the process received a signal
because it did produce a core file right
so to understand this properly let's
also try to understand what signals are
notice the 7 this is important to
reference the correct page about signals
in the manual so main 7 signal let's
have a look at the standard signals
further down linux supports the standard
signals listed below
several signal numbers are architecture
dependent as indicated in the value
column hmm so signals can be different
on different architectures so if it is
an Intel arm or SPARC processor this
might make a difference but generally
this tells us that signals could have
something to do with very low-level CPU
or hardware features let's have a look
at the list of signals for example SiC
end is a signal you have used many many
times
it's an interrupt from the keyboard this
happens when you press control-c or
remember how you sometimes get an
illegal instruction when you jump into
invalid code a cig ill it's also a
signal which obviously must have been
triggered from the cpu which couldn't
make sense of an instruction our our
favorites is called 6 seg v a segfault
triggered from an illegal memory
reference for example when you jump to
non existing memory or try to ride to
non existing memory which obviously is
also triggered by low-level hardware
when you try to execute bad stuff this
line here is also interesting the
signals say kill and sick stop cannot be
caught blocked or ignored this me
most of these signals can be caught by
the process we have actually experienced
this before - when you run a process in
gdb you forgot to set a breakpoint in
the process just running you can use
control-c to break back into gdb you
send a sick end to the process which
instead of quitting had a signal handler
set up to catch it and perform a
different action so signals are kind of
like interrupts for processes by the
kernel certain events like memory access
fails pressing ctrl C are also killing a
process causes the kernel to send a
signal to a process unhandled signals
usually cause a process to die but
processes can also set up signal handles
to perform certain actions when it
receives these signals so in our case
when we overflow a IP on the stack and
the function returns a segmentation
fault is raised and a signal is
triggered the process doesn't handle it
and it is killed by the kernel at the
same time a core dump file is created to
save the state of the process that
caused the signal so now let's use GDP
to see what happened like before you
simply specify the binary as a first
argument but then you add the coffee as
a second argument and you see
immediately when gdb opens the message
that the process terminated due to
signal 11 a segmentation fault we can
also look at the registers and see the
value of e IP and those are definitely
our characters we have entered we can
also explore the stick with examining
the stack pointer you can see that
having these core files is extremely
useful now we know which characters
caused an overflow and we can now
calculate the offset to the instruction
point on the stack another way to debug
this further is to use gdb to attach to
the already running process make sure
you are rude simply find the process ID
and call gdb with - P and the PID and as
you see the process is currently in
accept waiting for client connect but
when we send our POC overflow we don't
see a segfault
that's because if you remember this
process creates a fork and
process to handle the client and we
always stay in the parent but we can set
in gdb the follow fork mode to child and
we now continue and send this long input
we get the seg fault awesome now you
have everything in place to develop the
full exploit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
