and meanings so many in fact that I
can't even think of another word with
this issue
and I'm certainly not fighting against
these established definitions because
you will always lose against the
evolution of languages it's OK for me
that hacking in the public eye is
negative and I can accept that people
participating in programming events call
themselves hackers and I also see why
social engineering can be considered
hacking and I also know that these
perceptions might change over time I get
out of it and that's fine human
communication is ambiguous and obviously
I have my own definition as well on what
I consider the correct way of hacking
but as I said I won't disregard the
other opinions
so let's actually not discuss this
highly emotional word and just talk
about why many of you watch my videos
and that is understanding computers so
well that we can make them do stuff that
was not intended
it seems like the rubber ducky is a big
trend right now at least on YouTube and
Reddit and I want to use that thing as a
scapegoat to make a point but before I
get into my argument let me quickly make
something clear the rubber ducky is a
product sold by hak5
and my criticism is not aimed at them
advertising their products on their show
I have nothing but respect for them
creating a solid product and building a
successful company I'd love to meet them
have a beer and collaborate on a video
we're not going to get a takedown for
that no I don't think so my criticism is
about something else so here's my rubber
ducky tutorial rubber ducky is the name
for a USB device that identifies itself
as a keyboard you can configure or
program it so that it automatically
types whatever you want for example you
can use that to open a terminal and type
in commands to create a backdoor or
download and install a rootkit
done that's the whole tutorial there's
nothing else to say about this I mean
when I heard that for the first time
my reaction was huh that's actually a
pretty clever hack this idea never came
to my mind but that's it it's not
sophisticated or interesting to me
beyond that nonetheless you find an
endless stream of videos blogs and
tutorials about this the obvious reason
for that is that it's so simple that
anybody can understand it and actually
it's a cool way to introduce kids to the
concept of hacking or IT security like
we give children cosmos crystal growing
kids for Christmas to get them excited
and interested in science but what real
scientists do where the university is
obviously completely different of course
the rubber ducky can be used by a
professional penetration tester when
going on-site and trying to get a
foothold into an organization by trying
to slip that into a computer but a big
part of this job is not that technical
you know tricking people into clicking
on emails or acting like cleaning
personnel to enter a server room is
impressive and not that easy I'm
certainly super bad at social
engineering and acting but is that
really following the spirit of figuring
out the magic of computers how they work
how you exploit them not for me you see
there are two ways you can approach
learning about security
and most of these rubber ducky tutorials
are result-based hmm I'm not that
eloquent so there's probably a better
word for what I try to express what I
mean with result-based is that these
tutorials are about how to extract clear
text passwords with a rubber ducky how
to brute force an Android lockscreen
with a rubber ducky how to start a
reverse shell with a rubber ducky but
what do all these things have in common
they all rely on typing something on the
keyboard so if you come from the other
side if you learn the underlying
concepts and principles and you have a
general understanding of the operating
system programming the digital circuits
protocols and so forth then it's clear
that all this is possible specific
tutorials for these things are not
helpful and when you come from this
other side you get much more benefit
from it for example when you find the
remote command injection vulnerability
you now understand what kind of commands
you could use to get a reverse shell and
you don't need another tutorial on how
to get a reverse shell from a command
injection and here is the predicament
using a rubber ducky turns normal
commands into a hacking attack so if you
want to learn hacking you search for
tutorials you will obviously find these
result based explanations if you want to
learn it properly the underlying
concepts are hidden in standard
literature and computer science courses
that don't have the word hacking in it
that's why I strongly believe a good
sysadmin or programmer has good chances
becoming a good hacker once they change
their mindset from building to breaking
in somebody who learns using all the
callee tools will have great results
during penetration tests and will have a
successful career but it's a lot harder
for them to combine the fragmented
information they get from the different
tools to the general underlying
understanding now that's an ideal I'm
not innocent when it comes to that I
will also use tools that I don't really
understand just because it gets a job
done but that doesn't necessarily make
me a script Kitty if you use the rubber
ducky and it makes you look into how to
program your own USB HID device you
learn about Arduinos and how to program
a microcontroller you learn about the
USB protocol and how to add
ties yourself as a keyboard then you are
not a script kitty but if you just use
it and go around and drop different
payloads you are not a hacker in my eye
but the criticism I had for hacking
tutorials from earlier also applies to
many of my videos I could argue that
teaching you about buffer overflows or
format string exploits is the real deal
and teaching you the principles but that
might not be the case I wish I knew what
have a flake really said during one of
his presentations unfortunately there is
no recording available but what it says
here on the slides hits deep however
argues that we fail a teaching
exploitation properly and instead teach
a bag of tricks that's kind of what I
meant with result based learning earlier
the broken exploitation curriculum looks
like this we learn about stack smashing
about specific people implementation how
to exploit it we learn about SQL
injections about a SLR and other
mitigation and we learn about XSS and
many more overly special cases we have a
problem that we are disjoint the spirit
and terrible at transmitting principles
too many people miss the forest for the
trees as a result when you learn how to
write a heap exploit and you become an
exploit practitioner you will probably
develop the intuitions that is needed
you basically learn the actual
underlying concepts from the fragmented
information you have collected over time
but there is no incentive to formalize
or disseminate their mental models and
we also not really have them at this
point I guess that is the main reason
why we still teach in this way but
there's progress in that field we
started to formalize this concept and
develop the theory of weird machines and
language theoretic security but we don't
have a full understanding yet
I met half of leg once he doesn't know
me but I told him that his research was
a revelation for me basically I
understand now that we should approach
exploitation also from the other side he
said and I'm heavily paraphrasing here I
hope I don't misrepresent what he really
said that he talked to many people over
the years who have written real crazy
exploits in widespread software and they
have developed this formal intuition of
what exploitation or hacking really is
for exam
but here's a guy who faces browsers and
has a lot of high value backs to his
name reacting to the slight egg from
which I have shown you a few pages
simply Wow however flag makes explaining
the seemingly random processes in my
head when I write exploits look simple
for a script kiddie different rubber
ducky payloads may look crazy and like
complicated hacking but if you
understand the underlying concepts they
are nothing special so if we can also
understand the principles of
exploitation all these memory corruption
tutorials may seem trivial I hope I can
get there I hope we can together develop
this intuition but also hope smarter
people than me who do research in this
field can formalize it for all of us
that would be easier long story short if
you own a rubber ducky use it as a
motivation to go deeper don't be a
script kiddie thanks for listening to my
two cents about hacking I'd really love
to talk about this more so feel free to
express your views here as a youtube
comment or and reddit see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
