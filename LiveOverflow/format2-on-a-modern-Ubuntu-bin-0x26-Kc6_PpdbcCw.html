string vulnerability from the protostar
examples but had it compiled on a modern
system with a SLR and 64-bit at first I
thought we couldn't solve it but
explored some tricks and played around
with it but then actually figured out a
reliable technique so let's explore some
more of the format levels
format one at first looks very simple
remember last time we just failed
because required that we write to target
the exact value hex dead beef but here
we just have to write something let's
have a quick look if our trick still
works so this level also takes an
argument but passes it directly to
printf know s printf and buffer involved
anyway we compile it again on our 64-bit
Ubuntu version and open it in gdb then
we set a breakpoint at the if compare of
target run it and as arguments we use
AAA then we have a look at the stick see
how our ace don't show up where are they
let's keep looking further down oh wow
they are all the way down here and
what's all this stuff again well so see
we didn't copy our string input to a
local variable like buffer did in the
last challenge we directly print the
arguments and the arguments are placed
along with the environment variables all
the way at the start of the stack so
these are the environment variables and
you see there is no stack address we
could override an abuse like we did last
level that sucks
but actually it's still solvable we
don't need the trick from last video at
all it's simpler than you might think
but let's explore it with the next
challenge format to that one we hadn't
looked at yet and it boils down to the
same thing it looks a bit more promising
right it does read data into a local
variable on the stick but it doesn't
look like we can overflow the buffer
this program gets the input from
standard input instead of an argument
and then later our target is checked if
it's 64 okay
so let's compile it and open it in gdb
again we look for the if compare seems
to be here hex 40 is 64 and set a
breakpoint then run it this time it's
waiting for input so enter some A's and
B's and now we hit the breakpoint and
let's have a look at the stick
hmm we know that our buffer has 512
bytes and looks like there are a lot of
staggered versus in range but why is
that isn't the 512 bytes buffer
unallocated or empty well not really you
see it's a local variable on the stick
which means it simply moved the stack
pointer further up to make space for it
but doesn't clear it so these are left
over values from other functions that
ran before and had a stack there which
then got destroyed again when they
returned but their values always remain
there for a regular program execution
that doesn't really matter except that
you must not expect a value to be
initialized with 0 because you can have
bad luck and something was in its place
before anyway let's see where our target
variable is we can use print and then
ampersand target to get a pointer so
basically the address of target but what
is that that doesn't look like a stack
address somebody who has some experience
with exploitation 64-bit knows already
what that is it's a very recognizable
address with VM map you can check the
virtual memory and see that it's part of
our binary look at the permissions for
this memory region it is read and
writable not executable so it's not
where code is it's in a data segment
when we look at the code we see that
target isn't defined in the function as
a local variable it's a global variable
so it's placed in the data segment now
if you have some experience with
exploitation 64-bit targets you also
know that that means this address is not
affected by a SLR by default let's add
another printf here like we did last
video to print the address of target and
when we run it a few times you see
target doesn't change
awesome so it should be fairly
straightforward step 1 let's find our
input on the stick we enter some ace
followed by percentage x 2 prints tag
values and here we are 1 2 3 4 5 6 at
offset 6 we have our input so we could
place our address there instead of the
A's and then
replace the 6% this X with the
percentage n 2 right to it let's try it
so we should now enter our input via
echo so we can encode raw characters in
hex then pipe the input into format tool
so let's enter the address of target ah
see there it is but it's 4 bytes so
there is also a space and still included
this has to be a 0 because the address
is only 3 bytes so we add that but now
we don't see any output anymore
what happened well printf prints strings
and strings are now terminated in C so
printf stops when it reached the 0 so we
never reach our percentage X format
modifiers this means we should move our
address to the end so we can have format
stuff before now let's try to find again
our address this time I'm using the
dollar syntax to enter an offset
directly so we know our start was at
offset 6 so the address has to be
further down also don't forget to escape
the dollar here on the command line
because dollar is a special character
for the shell if we keep going with the
offsets we can find the ace
now sometimes the offset might not be
right so you may have to add or remove a
few characters as petting to align it
perfectly okay now it looks good let's
change it to a percentage n segmentation
fault well that didn't work let's write
our input to a file open gdb and use
that file as input to investigate the
crash so here we are at a move it tries
to move whatever is in our 15d into
address in our I X and so are I X
appears to be an invalid address it's
not our target there is a hex a and that
is obviously a newline so that's the
issue we are on 64-bit so we have 64-bit
addresses but we only entered 4 bytes
and after echo is a newline so we just
have to add four more null bytes okay we
don't get a crash now but target is
still
zero how's that let's make it crash
again by making the address invalid
again this way we should be able to
investigate if our address would be
correct and what was written to it so we
see our ax looks good it only is invalid
because of what we changed otherwise it
would be great and so it tries to write
our 15 d to it and that is zero what
shouldn't present us and write the
amount of characters already printed
let's think for a second oh of course
it's zero because we didn't print
anything yet before we do the percentage
n we obviously have to print something
first so let's add percentage 64 d to
print 64 characters now that's four
characters long
this means we've shifted everything by
four and in order to line up everything
again that the address is at the correct
offset we have to subtract four
characters somewhere but luckily we made
the padding earlier large enough and so
that's simple and here we go
it's you modified the target finally
finally we managed to exploit a simple
example on a modern system without much
hassle goddamn it so maybe now you
wonder but the system has is alar why is
this address fixed well the system has a
SLR and the system libraries like Lipsy
are affected by a SLR but the binary
itself is not affected by a SLR unless
we specifically compile it to be
position independent code and we can do
that with the P ie flick for position
independent executable and pic4 position
independent code if we now execute form
a tool and check the address of target
then we see it keeps changing a lot now
it's going to be much harder maybe with
some strategies from last video it's
doable
I'll leave that as an exercise to you
