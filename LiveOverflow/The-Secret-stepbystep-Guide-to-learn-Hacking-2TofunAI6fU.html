what resources can you recommend me I
get this us a lot TL DR I don't know
I genuinely don't know before I tell you
my thoughts I have to mention that I'm
young I have very limited exposure to
the industry I have not had different
jobs in this field and so I really don't
know how to transition from another job
into it what certifications to get how
to balance a full-time job and a family
anything country specific I really can't
help you with that because I have zero
experience all I can look at is my life
and tell you my thoughts about it if you
disagree with what I will say or it
doesn't help you then you need to ask
somebody else I don't have the answer
but I think there are a lot of
misconceptions about how to get into the
security field and I try to explain now
why maybe you think there is some kind
of shortcut or at least a very efficient
path you hope a professional or
experienced person can easily tell you
about a clear path to success
I certainly had exactly those thoughts
several years ago I got frustrated why
nobody would write down a clear guide I
felt somewhat entitled that I have a
good experience already I just need some
guidance on mentoring but the truth is
there is no efficient path truth is it
just takes years of experience so if you
think that somehow it would be easier
with a study plan it's not so forget it
I am sure you know this interview
question what advice would you give your
younger self and for me I don't know
while certainly thinking differently at
the time in retrospect I don't think
there was anything bad or inefficient
about the path I took of course I could
help my younger self understand certain
concepts better and faster and that's
what I try to do with the videos the
videos cover exactly what I would tell
my past self but I couldn't lay out a
path of do X Y and then Z there is no
secret step-by-step guide it's not a
straight path but a web of
interconnected topics layers and
dependencies and you're free to walk and
jump between stuff however you want
truth is anything you do any tutorial
you
any project you start and never finish
any dead-end your head down it's not
wasted it's all experience that is
accumulating over time if I learned
anything about hacking what it means
what it is then at least to me it's not
really something I can get a hold on
it's an abstract artistic and broad term
for many different things truth is
hacking is just learning IT stuff but
kinda in an artistic weird creative way
maybe now you say well tell us about
your path then clearly it got me
somewhere right maybe that's the
ultimate guide well there are a few
things I can mention my path is also
full of just lack opportunities I have
never planned for so it's also somewhat
not applicable to anybody else
nevertheless here are our of you
checkpoints that maybe give you some
idea as a kid I started with some HTML
then I got a book about visual basic
script and I wanted to write an
operating system in it if you have ever
written visual basic script it's a bit
like JavaScript you know how ridiculous
that idea was but it didn't hold me back
I asked this question in a forum and
what's called a dump troll I was really
sad that day because I was just a kid
trying to learn something and I had no
idea what it means to have an OS anyway
at some point I got into web programming
with PHP so I had to learn actual HTML
CSS JavaScript PHP and MySQL I started
an abandoned several browser game
projects then I heard about SQL
injections and I did a school project on
it here I wrote a test application
explained how injections work I started
to learn Java and got into Android app
programming did some C++ and a bit of
game programming made the shitty
Monopoly clone then I did some Google
Wave gadgets does anybody remember that
I was just a dumb kid and my code was
arguing but my pole gadget got some
attention from professional that was
cool I learned more about computer
science fundamentals and university data
structures and algorithms learned about
Linux because I started to use it at
work
joined the heck of space and learned
about Arduinos and soldering and then I
guess the major turning point I
discovered my first CTF the stripes
TTFN and got hooked on war games and
other challenge sites and essentially
here i know and now i'm a freelancer
doing security code audits pen testing
application security and that kind of
stuff and please don't ask me how to get
into freelancing I have no clue how to
do it I met a guy who knew a guy who
recommended me and Here I am so that was
not planned at all and looking at my
history imagine that these are just
large check points it's not a straight
path it's traversing through a jungle of
different topic it's kind of like a
fractal or the coastline paradox if you
zoom in you uncover even more complex
lines there's a lot of stuff I did not
mention in this high-level view like
making RPG Maker games where I was first
exposed to if-else logic blocks or
modding my calculator with a window and
LEDs one of my first exposures to
electronics and if you ask me where to
start
where should I point you to is to start
the first HTML line wrote as a young kid
or is the start when I had already years
of programming experience and discovered
cts I have no answer for you you have to
figure that out yourself but one truth
is I didn't discover any secrets there
is no anonymous secret hacker
organization with forbidden knowledge I
simply apply the knowledge that I gained
about computers over the years you know
programmers use the same knowledge but
just think differently they think how
can I make it work and a heck of things
how should you implement it so that it's
secure and what could a lazy programmer
do wrong truth is the more you
understand how something is built you
can also think about how it could break
so I'd say 95% of what I'm doing is just
learning about how computers work and by
that I mean learning a ton of different
programming languages frameworks
concepts and so forth over the years
again a very good broad basic
understanding from low-level logic gates
over simple circuits to PCBs and chips
microcontrollers low-level programming
assembler see from where operating
systems higher-level languages language
and programming concepts data structures
file structures 3d programming
networking cryptography servers server
administration websites frameworks
databases web apps mobile apps math
machine learning the list is
and you see nothing on this list screams
hacking or security because this
knowledge is just the base requirement
the tool that I used to do my job as a
professional hacker like I said it's not
secret knowledge it's everything a
programmer sysadmin or whoever would
learn just apply it a bit differently so
I'm thinking what could go wrong how can
files be exposed how could I gain access
without a password how could I modify
something that shouldn't be modifiable
how can I manipulate the output and so
forth and maybe surprising to you but
that's not different from what a
programmer or id architect would do they
use the exact same technology just have
different thinking patterns different
problems they try to solve so they think
how could I use these things to build a
social network how could I build a
time-lapse camera how could I make a fun
game different problems different goals
but based on the same knowledge and the
security focused stuff like conference
talk CTF write-ups trainings academic
papers blog posts are essentially just
sharing cool ideas how to apply this
knowledge in a security focused way and
that is not different to a program of
sharing techniques on how to handle huge
datasets efficiently or how to implement
a game AI don't think of hacking as
anything crazy or special it is based on
exactly the same thing just with a
different angle breaking not building
so to summarize hacking requires a lot
of knowledge about computers and I say
generic computers because it could
literally mean anything IT related and
learning a wide variety of technologies
and gaining experience and knowledge to
draw from just takes time it takes years
so any game you develop any minecraft
redstone circuits you build any boring
sorting algorithm any math class any
mobile app you start and abandon
anything you do is knowledge you
accumulate and eventually can use so one
general advice I give is it takes a lot
of time so make sure you have fun enjoy
learning about computers enjoy
programming enjoy following tutorials
enjoy learning a new language whatever
it is that you have fun with it will
keep you motivated over the year
don't get me wrong you don't have to
first program for years and then get
into security you can do it in parallel
when you write an Android app look into
the official Android security tips think
about what could go wrong what happens
if you don't follow it play around with
it and maybe at some point you want to
build a web API to be used by the app
and suddenly you learn web development
and server administration then you have
to debug your connection and how that
can be used to analyze and test stuff
this is essentially the process you will
be doing for the next few years and
that's what I do all the time you know
the thought of being able to hack an
iPhone or gaming console or banking
terminal is motivating but good chances
that you are just very very far away
from that I am at least not there yet
I failed my Nintendo switch hack attempt
I barely understood the surface but
that's fine I keep learning and I have a
ton of fun with learning basics and
learning a new programming language and
learning new technologies and in a few
years in to my console generations maybe
I know enough to join one of those teams
I know you might still feel frustrated
where to start but if you feel
frustrated then that's probably because
you picked a target way too large for
you if you don't know the steps you need
to take it's too far away to see how to
get there so try to break that goal up
for example if you want to get into bug
bounties and you have no clue how to do
that analyze it sit down and try to
uncover the underlying topics for
example black bounties are usually web
security web security means hacking
websites web sites can be written in a
ton of different languages so start with
one learn PHP learn what can go wrong
with PHP learn about different PHP
frameworks learn about different
databases and with learn about I mean
write your own websites use the
frameworks just play around with it and
gain experience when you get bored with
PHP look into Python learn about Python
flask and Django what can go wrong with
Python websites what can go wrong with
Ruby websites do you see how the typical
Ruby Python and PHP web security issues
are super different because they are
different
images learn about JavaScript learn
about HTML and try to understand what
XSS means you see how that single topic
just immediately exploded in so many
subcategories and there you have a list
of stuff you can spend years on and it's
not a step-by-step path it's a
collection of topics and you basically
jump around between them and slowly
understand them deeper and deeper over
the years I've revisited the security of
PHP websites and I always learn a bit
more you can go even so deep to look
into the actual PHP source code so this
is what you have to do break it up try
to understand the layers that build up
whatever you want to do and learn these
layers is a bit of research but that's
part of it and another thing I want to
make clear you won't find these things
when searching for hacking tutorials
that's something I had to learn truth is
most resources hackers use our regular
documentation and programming resources
hacking tutorials like what I show you
in videos is just showing you how to
apply that stuff to security you don't
need to rely on me or any other person
to write it up for you you can do it
yourself in many videos and not
referencing any secret hacking book and
just simply open the official AVR
assembler reference or look into the PHP
function documentation or look at the
official Linux manual pages so let me
summarize no there is no clear easy path
to learn this stuff and I can't help you
there is no secret book or website to
learn it the more you understand
computers the more ideas and
understanding you have what can go wrong
programming abstract theory and so forth
is important to understand computers and
just have fun if making game sounds fun
make games it takes years to accumulate
this knowledge so make sure you enjoy
the right and one last thing I want to
say I make the videos in a way I would
have loved to watch them years ago which
means I already had experience with
programming
so I guess my channel is not intended
for complete programming beginners but
it still hope that what I just described
helps you to get somewhat started and if
you have some experience just keep
watching my videos and take some
inspiration to look deeper
or into different topics you absolutely
don't have to understand everything but
catching one thought or seeing one tool
I use can be all the difference and I
hope the videos at least give you a
rough idea how stuff works and you can
research at once you actually need it if
you want some more guidance you can also
check out my playlists I have a fairly
long binary exploitation playlist mostly
based on exploit exercises calm but I
also have some web security videos or
just my CTF write-ups like I said it's
not a clear path so just keep jumping
between topics and just have fun look
into stuff get frustrated and then look
into other stuff in otherwise maybe look
at over the wire Piko CTF CTF 1000 or
try out some bug bounties or just look
at other programming YouTube channels
and learn about something new maybe make
sure to check the description for links
to stuff I recommend anyway always try
to learn something new and trust me if
you just stay curious and keep looking
into many different new things in a few
years you will totally get there be
patient
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
