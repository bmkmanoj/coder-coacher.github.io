soldered and set up the other inner
board for the risk you embedded hardware
CTF I couldn't release this video
earlier because the competition was
still under way but now it's over and I
can release all the solutions and show
how I worked on these and I'm excited to
take you along with me on this journey
of slowly exploring this unknown land as
I mentioned in the previous video the
secure file system is a good challenge
to start because you can learn how to
interact with the board in this video
we'll be about that ok so we already
learned how to flash a challenge onto
our board the challenges come as a hex
file this is a special file format which
is not really a raw binary but has the
binary data as a hex encoded string
inside AVR dude can read that file
formatted flash to bytes onto the board
this binary would usually contain a VR
assembler code which we could
disassemble and reverse-engineer but
that would make many chandos travel so
this is actually encrypted and without
the secret key embedded on the board we
cannot analyze it so the only way for us
to solve this is to load it onto the
board and figure it out by interacting
with the board so when I loaded the
binary on to the board the first thing I
did was checking the serial monitor
feature of the arduino ide usually you
can use that to send and receive data
via the serial connection and it
actually looks like there's some data
but it seems corrupted it is not
readable so either it's binary data or
we have wrong settings syria has this
baud rate setting it defines how much
time you get for each symbol or packet
if you will so if you read very slow or
too fast you will only read garbage by
simply trying out different default baud
rates offered by the drop-down menu I
got the correct value and we see a list
of files a cat dot txt also a passwd
file which is probably our goal when I
hit enter or other keys it doesn't react
we don't get a response or see our keys
I actually tried out different line
ending settings what should be send if
we had enter and we will soon learn that
I just missed the
Enza but at this point I couldn't figure
it out I thought maybe something is
weird with the Arduino console so I
connect to the board via screen and it
also seems to work I get the file list
but I have the same issue here nothing
really happens when I write anything on
the board before we continue let us
quickly establish what a serial
connection really is and then check if
we actually send data or if that is
broken so let's say you want to transmit
the letter A we know that the asker
representation as a number of this
letter is hex for 1 or decimal 6 5 in
binary that would be 1 0 0 0 0 1 a
simple way to transmit this information
between two components two devices two
circuits two chips log to whatever is to
simply use seven signal wires and simply
apply +5 volt or zero volt depending on
one or zero that would be a parallel
connection and that one is also very
fast right you can transmit seven bits
immediately but you waste space another
way would be a serial communication you
could have a clock that always checks in
an interval the state of a single wire
and if it was how you read a one and if
it was low you read a zero and over a
short period of time you can assemble
the whole seven bits into ASCII a so and
this is basically how the other we know
and many embedded device communicate
there are two LEDs on the board one says
T X and the other one rx T extends for
transmitting and our extents for
receiving so these are basically two
wires one along to send data and serial
the other one to receive data as zero if
you look closely you can also see Rx and
TX being available as a pin here so we
can hook up a logic analyzer and capture
what is sent over these single wires we
connect three probes one RX one TX and
one to ground then we use the logic
software to collect the trace for like
10 seconds and then we very quickly
connect to the board by a screen and
type something and press Enter now let's
look at the trace so this one signal
here is the receiving side and the other
one is the sending side from the
perspective
of the Arduino you can see that it sends
some data and that it received some data
you can also enable the protocol
decoding then you can actually read what
kind of characters or bytes were sent in
these serial packets
now you understand also the baud rate if
you have the matching rate it will
perfectly read these highs and lows if
you are too fast you read too little and
if you read too slow you read too much
so now in reality the serial connection
doesn't actually go from the arduino
into your computer it just goes from the
microcontroller the atmega to this chip
here
ch3 four zero which is a USB to UART
converter UART stands for universal as
synchronous receive our transmitter so
the microcontroller in this chip already
speak a specific protocol to exchange
the serial data via Rx and TX and then
this gets translated into USB packets
and the driver on your computer will
make it look like a serial interface
when you then send serial data the
driver will do the USB communication
with that chip and the chip then does
the UART or serial communication with
the microcontroller which runs code that
can read that data so it's a fairly
complex system but whenever you see are
eggs or ticks on a PCB it's very likely
that it is some kind of serial
connection maybe for debugging where you
can hook up a you are two USB chip and
read it with your computer so now we
know that sending data actually works
but we do something wrong next I try to
interact with the ball through a Python
script because that allows me to control
each byte I want to send rather than
hoping the terminal is configured
properly I use PI serial for that after
installing the module I can import PI
serial and set up a serial connection
then I can start reading bytes from the
serial connection and I also get the
file list so that works and then I
noticed something each line doesn't end
with a simple new line it ends with a
carriage return and a new line aha
so I try it again this time I use an
example line from the challenge
description and send it with Python that
example apparently can read the cat dot
txt file ok so now we can read from the
serial connection and
worked we see the content of cat dot txt
that's awesome okay so we figured out
how to interact with the board each line
has to end with a carriage return and in
your line but how we solve that
challenge now will be in another video
so now that we know that we need a
carriage return for the line and we can
modify a couple of common of settings I
create a special keyboard shortcut with
shift enter which sends a special text
which also allows us to specify scape
sequence like new line and carriage
return so now when we hit shift enter we
should send these instead of just a new
line let's try it
and we now access the screen and hit
shift enter the board actually responds
and tells us that that is an invalid
request and we can even request the
example files now okay now we are all
set to solve this challenge I was
actually very confident that I know the
solution for this task already like I
said in a another video that coward the
idea behind this challenge it's either
super simple for you or super hard and
mind-blowing I wonder if you can figure
out which video I'm referring to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
