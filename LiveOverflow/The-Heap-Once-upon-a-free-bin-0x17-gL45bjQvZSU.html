about abusing application logic
basically because the program used
faulty data from the heap but this time
we exploit the heap algorithm itself in
this video I want to explore heat level
3 from exploit exercises purusa which is
about the infamous unlink macro this
video is based on the excellent frack
article once upon a free as you can see
this article from 2001 so we are still
15 years behind the times and we have
not yet caught up with the modern state
of exploitation the heap implementation
that we will exploit changed over the
years to prevent this kind of attack but
the current versions are still based on
this old algorithm so it's important to
understand this easy version here so
let's start by looking at the code of
this level this level introduces the do
gleameil loc dl malloc and how heap data
can be modified to change program
execution the goal is obviously to call
the function winner first we may look
three objects with 32 byte a b and c and
then we copy the program argument a b
and c obviously s teraCopy is vulnerable
because it doesn't stop us from copying
more than 32 byte so that is our
overflow and then we free again the
objects in reverse order C B and a and
we have the printf at the end so as you
can see there is no obvious application
logic we could exploit no use after free
no vulnerable pointer on the heap but
still it's possible to redirect code
execution and as the description says
this level is about corrupting heap
metadata so there is an issue with the
heap algorithm in this case in the free
function that we can use to redirect the
execution to winner let's start by
looking at the heap in gdb to do this
let's add a couple of breakpoints how
about each library function so break at
my log string copy free and the printf
which is actually put at the end this
quickly run it don't forget the three
arguments and continue until you arrive
at the first string
copy then check the map memory for this
process and look for the heap so this
shows us that our heap area is from 8 0
4 C 2 8 0 for D and we can define a hook
stop to always print like 56 words of
this area when we hit a breakpoint when
we now rerun the program we can see how
the heap develops let's do it before we
execute the first Mel up we don't have a
heap yet after the melech we can now see
the first object on the heap so remember
how a heap chunk looks like this is the
size of the current chunk which is hex
to 9 the last bit indicates if the
previous chunk is in use and because
it's the special first chunk there is no
valid memory before that does it test a
bit set indicating that this memory is
not available not free this means the
true size of the chunk is hex to 8 which
is 40 bytes so malloc allocated a bit
more than 32 bytes that doesn't matter
to us after this chunk we have the
wilderness which is like the first chunk
a little bit special but you can just
imagine it as a huge free block still
available for allocation and that's its
size and it is obviously has the last
bit set because the previous chunk is in
use
we Mel up the second object same size
last bit set because of previous chunk
is in use and the wilderness was updated
and has now less free space but still
the previous chunk is in use and the
last object another one with the same
size last bit set because the previous
is in use and less space available in
the wilderness next we execute the
string copies so we copy the first
argument which was the a is to the first
chunk the B's to the second chunk and
the C's to the third junk obviously we
could have written a lot more and
completely overwrite everything
including the chunk size which is the
heap metadata next we're going to free
them again so last chunk got freed the
C's got all written with zero because
these two words you have special meaning
for free block so previously we had
allocated blocks now we have a block
that is available again free not much
else change in fact those chunks are
very small and are considered fast bins
by malloc they behave a little bit
different we will learn about that in a
little bit later but let's go
continue and free the next one so we
have two free blocks this time our
beasts got all written with an address
and it points to the other free block
that's a special meaning of the Overtoun
word they are pointers pointing to the
next free block a linked list okay
continue and free the next one and we
extend the linked list the first free
block points to the second one and the
second one point to the third one which
is the last block before the wilderness
you probably ask yourself by the last
bit of the sizes which indicate that the
previous blocks are in use didn't get
set to zero it's a bit confusing but
think like an algorithm for a second in
this case they are small fast bins and
we want to be super fast handing them
and how we freed blocks in this reverse
order it just doesn't matter it would be
unnecessary waste of time to set that
bit just imagine this point of somewhere
which always points to the first free
chunk when I now want to malloc
something and look for free space I can
simply follow the link list to find all
the free chunks and that's the
information that a previous chunk is
free is just irrelevant right but it
will also look a little bit different if
the chunk sizes were bigger then malloc
and free would clean up a little bit
more and use more heat metadata for
housekeeping but let's not get hung up
on this we will walk through some of
part of the algorithm later and clear up
some ports so let's have a look in the
code when we look for the dilma log
algorithm for this case make sure you
have version that is over 15 years old
otherwise you look at a patched version
now before we start reading the code
think for a moment what we are looking
for we look for a primitive that allows
us to perform an arbitrary right that
would allow us to overwrite an entry in
the global offset table one possible way
how such code that can be abused for
that looks like is following pointers
that we control right if there is some
kind of code what performs a right based
on pointers on the heap and can overflow
we win let's keep that in mind when we
look at the code the functions start
with the parameter mem which is the
address we want to free shortly
afterwards
mem to chunk is called which gets the
address towards ahead of mem which is
the true starting address of the chunk
the first if
we reach contains only a little bit of
code and it refers to fast bins this is
exactly what we witnessed when we freed
our small 32 byte chunks it updated the
first pointer the FD pointer which
created the linked list but otherwise
not much happens and thus it's not very
interesting so this means we really want
to make sure that our size is greater
than the maximum fat span chunk size
which is defined as ad our chunk sizes
are 32 so we want to make sure that we
overflow the size of this chunk we
handle if we head into the elsif we
arrive at an interesting comment
consolidate other none and map chunks if
we check what is necessary to pass this
test we look at the chunk is M map macro
which takes the size of P which is the
size of the current chunk and check the
is MF flag very similar to the pref in
use bit which is the last one the is MF
flag is a second last bit so when we
want to reach the code here we have to
make sure that the second last bit is
not set then we get the address of the
next chunk which we can calculate based
on the size of our current chunk so with
an overflow the size is already
something we can control
this means that here we have a first
opportunity to fool free into thinking
some other data is the next chunk after
that we have a check of the previous
changes in use if the previous chunk
would not be in use which is defined by
the lowest bit set to 0 we would follow
the pref size which we haven't
introduced yet but it's this word before
our chunk size and thus calculates the
address of the previous chunk again a
value we possibly can control then we
execute an unlink that's the magic word
I mentioned at the beginning so let's
see what that means the first parameter
P is the block before our current block
which you got following the pref size we
take the forward and backward pointer of
that chunk which is the first and second
word after the size and remember it in
FD and BK next two lines for simplicity
ignore the arrow BK and arrow FD because
net just references a small offset from
the address here we add those offsets
afterwards
so now we write the address BK to the
address where FD is pointing to and then
we okay stop BK could be the address of
the winner function and FD plus 12 could
be our g OT table entry for puts this
would all will write an entry in the
global offset table with the winner
function this sounds perfect
but we forget the next part where we
would take our g OT address and FD and
attempt to ride it to the address of
winner + 8 ah then what zeg fault we
can't write into the code segment dammit
but now you just have to get creative
think about it if we have two memory
segments segment a and segment B we can
write an address from segment a into
segment B and we write an address from
segment B into segment a the global offs
the table's rideable so that could be
one of those segments just the code
segment can't be the other one but the
heap could be our second one we can
write to the heap this would allow us to
write an address from the heap to the
global of the tailor and some
unimportant address from the global
offset table where we written into the
heap this means we can redirect code
execution we are the global off the
table to shellcode that we place on the
heap and then the shell code calls
winner files that sounds like an awesome
plan let's take the state of the heap as
we know it and think about how we would
want to construct the case we just
explained so we could decide that we
want to free the last block and make
sure the pref and use bit is set to 0 so
that it attempts to consolidate the
previous block let's actually make those
changes right here with gdb this way we
can directly test it set the chunk size
to more than 80 and have the pref and
use bits set to 0 so why not 100 now we
want to set the prefs eyes to point to
the previous block we want to merge with
let's make that a small block so maybe
hex 10 this means at - hex 1 0 we have
to create a fake chunk of that size so
set the size to hex 1 1 because we want
to indicate that the chunk before this
fake junk would be in use great now we
need the address from puts in the global
offset table this will be the forward
pointer where the second pointer will be
written to at plus 12 that's why you
have to do puts minus 12 because it will
be written to the address plus 12 and
the other pointer will be the address
that we write to the global offset table
so that one should point somewhere into
the heap where we can place some shell
code why not go here just one other
thing to consider before we can test it
the size is used to calculate the next
chunk in the next size and after the
unlink those values are used
so if we use the size 100 we pointed to
some unused memory and we have to make
sure that the values there behave nicely
otherwise we will crash there is an if
check if the next chunk is the top or
what we call the wilderness but our size
is overshooting that address this means
we land in this if case and now it
calculates next block of that one and
checks the Preferences but to figure out
if the block before is free or not so if
it is not in use we perform another
unlink to also merge the unused block
after the current one which copies
around those pointers
hey this life overflow from the future
I'm just editing this part and I
realized that I misread the code here I
thought I had the choice between this
short unlink if case or the whole else
case below but I missed that there are
no curly braces which means the else
case is just this clear and use bidded
offset function when I was developing
this proof-of-concept
I thought to myself I don't want to over
complicate it with the code down here in
fact I made it over complicated because
we have to construct another fake chunk
now to deal with the second unlink in
here but whatever I think there was a
great learning experience let's head
back into the episode
but at this point we should have already
succeeded in writing our he Butler to
the global offset tale with a previous
ending so we can just pick two random
heat valves to not crash here so those
are two more fake chunks with the
forward and backward pointer pointing
into the heat which we don't care about
this is like overflow from the future
again I just realized I made another
small mistake which negates my false
assumption about the big L's case from
earlier I actually did set the previous
bit which means it does not consolidate
this freak trunk not to mention that I
said the FD nbk point of all the wrong
track anyway should have been in the
other junk before I'm sorry guys I'm
just a noob so to summarize we change
the size of the block we are going to
free we create a free fake chunk before
our current one to trigger an unlink and
overwrite the global off the table and
we create two fake chunks afterwards
where the second one says about the
previous one that it is in use that's
not triggering another unlink and those
two values you were unnecessary now if
you continue and execute the first free
we can check the entry for puts and we
see the function address was
successfully written and when we look at
the heap we can see that at offset plus
8 we have a G ot adverse written awesome
and when we continue to the pods and
single step forward we jump into the
heap awesome this works now we just have
to get these rows into the heap with a
string copy oh no oh no no no no no no
I'm stupid
string copy can copy null bytes a string
and C is too fine to end with now so we
can't write sizes like hex 10 into
memory at least not multiple times
oh dammit the whole plan doesn't work in
this case if it were read it will work
but not with string copy I go sit in my
corner now and think about all the
failures in my life see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
