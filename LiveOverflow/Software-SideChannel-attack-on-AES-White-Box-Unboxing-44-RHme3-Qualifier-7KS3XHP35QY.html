from the first three parts covering the
white box script adjourned from the
origin III qualifier they are pretty
long and rambling so let me quickly
summarize white box crypto is a method
where you try to hide the secret key of
for example AES encryption inside a
binary it's called white box crypto
because essentially you can perform a
white box analysis of the binary that
implements the crypto and extract the
key so it uses some fancy tricks like
look-up tables instead of straight
calculations to hide the actual steps
now in the past videos I've spent a lot
of time reversing the binary
understanding AES and come up with a few
attack ideas but in the end none led to
the key
so let me show you how I and most other
players have solved this challenge very
early during the qualifier people were
sharing the link to this repository on
the official IRC channel and people were
saying is on a spoiler and whatever and
I think you could even find the
repository when googling for it because
of a commit message so this is a
repository of various public whiteboard
crypto implementations and their attacks
so apparently it can be used for this
challenge
and during the CTF this commit appeared
adding a feature that allows passing the
key via our standard input to the binary
and we know that the challenge hasn't
input to read from standard in now when
you look around there are actually three
relevant repositories Deadpool contains
a lot of examples from various other
white box challenges so that's a cool
start then we have daredevil which is a
tool to perform correlation power
analysis attacks so it's a side channel
attack tool which makes sense because we
know that from Hardware side channels
can leak information about the secret
key so maybe the solution here is also
to use a satchel attack on the white box
binary and then there is a tracer
repository it contains a set of dynamic
binary instrumentation and visualization
tools for execution traces so when you
look at a relevant example in Deadpool
for example I looked for some AES
implementation you can see that it
requires the Deadpool script and then
use the tracer tool to collect tracers
from the binary in this case the binary
was called white box on a squad
challenge and we collect 2000 traces and
we configure it with some attack
algorithms targeting s box or the
multiplicative inverse no clue so we
definitely have to install daredevil n
tracer I'd like to always work on a
fresh learn off machine so I off just
click myself some server and rent it for
a few hours or days then we just follow
the read means of the repositories
install dependencies and compile it this
takes a while the real challenge here is
to compile tracer there are two ways to
run tracer and I try to get pin working
but when you follow the instruction pin
fails to compile the C++ ABI of your
computer does not match the ABI of the
pin kit
this is really difficult because you
have to realize in this moment that you
can use Google and when you spend
minutes reading through your results you
find this tip that you can specify the
API version that shall be used for PIN
so we have to add these compound flex to
the make file of pin the next problem I
had was simply make didn't work because
the SQLite 3 library was not found but
this happened for the 32-bit version and
we only need the 64 bit so the crazy
trick I used was just to make the 64 bit
version and then it worked
Wow now we also have to adjust the
tracer example script for white box
binary if we look at the commit that
added the esterday in feature we see
that the process input returns now a
tuple first element is what is passed to
the STD input in the second one are the
arc V commands so we pass in the raw
bytes for STD in and for the arguments
we specify the option - - acid in and
process output simply has to read the
hex values and convert it back to an
integer then we can run it that's pretty
slow collecting execution traces takes a
while so let's lower the amount of
traces for now okay let it run okay it's
just done now where's the key well we
should have written more off the read
nice man it's so difficult well here
says that we now have to use Daredevil
and use the conflict that was generated
by tracer so let's just use one and let
it run
it performs some sideshow analysis of
the traces and finds good candidates for
the key bites with the super high
confidence so we just have to let it run
and wait for it to finish okay here we
go this already looks like a ski let's
decode it all tables are ours hmm this
was the solution we didn't have to
understand anything about AES as you can
tell I'm salty again about this I feel
ashamed for having used this tool and
I'm sure the challenge greatest knew
that this tool exists I also want to
mention that I know a few who have
solved it without this tool and for them
it was probably very insightful an
interesting challenge so if I being
honest then I'm just salty because I'm
not smart enough and expect people to
make challenges that I can solve but you
know I want to learn something with CTF
and especially for the easy low points
qualification challenges kind of stuff I
would love to see more approachable
challenges and then for the higher ones
go crazy make it hard and let the smart
people shine so here's how I see this
challenge you want to create a white box
crypto challenge right so you can do it
super simple just use some lookup tables
but don't mask it or don't mask the last
round or so then it's a lot easier like
we explored in the previous videos we
could have reversed the key from those
steps or you can create a much more
advanced version with a lot of
countermeasures where you either have to
dig really deep or use some advanced
tool and you see both challenge versions
can be easily solved with the tool right
if you expect it to be easy because
there's a tool make sure that you lead
noobs to discover those tools a few more
hints or tips in a binary or just link
the tool otherwise nobody wins here
advanced players throw the tool they
know edit and noop like me can solve it
by hand because it's just already a bit
too advanced and we get frustrated
especially for the qualifier and to
create a learning experience for noobs
it's great to make a more simple
challenge if you make it approachable
for beginners they could have learned
about AES and implement their own at
it would be so beneficial in people who
discovered the tool can still Chee's it
if there's a tool that works against a
heart and a simple problem just make the
challenge a simple problem so there's
more options to solve it and encourage
doing it by hand rather than giving up
and using a tool like I did anyway I
still learned a lot a little bit salty
but that's fine I'm looking forward to
the actual CTF it's gonna be awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
