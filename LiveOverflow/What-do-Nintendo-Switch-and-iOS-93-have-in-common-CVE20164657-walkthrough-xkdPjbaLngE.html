switch have in common they both use the
browser engine WebKit with a version
that is vulnerable to a known memory
corruption vulnerability remember the
news of the Pegasus malware for iOS
which was discovered when it was used in
a targeted attack against the human
rights activist ahmed mansour that Melva
used a WebKit exploit as the first stage
to gain arbitrary code execution clergy
and dapeng go team then used this back
in the JailbreakMe website and it turns
out the browser of the nintendo switch
is so old that it also has this bug and
this is what a lot of people are using
right now as a first entry point in
hacking the switch obviously the whole
jailbreak is extremely complex even just
getting code execution is insane but I
spent now quite some time understanding
the back itself and the first crucial
part which will create an arbitrary
read/write primitive so you can override
anything in memory for example function
pointers but let's start at the
beginning
first we need to figure out how to
access the browser in the switch you may
have heard that the Nintendo switch does
not have a browser so what the heck am I
talking about
well there is no good rouser implemented
but it turns out that when you connect
to a Wi-Fi which requires you to login
in a captive portal it will use a
browser view and load that page for you
a captive portal is common in hotels
airports and so forth so we have to
figure out how to load our own website
here when you look at the network
settings you can specify a proxy server
which is great because then I can run a
proxy server on my laptop and intercept
all the traffic I use pursued as my
proxy server and just have to make sure
it listens on all interfaces so other
devices on the same network can use it
so now we just have to enter the IP of
this laptop into the proxy settings of
the switch when we now connect to the
Wi-Fi the switch will establish a
connection through this laptop and we
can see here in the purpose review that
the switch try to contact contest
Nintendo Wi-Fi net net site just
responds with a simple string that the
connection works it uses this to check
if you have an internet connection or
not so if this check fails it will think
you first need to authenticate from a
captive portal so next we need to
redirect this request to a different
page basically our captive portal we can
do that by simply modifying the e.t.c
host file to point the contest to main
to another IP for example localhost then
we spawn a simple web server on our
machine for example with PHP minus s we
can place an index.html file here to
verify that this works and with a
browser we can see that we now on
localhost have a web server running so
when the switch now connects to the
Wi-Fi it will try to contact contest it
will go through the proxy on my laptop
my laptop sees in the HTC host file what
the IP for contest is so the proxy will
connect to localhost instead which will
access our index.html file now let's try
it we connect to it it will
check if there is access to the Internet
it didn't get the expected result for
contest back and tells you you have to
login when we now press next it will
load what it thinks is the captive
portal now we have access to a browser
that loads our website so now that we
have that set up let's read a bit more
on the WebKit bug it was a sign CBE 2016
4 6 5 7 and has a description
WebKit in Apple iOS before 9.35 allows
remote attack us to execute arbitrary
code or cause a denial of service memory
corruption layer across the website the
description can be a bit misleading
makes it sound like it's only an iOS
issue but it's generally a WebKit bug
and would affect anything that use that
particular WebKit version in our case
the Nintendo switch also this is not an
exploit where you just type into
Metasploit use exploit Nintendo switch
WebKit this is something where you
actually have to understand it quite
in-depth to be able to use it now let's
take queries JailbreakMe code which uses
the WebKit back extract the first
relevant part and adapt it to a Nintendo
switch I won't go through all this
process because that took me ages to
understand but I want to show and
explain to you what I got now so let's
walk through it
first we create a typed array of
unsigned the
two bit integers and in memory this will
create a struct with a couple of
different values such as a J s cell
which contains a couple of interesting
values like the structure ID that
determines the kind of the type of this
object and we will have a later look at
this again
a butterfly pointer which is used in a
bit more complex object but not quite
relevant for us right now a vector which
contains a pointer to a chunk of memory
that represents our array and the length
of that memory so that area gives us
basically access to raw bytes in memory
obviously you can't access beyond its
length then we create a more flexible
array a standard error like you might
use that area is a bit different as it
can contain arbitrary types any kind of
objects so instead of just pointing to
raw memory it points to more complex
objects called J s values and here's an
example of the integer with the hex
value for one for one for 101 it would
store ffff 0 0 0 before it to indicate
the value is an integer look at the
amazing strength paper if you want to
know more details about these traders
values in the case of the expert it will
set the first element of the error to a
big array buffer and the second to some
number an area buffer is also access to
raw bytes basically different typed
areas can point to some buffer in memory
so if I'm not mistaken the first element
of the array is now a J's value with a
pointer to an array buffer
next we create a simple JavaScript
object and overwrite its two string
function this function is called
whenever you want to get a string
representation of that object so if I
return 1 through c7 object as a string
and I would alert this object it would
call to string and show me that one in
this case the function does a bit more
it first sets the reference to the array
we just created to null as well as
setting another property to know in a
second you will see that this stale
property is also a reference to the our
array theoretically now all references
of the array are gone and the garbage
collector can free that array to force
the garbage collector to kick in right
now we can use the function which just
allocated removes a lot of objects and
when you do this a couple of times you
can be fairly certain that the garbage
collector did some work after the
garbage collection the function will now
allocate a lot of new you in 32 arrays
the reference to those are stored in
stuff so we can access those errors and
if everything goes well those areas
might be allocated where the previous
array was but how is this object with
that two string function used now
we define an object that we use as
properties and I think we allocate more
than just two so the properties are not
stored in line but I'm not an adventurer
anyway one of these properties is called
scale and is set to the array reference
that is the property that the two string
function will set to now another
property is the length which is set to
the not number object then we create a
new empty array target and apply those
properties to it with object defined
properties this means all those
properties we defined will be set to the
target area during this assignment the
to string function of not number will be
called and causes the garbage collection
of the area as well as the allocation of
a lot of U and 32 areas and this is
where the back happens theoretically the
stale property was set to null and
should not be accessible but somehow the
reference is still there some stuff
internally did not properly check
everything this means that we have a
reference into some memory where
previously the our array was allocated
and we also allocate a lot of U and 32
areas and we hope these now overlap as I
mentioned earlier the U and 32 areas
allow direct memory access they can read
and write raw bytes where the our area
was a complex object with j s values now
it's already clear what you can do with
this you can use the U and 32 arrays
which are accessible via bus to read and
write raw bytes at the location where
the stay of properties things are
standard JavaScript objectives so first
we have to find if and how the buff in
the same array overlap to do this we can
simply add a number to the first element
of stale but what is the first element
of stale now isn't that garbage memory
well ideally if everything works it
points where we created the U and 32
areas and we populated that memory
region with hex ffff 0 0 0 4 1 4 1 4 1 4
1 which is a KS value representing an
integer in fact
for one for one for one one this means
now we add hex 1 or 1 to the first
element of this Dale area making it the
integer for one for one for two for two
we can now simply search through the
hole you enter to array memory bus
looking for this for one for one for two
for two keep in mind that the buffer has
access to raw bytes so it will also see
the ffff zero zero enter for one for one
for one while the stale Airy things this
is a JavaScript object and only users
area zero internally to determine that
we have an integer in the value of it
this for one tone for one for one so
what can we do with it now this is where
exploitation really becomes creative the
frac article says that once you have the
ability to craft arbitrary JavaScript
objects you could craft afloat 64 array
to create a readwrite primitive but
clergy use a UN 32 area to quote him
here is his reason it's easier than
float to do math with lot and I guess he
has a point floating point values and
raw bytes are really annoying so first
of all why do we want to crafter you in
32 area if you remember the basic
structure of a UN 32 area it uses a
vector to point to some raw memory if
you control where this memory points to
you can control where you can read data
from and write data to because it thinks
it points to the actual array there's a
super clever way how to craft this arena
QWERTY creates a new object with four
properties ABCD he probably just took
that from the frac article because when
you look at how the simple object with
only four properties is stored it stores
the values in line this is very helpful
in a second as you see the value set
like the hex 137 are simply placed here
in memory after each other so that's a
very neat way to control a couple of
consecutive values in memory the to
64-bit values are the JSL and the
butterfly pointer the Jaso or more
specifically the structure ID inside of
the JSL determines what this javascript
object actually is in the frac article
it looks like the object ID here has 136
so in order to craft a you in 32 area we
would have to know the structure ID of
that according to the Frank article this
ID can change sometimes maybe it we
started between different WebKit builds
but apparently it's very common to be
105 nonetheless because my ex-wife was
very unstable I try to see if the value
is maybe different and the frac article
shows the technique how to do that back
to the new abject for a second this will
allocate the new object with four
properties that look like this in memory
hex 69 or in decimal 105 then 0 the
pointer to the smash array which we
allocated way at the beginning and X 100
the function U 2d is a clever little
helper as every number in JavaScript is
basically a float we can create a new
data few of 16 bytes so 64-bit set the
high and the low 32 bits and return the
float representation of your space this
new object creation will also overwrite
stale 0 just a few seconds ago I
mentioned that stale 0 points to a J is
value of representing a number but now
it was all written with a J's value
representing a pointer a pointer to the
Jas object that was just created this J
is object it points to is not very
interesting for us it's not an arbitrary
object we have profit but remember that
the J is a value with the pointer to
this object is in the memory that is
overlapped by the buff this means we can
use buff to manipulate the pointer and
what we do is we add hex 10 or decimal
16 which moves the pointer into the
properties of the JS object now suddenly
the hex 6 9 is a JSL value and the 0
here is a butterfly and the smash
address becomes the vector the pointer
where the actual array is in memory to
be clear this point into the similar
struct of that array so this doesn't
point into the memory location of that
smash array but also into this JS object
struck with its vector pointer and its
lens and text 1 0 0 is the length of the
arrey witches are treated as the object
structure of the smash area so now you
know how we can miss align the pointer
to this object which will interpret the
properties here as the actual object we
remember the original still zero pointer
in stale one and then miss align stale
zero then we can check the type of the
stale zero object if it's not correct we
increment our structure idea guess and
assign a new value to the stale one a
property which will look like the
structure ID from the misaligned pointer
in still zero or we basically create it
now is we have two pointers in stale
which slightly overlap in memory we also
have somewhere an array called smash we
have also set the memory location for
our crafted array the vector pointer to
point to smash to the smash structure
not the actual memory location of the
smash array this means we have another
object that we can fully control stale
is an array the first element of stale
points to a crafted um 32 array so when
we access the element of the array we
obviously access the 32-bit values of
the smash J's
object structure and as you know the
object contains 64-bit values and the
six 64-bit value is the length of the
smash area so still 0 of 0 and 1 would
be the first 64-bit two and three would
be the second 64-bit foreign five would
be the third 64-bit and six and seven
would be the fourth 64-bit so with stale
0 6 we can overwrite the length of the
smash array and we can now check the
length of this measuring let's try this
on the switch we load the page and it
might not immediately work but it will
refresh and try again
okay so we trigger the back and we found
overlapping memory by looking for 4 1 4
1 4 2 4 2 now we check the current
length of smash we cross our objects
then we change the length of smash and
print this smash lens again and it
changed it's not crazy so now we can
just modify the vector where the smash
or it points to in the exact same way
and then simply read the raw data at
Pala to from the smash area or right to
the semester it gives us a super simple
access to the whole memory of the
process next steps could be to find the
address of the browser binary in memory
to dump it this video is already crazy
long so let's stop here for now I really
learned a lot working through the first
part of credit exploit I hope this also
gives you a sense for how freaking
complicated these modern memory
corruption exploits are and what kind of
work and knowledge is required to do
them I only scratched the surface here I
hope this also increases your respect
for the people who do this kind of
research at this point I also want to
thank Reed roid and undo who I just met
on IRC and we're in the same boat as me
and we helped each other trying to
figure out how this works and also huge
thank you to QWERTY who answered a lot
of my new questions and shared his
progress with me I really appreciate you
supporting somebody who tries to learn
this if this sounds like fun to you make
sure you read the frag paper by Samuel
Groth or Salo about attacking JavaScript
engines which gives you a way more
in-depth insight into how this works
there's also another article more
specifically about Firefox which is
different from WebKit but also gives you
a better idea how browsers work thank
you very much
keep on hacking in the free world and do
to loot to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
