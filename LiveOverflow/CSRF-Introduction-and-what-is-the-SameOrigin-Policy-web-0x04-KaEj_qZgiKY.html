technique called cross-site request
forgery CSRF
in the last video we have explored XSS
cross-site scripting which allows us to
execute JavaScript in the context of a
user's session this allows us to perform
any actions the user could do thus we
can use it to send messages to other
users on the platform without the victim
noticing or injecting fake news article
into a site or simply defacing it but if
the site implemented user input securely
properly escapes the strings then you
are out of luck one might wonder why you
cannot simply run JavaScript on your own
site that you control and perform the
same requests and actions well the
security model of the browser prevents
that this security model is called the
same origin policy whatever is running
on my life overflow dot-com domain is
not allowed to access resources across
origin you will get an error but wait
that doesn't make any sense how can the
reddit domain access resources namely
images from this other origin Inger calm
does that not violate the same origin
policy you are so smart for asking this
question the same original policy is
obviously a little bit more complex and
there are a lot of different cases you
have to consider let's do some examples
so you just see how diverse it is I'm
here on reddit it has the origin HTTP
reddit calm over here I have HTTPS M
Gore calm so on reddit I can easily use
an HTML image tag and load the image
resource as you can see the browser did
the request without complaining on
reddit you can get a lot of data in JSON
format it's a neat trick if you didn't
know about that question can Engler calm
access those JSON responses is a simple
gate request like the image right and we
are able to display the image so we
should be able to get the content of
this risk request as well we can use XML
HTTP request to perform a get request
looks like it worked but the response is
empty Jason and it doesn't contain the
data we expected let's have a look at
the network tab to see what happened we
first notice there is more than one
simple request the first one here got a
response from the reddit soul with a
location header the browser receiving
this header will now perform a redirect
to this new location and this new
location is slash login that makes sense
when we look closely we don't see any
cookies being sent along with this
request like it did when we simply open
this URL on reddit a quick Google search
will tell you that you can include their
cookies by setting with credentials to
true before sending the request but nope
now it doesn't work now the browser
complains that you are violating the
same origin policy the domain in Gore
com is not allowed to perform a get
request to reddit.com with cookies this
makes it kinda useless for an attack
because as an attacker we would like to
extract private user data but without
the cookies it will never contain
private stuff let's try something else
let's use an image tag like earlier and
load this JSON file we look into the
network tab in what the it did send
the cookies with this request so did we
just find a bypass to the same origin
policy well no you see we can't access
the response of this request we cannot
access the JSON content thus we cannot
access the private user data okay so it
looks like the same origin policy is
pretty good it prevents us from
accessing private data across origins of
course there are some technical
possibilities to loosen up this policy
and Chrome even tells you about it in
the error message with this special
response header that could be set by the
reddit server this could be allowed but
one thing is still fishy with the image
source we just performed an
authenticated meaning cookies were
included a request to the other domain
we don't get the response but could this
still be exploited in a meaningful way
yes it can
let's see you remember the different
HTTP methods like get and post
get requests are intended to fetch to
get a resource and nothing else well a
post request potentially change a user's
data so performing an authenticated get
request should generally be safe except
when the site is developed badly and a
URL is accessible via get performs an
actual action if that is the case you
have found your first cross-site request
forgery CSRF vulnerability so if there
is for example a URL that deletes a user
like profile delete you embed that as an
image on your website then every user
visiting your site will delete their
profile without them noticing it okay
but let's say the developer follows this
design and there are no state change in
get requests is the site safe well
here's another technique for post
request I can create a form with the
method post and the action aiming at the
other domain and when we submit the form
it will perform a post request with the
cookies so yes we can perform an
authenticated post request as well so
the site also redirects to the new other
domain but we can hide that from the
user or don't care because the attack
then is over anyway but how do I get a
user to click well a user doesn't have
to click you can simply auto submit this
form with JavaScript just to make it
clear the same original policy is not
violated here because our origin does
not get to access the resources the
response the data of this other domain
so how do we protect from this kind of
attack one approach would be to compare
a legitimate request from our domain
with an illegitimate request from
another domain and see if there are any
differences that we could check for oh
yeah we could check for the origin
header which is definitely different
this might sound like a good idea
it certainly prevents some kind of
cross-site request forgery attacks but
for example sites like forums allow
users to embed their own pictures and if
this forum is vulnerable to a get CSRF
attack then users could simply embed
that URL as an image into a message and
the request would come from the same
domain so this is not a bulletproof
protect
there are also some kind of mitigations
for example form post requests always
sent the data URL encoded and you may
have found this old stack exchange third
telling you that across domain request
with the content type jason is
impossible and your endpoint could only
accept json data and this might prevent
some noobs from exploiting it but your
trust into this protection is flawed
down here in the hidden in a comment you
find information about a trick using
navigator send beacon it's a super
awesome trick and little tricks like
that make the difference between a
normal web penetration tester and a
great one anyhow as you can see this is
also not bulletproof so then what can we
do the solution is called CSRF token
sees RF tokens can be implemented in a
few different ways but generally you
want a secret random value to be set by
the server in a way that it's only
accessible to the website running on the
same domain and this secret value has to
be included in every post request to the
server otherwise it will refuse to react
to the request and that works because
the same original policy prevents other
domains accessing your data this cannot
get the secret CSRF token but the legit
domain can obviously if you find a way
to leave the CSRF token can you defeat
this year's RF protection now this Titan
doesn't have to change with every
request but the idea is that it's hard
to predict so it shouldn't be valid
forever also very very important CSRF
tokens have to be bound to your users
session otherwise I could accept for
example collect valid CF tokens with one
account and use them in a series or F
attack against other accounts cross-site
request forgery can be extremely
powerful and by passing a weak self
protection can be super fun but make no
mistake just because a website has a
vulnerable endpoint doesn't mean it's a
critical issue but before we finish here
I want to simulate your creativity a
little bit by giving you an example and
how you can turn a few low severity bugs
into a cool attack here's the recipe
first low severity issue is a stork self
xs/s vulnerability self XSS means that
we can inject the JavaScript payload
into a website for example a personal
notebook on its side but it only effects
our own user account
we can't trick anybody else in executing
this JavaScript payload because we are
the only one seeing our personal note so
it's useless right or is it next issue
is a lock out cross-site request forgery
this allows us to lock out anybody
visiting our evil page
the last issue is a lock in cross-site
request forgery so this allows us to
send you log in credentials to
authenticate with that website by what
the hell would we do use that for well
here's our attack plan first we create a
new account and add the self XSS maybe
the payload can create a fake login from
telling the user to re-enter their
password so we can steal it then we
build an attack site that will execute
the following two things in order first
it will make sure the victim is not
locked into the site by using the
lockout CSRF and then we perform a lock
in CSRF with the account credentials of
our self XSS account now we simply have
to redirect the victim back to the site
and the victim will be authenticated
with our account executing the self XSS
asking for the password
