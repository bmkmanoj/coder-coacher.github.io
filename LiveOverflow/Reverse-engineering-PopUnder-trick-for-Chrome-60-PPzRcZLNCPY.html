and Google Chrome tries to stop them
unfortunately some advertisers find bugs
in browsers that they exploit to achieve
pop-unders to me that's like exploiting
any other bug for malicious purposes so
in the last video I reverse engineered a
technique that worked on Chrome version
59 and also still worked on Chrome 64
Mac and what super cool is that
avy Dressman from Google who works on
the pro bono blocker for chrome filed
the bug in the issue tracker and in
sticking it and turns out that for
Windows this has been already fixed in
version 60 so the issue only remained on
Mac but when I visited the demo page of
the guy who sells this pub under library
then it still works on Windows how
remember the underlying idea for a pub
under is to open a pop-up and then
return focus get the main window back to
the front so the pop-up stays in the
background and the previous technique
combined a notification permission
request along with a PDF alert to
achieve that but this new version for
Windows doesn't seem to use the
notification permission bubble so how
the heck does this work well I figured
it out so chrome can fix it and it's
again super clever let's head in
I got some great feedback after the last
video and try to improve my techniques
on working with obfuscated JavaScript so
if you have more awesome tips or ideas
please share them
one was from Alex a que inserts group
who has an amazing blog where he writes
a lot about abusing PDFs in browsers and
if you are like many others surprised
about javascript in PDF then you should
really check out his work he suggested
instead of mirroring the site locally to
insert my own JavaScript I could develop
a small Chrome extension to inject a
script into every page this has the
awesome advantage that I could inject
myself into any iframe that is being
created and track whatever they are
doing as well I think that's a much
nicer technique so I started doing that
in the manifest I declared a script that
should be injected into anything no
matter the protocol domain or path and
do so before any other JavaScript runs
in this injected script is a Content
script which has some access to the page
but not fully so then I create a dynamic
script and inject it into the page this
hook script then that's what I did in
the last video it attaches proxies to
interesting functions and objects and
later that would be the explorative task
of adding and removing proxies as I need
them then I use window post message to
send the debug log to the content script
which is listening to those messages and
in the content script I take these
arriving messages and forward them to
the background script and the background
script is always running and can now
receive and show all log output of all
pages in one place so a page is loaded
content script is attached to it and
executes inserts another script and uses
messages to send it back to the
background script and then you can
simply load the extension from a folder
in Chrome we now have this extension
active on the demo page you will quickly
see that it creates again an object tag
dynamically with a PDF and it's
basically the PDF we know it just cause
alert
but then I kind of got stuck the logging
output was not perfect I was wondering
if I should improve this extension to
log everything basically create an
extensive Dom logger extension with
filtering and a nice UI and log property
accesses and not only function calls and
that would be an amazing tool to have
but is a lot of work so I want to try
something else
at least we know an extension like this
could work and the PDF is involved again
next I recorded again
the pop-under and slowed it down because
last time it reveals the PDF alert and
the notification permission requests but
this time it's different
this time it opens a blank tab then the
pop-up which appears in the background
and closes the tab again we don't see
the PDF alert because it's just super
fast but when you overwrite the remove
child function making it not work like
in the last video and then do it you see
that the alert is actually there so at
this point I felt I understand the
underlying idea of this trick somehow
you'll retain focus of the main window
when you open a new tab plus using a PDF
alert but when you start trying to
emulate that and you quickly run into
the issue that you cannot call window
open twice a window open is used with
different parameters to open pop-ups or
new tabs and calling it twice triggers
the pop-up blocker and it will prevent
it you see pop-ups are only allowed when
triggered through human interaction so
for example when you click a malicious
site would simply overlay the whole page
with the click handler but nonetheless
you have to interact to make a trigger
but this also means a single click will
only open one window so how do you do it
twice open the tab end a new window so I
look more closely at the performance tab
of the chrome developer tools they can
click record and then perform actions on
the page you want and then stop the
recording now it recorded everything
that happened
tip is intended to find performance
bottlenecks for example identifying very
slow functions and for our purpose it's
not perfect a lot of information is
missing but when you look closely you
can find two major blocks that call
window open this graph is easy to read
each function call is a bar and when a
function calls another function a new
bar is below it so the topmost bar is
the initial function and the lowest bar
is where it ends in so you see this one
block here triggered on a mouse down and
the other one is triggered on a mouse up
event also that's the trick
I've used to user interaction handlers
that happen during one click to open two
windows just open a window on Mouse down
and another one on Mouse up let's test
it we create two functions that open a
new window and declare to be executed on
Mouse down and mouse up and when we test
it it doesn't work the Chrome pop-up
blocker is not dead easily fooled
somebody was smart and made sure that
that is not possible but how do Frick
does a demo do it then while the
performance tab doesn't have a lot of
information it has has links to the
functions in the JavaScript source
unfortunately you know the code is
obfuscated and there's the super
annoying debug a breakpoint called
constantly which prevents us from
debugging with breakpoints when I
initially looked at the stuff for the
older video I defeated this anti
debugging thing by overwriting set
timeout because a function called with
it was responsible for constantly
triggering the debugger but a much
cooler JavaScript snippet was posted by
/ abscess or WW in a comment on the
other YouTube video the code is intended
to be loaded with temper monkey which is
an extension that simply injects
JavaScript snippet into the site to
enhance them super-freaky script but in
the end all what it does is prevent the
demo from calling debugger all the time
to annoy us if we replace the unsafe
window with regular window and paste it
into the console we can now simply debug
the J's code so let's go to the
performance tab again and see where the
first window open calls
from it comes from this anonymous
function and it shows us where it is and
chrome dev tools are awesome it even
knows where in the script it is when we
pretty print it there so something in
there calls
open let's just set some random
breakpoints in there to investigate then
trigger another pop under and the
debugger should pause there we are
press escape to open the console in the
current JavaScript context so E is just
pointing to a window object and ER is
the string closed so this would call
window close hmm weird let's continue
always single step forward n is an area
of functions and QE is a weird function
if you step in it and investigate it
doesn't tell us much so all I'm doing
now is just stepping in investigating
the variables so for example here is a
again so window and si is a string go so
it would call window go hmm weird that's
not a standard window function but it
didn't really tell us much and also when
we continued the script it doesn't work
no pop under so maybe we screwed up some
timing let's remove the breakpoint in
here and remember that this part wanted
to call clothes and go on the e
window object and then we do it again so
what is this HS HS points to open a half
so that's probably an important window
open call and a o as well as ye are the
parameters of it so about blank and
underscore blank this will open the new
tab and remember that E was a window
object that the other function wanted to
close and call go on so that window
object was inspect from the new opened
tab no idea why this one didn't trigger
first continue stepping forward and
there we go new tab then uo r is called
which is a weird function with three
parameters first a window object in fact
this is our current pages window second
parameter is the string focus
and the third is a function which we
know it tries to call clothes and go on
the EU window the new tab I have a
suspicion what this obfuscated function
r does t is the window and Q what's Q
that's add eventlistener ah so on the
current window it will set an event
listener waiting for our current page to
gain focus and then it will call clothes
and go on the new tab great after
setting up this event listener something
is called on a again H is a string
document so window document and X is
right so it will write to the document
off the new tab and there's a long
function call as a parameter but we know
it would like to write a string so
whatever this obfuscated code does it
must return a string so let's just call
it ourselves and there we go it writes
some HTML and JavaScript to the new tab
let's copy that HTML make it pretty and
have a look at it so that defines some
variables a window name and a window
parameters the pop-up URL as well as the
pop-up options and then it creates a new
event listener on Mouse up oh wait
that's so clever so the mouse up did not
happen on our page it happened on the
new tab and that's the trick how it
opened the second window chrome loses
track that mouse down already triggered
a new window because it happened on
another page and it also registers a new
function go to window which will simply
resize and move as well as we directed
new pop-up window to another URL that's
it let's put it all together and walk
through it first we declare a function
to run onmousedown this function will
create a new tab and immediately write
javascript to this new tab which will
register a mouse up event to open the
actual pop-up and because chrome is so
fast the tab will be open before you
release the mouse button in s triggering
a mouse up event on the new tab which
will openly pop-up how crazy is that
in the meantime the main page also
embedded the PDF with the alert which
now triggers and gives focus back to the
main page that's why we register and
onfocus event handler on the main page
and then call go on the tab to change
the URL to our pop under target website
as well as closing the tab and removing
the PDF object and it happens so fast
that you don't even actually see it and
that's the magic another pop under and
it's a beautiful one I will link the
back reports to the google chrome issue
tracker below also I would like to
mention Patrick who was also analyzing a
pub under behavior on iOS and is
blogging about it and he worked with the
same script but not with the demo but
with the script encountered in the wild
on for archive so check that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
