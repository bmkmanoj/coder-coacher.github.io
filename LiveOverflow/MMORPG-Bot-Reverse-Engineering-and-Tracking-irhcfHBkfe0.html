project that I did we are going to have
a look at an auto trading bot that is
being sold or actually was sold to
people for the game Guild Wars 2 which
is awesome by the way play it so a
friend of mine told me that this bot has
a fun little design issue I should check
out and so that is what we are going to
do
Guild Wars 2 Auto trading bot is a fully
autonomous buying and selling trading
post bot for Guild Wars 2 they offer a
free trial and it can be run in the
background and obviously it's supposed
to make you a lot of gold they also
claim that because it doesn't do any
memory reading or writing like hooking
into the engine that the bots would be
hard to recognize by ArenaNet the
develop of Guild Wars 2 there's a video
how it works you can see you have a lot
of different ways to configure it and
when it's running it will basically
simulate clicks in the game as if you
would perform those actions so a very
simple but that doesn't do anything
really advanced obviously I don't want
to run this binary on my regular machine
because I don't trust it
so I'm downloading a free Windows VM
that microsoft offers for developers
first I want to get some tools I might
need to analyze this binary it's very
likely that it will communicate with a
server for example the Guild Wars 2
API to pull item prices but yeah I admit
I already know from my friend that they
also have their own server they
communicate with and a great free
Windows tool for that is fiddler on the
download side of the body it also says
that the dotnet framework is required so
I assume it might be a dotnet binary and
so I'm downloading dotnet reflector
which is a tool to decompile and analyze
net code okay so then we can download
the button have a first look at it we
unpack the archive and we find a couple
of interesting files there is the main
exe here's a library to parse JSON data
OCR optical character recognition
library along with a folder named test
data which reminds me of tesseract which
is a popular OCR framework and they
probably use that to analyze the text in
the game window and there is a mouse key
hook which they might even inject into
the game to simulate the mouse clicks
well that would certainly be fairly easy
for an owner to identify though I
believe ArenaNet
actually doesn't care because fighting
against these kinds of things is always
an arms race you just pour in money and
cheaters will always find new methods I
think they are clever enough to fight
cheaters and bottles that have actually
negative
impact for the game on another level you
will see later that these bottles here
are absolutely irrelevant for ArenaNet
okay so let's have a first run we start
fiddler and make sure we have SSL
interception abled and then start the
bots Windows Defender prevented the app
from being run because it's not known
smart screen knows the hashes of
programs that a lot of people use and
Trust and so this is probably an
indication that this spot is not a
widespread thing only a few people use
it ah look there is a first request
going out to the auto trading bot
website check version and it displays a
Terms of Use prompt so cute as if they
run any kind of legit company that cares
about legal matters okay and then there
is a log in window but we obviously
don't have a subscription for it if you
try to log in we can see another request
going out to check login data canceling
the login will start the trial ok so
let's do that
hmmm it asks us for our API key Guild
Wars 2 offers a JSON API that you can
use to query your accounts information
for example there is this amazing site
called GW to efficiency we can use your
API key to see all sorts of statistics
and information about your character of
course the bot would use it to look into
trading postings maybe pull the current
buy orders or so and we can click a bit
around and investigate the possible
features but we see no new requests so
far ok so far nothing too interesting
like I already mentioned a friend told
me about something funny here so I know
what to look for and we haven't found it
yet so I keep exploring it has to do
with the server they are using so far we
have seen two API requests to the server
but we don't really have a full running
but where we could see more so let's try
to find other endpoints next I decide to
see what dotnet reflected us with the
Exe file I pull it into here GW - ATP
Exe not a dotnet module uh-oh that is
not what I was hoping for hmm ok next I
download either Free 5.0 which can
disassemble the
to bid applications by the way there is
a new version now version 7 which can
disassemble 64-bit but here I have to
use the old one for 32-bit then I load
the exe into Ida and try to get a first
feeling of it I'm looking for hints if
it might be packed or obfuscator or
maybe I can even find already what I'm
looking for with the strings I don't
have a lot of experience with Windows
binaries so I have a lot more
assumptions and guesses then when I
would look at the Linux elf binary but I
find the patterns appear kind of
irregular and weird and I think that
should be a sign that something is fishy
going on and especially because I can't
find the auto trading bot website or the
API calls in the strings which we know
must be there is most likely evidence
for obfuscation okay let's try something
else
let's start the but again and have a
look at the task manager we can actually
create a dump of this process I have
never done this before and I actually
don't know what it does but I assume it
dumps the process memory I just knew the
menu item was there and now we have a
dot BMP file it's over 300 megabytes so
I assume it's a full memory dump my
assumption is that if it's a basic
packed binary then once about is running
all the strings are unpacked and in
clear text in memory so I hope that we
can now fairly easily extract strings
from the dump now I'm a bit unsure about
it because I don't know if that's like a
raw binary dump or if it's some kind of
compressed file format that requires
tools but anyway next I'm getting a hex
editor to look at it and I think hxd is
pretty nice after installation just when
I thought about opening the dump I also
noticed another functionality of the hex
editor under extras you can select open
Ram and then I select the auto training'
bot so we can apparently directly read
the RAM which hopefully contains the
unpacked strings and now we can simply
perform text searches in there for
example we know the API endpoints head
slash script / in the path and so we can
search for that and look we find
instances of that here's even the HTTP
URL with the Czech version API call
so looks like in this general address
area we have interesting strings
so I'm just copying that part into a new
file to more easily work with it I call
it now simply memory dump and then I can
write a bit of Python code to extract
those strings and the output file is now
easier to explore and we can search for
the API calls and there they are there
are the official Guild Wars 2 AP is and
they are also the auto trading bot
script API calls and look we haven't
seen those cost before set and get
online so we can extract all new
endpoints we have found and have a look
at each of them get online user sounds
really interesting so let's see what
happens when we visit the link but it's
nothing but if you look at the API calls
that we know then we see that they were
post requests and included an
authentication parameter so what we can
do with fiddler is we can select one of
our previous successful calls and select
replay and we want to edit the request
and then we change the API call to get
online users dot PHP and that worked the
response contains all online BOTS and
the crazy thing is it returns them with
that gw2 API key this is ridiculous the
bot developers gave us an easy way to
track each bot user not only the amount
of online users but also gave us their
official Guild Wars 2 API key so we can
look up their characters how much gold
they have what kind of items they trade
the character names the gilt they belong
to everything so this was in November
2017 and I've written a script that
checks every hour the logged in users
and then uses the API key to pull their
currently traded items knowing the items
they are ordering and selling and how
much gold they have I can calculate a
liquid net worth of the account and
track how effective the spot actually is
so we can see how rich these players are
and how long they were active now in
February 2018 about three months later
the board was actually shut down and
it's not being sold anymore which is
kind of sad I had hope to collect data
for much longer time but at least we got
some data but the video is getting
pretty long now and I would like to show
you a bit more
so I create a part 2 bonus video talking
about the findings
