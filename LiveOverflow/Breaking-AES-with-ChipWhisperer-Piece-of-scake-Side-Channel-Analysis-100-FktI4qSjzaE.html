private crypto key inside the Arduino
just by observing its power consumption
we are going to perform a differential
power analysis attack on an AAS
implementation in the previous video we
have introduced what power analysis is
and how you can prepare the other inner
board to do those measurements and now
we are going to actually solve the first
side channel challenge of the risk your
embedded hardware CTF
P softscape SC a side channel analysis
100 points so this is really a low
amount of points and I do have a lot of
opinions about that you will see this is
an easy SCA challenge using a cipher
implementation without any FCA so side
channel analysis countermeasures find
the keys used to encrypt and decrypt the
messages to encrypt a message send the
letter e followed by 16 bytes to decrypt
the message send the letter D followed
by 16 bytes this sounds really easy
should be a straightforward thing
remember from last video how you can
break a terrible RSA implementation by
identifying the square and square
multiply operations in a power trace and
simply read the bits of the private key
let's like the simple go-to example when
introducing side channel analysis
because it's so simple so from the
beginning I set my mind to RSA this is
gonna be our assay I just sent a decrypt
command via 0 to the board trigger the
oscilloscope at the right moment to
basically trigger after I sent the data
to decrypt and then the board will use
the private key for decryption and I can
just read the bits from the power trace
after the multiple days of fighting with
setup so during knowing about ground
loops and capacitors you should remove
and requiring all the fancy equipment I
was sure this is what I got to do I will
be rewarded for learning all this with a
simple challenge
it's the introductory sight channel
challenge anyway gosh I was wrong
so I'm sitting there staring at the
oscilloscope zooming around trying
different methods to acquire the data
like averaging traces or different
resistors I just didn't see what I would
expect in an RSA power trace this killed
already
multiple evenings for me until I was
more or less told this is not RSA this
is a s fact my life also makes sense
with the 16 bytes of data to encrypt or
decrypt that's the a s block size
a rollercoaster of emotions happiness of
learning something new
followed by pure rage and frustration
this describes the whole challenge so
here's the thing I knew the FAQ
introduced differential power analysis
DPA I also learned about this in a
hardware security class at university so
I knew that it's a thing and I knew what
kind of equipment I need to do this but
I did not expect this to be the case for
the first 100 point challenge in a few
minutes you will see why they gave it a
hundred points from a certain point of
view it makes sense but I completely
disagree with it so what is PP a
differential power analysis is a more
advanced form of power analysis which
can allow an attacker to compute the
intermediate values with encrypted
computations by statistically analyzing
data collected from multiple crypto
operations these were introduced in the
crypto community in 1998 by a company
called cryptography research and they
are filthy rich now for discovering this
and creating a consultancy research
company around it I mean they deserve it
I guess it's a pretty crazy attack with
simple power analysis we assume that the
implemented algorithm will perform
different operations depending on the
private key and let's show a different
power footprint but in case of the
shitty RSA implementation you could just
multiply and square in every iteration
and just keep the result of whatever the
current bit was there's no difference
anymore but there is a deeper layer in
the net the power consumption directly
comes from the single bits the
transistors so even if the algorithm
performs the same operations independent
from the private key bits those bits
could still cause a very very tiny
different power consumption the sounds
even more crazy than the simple RSA
example because these bits changes are
so small that's why you do a smart
statistical analysis on a lot of
collected traces I actually don't want
to explain this method in detail because
it's very complicated and there's a good
video by Colin or Flynn doing exactly
the is example
but the gist is that you collect a lot
of power traces from random inputs you
encrypt then you make a guess on what
the first byte of the private key could
be and then you perform part of the
encryption algorithm as if it was the
correct key and given the random input
value and that key guess it would lead
to different intermediate values then
you take the traces where this
intermediate value is the same for
further analysis if the key gets is
correct the power traces should all have
correlation of power users in that point
in time if the key guess was wrong the
traces you selected based on that would
have completely different intermediate
values that's the random power
consumption and nothing would correlate
it would cancel out so you do this for
each possible key and for each possible
byte and in the end you should find the
correct key but how do you actually do
this now I knew I did not want to
implement the math myself also I would
have to write my own tools to
automatically collect these traces from
my oscilloscope and the USB and
networking API seemed horrible I wasted
so much time and gave up on it I knew
what I needed it was a chip Whisperer
it's a piece of hardware that is
specifically designed for doing this and
it comes with a software that has all
these attacks already implemented I
thought about buying one initially but I
assumed an oscilloscope would be more
flexible and I could learn more with it
I know some players spotted chip
whisperer because it was recommended to
use it for these hardware tics and costs
a bit of money but I think without
additional equipment like an extra
oscilloscope it's hard to debug issues
anyway I'm happy with my purchase choice
but I still wanted that chip Whisperer
for this challenge and I knew where to
get one from some of you know that I am
still a student at the Technical
University of Berlin I'm still working
on my master's degree and we do have a
small group at the university that does
hardware security research as well most
of my theoretical knowledge about these
attacks comes from and I have a fairly
good relationship with them and they
obviously have a chip Whisperer in their
lab so I wrote one of the PhD students
and asked if I can come over and play
with it and that's the off
thing about a university you can get
access to awesome equipment as well as
help and advice so I encourage every
student to take advantage of these
things so when I used it the first time
I just followed the example which is a
DPA attack on the test board that comes
with a chip whisperer everything is
already set up for you the test board
has a connector for the probe this is
the measurement probe and another broad
connector which carries the power as
well as Rx and TX lines for serial
communication then you use the example
script which implements the serial
protocol to talk to the test board
basically it sends sixteen bytes that
should be encrypted and with a click on
start it starts collecting power traces
the trigger for the power measurement
and all the other parameters are already
set to the correct values then you let
the attack script run it does the DPA
and after a few minutes or so it finds
the key where the power spikes
correlated you can look at the fanta
grabs and you can feel really cool that
you just broke a es with DPA without
knowing and this is why this
challenge only gives 100 points because
in the end it's just putting in the
correct parameters and clicking go and
then the secret key falls out well
there's a bit more to that challenge but
essentially that's all it is so I took
the chip Whisperer home and spent the
next few days trying to do this on the
CTF board there were so many failed I
will tell them now in sequential order
but you have to imagine that they were
all intertwined and only slowly I found
all these mistakes it was not a clear
progression of find error fix it fight
next error fix it I tried a lot of
things and spend hours over hours until
I discovered these issues so while I
make it sound straightforward it was
absolutely not it was hell okay first of
all I had to learn how the chip was for
framework works I realized that the test
board is just a little bit different
from the CTF board so I only have to
change things like how to trigger
encryption or decryption but before the
chip whisperer could communicate by a
serial with the board I had to solve the
issue of different voltage levels the
Arduino Nano
grunts with faith walk while the chip
whisperer uses three walk so I had to
build a unidirectional level converter
to convert the three volt signal to five
fold in the five volt signal to three
volt but did work surprisingly quickly
so this is the setup shield connection
wires the level converter and then using
a Rago probe to measure the voltage
after the resistor I was so happy and I
felt really smart for using the Rago
probe because it fit onto the plug then
I copied the code for the example script
and spent some hours modifying it and I
was able to collect traces and rent
analysis I thought the difficult part
was now to find the correct moment in
time where the crypto is happening at
some point I realized that one of the
LEDs flashes just before the Crypt of
starts so you could use that as a
trigger for the chip whisperer again
don't forget the unidirectional level
converter but after a few days of not
being able to find correlations in my
captures and was so frustrated and I
finally decided to look into the serial
communication and then realize that I
did not send the raw data
I wanted to encrypt but I sent it as a
hex string this was obviously completely
 wrong no wonder no analysis
worked because the data was just wrong
so at some point I had fixed that but
stuff was still not working and it's
really hard to figure out what's going
on the traces I took on your so scope
looked really good I was able to easily
see where the crypto is happening AES
has ten rounds of crypto and you can
clearly see them they are right there so
my trigger was at the right moment but
when I took traces with the chip
whisperer I didn't see that after many
many more hours and days I realized the
raggle probe is the issue you know these
probes are not just plain metal wires
they have some components in there in
fact this probe is a ten to one probe so
on the oscilloscope you actually have to
set a 10 x multiplayer for it and the
chip whisperer was not compatible with
it once I realized that I was about to
jump off the next building what the hell
then I replaced the nice professional
probes with a simple
fire and suddenly the measurements were
great another challenge I had was to set
their sampling rate high enough because
you want to sample a lot faster than the
clock of the microcontroller but setting
that is super janky for the chip
Whisperer and a lot of other small
issues the software constantly stopped
working I think it's a memory issue I
had to guess what certain parameters are
for and you can imagine with all the
issues I just told you about and not
really knowing what's causing it it was
overall a damn frustrating experience is
it the capacitors is something broken is
it interference it's a script wrong
other parameter is wrong am i collecting
not enough traces I made the wrong point
in time it's a trigger working the data
even random I don't know oh and I also
lifted a second pin of the admit up
because there are two VCC connections
and I didn't know if that was maybe an
issue it was all hell anyway once the
whole setup was correct and working and
I clicked start to collect the traces it
started to look really good once you
have a nice set of traces you have to
align them because the trigger is not
perfect in time but they are modules for
that then you can run the analysis and
the key magically pops out there it is I
transcribe the key and hand it in 100
points 100 points for hundreds of euros
spent on equipment and days of work 100
points I am so depressed I also have to
give credit to andres moreno from risky
or who despite my constant ranting and
cursing still listened and helped me a
lot thank you so much also thanks to my
friends at the TU berlin and others from
the rescue ifc channel i needed a lot of
help for this challenge but regardless
of my hate for this challenge I'm also
really proud for having done it
it was so clearly above my skill level
and in the end I succeeded and I learned
a lot
