protostar a while ago which means we
have a really good basic understanding
of our binary exploitation work many
years ago exploitation nowadays is not
as easy anymore and some of you have
noticed that because you try to copy the
source code and compile it on your own
modern Linux machine so I thought it
would be interesting to start
introducing modern techniques and
exploit mitigations by revisiting some
of the protostar challenges on our
current ubuntu and see how far we get
are they still exploitable
so let's have a quick look at the very
simple source code again there were
these variables a buffer and thus
modified integer which was set to zero
then there was the sketch function which
reads in some input into the buffer and
it doesn't have a way to check the
length so this way we were able to fill
the buffer completely and even right
beyond it into ages and memory the
binary on the old photos of VM has the
modified variable just after the buffer
thus if you wrote more than 64 bytes you
all wrote the 0 value of the modified
variable and has change the outcome of
this if so let's try this again on a
modern system I'm using digital ocean to
quickly spin up a new open to machine
and as its age into it then I take the
code and compile it a new system so we
had to install you to see the compiler
now it works you can already see that
the compiler is warning us of the use of
gets you see making programming's the
executives really requires the developer
to ignore warnings like this you don't
really have to know about the dangers
from somewhere else anymore it tells you
right away
so let's see let's try to input a lot of
characters and see if we can change the
modified variable but it doesn't seem to
work the only thing we can get is a
stack smashing detected error and the
process is aborted that's the first
evidence that a bit more stuff is going
on here so let's look at the assembly
code that the compiler produced
first of all let's check why we couldn't
override the modified variable that's a
stack smashing detected had to do
anything with it
mmm kind of but let's see you see this
location on a stick is where the local
variable modified is stored you can see
that because the value 0 is moved to it
like in the C code and this here is C
buffer on a stick
you can see that because the address of
it is passed to get like in the C code
so when you look at this you notice that
the modified variable is not located
after the buffer anymore we can write as
many characters as we want
we will never override modified you can
also try to reorder the variables in the
C code but it has no effect on the
assembler code either and it's not a
coincidence buffers or arrays are risky
compared to simple integer variables
buffers are prone to buffer overflows so
the compiler made the decision to order
the local variables in a particular way
and it kinda has something to do with
the text matching detected message you
see this message is caused because a
stack cookie or stack canary or stack
guard was overwritten so what exactly is
that let's open the compiled binary in a
disassemble to have a better look at it
if you are still learning about the
stuff assembler code always looks very
intimidating but it's all about
recognizing and learning patterns one
such pattern is here with the stack
cookies because when you reverse
engineer program you can basically
ignore a lot of stuff for example this
here and down here has to do with the
stack cookie and so it has nothing to do
with the functionality of the program if
you are interested in what the function
Ruffy does you can look for functions
being called here
so there's gets and so it's reading
something then a local variable is
compared and then it prints a string
with puts in either case so you already
get a rough idea from that but we
already know what it does so what's up
with the part of the stack cookie in the
beginning of the function a value was
moved from a weird place FS at offset X
to 8 into the register RA X and that
value is placed onto the stick at the
end of the function just before the
return this value is read again from the
stack and then ex-ored with this
mysterious value in FS x to 8 this is
just a check if the two values are the
same if they are equal the function is
allowed to return if the check failed
and those values are different then
there's a call to stack check fail and
the program will never return and this
makes sense right so some unknown value
is written onto the stack at the
beginning then stuff happens for example
gets call which can overflow the buffer
in at the end the value in the stack is
compared again to this mysterious value
so if we had a buffer over
all that over wrote the state cookie the
check would fail so FS OGS or other
segment registers are special registers
with varying usage depending on 32-bit
of 64 bits and if you're on Windows or
Linux or if you write low-level boot
kernel ring 0 code or if you write user
space doing 3 programs and there's a lot
of historical baggage with them and to
be completely honest with you I don't
fully understand it maybe somebody in
the comments can correct me and add some
additional information so take this
explanation with a grain of salt you can
imagine the FS register to point to some
memory and from the perspective of the
process we actually don't really know
where it points to the kernel I think
sets up where it points to so the
process doesn't really care where it
points to it just uses it and it can
then reference different values at
certain offsets in that memory so for
example the stack cookie is stored at
the offset x28 and actually the location
must be somewhere in the virtual memory
of the process as well let's install gdb
enhancement peda
very quickly because it has a great
memory fine function
we can test this by setting a breakpoint
at the step cookie handling routines and
search the process memory for this stack
value you can see it shows up in some
kind of memory and if you check the
memory mix it is included here and it is
really the location where FS points tool
because for example we can now overwrite
this value with hex for one so capital a
a and when we continue and enter a lot
of data a lot of A's will or write the
cookie on the stick with text for one
for one for one and when we now reach
the end of the code the state cookie
value was obviously overwritten by us
words for one for one or one but we also
just set the hand the original value of
the state cookie two for one for one for
one and even though we cannot inspect to
see where FS points to the CPU knows
where the value is and we'll compare
those two now and not surprisingly we
continue to the return and get a sec
fault instead of getting the stick check
fail this means we actually have changed
the original value of the state cookie
that's cool huh but you see it's not
really a bypass for cookies it doesn't
help us in this particular case and
magically make it exploitable we are
just playing around with it to
understand it better and we know that
the original state cookie value is
stored somewhere in memory so those
cookies serve a precise purpose but it's
not the magic medicine that stops every
exploit attempt but now you have a
better understanding of the limitations
of state cookies they adjust the value
on a stick which are placed there at the
beginning of a function and compared to
the original value before the function
returns this means we can overwrite the
return point in the stick but the issue
is that the function will never return
because the state cookies wrong and if
there are other variables on the stick
before the cookie they could still be
overwritten so it's actually just kind
of protects you from smashing the return
pointer for classical buffer overflow it
only stops the function from returning
but it might not stop other side effects
due to your things all written on a
stick so in our case theoretically if
the modified variable would have been
placed after the buffer we could have
still all written it without ever
writing so far that we overwrite the
stack
cookie but the compiler developers know
that buffer overflows are a common thing
so they want buffers to be as close as
possible to the state cookie which
causes the modified in buffer variable
to be reordered in this way the buffer
is placed after the modified variable
closer to the cookie darn it
there's another interesting thing about
dec cookies let's rerun the program and
collect a few random cookies
to something they all start with a zero
bite so this is the little engine phone
but the in memory the bytes would look
like this
so it's interesting why would they not
use all eight bytes for random values
but compromise one of these bytes to be
aesthetic zero doesn't that make it
weaker because now you only have to
brute force or guess seven bytes
there are obviously various ways how you
can attack stack cookies it obviously
should not be guessable or brute force
about but seven bytes is a huge number
already
so probably good enough but as you know
there are a lot of ways to leak values
from memory for example with format
string exploits so use that to leak a
stack cookie value and then you overflow
is trivial again but some overflows
happen because of a string copy and
strings and cr0 terminated so even if
you would know the stack cookie and you
have a vulnerable string copy you can
never overwrite the cookie with the
correct value because you cannot write a
zero byte because of no bite marks the
end of a string and see but our example
users gets and according to the main
page you can see that gets actually only
stops at a newline so you could write a
null byte with that so it's a very
clever choice to include a null byte in
the cookie it's an additional protection
against string copies even if the cookie
value is known but maybe you ask
yourself what about 32 bit is there also
about used for a null byte let's find
out to compile a 32 bit program on 64
bit you have to install some other stuff
and we can also quickly check if this is
not exploitable you can see that we also
only get this text match for tection
error
okay so let's extract some stack cookies
here you can see that a different
segment registers used here on throw a
little bit but same concept and who
would have thought also zero byte in it
so this makes only three bytes of
randomness 16 million possible values
hmm that sounds a bit more scary sixteen
million depending on the context where
and how the program is run is not much
maybe in our case it might actually make
it exploitable I mean the original
prototype VM was also 32-bit so I think
it's fair game but to be fair 64-bit
probably makes it an explodable so the
plan is clear
you've write a program that calls this
32-bit version of stack level 0 all the
time and send an exploit string to it
which uses a random cookie value to
prove Fawcett and at some point we might
get lucky guess the correct cookie value
overflow the return pointer and redirect
code execution to the output the if case
we want well the plan sounds good if it
were just as easy we will need a bit
more time for this so let's do it in
another video but it's a fun challenge
so you should try that at home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
