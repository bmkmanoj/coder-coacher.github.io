challenge where we first
reverse-engineered how the server is
listening on a port and then we
connected to it with net ket this video
we want to go one layer deeper and have
a look at the TCP protocol this will be
the first time that we have a look at
what it means to send a packet over the
network we have used netcat not multiple
times we've used it in CTFs and last
video to connect to challenges and in
the web security series we used it to
talk to a real web server so you know
that net ket is a very handy tool to
send TCP packets over the network so I
suggest without Wireshark to analyze
packets we send with net code when we
open Wireshark we select the network
interface we want to capture packets in
this case our traffic doesn't leave the
machine us we can select the loopback
interface loopback is more like a
virtual network interface it's not a
real physical network card stuck in your
PC through this interface will go all
our traffic that we send around on our
local machine and as you may know the
own machine is always identified as
localhost or IP one 27001 now let's use
two terminal windows and in one window
we start netcat in listening mode and a
port in the other window we can then
execute netstat like in the last video
and we can list all processes that are
currently listening on a port and here
is our net CAD process you know what
let's execute our net cut so with
esterase so we can see all the sis calls
that netcat uses to establish a server
so it will first create a socket set
some options then bind the port one two
three four and it's now listening on
that port and it's waiting for a
connection to be established with accept
it's basically exactly what we reverse
engineered in last video we can also
quickly check Wireshark and we don't see
any packet being sent over the network
yet okay now let's use the second window
to connect to this net cut server you
can see on the server that except now
returned because a client connected to
the port and now we see three increase
in Wireshark we see a sin
cynic and AK packet let's quickly have a
look at those as you can see in the
lowest window a packet is just some
binary data and that binary data has
meaning which Wireshark can parse and
display us nicely so above we can see
the decoded packet and it's divided by
layers because the spec it didn't leave
our machine the ethernet layer is just
all zeros usually you would find here
your MAC address and the MAC address
from your switch or router so that layer
is only used between two direct
connections besides the MAC address this
layer also contains a type and the type
is set to hex eight zero zero which
indicates that the next layer is an ipv4
layer Wireshark sees that and knows how
to decode the next bytes when you click
on the next layer
Wireshark will highlight which bites off
the packet belong to that layer you can
see how it decided that it is an ipv4
version four layer because the first
four bits of this byte here is four you
can also see here the source and
destination IP which in this case is the
same so while the ethernet layer with
MAC addresses was about direct
connections the IP layer can contain an
address very far away on the internet
and the switches will make sure that
this packet is forwarded until you reach
the correct machine this layer also
contains information about the layer
afterwards and that is a protocol
identifier in this case it's six which
means the content of this IP layer is a
TCP header
IP and TCP are usually always together
it's very common thus you have probably
heard of TCP IP before which just says
that there is a TCP layer or an IP layer
so the ethernet layer helped to get from
machine to machine the AP layer helped
to identify which machine is the real
destination of this and the TCP layer
will now help identify which program or
process on this machine should handle
this packet and that is identified with
the port number you can see here that
the destination port is set to one two
three four you can also see here a sore
spot which is required so you can
receive answers from the server so when
the server responds with a packet
it will use this port so that the client
machine knows which process gets this
response and it's usually a random high
port number anyhow now we understand how
a full TCP packet is constructed now
let's have a look at the protocol a
protocol just refers to a set of rules
on how to talk to another computer if a
client and server agree on how to send
data back and forth it will work so what
we will see now is just what somebody
came up with in in order to create a
data connection just remember at the
moment we have not sent any data with
netcat so far we only establish a
connection okay so we see that three
packets were exchanged first the client
sent a so called Sun packet a
synchronised packet and the server
responded with a syn ACK packet meaning
I acknowledge that I received it this is
important because maybe the initial
packet didn't arrive so when you as a
client get a response you know that the
server got your message this means the
client knows now that the connection
works but from the perspective of the
server the server doesn't know yet if
the sending the packet was successful
maybe the server can only receive but
not send packets as a client will
respond to the syn ACK packet with an
ACK packet acknowledging it so the
server gets an answer and both parties
are sure yes I successfully exchanged
packet with this other machine now we
can talk data and this is all done
transparently you didn't have to
construct these packets yourself you
simply open a socket and waited for a
connection okay now let's send some data
from the client to the server you can
see that immediately the server was able
to read the line you send how does it
look in Wireshark we see two new packets
a psh packet for the client to the
server and an ACK packet back the packet
from the client also now has an
additional data layer and that data
layer just contains the raw bytes we
send and the solve responds with an ACK
to confirm the client that the packet
was successfully received now let's send
the
Bunz from the server you see the server
simply wrote the text to the file
descriptor for which is a file
descriptor that accept returned as you
can see an application simply rise to
that pseudo file that socket and the
magic below is sent dead over the
network now let's have a look what it
did it also just sent push packet and
the client acknowledged the arrival with
an ACK packet back one more thing
obviously the size of a packet is
limited so what happens when you send a
lot of data let's say you upload a huge
file somewhere
how will that work let's just copy a
bunch of characters and sent them ah see
now there are more than just two packets
you don't see it when you develop an
application but somewhere in the kernel
network hard driver I don't really know
it got split up you can also see that
the second packet was not sent along
with the first one the second packin was
only sent out once the server
acknowledges the first one let's see
what happens when you kill the client
even though we just control CNET cut we
can see in Wireshark that thin packet
was sent out to indicate we are done
with this channel you can free up
resources and you don't have to expect
more packets from this connection unlike
during setup there are three packets
exchange the server acknowledges the fin
by the client now the client knows that
the server knows that it's done but the
server doesn't know yet if the client
knows that it knows it's done so it also
responds with neck now both know it's
over now this whole exchange is referred
to as a TCP stream we establish the
connection and then exchange data back
and forth and then quit the connection
in Wireshark allows us to investigate
the stream for example with follow TCP
stream here only the data is visible and
color coded who sent what and now you
should watch my HTTP protocol video from
the web security series because you will
understand now much better what it means
to have a server inclined and that HTTP
is just data sent over TCP exactly how
we set these messages a browser and a
web server are just special programs
that do special
things with special messages over TCP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
