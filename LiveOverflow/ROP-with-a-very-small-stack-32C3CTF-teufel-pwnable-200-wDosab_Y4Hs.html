video of write-up of another challenge
of the 32 C 3 CTF and it will be the
portable title challenge like the weekly
challenge I didn't solve it during the
CTF but I used to write apps to work
through these solutions and now I
understand it completely and now I want
to share the knowledge that I gained
with everybody else so I will now show
you recording of me creating the exploit
step by step and I will explain certain
things along the way and basically
comment on it
so first thing I do is I just connect
with net cut to the service and get a
view on it so it looks like you type
something in and response the same thing
back again so it's not very not very
fancy like in the in the previous video
I explained I used vagrant as a virtual
machine rapper to quickly set up
machines to work with in this case is a
bunting machine and yeah I just like set
up my environment here and I create a
symlink
from the Waker and share folder which is
shared between the VM and my system
inside of my CTF script folder so just
to it's just easy setup for my editor to
create scripts and stuff so now I copy
the link and I'm now on the Ubuntu in
the Ubuntu VM there on the right and I
download the file and I extract it and
obviously one of the first things you I
always do is I check the file type of it
and indeed it's a 64-bit Linux
executable but we also get a Lipsy file
with it which in this is an indication
that it's probably drop a return
oriented programming or red tulip see
kind of challenge why they usually give
you provide you the CC binary because
you often have to find the gadgets in in
there okay so I haven't no up in my VM
the title and it also runs on my machine
so that's great
and yeah now I can open it in hopper and
we can start having a look at the
assembler code
the first thing I noticed is that does
the entry point the entry procedure
function and below it is another
function and then there's nothing that's
literally the whole code segment you
only have the entry function and the
function below and then dial here
afterwards there starts another section
so it's super tiny binary probably
handcrafted so what we see is this entry
point calls M map and then M protect so
if we look here at the D computation we
see that it calls MF with zero as a
first parameter means that the kernel
will give us decide on an address that
it will give to us and it will be three
thousand hex big and one of the other
zero parameters there means that it will
have zero protection nothing said you
will see later in the S trace what those
protections exactly mean and then we
have an M protect which changes the
protection flags on on a certain memory
area and if you look here at the output
you can see that you see that there's a
loop and I will so always around this
one function so I call this endless loop
and this endless loop has to read in a
puts call so it basically just reads
something and then puts out a value now
I can have a look at it with s trace
because it will show us the MM call so
we can see here that we request a new
virtual address space and we get this
address which starts as e 0 0 0 and then
afterwards we call m protect with D 0 0
0 so it's 1,000 hex further
that's what's a plus thousand in the in
the D compiled code and it sets those as
read and writable and if you now look at
the program memory map output you see
here's our C address and then there come
two more entries afterwards so basically
you have a read writable area in the
middle and you have to guard pages with
no protection around it and that will
become important in a second and you can
also see that when you input something
it will always read two times and then
write something
yeah so you can hear CD calls again
you've got to read and write
so now let's follow this in gdb again
and make us at a breakpoint at the entry
point and then we can step slowly
forward to the MF call and we can see
here again nicely the pairing with us
that it gets called wills so it will
allocate three hex 3000 range of memory
now we will set a breakpoint after the M
protect so now it will have created this
middle page surrounded by those middle
page with freedom writable access and
you will also notice it moved the
address that was just what set with M
protect into the stack pointer and maybe
you can like set back a couple of
seconds and look at the stack output
here in the bottom left that the stack
is now pointing to a different address
and this is pointing at our memory
mapped area that is read and writable so
we move this text somewhere else now and
then we will call now the endless loop
and it will use this new stick so we
will place now a couple of important
breakpoints basically before every read
and then also before we return this
allows us to always inspect the stack at
certain different stages so we can see
what happens so let's move to the first
read it reads 8 bytes into an address
that is on this deck and fe8 and you see
only here like on the bottom left on the
stack output that it like literally has
only three values on a stick and the
other one are white those are different
okay so we so we insert an A and then it
did a second read with with the size
that we actually entered with the third
read so you can see here I entered
multiple A's and now you can see that
the second read will read like 4 1 4 1 4
1 bytes tries to trace read so that
means that with the first read we
specify how many bytes we wanna we want
to read into and with the second way to
actually read those bytes in and then
obviously we can say we want to read you
know
200 bytes like 300 I would have an a we
basically say we want 4 1 bytes to read
fallen bytes and then we can enter form
on bytes and basically overwrite the
whole stick if you look now what I'm
doing here I'm just basically you know
playing around with different values
because depending on what you enter with
the first read the program will actually
exit and I haven't looked investigated
as properly but as far as I know the the
read will check if it like makes a
sanity check if it can even has that
much space to read into and stuff and
because the memory region afterwards has
no protection all the read will probably
just you know exit because it will not
be able to read there and in this
example I fill the buffer perfectly with
the new line at the end but the string
ends with a 0 byte so it tried to put
the 0 byte in the in this memory region
at 7 0 0 0 which is not writable so it
will cause a segfault so if I'm more
careful and put a little bit less see we
can see now that we didn't completely
fill this deck but we did overwrite the
return pointer and now we also have
currently a breakpoint at the read and
if you now step one further we will
obviously return into the sees that we
have written on the stack so this means
we can fully control the instruction
pointer then what I'm doing now is I'm
basically showing off a SLR if you check
the libraries that are linked to this
binary you see that with every time we
execute it and check the address it gets
mapped to they are different so it means
that the Lib C binary will be always at
different regions and if we look here on
the stack we also noticed that there is
a value on the stack which is the stack
address and what we can do here we can
leak this by because it will print the
string that is on the stick and if we
fill the first eight bytes with a s and
then you know the last null byte of it
with with another
well you we will we will force puts to
also print the address that is on the
stack and I'm demoing it here on the
right with the on the shell with the
simple echo we read the first 8 bytes
which is the a and then we read 8 a s
and a B which will then force the puts
to also print the address that is stored
on a stack so basically this allows us
to leak this deck address so now I'm
starting to write a script here because
it's clearly will be more interactive
because we have to leak the stack
address and do calculations on those
addresses and they because of a SLR will
always be different so we cannot do a
simple aesthetic program we have to do
it with my interaction so what I'm doing
here is I create a little wrapper
function X that basically just costs
truck Peck to build those nice addresses
and basically I'm just rebuilding what
we just did by hand we write for 1 and
the new line VA for 1 and then we write
8 a s and a B which will cause the the
stack address on the stack to leak so I
have to save it in the correct in the
correct place okay so yeah that that
looks fine now let's even throw it at
the target and see if we if that
actually works too if you can leave the
address and we'll text time maybe looks
more it's looks you can see it more you
can see it better that indeed it looks
like that we can actually leak the stack
address from the target as I said we
need a little bit more interaction so we
actually have to like do some socket
work and do the connections with Python
so what I'm doing here I create a socket
and I define the server address up there
and we will call this a connect server
and it will return the socket that we
created for us so we can just do connect
the socket and you
the socket essenti buffer that we just
created and with recei if we can print
whatever we received so when we now call
python toy though it will actually can't
create a socket to the server and yeah
seems to work so what we now want to do
is i create a function that will read
all the bytes that are available
I call it receive all and what it does
is just basically looping around receive
and read as an appended by its to be and
in the end return B so this will read
all the available bytes that we have so
if we execute this we receive all you
will notice I get a timeout that's
because we I set a timeout in there when
you setup of the socket and obviously I
have to catch this in case it happens
and that's fine that will happen
basically all the time that happens we
just we finished reading and we can now
return the whatever whenever we have
friend so this is just it seems to work
okay because if you read too fast you
sometimes read garbage values I have
noticed so let's start just something
that seems to work better okay and then
I just add some nice output that it
becomes clear about what's happening
okay looks cool
so now we want to convert this to a
proper address to a basically a number
so that we can calculate with this so I
could you know be intelligent and do
this like first try and realize how to
convert this but it's more an arrow for
me and you found another wrapper
function with unpick so I can unpack
this binary string into a number but
obviously it's not 8 byte long so in I
have to add some 0 bytes but because I'm
a noob I cannot calculate this I have to
do trial and error to figure out where I
have to append the padding and there's
zero by padding
failing here at standard patent but in
the end it seems to work just that it
doesn't look so correct with the zeros
at the end I think the zeros don't don't
really belong there
I also decrease the time on because it
always takes so long to wait so now I
want to test it locally so I use soak it
again to basically act like the server
maybe put for two so I can execute this
and now I can connect to like localhost
and it's no now I can easily debug it so
I want to print the memory map of the
total process that I call but because
the script finishes the total binary
will also quit so before I close the
socket I will add a weight with raw
input which allows me to check the
memory map and then I noticed that this
dagger is not completely correct because
Israelites didn't problem when on it
they well are correct but yeah now that
looks actually pretty good if we check
here the stack will have the correct
value and we successfully leak these
tech address now we can start to find
the gadgets because we connect this deck
address and we can / we can control the
instruction pointer so now we have to
basically increase the space on the
stick to do more complex stuff because
we only have one enters we can use so we
are looking for a gadget that will
somehow modify the stack pointer and the
basic idea that I have is moving the
stack pointer further from down so that
we get more and more space but not too
far down because then we don't control
the values on a stick anymore and we
don't know where to return into so we
basically just reduce this deck a little
bit and we still have some well use on
the stack and then we can control and
then we return into the endless loop and
yeah the schedule here does moves the
base pointer into the stack pointer and
when that you can see that before this
function
it pops the base pointer so we fully
control the value of the base pointer in
this case is its bbbbb and now I just
emulate the overflow and indeed we
control the base point and thus with
this gadget we control the stack pointer
so now we can set the stack pointer to
any value we want and what we want to do
now with it we want to move this deck a
little bit higher than it currently is
and then we call the endless loop again
and then basically everything is one
address higher on the stack and we can
again read new values to the overflow
and then basically do the exact same
thing repeatedly and slowly move these
deck upwards so I hope I know it's a
little bit complex I mean this
especially if you have not much
experience with returner and programming
and I'm sorry if this rambling is just
confusing but if you would do it
yourself by hand then it would be clear
so yeah I our design would be that we
that we use a gadget to move the stack a
little bit higher and the new stack
address value will be the will be
basically the B's which yeah well we
know our new stack pointer so again we
write three addresses the first one will
actually be now instead of the A's that
that was previously the A's will now be
the address that we want to return to
and the next value will be the new stack
address so we will move this deck a
little bit higher than it used to be and
obviously the actual overflow down
nearly from our gadget so I hope it
becomes clearer when you know debug this
a little bit yeah I try to yeah I try to
now calculate the exact address I want
to set this deck point or to to move it
a little bit higher and you know I try
to be intelligent and calculated but
some I screw this up and I kind of
figure it out
so basically is trial and error again to
get the
get the value right I want to set this
deck to that it works what I want to do
okay
so I think yeah now I calculate it and
all I get the correct address
so now pay attention so we will break at
the return we will have the new stack
address in our VP and so we will return
to our gadget we will remove our BP into
the stack pointer pay attention we will
update it now now this stack pointer
points to a new address and if you look
closely now now we you know see we move
the stack up like before there were no
yellow values on the stack now they are
multiples and if we step further into
the next schedule yeah we pop the RVP
again and now we will return to in the
next address on a stack which is now the
endless loop function again so now we
basically move the stack one address up
and we are at start again and we can now
repeat this in a loop to move this deck
further up and up and up so let's create
a loop around this okay so in step of
eight and we constantly want to change
the stack address do some changes here
again for now we test this and when we
now continue you see how slowly the
stack grows bigger and bigger and bigger
and now we can't we have enough space on
the stack to actually put like multiple
gadgets or whatever we want to do with
it so basically now we have all the
possibilities of Rob I mean the Rob
exploit that we will use is not that
complex it with wood we don't need that
much space but you know it's actually
cool to see this loop happening and
making more and more space on the stack
and I will wrap this again in a function
called build stick and we'll take this
socket and so every time when we call
this function it will leak the current
stack value and then with this value we
slowly will build the stick
cool so now we have a setup that leaks
this deck and create space on the stack
we can check the memory map again if the
memory we leak is correct
and it looks all fine so now we have to
figure out where let's see is loaded to
do this I have now read the memory map a
couple of times and now I take notes of
where the Lipsy address is and where
they stack addresses and then we will
have a look at this with the calculator
and calculate the offsets between those
things so if we calculate these how far
away these deck is from Lipsy we notice
that it's both time the same and notice
like when I say stack it's not the user
stick this was a memory mapped area that
we created so and this attack on this
issue is called offset tulip see or to
any other library or whatever so there's
always this constant offset happening
from an area for a virtual address space
that we map and that is fixed for like
this particular I guess depending on the
Lib C so it's for this for my local
Lipsy it's this offset but now we have a
problem we have to figure out the offset
of the target system because that this
will likely be a different offset value
so how we can do this is we try to leak
an address that is from Lib C and we can
do this because the toy for binary uses
the exit function which is from from
Lipsy and I also now copy my local Lipsy
to a file so I can load it in hopper and
find the exit symbol in there so I want
to know the the address of exit which is
used by the type of binary so I can go
into the global of the table from toy
file and get the address of exit so here
in DB we can read this address which
ends at two
zero and we can't compare this to the
exit symbol from the Lipsy which also
ends at 2 D 0 so they are their same
offset and we can write this address
down because this is the opposite from
the start of Lipsy where the exit
function is and what we can do now is we
can reuse a little bit of code that is
already in the binary and that is the
puts call basically we want to leak the
address from the global off the table of
exit and we can use the puts call for
that to do this we can just jump here
right before the puts call because we
have to set the RDI register with the
address of the string that we will print
in our case the address will be the
global offset table entry for exit so
that it prints the X's address we have
to set it up in a way that you know the
the third value will overwrite the
instruction pointer this will be where
we want to jump to right before they put
the value before will be the value that
will be loaded from the string that we
want to print which is the address of
the global offset table of exit and then
we just have some ace that we don't care
about so if we test this now it doesn't
work like the value we get it's just
wrong and that's because I'm first of
all made a mistake and I again didn't
send it but the values don't uh not
correct so I open it in gdb and attach
to the GB process again and check it out
and now we are right at the put and you
can see that it subtracts 8 from the
base pointer so now the base pointer is
currently pointing exactly at the exit
value from the global offset table but
it subtract 8 from it and that will be
loaded RDI where we step one further we
will see that now RDI has the wrong
value so it will have the wrong value so
so we'll have to add age to it that
after this abstraction it will be the
correct address so you can try this and
yes now this value looks much better you
get these 7f there which pretty much
looks correct to the 12 see address now
we have to do the same thing again like
before with when we leak this decade
fiddling around with converting it to a
proper address this is so ugly I am very
sorry for this terrible code but and
with some trial and error like it's the
worst I'm sorry but at some point it
almost works except that I accidentally
stripped away the last two bytes the d0
in this case which is now missing and I
realized that I guess zoom still not
correct but almost correct yeah no no it
looks good okay so now we can calculate
the offset tulip see by basically
subtracting this deck with the offset
with the illegal exit address and then
from there we subtract the offset inside
the ellipse if binary to the exit
function and you can see here when we
print this value it's what we have
calculated before so now we have a way
to leak the offset tulip see and we
prepare now the important offsets for
the target binary which we can already
do here and then we can also try it with
the target and see if we can if that
works but again I have some coding arrow
here accidentally print offset tulip see
before it was defined I moved it to the
correct location try it again
and yes it says here that Lipsy is at a
place and it also calculated an exit
offset which is actually different from
our local system so cool that is the
offset tulip see on the target system
okay now we want to prepare our prop
return to Lipsy exploit first of all we
have to find the string bin SH because
basically we want to call system
business age so and we can actually find
this in Lipsy and then also we need the
address of system and we can also
already get those values for our target
system as well and get all the offsets
ready
you see also they are a little bit
similar but still different you know
they that's why it's important that the
challenge gave us their lip see because
the addresses just don't uh not the same
on different systems ok so now we with
the first stage of the exploit we found
out the offset tulip see now we make a
second a stage where we use this offset
to actually do the Rob exploit but first
we have to figure out how to call system
so I do this little C program and look
at the disassembly which tells us that
we have to load the string that we want
to execute with system into EDI and then
we call system so we have to find a Rob
gadget that will pop a value in our di
and then return so we can return to
system again I use Rob gadget for it and
this time on the Lipsy and we are only
looking for pop ret because I'm looking
for pop RDI
red gadget and I saved it in a file and
I do the same with the with the target
Lipsy and this takes a while so we start
to prepare the exporter in the meantime
so basically again we want the same
thing but we don't care about these
values and the first gadget we will
return to will be pop are the I read the
value that we will pop will be the
offset of will be the address of bin SH
string and then we will after that
return to
system so now we have to just wait for
the address of pop RDI
and i also change to some repair the
code for the actual exploit okay fixing
some small things and it looks like the
rope gadget program was ready so let's
find a pop RDI red gadget so there we
have it so let's define it for my local
system and now let's also get it from
the top for the target cool so now we
can place the pop already I get it
address there and we can try it on my
local system if it works no didn't work
because I'm bad programmer what did I
forget
also here's a cool trick that I learned
from Gio Hearts CTF streams yeah you can
use telnet lip and assign it the socket
that we created and then you can use
telnet interact to have a interactive
shell with the business H won't work
with stolen working and it takes me a
second to realize my mistake because if
you look here which lip see address I
used to calculate the addresses are from
the previous stage I'm debugging it now
and I'm looking at gdb and realized that
the values are incorrect
you know I'm braking here at the return
and when I look at the address that we
were returned to their complete
gibberish they are not not where Lipsy
actually is and then it clicked and then
I realized I calculated the Lipsy
address based on the first stage but
obviously we close the socket again and
open it up so it's different and now
it's magically working
we throw it against the server but it
doesn't work what the is my mistake
now do it again and then I realize it
works the issue before was that it read
some garbage addresses which you can see
there at this deck and Lipsy output it
as they are incorrect but yeah now it
works
the flag is move pub red repeat that's
exactly what we did to move up the stack
and there's our flag awesome we got the
flag I'm very happy I learned a lot and
I hope I was able to share some of it
with you even though that this trifle
challenge was not so easy to understand
like the like the readme challenge
before because this included so many
more steps and Rob exploit which is kind
of Lee to explain but I hope that you
learned something nonetheless please
check out the reddit threads from my
about my videos you can comment there
and I'm very very interested in little
tricks techniques and scripts and stuff
that you are using to solve challenges
like that if you have just like little
tricks that you could use in gdb or in
Python or whatever to just speed up
things or get things more reliable or
how you do those address calculations
where I kind of did try an arrow stuff
I'm always looking for tips to improve
myself so that would be pretty cool if
you would share that in the reddit
reddit threads of the particular videos
thank you very much and hopefully see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
