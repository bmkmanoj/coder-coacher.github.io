embedded hardware CTF competition I
started to do a bit more hardware
related videos and some of you struggle
to understand the basics of electronic
instead of making a basic tutorial video
I thought I'd do a collaboration with
another channel electronics idiot so we
built a simple prototype for a door lock
with a pin ped entry we kept it simple
with only four buttons three LEDs
showing the status and a motor that
would actually unlock the door if you
type in the wrong code and the red LED
will stop flashing and the more wrong
tries you have the longer it will do
that and when you enter the correct pin
the motor will start spinning to unlock
the door if you're interested in how
this prototype is built and you don't
understand what all these components are
for and journey want some introduction
electronics
follow now this link to electronics
idiots video and come back later it's
also linked in the description below now
let's get ready and attack this lock
first of all let's make some assumption
let's assume we don't have access to the
microcontroller and to the motor to
unlock the door otherwise you could just
directly cut the wires of the motor and
hook them up to your own power supply
and unlock the door
but obviously the pin pad and the LEDs
have to be accessible but not only that
also the power supply is exposed because
maybe the lock is running from a battery
and achieve phase and you need to be
able to change that our goal is to
unlock the door and the opposite tech
would be to try every possible pin as
fast as possible but where do we start
we have these buttons that enter the pin
and obviously buttons also just modify
the voltage on the input wire to the
lock
the wire is always slow but when you
press it the wire is pulled too high
five fold and the LEDs are just
connected to those wires of the lock
which usually outputs below which is not
enough to turn the LEDs on between the
output is set to high the 5 volt the
LEDs will turn on so you can just
imagine that in these locations are
either zeros or ones for the buttons you
decide which one it is by pressing the
buttons and follow LEDs the lock decides
the state of the zero or one now we want
to attack this to lock a very simple
prototyping platform that everybody
knows is Auto ìno so lets you set first
of all we have two status LEDs
especially the blue one is interesting
because it tells us that the pin pad is
ready for input let's take off the
imagina Tory front panel of our lock and
hook up three cables to the LEDs and
remember the three I open numbers we use
on the other inner because we need it
when we write the program we know that
the lock will output here a digital one
or zero which is basically five volt or
zero volt depending on if the LED shall
be turned on so we can just read this
value on the pins that are now connected
to the lock LEDs we can take one of the
example programs that read one input pin
and send it to the computer via serial
and just modify that we define which pin
number correspond to which LED set those
pin two input mode and then we simply
extend the program to
the current value from the wire and
write it out to zero this is happening
in a loop many many times per second now
if we program our auto in on board and
open the serial console we see that the
blue LED is turned on we read a 1
because the lock is putting out 5 volt
on that wire and the other 2 LEDs are
off and obviously when you type in a
wrong pin and the red LED is blinking
you can see that it easily as well now
we need something to press the buttons
for us again this is super simple with
an Arduino we just hook up four cables
to the buttons the microcontroller off
the lock reads the status of the buttons
exactly how we just implemented the
reading of the LEDs this means we just
output a digital one 5 volt from this
pin via those cables to indicate pushing
the button and a digital zero if you
want to release the button again it's so
simple so when you write code to enter
every possible pin combination we define
which output pin corresponds to which
button and set their pin mode to output
and then we write a couple of nested
for-loops
one loop kirpan digit to see that in
action we can output which buttons would
be pressed by a siren and you can see it
quickly looks through all the possible
combinations now we simply have to write
the code which presses the buttons in a
sequence like we would by hand that's
simple but before you press the buttons
we should make sure that the pin pad is
ready for input by checking the status
of the blue ready LED we can write a
while loop which waits for the LED to
turn on after that we know we can now
enter the pin tool that we just set the
output pin to hi wait a short amount of
time and put it back to low it's like
pressing the button by hand and then we
do this for each digit this code now
types in all possible pins for us so we
don't have to do that and that works
already pretty well but the issue is
that with each failed attempt the lock
increases the time out after a couple of
attempts the time is so long that it
starts to become unfeasible this means
we need some kind of vulnerability that
allows us to make
put forth faster while playing around
with the lock trying to understand all
of its behavior you might realize that
when you reset the board for example
when you cut the power and reconnect it
again the timeout resets the memory of
the number of failed attempts seems to
be lost after the power is removed and
this is where we can attack to simulate
cutting the power I connect another
cable to the reset pin of the lock in
the code after we enter the pin we check
with a loop for the read failed led if
that LED turns on we proceed to pull the
reset to low and back to high which
restarts the lock then we enter the next
loop wait for the blue LED which
indicates the lock is ready and then we
enter the next pin and now we can brute
force a pin fairly quickly just takes a
minute or so but then it finds the
correct pin in the motor spins also
because our code was waiting for the red
LED it will not continue to try more
pins this theoretical attack is not
unrealistic for example there was this
iPhone lock screen brute force where you
would cut the power aggressively after a
failed attempt before the failed
attempts counter could be written to
memory this way you could brute force
all pins even though it should be locked
after 10 failed attempts let's kind of
the fun stuff with hardware Tech's they
really feel like cheating in some way
because it's a software person and
taking a software implementation with
hardware seems pretty unfair but these
kinds of things are very powerful the
personal engineers will look like this
or some other kind of hardware really
has to be aware of something like this
if you start thinking about possible
Hardware attacks where somebody has
physical access it becomes really really
hard when we start to plan this
prototype for this color I realize it's
not trivial to create a secure lock so
think about how you would design a look
and how elaborate it quickly becomes
from a software standpoint to prevent a
text like we just did but also from a
hardware engineering standpoint you have
to be able to exchange a battery and
enter a pin but you must not be able to
simply remove the plastic front panel
and short the wire to spin the motor
if you are an engineer software hardware
I'm really happy that you watch this
video because once you get into the
mindset of always thinking about how
stuff can detect you will also create
more secure products for the general
population</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
