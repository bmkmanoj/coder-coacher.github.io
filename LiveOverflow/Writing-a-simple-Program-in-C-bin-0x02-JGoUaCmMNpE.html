software one has to understand how
software is written it's very helpful to
explore different programming languages
to understand their differences and
similarities and to get into the special
way of thinking often when I use a
software I imagine how a certain piece
of that might have been implemented this
makes me think about the software
architecture and potential difficulties
that developers may have had which helps
me to find bugs that can be exploited
when I was younger I used programming to
write damage calculators for browser
games or simple chat programs that we
could use at LAN parties to communicate
nowadays I use programming more as a
tool to solve other problems or help me
with repetitive tasks to get a feeling
what programming is like we will have a
look at a very simple program
implemented in a very old and low-level
language see and in the next video we
use a more modern scripting language
Python you will notice a lot of
similarities in terms of structure but
also how different the syntax looks like
let me first show you what our little
program will do to execute it you simply
have to enter the path because we are in
the same folder we have to start the
path with the dot which is an alias for
the current location maybe you are
wondering why the other programs like LS
don't require a full path to execute
them the reason for that is when you
enter a command or generally speaking
the name of a program the shell will
look at the configured path environment
variable which contains a list of
directories we are to look for programs
there are many different environment
variables that all have the purpose but
because we are only interested in the
path we can use the pipe to redirect the
output of n into another program called
grep which can filter for lines that
only contain path I use grep to filter
output of other programs all the time is
one of the most useful tools another way
to get the content of path is to use
echo to print the variable
now let's use where is to find the
location of the LS program which shows
it that it is indeed in a location
specified by path the paths are
separated by colons if you would want to
execute our program from every location
like LS we can simply add this current
directory to the path variable with
export a nice trick if you want to copy
something in the terminal it should just
mark it and then press the mouse wheel
this will automatically paste the mark
text if your current cursor location now
at the users home folder to the path and
then you can execute the program like
any other
but let's dive in seas over 40 years old
and despite its age it's still used a
lot many beginners feel that sea is hard
because it feels unintuitive
and too low level at first but you will
notice in later episodes that it's very
close to assembler which is ideal to
understand and imagine how computer
works our goal is to obviously look
nerdy so we will use a command line text
editor called vim chalk aside it really
makes sense to learn them because we
actually needed a lot and sometimes you
connect to a remote server and you have
nothing else than just the text
interface VI is already installed but
wim which stands for Wii I improved is a
little bit nicer and it's not yet there
but we get this nice little suggestion
to install it with sudo apt-get the sudo
prefix is needed because only the root
user can install new software
enter why to continue
now enter them in the file name dot C to
start editing before you can type you
have to enter the insert mode by
pressing I keep an eye on the status bar
at the bottom which tells you what you
are doing to exit the insert mode hit
escape and then you can enter commands
with a colon such as colon W to save the
file or call it Q to exit the editor or
simply : WQ to save and exit we don't
really have to know more features than
that for now
except maybe we want to enable syntax
highlighting and displaying the line
numbers so syntax on and set number
first we want to use the include
statement to add the standard i/o the
input/output functionality to our
program next we define the entry
function which is always called main
every C program has this function and
this is where the our program starts to
execute a function has a name and an
encloses code that belongs to this
function the parameter variables defined
here are standardized the first
parameter is an integer number called
Arg C which stands for argument count
and the second parameter is a list
called Arg V which stands for argument
vector for now we will use ArrayList and
vector as synonyms so those function
parameters are in fact what we can pass
to a program on the command line just
think of the cat command
it takes a file name as a first argument
and if you would program cat yourself
you would access the file name with Arg
V now let's print something by using the
printf function and a string as a
parameter the backslash n is a special
character which stands for newline maybe
you remember it from the last video
where we headed in the hex dump and it
shows up as hexadecimal a let's save it
with escape : WQ and enter just a
friendly reminder read the man page of
printf to learn
or about this function to access the
manual for the C function printf you
have to look in the third section of the
manual so Man 3 printf
to create a program from this text we
have to compile it the compiler converts
the text into a binary machine code that
can be executed by the CPU we can use
the GNU C compiler GCC for that GCC file
name of the code and - o to specify the
output file name oh I made a mistake
there is a conflict for arc V so let's
quickly fix that by calling this
variable probably arc C
now you can execute it awesome but let's
be a good program from the beginning and
use - capital W all to enable all
warnings now we get a warning that at
the end of the function is no return
value despite having main defined to
return an integer number so let's fix
that by adding a return zero at the end
zero means that the program exited
without an error you can hit o instead
of I to enter the insert modern boom
which automatically creates a new line
below for YouTube right maybe you start
to realize now how powerful women can
get when you get familiar with the
shortcuts in our it compels just fine to
make this program bit more interesting
we will add an if statement we say that
the argument count has to be equal to
two and if that is the case we will
print the same phrase as before just
without a fixed name we can use this
formal string syntax of percentage s to
indicate that at this place belongs the
string and its first parameter we
specify the string which is the second
element of the arguments vector yes it
says 1 but it's the second entry in the
list because we always start counting
from 0 if we don't have exactly two
arguments we will print an error message
good practice is to print the error
message not to the standard output but
to the standard error may seem weird for
now but you will understand it in the
future and instead of printing the
second argument because we might not
have one we will print the first
argument instead but why do we have a
first argument you will see in a second
let's also add a return one here because
that indicates that the program exited
with an error compile this code and test
it as you can see if you don't specify
an argument it will display the usage
error message with the program name the
shell passes everything you typed on the
command line separated by spaces to the
program as arguments and this means that
the first argument will be your
now if you set the second argument the
personalized message is printed also
notice that when you want to have a
string with spaces you have to put it in
quotes to indicate that it belongs
together with dollar question mark you
can display the exit code of the
previously ran program which is either 0
or 1 depending if we got an error or not
now let's play a little bit with the
program we already scratch the topic of
environment variables if you look at
them again you can find the user
variable which contains your user name
so when you execute the program with
dollar user it will print life overflow
but what if you actually want to print
dollar a user to achieve that we have to
escape the dollar the dollar has a
special meaning on the command line when
you enter this text the shell will read
what you type character by character and
once it reaches the dollar it knows that
the next characters will be the name of
a variable it will then look up the
value of this variable and replace it
but if you use another special character
the backslash before the dollar the
shell will first read the backslash and
knows that if a dollar is following it
will not treat it as a special character
anymore but wouldn't it be cool to
always get greeted when you open the
terminal so browse to your home folder
again and check out the dot files there
there is one file called bash or C which
is a special file that will be loaded
once you open the terminal and it can
contain commands that are executed every
time open it in wim and you can go
quickly to the bottom of the file with
shift G and switch to insert mode with I
or o now we can add the export command
from earlier but because we know about
environment variables and how they are
recognized and replaced we can use this
better technique to change a path and on
the next line we add our program with
the user variables as an argument now
save it by pressing escape to enter the
command mode : w now open another
terminal and be excited obviously there
are easier solutions than this
but just using echo instead of a
compiled C program but it doesn't matter
we learned something as an exercise you
should add an alternative version with
echo and the environment variable to the
bachelor C and you can also modify the
VAR c to always enable the syntax
highlighting and the line numbers for
them I remove the export command again
because I don't want to have the home
folder in the path place the cursor
somewhere on the export command line and
press DD you have to be in command mode
for this so hit escape if you are still
in the insert mode but now I also have
to use the full path to our program
