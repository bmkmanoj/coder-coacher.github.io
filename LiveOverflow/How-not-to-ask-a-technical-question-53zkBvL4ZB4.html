bit of a Randy video let me say sorry
for that in advance I love to help
people and try to answer every question
I get that's why I have an educational
YouTube channel no question is stupid in
all this yada yada but sometimes it's
really really frustrating not because
you are asking a beginner question or so
but because how you ask the question let
me give you some horrible examples that
can make me really mad and also why they
make me so mad and hopefully then you
will understand how to ask a technical
question so that you get the help you
want
so this one guy is stuck on a web CTF
challenge and seek some advice of course
I wouldn't give hints or solutions
during an active CTF but it wasn't
playing that one and I'm happy to be
used for some rubber duck debugging so
he writes I'm trying to solve web 100 on
CTF running found bug and the URL can
you look mmm I don't care about grammar
spelling issues I'm not a native speaker
so I don't mind as long as I kind
understand what you try to say but why
do you make me respond to this with yes
and then make me wait for the actual
question this is just wasting time so I
asked what is the bug you found and I
get this as a response stuck at sqli I
try to put single quote it gives bug
what is the bug what's the error why do
you think that error means it's an SQL
injection
are there other typical SQLite
characters that cause an error can you
enter more characters to fix the
corrupted SQL string again to prove its
SQL I we talk a bit more and he also
says there might be XSS and he sends me
this I don't know how to read but in
excess log its HTTP localhost - but just
write enter HTML what the are you
talking about why do I have to guess
what you did that this shows up in the
access log well I guess you may be
injected an image tag or maybe a script
tag and you trigger this request to your
server and you check that in your access
logs but does it mean you have CSRF or
is it actual XSS also you said you try
to enter HTML I have no idea what it is
that's not valid JavaScript obviously he
means inner HTML but what exactly was
the payload you tried in what context on
what Dom object were you trying to
access content within our HTML computers
and programs are deterministic machines
they do exactly what they are told to do
so if you show me exactly what you did I
may be able to think like the machine
and tell you why it doesn't work
but when you make me guess and assume I
cannot give a definitive answer so I
always waste time having to think about
something you could just tell me so I
ask for the exact payload and he sends
me a link
I visit the site i type in inner into
the search doesn't show up should I
waste now two minutes clicking through
all the payloads guessing which one he
might have used and then think about why
it might have not worked and I get these
questions all the time the program
jumped shellcode but when the shellcode
started print segmentation fault why
that I have no freaking idea why there's
an endless amount of reasons why this
might happen
and you don't give me enough information
to actually answer the question maybe
your shellcode is for the wrong
architecture or your shellcode is not
properly encoded or you use an old
version of your script without the
shellcode
or your address to the shellcode is
strong or part of the shellcode is all
written or the shellcode you use
actually has a printf that prints the
string segmentation fault
I don't know how should I know if you
ask questions like this I can't help you
you don't get the help you want and I
will feel really annoyed and also other
people you ask on reddit or Stack
Exchange won't be able to help you and
we want to help you we want you to learn
and understand it so here an example of
a great question where I'll love to
spend time on and try to help I was
wondering in this video of yours
provides a link with an exact timestamp
the essential listing says this jump mmm
and then a question explaining what they
would expect and that something else
happens and they are confused great
awesome I can click on the link watch a
few seconds to remember what I showed
and then respond awesome somebody had an
issue with an exploit it didn't work
they got some kind of shell but whatever
they typed it didn't work and I got the
screenshot here
well now I'm able to see what's going on
and why there is a confusion this person
accident
intially had a double quote in the
payload and actually this here was not a
shell in us waiting for the unbalanced
quote to be closed not a stupid question
I can totally see how that can happen
a little mistake and computers just do
what you tell them to do and I was able
to follow it precisely and determine the
error so let me tell you how I wish you
would send me a question and then I'm
more than happy to respond you want
something from me or from somebody else
so please put some effort into it maybe
follow these rules rule one
if you are referring to a video include
the link ideally with timestamp I can't
remember what exactly I said a year ago
rule two whatever you try to do show me
exactly your steps for example if you do
a buffer overflow with gdb just set some
breakpoints step through it show me the
irrelevant parts like memory addresses
and register values and copy the whole
terminal output and dump it into
pastebin make it as easy for me to get
the problem you can also record a video
about it or just dump everything into
placement I can't read your mind but I
can read terminal output rule three tell
me as much as possible about what you
think and know if something unexpected
happens tell me what you would have
expected Rule four provide as much
information as possible I don't want to
waste time asking for your shellcode
when you have an issue with your
shellcode you should have provided that
shellcode already from the start it's
better to provide too much data than too
little include anything you can think
about rule five include the failed
attempts you tried something else before
tell me about your negative results
these are important to understand what
you already tried so I don't have to
suggest trying them ok so I think you
get the point please put some time and
effort into your questions collect as
much data as possible and provide every
information every line of code command
terminal history whatever it can help me
to understand what the issue is well
sorry for the thread but I got really
frustrated with some of those questions
and I hope from now on it will be
be a bit more fun answering the
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
