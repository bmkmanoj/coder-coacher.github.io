CSS and JavaScript is and how the
browser uses that to render display a
web page in this video we will now talk
about how the HTML code gets to your
brows in the first place so we will
learn about the URLs and the HTTP
protocol let's start by running a simple
web server on our local machine
depending on what kind of language you
want to use for development there are
different options for running a
production or development server for
example if you want to write PHP code
there are our projects like XA MPP that
sets up an apache with a database and
PHP enabled for development purposes or
if you want to write a Python web app in
flask it will come with its built in
debug web server but let's start last
video we wrote a very simple HTML page
and open it in the browser from our
local file system now let's try to surf
this HTML page via HTTP from a web
server instead recent versions of PHP as
well as Python have cool features to run
a simple HTTP server so a server is just
a program that gives you a file if you
ask for them let's start a simple server
with PHP if you don't have PHP installed
yet install it with apt-get install PHP
5 CLI on Ubuntu or whatever matches your
operating system then write PHP -
capital S followed by an IP address and
a port where to listen from in this case
we only want to listen on one two seven
zero zero one which is a special IP
referencing localhost meaning this IP
points at your own computer and then
port 8080 port ad is the default port
for websites because people on the
internet agreed on that but generally
you can run a server on any port you
like a port is just a number inside of a
TCP packet so when the network card and
you operate
system receives a TCP packet meanings
just a bunch of bytes it will look at
the port number inside that packet and
then it will check in a table if a
program is listening
meaning if it's waiting for a packet on
that particular port then the operating
system will give the content of that
packet to that program and we registered
PHP to listen on port 8080 so now let's
open this in the browser we want to load
a site via HTTP whatever that means then
the IP address which is localhost and
pointing to this local machine and the
port 8080 hmm not found the requested
resource slash is not found let's look
at the terminal we can see here that on
that date this IP address try to access
slash but there is no such file when we
start the server it displayed to us that
the document root is here and we know we
have the test HTML file in here so let's
try to access test dot HTML cool that
worked and in the terminal we can see
that this IP performed another request
this time to test dot HTML we can also
see that we apparently try to access
favicon dot ICO we didn't type that in
the browser well see see those tiny
icons for websites you visit well those
are favicons and people on the internet
agree that file is supposed to be called
favicon dot ICO by default so the
browser's checking if you have such a
file so that it can display a need icon
for you now let's open the browser
developer tools again and go to the
network tab then we reload this page
here you can see now all the requests
the browser is doing to display this
page in this case it's just two simple
requests to test dot HTML and the image
but if you do the same for example on
reddit this is going nuts it's loading
so many resources so let's look at that
test dot HTML request so first of all it
access the file with the name test.html
any status return code was 200 this
means everything went fine for example
earlier we saw the arrow status code 404
which stands for not found there's a
huge list on what certain status code
numbers mean now let's click on it let's
first check the response tab this is
what the server returned to us after we
asked if we can get the file test on
HTML let's just the content of the file
we requested but how did we actually ask
the server to give us test dot HTML
let's do an HTTP request by hand use a
simple tool called net cut for that
netcat is a simple UNIX utility which
reads and writes data across network
connections using TCP or UDP but why
would that help us with the HTTP
protocol well HTTP is build on top of
TCP the TCP layer is responsible for the
port and TCP sits on top of the IP layer
which handles the IP addresses IP
addresses identify the receiving
computer in a network and the ports are
used by the operating system to decide
to which application should forward the
content of the packet so the web so
we'll handle the content of that packet
and the content will follow a special
format which is HTTP so this means we
can use netcat to send a TCP packet to
the web server with any payload we want
and we can decide that we want to talk
HTTP now let's request the test HTML
page first we open our connection to the
IP and port and when we type something
the text will be sent as a TCP payload
to the web server to request tests on
HTML we have to do the following we
start with the HTTP method get' so we
tell this server that you want to get a
resource followed by a space and then
the resource path in this case slash
tests on HTML now some web servers want
to follow the HTTP port
calm or strictly but in this case this
is already enough to finish up this
request we have to indicate that with an
NPO line and we get immediately a
response back from the server so
responded to us with code 200 everything
is ok and there are some key value pairs
called HTTP headers for example
informing us that the request resource
has the content type text HTML and how
long the content will be followed by an
empty line and the content of the
resource now if we were a browser we
would read that content type and we
would know we have HTML and then take
the file content and render that in a
window so HTTP is literally just human
readable plain text that is sent between
your browser and the web server and yes
that makes it super inefficient why not
use binary but that makes it super easy
for us to understand now let's go back
to the developer console and check the
first step of the request the headers
here you can see the response headers
from the server again those key value
pairs before the content of the file but
you can also see request headers so the
browser also added some key value pairs
to the HTTP request and did not only
send us one line we did we can also see
this if we quit our web server and use
netcat instead to listen on that port so
we can see the content of the TCP packet
and now when we refresh the page the
browser will sent the HTTP request again
to this IP in port
but this time netcat will display us
what was received we just want to see a
full proper HTTP request from the
browser and here it is you can see it's
a bit longer than what we sent the first
time for example it send a user agent
with Chrome so the web server knows that
web browser Chrome is requesting the
file and can act accordingly for example
if the user agent were phone it might
want to send a special mobile version of
the file instead it also sent an accept
header telling the web server what kind
of content types it can work with or
what language the user prefers
oh and with net kid we can also send
back a response so we can just send here
some text not including any HTTP header
the browser will make sense of it so
HTTP is super easy right a browser
simply creates a connection to a server
which is another program that has the
purpose of providing files when
requested and the browser can ask for
files or resources by using this plain
text human readable HTTP format and this
server will respond with the content of
the requested file in the next video we
will write a little bit of shitty PHP
code which can be used to dynamically
create files that are returned by the
web server instead of only serving
static files from the file system and
after we got that knowledge we can then
soon head slowly into security related
topics
