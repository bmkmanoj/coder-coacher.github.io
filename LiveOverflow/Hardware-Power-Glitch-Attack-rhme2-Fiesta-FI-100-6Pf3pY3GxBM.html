district when I stumbled upon the
strange device does anybody know what it
is it does not have any recognizable
logos or marks only the letters v1
written on one side and a USB connector
on the other to the photo it probably
some kind of memory but it has unusual
design I will check it when I arrive at
home I finally arrived at home I
connected the USB device from a computer
but it looks like it is permanently
locked now I'm curious about the device
in this content would I be able to
unlock it using a fault injection hey
guys this was a reenactment of the story
in the description of the Fiesta
challenge from the risk you're embedded
hardware CTF I'm really excited about
this one so check it out
the device is permanently locked we can
imagine that the code could look
something like this a loop with a
condition that will always be true so an
endless loop and it just prints block
which sucks because we want to get to
the code after the loop where it prints
the secret clearly there's no way to
reach that code ever that's what a
software developer would say but bear
with me we will perform a hardware
attack and glitch our way out of this
loop I'm so excited about this challenge
it was my favorite thing to experience
and the perfect end to the risky
embedded hardware CTF for me get ready
to get your mind blown
I have some theoretical knowledge about
Hardware text from University and also
watch some conference talks about it
which is just theoretical knowledge but
at least I had somewhat of a plan so the
challenge is a fault injection challenge
which means you kind of screw with the
hardware so it does something wrong and
there are several ways how you can
perform a fault attack for example you
know from movies how an EMP can crash
electronic so trigger a small
electromagnetic pulls to the chip and it
might do something weird or the chip
runs from a clock at a certain speed and
weird things happen once you let it run
faster than intended or a lot slower but
what I will do is a power glitch which
means I want to cut the power supply for
a really short amount of time so that
the device does not reset but it does
something weird and so to do this I need
to build something I choose to do it
with an FPGA developer board that I have
still laying around an FPGA is for now
just like any other electronic sport
something that you can program to do
whatever you want in my case I want to
use the switches to control the length
of the power cut and a button as a
trigger and I want to use a single wire
as an output of the FPGA to control an
electronic switch that turns on or off
the power supply so a transistor so
let's focus on the first part
programming the FPGA so that it does
what we want if you are software
developer then you might find the code
that you write for FPGA is very weird
at least for me it took quite a while
until it clicked for me because you are
not writing sequential programs but you
are actually just writing a definition a
description of a digital circuit the
same description languages are basically
used in designing real chips like CPUs
and so what you are looking at here is a
very very simple chip that I have
designed this is just the first test to
get into writing very low code again but
let me try to explain like I said I'm
describing the behavior of the chip here
and at the beginning I'm saying this
chip has a few inputs for example a
switch a button and the clock so the
FPGA board also has a clock signal which
is just zero one zero one zero one zero
one and I define some outputs
two LEDs and a regular output pin on the
board then I define some internal
registers so a small memory cell that
remember some values I already define
the 32 bit counter register but ignore
that for now in a glitch register which
will be the output for the glitch so one
power is on or zero power is off now I
connect these internal registers with an
actual output to the chip imagine really
wires going from the glitch register to
the output so the LED as well as the pin
output are directly connected to the
register value and also I connect the
button input to the other LED output so
obviously when the button is pressed the
LED will turn on you see really just
describing how the chip is wired up then
I set some initial values these values
are set when the device powers on so the
counter for now is said to start at zero
but the glitch power output is 1 so
turned on at the start and then comes a
block that just describes what happens
in each clock cycle every time when the
clock signal has a positive edge so a
rising edge it will do the following it
will take the value in the glitch
register and invert it and you know the
glitch register is directly connected to
this output pin so that pin will just
wiggle one zero one zero one zero with
each clock cycle then you just compile
the hardware definition and program the
FPGA and by programming the FPGA I don't
mean it writes some kind of sequential
assembler code to some memory this is
not a processor you can build a
processor with it so it's kind of a
layer Depot but it basically contains a
lot of digital building blocks which
will be connected together in a way that
it does what you described so yeah it's
a lot of magic but it's quite
fascinating how it works so you should
look that up and then we can look at the
oscilloscope and see that it works you
see that the output pin here constantly
goes 0 1 0 1 0 1 cool huh now I just
have to write a bit more very low code
to get there behavior that I want so for
example I want to use the switches of
the board to set how long the power
should be turned off so I have to
include them in another definition file
developing this hardware stuff is really
frustrating at the beginning but I
learned it on my own a few
years ago because I heard that FPGAs are
awesome I think it was just the time
when Bitcoin people started to implement
mining on FPGAs
the very log code is still very short
because it's not a really complicated
circuit but let's see so first of all
everything here happens when the FPGA
sees a rising edge of the clock and then
the stuff in here doesn't happen
sequentially it just defines what
happens when the rising edge is seen
it's all simultaneously it's connected
wires in the ditches of the circuit not
a program so if the current state was
idle which it is when the device is
turned on it checks if the button is
pressed if the button is pressed the
stage will be set to glitch so with the
next clock cycle now the FPGA is in a
glitch state where it will output a zero
to indicate the power will be turned off
and start incrementing the counter so
with every clock cycle it will now
increment this counter at some clock
cycle in the future the counter will
have the exact binary value of the
switches so with the switches you can
obviously set a binary number with zeros
and ones so if that is reached the state
will be changed to hold off by that I
mean I don't want to accidentally glitch
multiple times out of each other because
a glitch is super short and when I don't
release the trigger button fast enough
it could glitch again so hold off will
output a 1 again so the powers turn Pig
on but also use a counter to wait for a
while and when enough clock cycles
happened it will go back into the idle
state where we wait for the button press
again to perform another glitch so now
we can have a look at that with the
oscilloscope you can see that the power
is high and when we press the trigger
button the power will drop to a zero for
a very short amount of time you can see
here the scale of the oscilloscope in
nanoseconds and with the switches we can
set the counter value to indicate how
long a glitch should be ah this looks
really good I think we are ready to go
so now we just have to wire up our
targets so we can control the power this
is actually a bit tricky because the
board gets the power through the USB
cable which also carries the serial
communication so we can interact with
the board but let's go step by step
first of all let's take care of the
power the FPGA board does not
run with five volts so we have to use a
small circuit to convert the three point
five volt to five volt which we already
did for the power side channel analysis
a few videos ago so I just reuse the
unidirectional level converter looks
complicated but there's nothing else and
being able to switch five volt with a 3
volt signal and we can hook up now that
5 volt to the VCC the power end of the
board you can see you don't have to go
through USB cable you can just directly
connect to the power supply now we just
need to somehow be able to interact with
the board via zero as you know those
other inner boards have an extra chip on
there USB to UART so a serial converter
which is great because we already have
the USB drivers for that installed on my
laptop now I just take an auto you know
uno that I have and remove the atmega
microchip so basically now only the USB
to UART chip is left and I can directly
connect Rx and TX to the target board
when I now establish a serial connection
with this other Ino
uno board what I actually do is talk
directly to the serial of the challenge
port and here is the complete set up we
have the FPGA which performs a power
glitch which can be configured with the
switches and pressing the button will
actually do it the three world clich
output of the FPGA
is converted to five volt we are a
unidirectional level converter and then
it's connected to the VCC the power end
of the target board so when the glitch
output of the FPGA drops the power
supply to the challenge board is cut for
a short moment and to interact with the
board via serial we hooked up the USB to
serial converter chip from another
Arduino awesome now all we got to do is
to connect the zero so we can observe
the lock message and then play around
with the length of the glitch you can
also see that the power doesn't
completely drop like I did before
without a target I think maybe it has
something to do with the capacitors on
the target board that release charge
when the power drops but it actually is
not too bad so the power doesn't
completely cut out but just drops a
little bit under the recommended voltage
threshold I think that's better for a
glitch so when you play with it
sometimes you glitch the board so hard
that resets which is not what we want
and sometimes it even loses the program
you flash on it you can see here that
after the glitch should start blinking
red which means the program was lost and
the bootloader waits for it to be
flashed no idea why it happens but you
can see that glitches are somewhat
dangerous you could theoretically brick
the board if you glitch a critical code
pipe in the bootloader but when you get
the timing right to the right moment
where you want to glitch and the voltage
drop has the right length then magically
the loop is broken and the flag pops out
how crazy is that
soft let's quickly recap the board had
an endless loop that will never stop and
the flag is printed after the loop so
theoretically you could never reach that
pot it's dead code but we know that
microchips can behave weird and
miscalculate stuff for example when the
power is below the minimum voltage for a
short amount of time usually the chip is
not operational with those voltage
levels but because we just do it for a
very very short amount of time it won't
just stop working but it just might
miscalculate some loop condition or
maybe skip instructions entirely we
don't really know I also assume that
risks your made it very easy so that you
don't have to actually glitch one exact
compare instruction but they may be made
a lot of calculations and if only one
fails it will break out so that we have
a lot of changes to actually go do
something important but nevertheless I
think it's just amazing I always felt
like these kind of fall injections are
very theoretical and unrealistic but
having done a simple one myself and I'm
not even a professional that was amazing
I hope you can appreciate how crazy this
attacker's - I just wish the
side-channel power analysis challenge
would have been on the same level
