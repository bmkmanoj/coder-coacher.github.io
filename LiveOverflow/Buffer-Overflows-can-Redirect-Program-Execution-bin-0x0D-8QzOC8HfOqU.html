bit closer to a full buffer overflow in
the last episode we have learned how a
buffer overflow can change local
variables which are stored on the stack
now we will have a look at stack level 3
which is very similar if you forgot how
we were able to solve stack level 0 you
should go back and watch it again when
we look at this code we see that it's
basically the same the only difference
is the name instead of a modified
variable we have the FP variable which
is defined as a function pointer the
syntax looks a little bit ugly but if
you check the if case is simply checked
if if P is not 0 and then just calls FP
as if it were a function now you know
that a function has an address location
in memory so it will basically call
whatever address is stored in FP now
like the modified variable into X 0 the
function pointer FP gets set to 0 and
after the gets function it will be
checked if it's not zero anymore so we
know that FP must also be stored on a
stick as a hint it says that we can use
gdb or object dump to determine whether
vin function lies in memory so let's
first use gdb and you can use examine or
print to get the address of win then set
the disassembly flavor to Intel and
disassemble main exactly next x0 we can
see that it makes space for hex 60 bytes
on the stack then we set ESP offset 5c
to 0 so that is the location of the FP
variable after the gets we compare this
value if it's still 0 and that if that
were not the case we load the value into
EAX down here and call that address so
let's set a breakpoint at this call now
execute it and enter enough characters
to alright this value on the stick
exactly like last video ok we hit the
breakpoint let's look at the registers
and we can see that we have successfully
set e^x - 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 which is the s
key value of a capital a and the next
instruction tries to call this address
so basically jump there but that is
obviously invalid memory so we get a say
fault now open a second SSH session and
create a Python script that will be our
exploit
so let's first try to figure out which
offset controls EAX so simply print a
recognizable pattern for example the
alphabet okay cool so plant this output
in a file now you can use this file in
gdb as input so we don't have to type it
every time it will use the content of
the file as input now run and use the
arrow left to redirect the file contents
in the standard input of the program
okay so yeah X is hex 5 1 and that is
capital Q so now we know which offset
modifies eax
let's rewrite the code a little bit
let's call this part up to the Q's
padding so we want to write here the
address of the wind' function so simply
use spec /xs hex escape for those 5
values oh oops that doesn't fit there is
a leading 0 missing save write the file
and check it in gdb
huh the address looks a bit weird looks
like the wrong way around well that is
because of the Indian Asst so the
numerical value will be basically the
other way around
cool eh looks fine now let's continue
and we get code flow successfully
changed now let's quickly solve the next
level as well this level is our first
buffer overflow where we take advantage
of the stack layout the code doesn't
contain much there is no function point
of variable we could all right and no
modified variable but it still wants us
to execute win so how do we do that now
do you remember how the stack layout
looks from last video here's a quick
recap so here on the left you can see
the assembler code and on the right I
will illustrate the stack with the three
important registers the instruction
pointer a IP the stack pointer ESP and
the base pointer EBP so first it starts
somewhere else with call main call will
push the theoretically next instruction
pointer onto the stack and then jump to
our main function as you can see when
the address of the next instruction was
pushed the stack pointer got incremented
and the address is placed there so now
comes our push EBP how do we know now
where to return to from main well if you
remember call push the address of the
instruction after the call so the next
value on the stack is where you want to
return to and the read instruction is
basically just popping this address into
the instruction pointer and that's
jumping back where we came from
so as you can see when a function is
called the address where we want to
return to will be stored on a stack so
instead of overflowing a local variable
we can simply overflow the return
pointer on the stack and when main would
return it will read the wrong value and
jump there instead so let's use the code
that we have just written and modified
it a bit let's select the payload a bit
longer and simply throw it at this
program in gdb
segmentation fault in hex 5-4 so we
successfully redirected code execution
to bad memory if you look closely you
can also spot that the base pointer is
hex 5/3 so that one was also written
because if you remember from last video
the old based pointer is also stored on
a stick right before the instruction
pointer and hex 5-4 is T so T allows us
to control the instruction pointer this
time let's use object dump to find the
address of the wind' function with - T
we get all symbols and then we can grab
for win so there's our address let's
remove everything up to the s because
that is the base pointer now we create
two variables EBP and AIP we don't care
about EBP so we can just set it to
whatever we want and next we want to set
the instruction pointer but let me show
a better way to encode the address as a
string so impo struct and then you can
use struct pack to convert the address
from the integer number into a binary
string then print the padding and append
EBP and EAP variable so let's execute
this exploit and pipe it into state
level for code flow was successfully
changed amazing we smash the stack and
control the instruction pointer but you
still get segmentation fault the reason
for that is that after the wind'
function is complete it tries to return
to the next value on the stick which is
now some gibberish and likely not valid
code area so it will crash eventually
but we don't care because we executed
what we wanted in the next video we will
write our first buffer overflow with
shellcode which will show you how
powerful a buffer overflow can be and it
will be our first exploit that will get
us root privileges</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
