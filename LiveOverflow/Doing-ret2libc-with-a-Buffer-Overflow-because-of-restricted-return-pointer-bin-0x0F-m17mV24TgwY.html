first full stack buffer overflow exploit
by overriding the return pointer on the
stack and jump into shellcode that we
have placed on the stack as well in this
episode we will look at stack level 6
which looks at what happens when you
have restrictions on the return address
to understand this video you must have
understood how normal buffer overflow
and jumping to shellcode works I hope I
explained it well enough in the past
videos but if there are still open
questions please post them on reddit I
really need you to have understood that
stuff as a hint this level tells us that
this level can be done in a couple of
ways such as finding the duplicate of
the payload with object M minus s or red
tulip C or even return oriented
programming in this video we will not be
able to explore return oriented
programming but I will show you a couple
of other tricks that will eventually
lead to return oriented programming so
let's have a look at the source code and
again it's very similar to the previous
levels just some small changes instead
of everything being in main main cause
this function get path get path
allocates a string buffer for 64
characters then reads a string with gets
and we all know by now that width gets
we can read arbitrarily many characters
which we can use to override the return
point on a stack but the next line is
interesting
built-in return address is a function
from the compiler which you can use to
read the current return address from the
stack and this return address is checked
if it starts with hex bf the M percent
performs a bitwise end with the address
after that only the part where they were
same survives basically setting the
remaining bits to 0 and checking if the
front is still hex PF if the return
address starts with hex bf it prints
this return address and exits when we
use our expo from last time and adjust
the padding to account for the new
unsigned int in this function we see
that it doesn't work it fails with
it okay so we cannot use addresses that
start with hex PF the exit protects this
function from being exploited that way
because the exit is a sis call that
simply quits the program so even though
we have smashed the return pointer this
function will never return so you can
see that even having a buffer overflow
doesn't necessarily mean you can exploit
it when you open this level now in gdb
break it get path run it and then look
at the memory with info prop map we can
see that the only address that starts
with PF are on the stack so basically we
cannot return to a stack address this is
crazy then how can we run our code if we
cannot return to the stack where we
place our shellcode so first of all we
can still control the return pointer as
long as it doesn't start with PF and now
comes the sick idea of returning into
known code let's think about this the
return instruction just looks at the
current address on top of the stack
removes it and just jumps there what
would happen if you returned to the
address hex 0 8 0 4 8 4 f9 which is the
return instruction itself think about
this we overwrite the return pointer
with hex 0 8 0 will reach the return
instruction it will pop this address
from a set and jump to it basically just
jumping to itself and now it will read
the next address on the stack and jump
there now you could repeat that make the
next address on the stack again 0 0 or
place the address of the stack here and
we can return into this deck again and
in theory that should work because the
original return address got overwritten
with an address that starts with 0 8 0
ok let's try that let's modify our
exploit code instead of the shellcode
let's use int 3 cc instruction again for
our trap
we all know that when we hit them we
have code execution and we just have to
find suitable shellcode so let's focus
on the interesting part set a breakpoint
at the return of get path and then run
it with our exploit input we hit the
breakpoint
and we got past the return pointer check
so let's look at this deck we can see
that the address on top of this deck is
now the zero eight address which is
return instruction so now single step
forward this should pop this address
from the stack and jump there and indeed
we hit the breakpoint again because we
jump to itself when you now look at the
stack the next address on the stack is
the stack address and we will return
into this address now so when we just
continue we will return into the stack
like in the previous exploit where we
hit our traps
boom arbitrary code execution by the way
this address we jump to the zero a zero
is a gadget when you read about return
oriented programming you are looking for
gadgets and that was a simple no
operation gadget it was just a return
doing nothing and for full return
oriented programming you look for
gadgets that do a some more stuff before
returning to the next address now when
we do this kind of stuff you hear me
saying return into or jump to those
become equivalent in this case because
yes we execute a return instruction but
we are not returning to the original
function anymore we are returning into
something else
effectively just jumping somewhere else
so I hope that does confuse you maybe
you ask yourself why the hell was the
sector computable in the first place
there is no valid reason why this text
should be executable that's why there
exists a general memory policy nowadays
right XOR execute basically it means
never have a memory page this writable
and executable because then an attacker
cannot execute any shellcode that he was
able to write in the process memory so
we would hope that today every modern
system uses DP data execution prevention
and sets the NX bit the non-executable
bit for memory pages like the stick but
reality is not so simple embedded
devices are on the rise with the
Internet of Things and often they don't
support features like that all modern
programming languages like Java Script
use JIT just-in-time compiler so they
have to compile code on the fly in
memory when needed and execute that so
they need writable and executable memory
regions but even if we had DP we could
use techniques like red tulips II to
never execute actual shellcode but still
pone a system now one of the hints said
you could look into red tulip see now
that you are almost a pro in
exploitation you understand what it
means it's very similar to what we did
instead level four we turn into Lib C
like we just returned into some code we
could just return into the huge library
Lipsy there must be something
interesting that we could abuse one
interesting function from that C is
system which executes the shell command
with print system we can find the
address of it but simply returning into
it will probably not work we need to
make sure to control a couple of things
let's create a simple C program that
calls the Lib C system for us in the end
we want to somehow execute system with
pin SH because then we get a shell
if we try that here that works well now
let's look at this in gdb we can see
that before the call to system the
address of the command we want to
execute is put on top of the stick and
as we know a call to a function will
push the return address on the stack as
well so if we draw this this is how the
stack will look like once we are at the
start of system first the address of the
command is placed on the stack and then
the address we want to return to now
imagine if we use our buffer overflow to
return into a system first of all we
didn't execute the call instruction thus
there was no return address pushed but
we fully control the stack so system
expects the stack to look like this and
we can build this by hand so first we
have to put the return address for
system on the stack but actually we
don't care about this right now
but that's still coulomb important and
remember that because you can chain
those things together like we chained to
returns after each other before we could
chain multiple function calls or other
gadgets after each other by always
controlling the return pointer of the
next step so in our case when system
finishes we will return into a segfault
because it will return in two for one
for one for one for one so next address
on the stack has to be a string we want
to execute preferably business age there
are many options how to get a reference
to such a string one option would be to
use a stack address because they are
strings we control on environment
variables because they are at the bottom
of the stack and a bit easier to predict
but as you remember a stack is a bit
unreliable a more reliable technique is
this here we can use find to search in
the memory of Lib C for a string cool
apparently at this address we can find
pin sh let's check if that is true
examine memory as a string at this
address
what the frak gdb what the hell are you
doing why do you say you found business
H there if it's not there I have no idea
why that's happening couldn't find
anything online anyway ignore this
here's another technique we can use
string to find all strings in Lipsy and
with minus T we can print the offset
inside this file as hex and then we can
simply add this offset to the address
slip C is loaded too and that is the
real address of Ben Sh
okay so let's copy this address into our
exploit and then let's try it
remember to use the trick from the
previous video with the parentheses and
the cat because the expert script will
close the input again and cool it works
what we just did was a technique called
red tulip see and we never executed any
code on the stick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
