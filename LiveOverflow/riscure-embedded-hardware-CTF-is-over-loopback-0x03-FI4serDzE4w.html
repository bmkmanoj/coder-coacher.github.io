seen some tweets about the risk of
embedded hardware CTF that has been
running for around three months the CTF
is over now and I have already prepared
several video write-ups of the
challenges that I've solved and they are
going to be released over the next few
weeks and months in this video here I
want to talk a little bit about my
experience with it and just a little
recap
so it all started last year when rescuer
announced the second round of the
embedded hardware CTF to enter the
competition you had to reverse engineer
a very very simple correct knee which
you could have easily done when you
follow my videos they were preparing
arduino nano boards to be shipped to
every participant so we all got free
boards but they replace the standard
other in a bootloader with their own
custom one the bootloader is a part that
is responsible for stuff like making it
easy to flash your own code on it they
did that because it didn't want to
distribute binaries that could be easily
reverse engineered instead of having to
interact with the board it also allowed
them to have unique Flags for every
participant so to work on a challenge
you chose one from this beautiful map in
an area that you want to try out I for
example started with the first crypto
challenge you get a little bit of text
and a file to download that file is
actually the encrypted challenge code
you could then flash as encrypt
accordance with the board exactly like
you would flash a regular Arduino code
on a normal board just in this case the
bootloader would decrypt the file and
then flash the actual code and then it
was just fair game find the flag how I
approached the challenges and what I
learned along the way and how I solved
them will be covered in the upcoming
videos also I spent way too much money
on equipment that I might never use
again
I'm sure riskier would have preferred if
I spend it on them but I was really
excited about the CTF and wanted to do
some hardware stuff but make bad
conscience is hunting me anyway
fast forward to end off February 2017
the CTF is over as you can see I was not
able to compete with the top ones look
at this point difference actually kind
of only solved the easy ones but I
learned a lot on my profile you can see
which challenges I soft when this will
also be the order of videos how they
will come out so you can experience the
CTF from my perspective from start to
finish you can also see that I have not
consistently played and obviously now I
regret that I mean I was busy or just
lazy but I think I missed out on some
good challenges let's also have a look
at which challenges were solved by how
many people as you can see I basically
cover all the simple ones they are
mostly
that don't really have anything to do
with the fact that it's an embedded
device they could have been just regular
CTF journalist and I guess that made it
a lot easier to approach though I did
not solve one of these apparently easier
channels and that is impostor I did not
start doing that one because I was
hanging out an IRC channel off the CTF
and I heard people raging over it not
because it was a bad challenge just
because it was apparently really hard
and I think it shows that generally more
people have good reversing skills and
there are people with good hardware
experience at least in the CTF community
the most fun and educational challenges
for me and the ones I'm really looking
forward to show you all other ones where
you really had to do some hardware stuff
so whack them all was great and I have
some fun fails to tell you about piece
of cake
and I think the coolest challenge of the
ones I've solved not because it was new
or creative just because I have actually
never done it myself and it's so magical
there was the Fiesta challenge if you're
a software person that one will blow
your mind
so overall the CTF was a huge success
the organisation was awesome the time
frame with those roughly three months
were perfect there were no big issues on
the systems or the hardware side I think
risker really deserves huge respect
spending quite a lot of money on running
this and obviously the biggest things
goes to the challenge creators and the
riskier employees who have been hanging
out on their free time when I a see and
were super supportive it was just a
really great experience overall and it
absolutely can't wait for risk you
embedded hardware CTF front three this
was just solid the only criticism I have
is that some challenges were relying a
little bit too much of guessing or
generally knowing exactly what it is
about
CTF challenges are designed best when
you could approach them without knowing
exactly what's going on and there's
enough information given all
discoverable to piece together the
puzzle and progress and find out what it
is about but that criticism is on a high
level designing good CTF challenges is
really hard and overall they have been
great but I wouldn't mind if they
improve
a bit on it and another small thing is
that I didn't want to try hardware
related things until the last three
weeks because I was scared of
accidentally destroying the board
because if you break it or fry it it's
game over you couldn't use your own
other you know board and I have no idea
how that could be solved
maybe next time they could sell the
challenge sports you could order a bunch
at the beginning or get another one if
you destroy it I don't know anyway you
probably think now damn why did I miss
this this sounds awesome and if you
don't think that leave and subscribe to
some Colley Metasploit tutorial channels
you are wrong here just kidding stay
here I have to try everything to
manipulate you into actually learning
something cool well lucky for you risk
you are slowly releasing all the
challenges unencrypted which means you
can load them onto an arduino nano board
with the irregular other you know
bootloader and those other inner bots
are really not that expensive so if you
want to follow along with the videos
attempt some challenges yourself or just
want to learn a bit more about
electronics and build a fun little
project blinking and LED you should get
one for the easy challenges no other
hardware like a soldering iron on
oscilloscope is needed they are only
software based if of course you want to
learn more about hardware security then
you need some equipment and it's not
cheap a binary ninja license is a lot
cheaper than Hardware hint hit I did get
one email asking me what this thing is
in a previous video
it's a multimeter and I realized maybe
not many people know really anything
about electronics I don't know how much
it is covered in school or physics class
or have had a small learning kit as a
child so I'm wondering if I should do a
video on the basics like transistors and
resistors and current and voltage at
least so you understand a basic digital
circuit I mean I don't know much beyond
that either but let me know if that is
needed or if there you think that's a
waste of time for me to make I think
it's important to have a rough
understanding and intuition on how
digital circuits and computers work on a
low level another thing I wanted to
mention thanks everybody for sending me
suggestions for the ioniq giveaway I've
selected a winner who wrote me a nice
list of ideas and actually put some F
in the mail and I just sent the package
out but thank you everybody
also I'm wondering and I'm really
curious about how you discovered my
channel where do those 50 subscribers
that they come from who are you what are
you doing
are you a student or are you
professional what do you get out of this
channels what are you hoping to find
here how did you get here I would really
love to hear your story so if you're
bored and want to tell me write me at
live overflow at gmail.com near the end
of March I will be at the troopers
conference in Heidelberg Germany I plan
to bring a camera and hope to find
somebody who was interested in sharing
some knowledge experience or a cool demo
so I can make a video about it I don't
even care about if it's some kind of
impactful OD and they don't really care
about products I'm mostly interested
about weird bugs or interesting research
so if you have something neat to share
let me know and maybe see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
