do something useful learn more about
hacking learn a new programming language
practice with CTF challenges write a
blog post watch those talks you have
missed and read the papers you have
bookmarked or finally learn read re what
is wrong with you you are wasting your
time is what my brain tells me a lot I
think everybody can relate to this
especially in security and IT in general
you always play catch-up and the
industry is constantly moving forward in
my talk from F SiC where I make an
argument for why I think CTF sarso great
tool on hacking I told you that I always
try to improve myself because I know
there are people that are better than me
and that they are a step ahead and I
could do a much better job if I would
know more and this is motivating me a
lot but it can also be very stressful at
times so let me tell you how I try to
deal with it
it's terrible when you feel like you
have to keep pushing and forcing
yourself to learn new things and usually
that doesn't work what ends up happening
is that you feel terrible and depressed
about this it's weird you are wondering
where your motivation went a couple of
months ago you remember sitting there
solving Raj me two challenges day and
night and now the new board is laying
here not even solar and instead you play
games like Guild Wars 2 of fortnight all
these awful manipulative mobile clicker
and idle games ensure there can be fun
but you also end up in a miserable
spiral thinking why am I keep wasting my
time I want to find cool vulnerabilities
why am I not pursuing that so I want to
tell you how I deal with this because
I'm not some kind of machine that can
just solve CTF challenges every day and
work through tutorials I also waste a
lot of time doing other stuff so first
of all I try to allow myself to play
games or do whatever seems fun and
relaxing I know that sometimes I'm just
not feeling like doing research or
playing CTF and that face can be a day
or can be weeks or even months but the
problem starts when I get these negative
thoughts that what I do is just a waste
of time because then I get nothing from
it I'm not learning anything new and
more importantly I can't even relax and
recharge which these games are supposed
to help with I need the break but I'm
not benefiting from that break so while
it's hard to keep these negative
thoughts out it's something I very
consciously try to change by telling
myself no it's okay I'm just enjoying
this game now shut up
mental health is very important to me
especially since so many people in our
community suffer from depression or
other issues that I'm sure are
intensified from our very competitive
elitist and stressful industry so just
allow yourself to relax and take the
break you need it's absolutely ok and
it's important to me but it's still half
these negative thoughts a lot
and so what I try to actively manipulate
my own brain into accepting playing
games or whatever other activity so I
can actually enjoy it and relax I have
one other trick what I try to do is if I
waste my time with a game I can't get
out of the negative thoughts spiral why
not do a project with that game and so
you can learn something along the way
for example for the past week I've been
playing clicker heroes on my phone you
have to click a lot and then by heroes
that will help you advance in the stages
and I felt so awful playing this game it
also has microtransaction and so forth
it's just your basic manipulative mobile
game however I noticed they have an
export function where you can export and
back up your game and it also has an
import function hmm that's interesting
so let's export the current safe
transferred onto my laptop it's clearly
basically 4 encoded so how does it look
if you decode it hmm that's just binary
data and also the file utility doesn't
recognize a file type so what to do next
in the meantime I played for a little
bit more so I can get a different save
that I can export and now we can compare
the two saves so first we can base64
decode and at the same time generate a
hex dump of the binary data if we do
this for both files we can then easily
look at the data in a diff I'm using vim
death for this now so as you can see the
first I think 27 fights are constant but
the remaining bytes change a lot this
could indicate that it's maybe encrypted
but even if it's encrypted it is likely
that we could reverse engineer the
method how it's done from the app
however I decided to run bin walk on one
of those basics before decoded binary
blobs and it turns out that bin walk
recognizes possibly Tet Lib compressed
data at position 24 or hex 18 so if we
look again at our hex dump we can see
that by 24 is here so I quickly looked
up these values for zet Lib and it turns
out that 7/8 is a magic number for
and the next bite indicates the
compression method 0 1 would be no
compression 9c as default compression
and Dae is best compression so we can
use the DD utility to cut out the part
so DD read input from the spine memory
file set the block size to 1 byte and
skip the first 24 blocks or so the first
24 bytes this will simply output all
bytes after the 24th byte and when
written to a file it also is now
recognized by the file utility as Zed
lib compressed data which we can now
pipe into something that D compresses it
for example OpenSSL Zed lip and the
result is some JSON data gold multiplier
total hero's souls from Ascension based
click damage debug total gold and so
forth
you can see it's all the settings so
rubies is the currency that you have to
pay for with real money and there it is
rubies let's change it to something high
oh and let's also enable debug now we
have to do everything in Reverse we
first pipe the modified JSON data into
open SSL zet lip and stored into the new
binary file but what about the 24 bytes
data before the set lip compressed data
well I have no clue what it is used for
but it's constant for both my save files
so let's just keep it you can use the D
again with the original binary as input
file block size 1 byte and this time we
just want the first 24 bytes which we
can educate with count and now we
combine this output with the zet lip
compressed data and we pack it together
in parenthesis and then pipe the
combined output into basics for now that
should be our new safe game let's try to
import it seems to have worked and when
we check the Ruby store we can see we
have over 99,000 rubies oh and I noticed
a console button that appeared in the
menu which opens up this year it's a
tiny tiny console and I typed help into
it to get a list of available commands
awesome and so now I learn new stuff I
analyze and reverse engineer the custom
safe game structure
and was able to modify it I practiced
using DD and improved my analytical
skills I hope next time I will just
recognize the Zed lip magic header right
away and so I turned feeling terrible
about playing this game into something
positive
and I'm happy that I played this game
and most importantly I just ruined the
game for me because now with all those
rubies there is no fun anymore
no challenge left as you can just buy
everything let's take a quick detour
because I just want to mention that I
would have not published this cheat or
heck about this game because I don't
want to screw over a small developer
studio just for some 10-minute internet
fame but when I did a quick Google
search I already found a prominent safe
game editor Freud out there so the
potential financial damage is already
done however I would like to point out
that even the developers don't like this
manipulative microtransaction system
they have announced a clicker heroes
tool and in the blog about why clicker
heroes too is abandoning free-to-play
they right we found that some number of
players spent many thousands of dollars
on rubies I can only hope that these
people could afford it and they were
doing it to support us and not to feed
an addiction but a strongly suspect that
is not the case we really don't like
making money off players who are in
denial of their addiction and that's
what a large part of free-to-play gaming
is all about that said we are not going
to change how we monetize click here's
one it would destroy our studio if we
did and so they announced a clicker
heroes - that is going to be a
standalone game without the abusive
microtransactions and look at this epic
trailer
you can pre-order it now for $30 and it
will hopefully be released in 2018 and I
appreciate their honesty and I really
really hope that their game will be a
success and that they can survive as a
small game studio and I understand the
controversy about prern games but for me
i pre-ordered it because I can afford it
and want to support them and the
pre-orders qualify for full refunds for
up to a year after we launch anyway just
wanted to get that off my chest because
ethics in research and reverse
engineering is important too so now that
I lost the motivation in the game
I found again the motivation to do some
more useful stuff like making this video
and there are many many more examples
like that for example I play Guild Wars
a lot and I was there early on reverse
engineering the Trading Post API riding
my own trading tools totally I over
engineered that including a deep
research into career and UI the
framework they are using to implement
the in-game web browser but that's a
story for another time and now they have
a real open Jason API that you can
access with an API key and there are
many other games that offer AP is for
example League of Legends or if you
don't play games you can check out the
reddit API s and that's so awesome
because you can use it to practice some
basic programming how to interact with
an API learn how to do HTTP request and
handle the response I think that's
perfect to learn a new language and
write some small tools such as query
your user information they don't have to
be fancy it's just to learn something
while also at the same time doing what
you enjoy
so browsing reddit or playing games
doesn't feel too bad and then you can
actually relax with them allow yourself
to unwind and you even benefit from it
by learning something new
