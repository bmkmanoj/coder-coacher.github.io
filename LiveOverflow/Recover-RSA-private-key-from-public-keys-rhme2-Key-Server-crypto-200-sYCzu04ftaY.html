of RSA that allows us to recover the
private key of an admin for a CTS
challenge this will be fun
it was also the next easy challenge
after the ones I solved already
if you know what you have to do you can
quickly google and find solution scripts
online but I wanted to take the
opportunity to look a layer deeper into
RSA
key server crypto 200-point
we have received a portable a symmetric
key storage for evaluation purposes
it generates and stores administrators
public key customers can use this
repository to find the public key of the
admin they want to contact and
administrators can use this repository
to update their key information if this
fancy keychain passes the test we are
going to give them away like candy
secure candy and we have a challenge
binary that we can download and flash
until the other inner board with AVR
dude okay so we get a menu with two
options first if you are a customer you
can list all public keys second if you
are an admin you can update your keys
just assign the plaintext admin and more
options will be provided the parameters
to be used for the signature are sha-1
and pkcs1 version 1.5 and it's pretty
clear that that is our goal we want to
be able to sign the text admin with one
of the admins private keys you can also
look at pkcs1 version 1.5 and quickly
see that the a symmetric encryption is
RSA and otherwise it basically just
tells you what the description said that
for signature you first reduced a
message with a hash algorithm by default
that would be md5 but in our case we use
sha-1 and then we encrypted hash with
the private key wait that doesn't make
any sense does it encrypting with a
private key do you not usually encrypt
with a public key and decrypt with a
private key well we want to assign a
message if you have my public key and I
want to send you a signed message so
that you can verify that I really sent
it then I can simply encrypt my message
with my private key and then you decrypt
the message with a public key only me
with the correct private key would be
able to encrypt it so that you can
decrypt it with a matching public key
and that's how signing works with our
Zaid so if we had the private key we
could take the sha-1 hash of the admin
message and then we encrypted with the
private
and then we take the result and give it
to the board this way we would prove
that we are apon because only an admin
with the private key could sign the
message but how can we get the private
key of an admin all we can do is list
the public keys at this point you can
google for common ways how you can break
hours a like mistakes that can happen
because crypto is hard but let's see if
we can figure it out ourselves by
looking at the math well at least
partially so here's the Dicky PD article
of RSA and it tells you exactly how RSA
works but first of all I like to mention
something when people ask what's the
difference between RS a and AES the
textbooks response is one is a symmetric
and the other symmetric encryption but
that's pretty shallow maybe you have
heard about how we usually do a
symmetric encryption of larger messages
we don't just use RSA we generate a
secure random key and use it to encrypt
our message with a s and then we encrypt
this random key with RSA public key of
our recipient and sent the RSA encrypted
key and the AES encrypted message to our
contact our contact and decrypt the key
with their RSA private key and then use
a s with that key to decrypt the message
we often say we do that because it's
faster but again it's kind of a shallow
reason what's really the difference
AES is a block cipher it basically is a
glorified byte mixer first it operates
block based it divides the message the
data into blocks and divides this blocks
further and basically handles bites it
then substitutes those bytes mixes them
of course doing a lot more and way more
complicated stuff than that but the
takeaway here is that it operates on
bytes that's completely different on how
RSA works RSA is pretty much basic math
which operates on numbers it doesn't
really care for bits and bytes sure AES
is also math but what I mean is for
plain RS a we never really talked about
bytes or bits we just do calculations
with you
numbers and that is not trivial with
computers the bigger the message you
want to encrypt the bigger your number
gets of course there are algorithms how
you implement those calculations on a
computer to make it efficient but still
it's a big difference so let's look at
how this RSA math looks like we won't
get into why it works but we look at all
the operations that are done to do RSA
so encryption works by taking the
message to the power of the key and then
mod a low end I think that's like high
school level math isn't it it's super
simple I mean it's kind of magical that
it works totally goes on my head why but
I don't care it's math somebody else
sends wide words I just know that it
works and decryption works very similar
you take the ciphertext the encrypted
text and take that to the power of the
other key and of course the magic lies
in the properties and the dependency of
those two keys the private and the
public key that it works but whatever so
it also means if you take the clear text
message to the power of the first key
which results to the encrypted text and
then the power of the second key you get
back the original message again
well modulo n just so I don't lose
anybody here modulo n is this clock
calculation what three o'clock perhaps
12 hours 15 o'clock well yeah in the
same country that Germany is but it's
just three o'clock again if you take
that whole thing modulo 12 modulo 12
means to restrict the numbers to only
what's available in that range and you
wrap around so even though that
exponentiation of the message will be
freaking a huge number if you take it
modulo this end it will be the smaller
message again so what exactly is the
public key let's have a look at the key
generation if you want to generate RSA
keys you first need to get two prime
numbers P and Q and they have to be
random then you calculate P times Q and
that becomes what we call the model of N
and n is part of the public key because
a person encrypting something needs to
know the N so
Enes public and it's just a product of
two numbers why can't you just figure
out those two random primes that seems
simple well turns out that it's
unbelievably hard we don't know how you
can figure out the prime factorization
of a number efficiently if we find a way
to do this easily RSA is dead so now you
got your public end next we want to get
the private key part there's some fancy
math involved how you get the private
key Dino but even though you don't know
exactly what they are doing here
they only use PQ N and E you know N and
it's a part of the public key and you do
know e because it is also part of the
public key maybe now you are confused
because we only get one number per
public key from that 10 list but that's
not a big issue usually the public key
exponent e is pretty constant there are
some typical numbers that are always
used and the reason why they didn't give
us here one is because it's a standard
one anyhow this means to generate the
private key D you need N and E which you
already know and P and Q which you don't
know so all you have to do to get the
private key is to factorize n into the
prime numbers P and Q and with them the
system Falls after that it's just doing
the calculations right so how could you
factorize n based on our current
knowledge of math there is no easy way
to do that but let's start simple if you
would know one of these numbers let's
say we know P we can just divide n by P
and we get Q that's easy but also it
doesn't have as much well here comes the
point where you actually have to think a
bit outside of the box because in an
ideal world P and Q must be random also
we only looked at one public key N and
came to the conclusion can't be broken
well if P or Q we have super small
primes
we could probably brute force it and get
lucky that certainly something you could
try but there's one thing we have more
public keys we
have only one if they were all perfectly
random we couldn't break them but what
if one of the primes is the same so two
Keys share the same P by coincidence or
because of a bad random generation the
thing is we know an efficient algorithm
to find the greatest common divisor GCD
of two numbers this algorithm is over
2,000 years old it's always blowing my
mind what kind of crazy stuff people
figured out a long time ago I wish I
were the smart you CLE didn't even have
the Internet I can't figure this out
today anyway
his algorithm can given two numbers
finds the greatest common divisor of
course only if they do have a common
divisor so if you have two numbers it
can find the value that can divide them
both see what I'm getting at if two
public Keys has one random prime number
in common then this prime number is the
common divisor so if one public key is a
times Q and the other one is P times Q
and they both share Q then Euclid's
algorithm will find Q so let's try this
we just have to implement this so we
loop over all keys which obviously have
to be converted to a number not a string
and we try to find a greatest common
divisor and print the result of GCD
obviously if the greatest common
divisors one then that's not the prime
but look here Garry and Bob have a
greatest common divisor and as you know
the divisor is already one of the primes
and we got everything we need now
because dividing the public key n by
this Q we get P so we now got n P and Q
only missing as a public exponent e but
that one as as I already told you some
typical values like 3 or 65,000 you may
have seen this before so we can just try
them all now we just have to perform the
math as described on Wikipedia D is a
modular multiplicative inverse of e
model of Phi n I just copy the model on
motive
to inverse function from the internet so
we can just do mud in from e and Phi N
and what is Phi n Phi n is just n minus
P plus Q minus 1 easy so I just use PI
crypto to do the RSA signing for me just
check the documentation how to use PI
crypto first we create a key object from
the values we now know and then we use
the pkcs1 version 1.5 class to sign our
message which is the sha-1 hash of admin
so we just run this we get the couple of
possible signatures or four different
E's and then we try them and there we go
the last one was the correct e our
signature is accepted and we get the
flag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
