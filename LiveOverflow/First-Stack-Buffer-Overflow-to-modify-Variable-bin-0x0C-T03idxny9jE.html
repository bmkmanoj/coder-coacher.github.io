the first level of protostar from
exploit exercise calm if you have
questions about the setup you can watch
the previous video generally I advise
you to stop the video right here and
work on it by yourself maybe give it a
day and see how much you can figure out
and after that watch my explanation but
if you feel completely lost then just
follow me this you should give you
enough information to solve the next
level on your own so let's first have a
look at the challenge description this
level introduces the concept that memory
can be accessed outside of its allocated
region how these tech variables are laid
out and that modifying outside of the
allocated memory can modify program
execution and this level is located at
up protostar binstock 0 okay next we
will have a look at the source code
which is provided below let's start with
the first quick overview this is clearly
a program written in Z it reads some
input with gets then check see modified
variables and prints either success or
fail message so obviously the goal of
this level is to make the program print
the success string know this level is
not about executing arbitrary code to
gain root privileges first we have to
understand a couple of basics a real
fool root exploit will come in later
levels so for now let's just focus on
smaller goal you can also execute this
Dec 0 program and we can see that it
seems to wait for some input and then
prints try again ok so let's have a more
detailed look at the code there are two
local variables an integer number
modified and a char array buffer with
space for 64 characters an array of
chars and c is basically just a string
then modified will be set to 0 and
apparently never changed again next as
he gets function with our 64 character
long char buffer let's have a look at
the gets main page so gets is used to
read the string from the input when we
scroll down we can also find a bug
section which is telling us to never use
gets this cannot be more clear that this
is the vulnerability in this program as
an explanation it
is that it's impossible to tell how many
characters gets will read it has been
used to break computer security and
after the gets called modified is
compared to zero if it not zero we have
one but how can modify it ever become
nonzero it's set to zero and never
changed by the way volatile is a way to
tell the compiler that it should not
optimize the usage of this variable
because at first glance it looks like
modified will always be zero and thus it
might simply remove the unnecessary if
case but it with volatile we can force a
compiler to keep it as it is I think we
have a good understanding of this
program now in C let's open it with gdb
and start debugging first let's set a
breakpoint in Maine with break main then
type 1 or short R to start the program
from the beginning now it's stopped at
the start of main with disassemble you
can disassemble the current function but
also set the disassembly flavor to Intel
because I like it more let's try to
understand fully what is happening here
Ike note those parts in the reverse
engineering introduction but here we
need the full understanding how the
stack works so let's start with the
first instruction push EBP a quick flash
back to my CPU introduction video I
mentioned that the stack is just a
memory area at the bottom and when we
look at the memory with info prop
mappings we can see that the stack goes
from BFF VB to Z 0 0 and because the
stack rose from the bottom it starts at
the highest address so C 0 but C 0
doesn't belong to it anymore so
basically these text starts at Z 0 minus
8 which is pfff 8 so push EBP EP is a
register which is used as the base
pointer and it contains an address
pointing somewhere into the stick ok so
whatever the meaning of this address is
it seems to be important because it gets
pushed on the stack which is like saving
the value at the end of the main
function you find a leaf and the
internal instruction reference tells us
that leaf is just basically move ESPE
and pop EBP as you can see the start and
end of the function at symmetrical at
the start we push EBP and move ESP into
EBP and when the function is done we do
the reverse don't worry I will
illustrate this nicely in a moment just
one more little thing
after those two instructions we mask ESP
which basically just sets the last four
bits to zero to keep it nicely aligned
not that important and then we get
subtract hex 60 from it so ESP the stack
pointer now points to a bit lower
address than EBP and the next
instruction moves 0 at the memory
location at offset hex 5c from the stack
pointer and that seems to be perfectly
match our modified variable that gets
set to 0 at first it's a lot to take in
but let's do it again but this time with
an animation so here on the left you can
see the assembler code and on the right
I will illustrate the stack with the
three important registers the
instruction pointer EAP the stack
pointer ESP and the base pointer EBP so
first it starts somewhere else with call
main call will push the theoretically
next instruction pointer on to the stack
and then jump to our main function as
you can see when the address of the next
instruction was pushed the stack pointer
got incremented and the address is
placed there so now comes our push EBP I
will illustrate with some arrows that
this file is a stack address which
points to another location on the stack
now we overwrite EBP with the value from
ESP move EBP ESP then we subtract hex 60
from ESP look at the stack now this area
between ESP and EEP is called a stack
frame this is now a small area of memory
that we can use for local variables and
calculations inside the main function
and do you notice where EBP is pointing
to it's pointing to the old EBP so this
area here is basically a stack frame of
the previous function which called me
and we know that we move 0 into ESP plus
hex 5c which we think is the modified
variable and it's true the local
variables all have their space in the
stack frame and it's so big because it
had to make space for at least 64
characters and the modified integer at
the end of this function we will now
perform a leaf which moves EBP into ESP
effectively destroying the previous
stack frame then we pop EBP which
restores the previous stack frame isn't
it amazing oh wait it gets cooler how do
we know now where to return to from main
well if you remember call push the
address of the instruction after the
call so the next value on the stack is
where you want to return to and the read
instruction is basically just popping
this address into the instruction
pointer and that's jumping back where we
came from computers huh
aren't they mind blowing so much smart
stuff in there now let's continue with
the assembler code after value on the
stack got set to 0 we will repair the
EAX register with an address from this
decade offset 1z leia or le a load
effective address is similar to move but
instead of moving the content often
register offset into a register it moves
the address of an register offset into a
register and this address then gets
placed on top of the stick this is
called calling convention the programs
and functions have to agree how to pass
function parameters in assembler in this
case the parameters are placed on the
stack and the gets function takes one
parameter which points to a character
buffer and the character buffer is on a
stick thus we have to pass it the
address where the character buffer
starts afterwards we read the value we
previously set to zero and with tests we
can check if it's zero or not and branch
off to print one of the messages so
let's remove the break comes from main
with del delete instead of breakpoint
before and after the gets before we
start I want to show you a cool trick we
will define a hook that will execute
some gdb commands when we stop at the
break
to do this type define hook stop
then info registers to show the register
and X 24 WX dollar ESP and X 2i dollar
EAP and finish with end this will now
print the registers these deck and the
next two instructions every time when we
hit a breakpoint now continue and enter
a couple of capital S do you see those
hex four ones those are all A's you have
entered now let's see the content of the
address we check if it's zero simply
examine ESP plus hex 5c still zero but
it shows us where it is located on a
stack and we look at our stick we see
that our aides are still a little bit
too far away so let's count how much we
need for our characters here then 4
times 4 that's 16 for a row and we have
three full rows and with the next full
row we can apparently right into those
zeros so run again enter that many
characters I like to use recognizable
patterns so I can clearly see which
letter which Row is it looks promising
so single step forward and it will load
the modified variable from the stack
into EAX and indeed those are the
characters that we entered let's try
this without gdb
we can use echo and our previous string
and pipe it into this tech zero program
cool it worked before the end let me
show you how we can make this input a
bit more convenient
thanks to Python with Python minus C we
can specify a comment that should be
executed then we can use print and
pythons cool string syntax which allows
us to repeat this character multiple
times with this knowledge you should be
able to solve stack one and stick to
it's pretty much the same task just some
different ways of input and a different
vulnerable function but if you invest
some time
you can absolutely solve it and I will
not make a video about those next video
will be about to take 3 this is when
things get start to get choose so see
you next time
