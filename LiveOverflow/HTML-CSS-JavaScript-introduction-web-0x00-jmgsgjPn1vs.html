security series like with the binary
exploitation stuff we have to start by
establishing some basics when I started
as a teenager with programming and web
development I did not quite understand
how this whole browser server TCP HTTP
headers cookies whatever work so try to
introduce those things slowly and move
more and more into security aspects I
will try and keep the series a little
bit more higher level but I certainly
will dig more into the low level
networking parts in the binary series at
some point okay let's get started
for now we will stay on our local
machine and won't make any connections
to a server we start with the displaying
of rendering websites part of the
browser so you already know that
browsers can render HTML files so let's
start by constructing a simple one the
first line is the doctype in previous
HTML versions this was more important
because it included important render
informations form different modes for
the browsers in the in the past but
nowadays mostly irrelevant then comes
the standard HTML skeleton HTML tag
including a head and a body oh and if it
wasn't clear hTML is hierarchical HTML
tag always opens and closes again on the
inside you can have more tags so you
should read HTML always in like the
pairs of tags and think of it in a
hierarchical order indentation helps
doing that let's add a heading with h1
and some text in a paragraph with P
let's also add an image with the IMG tag
and while we are on it a link to another
site there are a lot of different HTML
tags that provide different user
interface features some are for styling
text stuff like headers or images others
provide input elements for forms so
let's also add a form with a simple text
box and a submit button
generally the syntax for tags is like
this less than sign followed by the tag
name without space after that you can
have multiple key and value pairs
divided by spaces these are called the
attributes of an HTML tag the values
should be quoted but they don't have to
another small thing that is helpful for
certain attacks now we can open this
file in the browser the browser parses
now the HTML code and starts drawing the
elements to the screen when you do a
right-click somewhere you can select
inspect element which opens up the
chrome developer tools other modern
browsers have similar tools in the first
tab called elements you can see all the
HTML document elements it has this nice
hierarchical display where you can open
and collapse tags we can also go in
there and change the HTML this is
obviously just changing what the browser
currently displays and when you refresh
you obviously see the original file
again you are not modifying the actual
file on your hard drive depending on
your humor that might already be enough
to have fun by faking the content of a
website making a screenshot and post it
on Facebook claiming there was real
browsers are also very good at something
else HTML is kind of like a programming
language but when you write some weird
HTML code the page doesn't break like a
Python or C program what browsers are
very good at fixing crappy HTML code
rewrite fixing is maybe a strong word
let's let's say they are very liberal
and what they accept here you see some
examples we put the form inside of a
paragraph P tag which is a violation of
the standard but then the inspect view
you can see how the browser fixed it by
making a P tag before and after the form
other fixes include they don't care if
you forget to close your tags or they
don't complain if you use weird
characters in weird places
it doesn't complain about IDs that are
supposed to be unique being used
multiple times you can imagine that this
might add exploitation if you are able
to modify or generally inject
new HTML code in the HTML of a site you
can use this to get around certain
restrictions for example if you cannot
use slashes for some reason then simply
don't close the tag anyhow
besides HTML there are a few other very
common technologies used one is CSS CSS
is another type of language that allows
you to style the HTML page for example
changing colors you have multiple
options to do that you can give each
HTML element a style attribute you can
use a style tag or you can reference the
separate CSS file CSS syntax is super
easy you start with an identifier called
the selector so first you have to decide
which HTML tags you want to style you
can define styles for all text of a
certain kind or text with a certain
class using a dot before the class name
or only the tag with this ID using the
hash symbol
you can also combine these input class
name references all input elements that
have this class name or comma separate
if you want to give different selectors
the same style or hierarchical only
style this paragraph if inside of
something else instead of curly braces
you can define again key in values this
time semicolon separated there are many
different styling features such as text
colors funds margins headings and again
you can play with these things in the
browser developer tools just click on an
element and on the right you can make
changes it's awesome you can immediately
see the result really cool for learning
the third important technology is
JavaScript again you can write
JavaScript inside of attributes or use a
script tag or reference an external
javascript file javascript is a real
full-blown programming language allowing
you to define functions loops ifs and
all this kind of stuff a common example
and proof of JavaScript execution is to
use something like alert or prompt which
will trigger a small pop-up alert box so
we can for example define a useless
function that calls alert to have
JavaScript interact with HTML there are
two different major ways one are events
they can trigger JavaScript execution so
for example we can add an on-click event
handler on an HTML tag and if the user
clicks on the tag it will execute the
JavaScript function
the other one is accessing HTML from
JavaScript you can access the HTML
elements through an hierarchical object
model called the Dom JavaScript knows
objects like other programming languages
and the dumb is simply an object
representation of the HTML page so that
JavaScript can exit it nicely you can
use the developer tools again to play
with the JavaScript on the current side
so for example you can take the document
then its HTML body and its children then
access and change some text just that
there is no confusion all you do here is
in the browser opening a website in the
browser is like opening a picture in
Photoshop Photoshop renders this image
but also offers you tools to play with
that image and the browser also opens
and renders a file and provides you
tools to play with the display page now
currently this resource is loaded from
the local file system we can see that it
has the URL scheme file colon slash
slash followed by its path
usually websites are loaded from a
remote server via the HTTP protocol but
more about HTTP and in the next video if
you want to learn more about HTML CSS
JavaScript and generally web development
I highly recommend you sites like code
Academy getting into web development is
super easy now endless of resources
available and you can quickly see
results and create your own personal
website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
