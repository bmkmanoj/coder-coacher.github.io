where we will now finish the exploit
force tech level zero from protostar
which we have compiled on a modern
system in the first part we got a
general overview of what has changed
when the code is compiled with a modern
compiler and look more closely at the
stack cookie in a second part we then
ignored this deck cookie for now and
identified a few more exploitation
mitigations and developed a bypass for
them so only one thing is left finally
defeating the stack cookie
like we talked about in the first video
we can brute force a dead cookie if the
binary is a 32-bit binary there are
around 60 million possible values for
state cookies that's not that much but
16 million executions is maybe a number
where you start to want to optimize a
bit while I'm not an expert in super
fast shooting I decided I didn't want to
write up potentially slow Python script
I dried some C code and like I said I'm
not an expert and what is the fastest
way and I actually suspect that may be
the bottleneck here would not be a slow
script but the kernel which has to do a
lot of stuff to execute the program over
and over again so maybe it's unnecessary
to write a C code and maybe my C code is
very bad too but I just wanted to
mention it that it's not always easy to
decide what is the best approach now
that we said that let's try to approach
this step-by-step first how do you
execute a program in C well there is a
system call for it called x''k but
usually we never cause us cause
ourselves directly but use repla
functions provided by something like Lib
C so let's see offers a few different
versions of X X but they ultimately all
use the same x-axis call underneath it
says here in the main page the X X Emily
of functions replace the current process
image with a new process image I think
when you never thought about how our
programs executed before the sounds
really weird
why do you replace the current process
and not just execute it
that's a weird well that's just how it
works that's the execution model of
Linux and so in our case we don't just
want to exit and let's replace our
program but we want to execute this tech
0 binary as a new process over and over
again to spawn a new process we have to
fork the process before we exit fork
creates a new process by duplicating the
calling process this new process is
referred to as the child process the
calling process is referred to as the
parent process and may be also
interesting it down here difference
between C library function and the
actual kernel since version 2.3 3 rather
than invoking the kernels fork system
called the Lib C for grapa in
Vogue's clone with flags that provide
the same effect as you traditional
system call so what do you do to execute
the process over and over is to first
fork our current process now we have a
child an actual new separate process and
you have to imagine this code is now
duplicated we have two processes running
the same code just one runs as a child
and one runs as a parent you can check
the return value of the fork which
process you are in the parent process
you get the PID of the child and then a
child is just zero and in the child
process we can call X egg to replace the
current process with stick zero now in
our case we want to communicate with the
child meaning we want to write the
exploit input to it and read the output
of it to determine if we were successful
usually you will do this by creating
pipes pipe creates a pipe a
unidirectional data channel that can be
used for inter process communication the
arab pipe 50 is used to return to file
descriptors referring to the ends of the
pipe privacy zero refers to the read end
of the pipe and privacy 1 refers to the
right end of the pipe data written to
the right end of the pipe is buffered by
the kernel until it's read from the read
end of the pipe basically the same pad
you can use on the command line you pipe
a CD out from one program cut into the
sed end of another program grep that's
why we call this character a pipe so for
basic STD nsv out communication you will
create tool pipes and then when you fork
because you clone the process the child
and the parent have access to the same
pipe now obviously depending on if you
are the parent or child you use one or
the other side of it and in the case of
the child we are actually going to
replace the default standard in and
standard out now with those pipes by
calling depth to the adapt to system
call performs the same tasks as dub and
the dub system call creates a copy of
the file descriptor
after a successful return the old and
the new file descriptor may be used
interchangeably they refer to the same
open file the script and the share
everything but that two instead of you
the lowest number unused for file
descriptor a stop it uses the descriptor
number specified in new FD the second
parameter if the descriptor new FD was
previously open it suddenly closes
before it's being reused so devtool
closes the current STD in and STD out of
the child and plugs in the new pipe we
created and when we exit this take zero
and replace the current process with a
new one stuff like open file descriptors
stay intact so the new process will use
the pipes we just connected to for
reading input and writing output and
then in the parent we can simply read
and write to the end of the pipe and
thus communicate with the child
processed x0 a nice thing to do is to
close the ends of the pipes you are not
using in either process so for example
we don't need the reading side of the
STD in pipe because we want to write
send data to the chat process okay once
we have written our buffer overflow
input we can wait for the child process
to finish and read the output to see if
we were successful now here's the first
big issue
buffering Lipsy will buffer output
you're right so the output of the child
process is buffered in the process and
you can imagine that if we do a buffer
overflow screw with the SEC and get a
sec fault
this buffer is lost the program is just
dying horribly but maybe you think that
doesn't make much sense because we
showed in part 2 that our exploit
theoretically works and we see the
output on the shelf
we saw the modified variable message so
how does it make sense that the shell
would see the output but I'm telling you
now we won't see it with the code we
have just written well there's a
difference to how let's see buffers
output depending on what kind of pipe is
connected to and in our case we've just
used regular pipes and let's see well
buffer the output data until the process
called slash or maybe until it's filled
nicely maybe after 1024 bytes or so I
don't know but we have neither the
output is super short and the chat
process never calls flush so what's the
difference on the shell well programs
executed by the shell are not connected
via regular pipes but are connected to a
pseudo terminal PTY
and we're let's see sees that the output
is written to a PT Y to the terminal
then it will flush the buffer upon a new
line because new lines are like the
automotive indication that you want to
print a new line on the terminal output
I think it's like a speed thing you
don't want to flash if it's not
necessary but on the terminal you want
to see output after new line this means
we could also execute the exira program
in the context of a PT y so that we fool
let's see into flashing on every new
line and there is a convenient Lib C
function that does that for us called
fork PT y the fork PT y function
combines open PT y open up to your
terminal fork which we already know and
the login TTY calls to create a new
process operating in absolute terminal
the file script of the master side of
the two terminal is returned in a master
so that's really cool we fork a child
process and already get the file
descriptor so we can communicate with
the child process then I disabled a few
options of the terminal for example I
don't want to echo the input again for
example if you watch my email at
hardware security CTF videos you notice
that usually whenever typed something on
the shell to the board I don't see
characters at type that's because I
didn't configure the terminal to echo
back the characters where it would have
been nice there I don't need it here and
there are a few other options that could
screw with what we want to do then we
also don't have to fiddle with pipes so
the child was just exact now in the
parent we define our buffer overflow
input it's basically the one we
developed last video then also add some
random function to get three random
bytes for the cookie and place those
into the buffer overflow string a simple
actually loop to avoid new lines because
they will indicate the end of our input
and we don't want that then we write the
buffer overflow string to the master
file descriptor of ops to the terminal
and stick 0 will read it and we'll get
exploded then I create a short loop to
check the status of the child but I
don't want to block and wait for it
because the child could horribly die or
not die because of the buffer overflow
so I just check the status a few times
in a loop and
if the child was dead we can continue if
we waited already a few times we decide
to kill the child process and otherwise
we sleep a bit usually it shouldn't look
much as the child program is very short
but it's a safety net by the way program
IDs peds are prone to raise conditions
in Linux you see we don't have some kind
of handle directly pointing to the child
process we only have a number numbers
can be reused so theoretically our child
could have died in another process like
webserver could have been executed and
assigned our old PID and then we kill it
here and there is no better way in
general so it's just really accurately
sometimes anyway one other thing I want
to add now is a signal handler which
will be notified if the child dies or so
we could just read the output after wait
but we don't know why and how the child
might die and so forth and I also found
it to be 1/3 slower if I do that so use
the signal handler instead the signal
function is called to notify us if
anything happens to the child so when it
receives a sick child and in the handler
function we then read from the terminal
the output of stick 0 first we read the
try again message and then potentially
read this text measuring detected error
or maybe the successful modified
variable message or maybe nothing then I
do an ugly check of the second output to
see if the success measures is there if
that's the case we print it and we are
done so now it's basically ready I add
some more debugging output to see what's
going on add arguments to supply a
random seed and then we can compile it
because we want to use for PTY we have
to also link the utah's library here you
can see how many executions we get per
second per process this machine has only
one CPU so this will take a while let's
come back later let's see hmm nothing
happened yet maybe let's rent a bigger
server for a few hours with more CPU
cores maybe this one
Oh what only nine executions per second
what kind of crap is that if you look at
the processes you can see something
called a port a port is a system which
intercepts crashes right when they
happen the first time gathers potential
useful information about the crash and
the OS environment so because you
constantly crash a process this thing is
gathering information slowing everything
down let's disable the service to run it
I do some ghetto parallelization and
then let's wait it for a bit oh yeah see
one process output the modified variable
message how amazing is that I admit not
the most reliable exploit but it worked
so I'm happy if you have a better
exploit strategy for this year please
share with us and really curious what
other techniques could be used to
exploit this program in a more reliable
way thanks guys see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
