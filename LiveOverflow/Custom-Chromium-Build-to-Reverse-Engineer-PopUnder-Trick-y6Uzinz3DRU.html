chrome user I'm happy that Google agrees
with me they consider them to be bugs in
their pop-up blocker I made a few videos
a few months back where we have
reverse-engineered one particular
obfuscated javascript library used and
sold to advertisers in order to figure
out the trick they use and then reported
it to Google to get the bugs fixed back
then it has also motivated Masato
Kanagawa to research a few more
techniques and overall we killed quite a
few bugs that allowed pub owners and I
think we were quite successful for a
long time the pub under library did not
have a working pub under technique for
Chrome and had to resort to a tab under
which was awesome for a while we were
the reason why a lot of advertisers that
used the script couldn't create terrible
pub under ads on Chrome but now I was
made aware by silent hammer on the
subreddit that the pub under Jay s
library has been updated and ships now
with a working pub under for the current
chrome version 65 up to the current
development version 68 and indeed the
demo works there is a pub under let's
figure out how it's done and then
reported as well
the first few steps that I'm doing now
are the same like I did in previous
videos I essentially want a local mirror
off the script so I can modify them and
play around with it so I use the chrome
developer tools to get all the script
files loaded by the site and save them
and because of the licensing and this
being the demo and I don't know how the
license check works it might check the
hostname I do not only download all the
files but I also changed the ECC host
file so that the domain points to
localhost then I use PHP to launch a
local web server and serve the files
with the same folder structure as the
server now I have all the files locally
and can change them however I want for
example I can clean them up and beautify
the script the files are loaded locally
now and a quick test yep there pop-under
still works okay so let's have a first
look the JavaScript code is clearly
still obfuscated so nothing we really
want to work through statically and
trying to look at the script dynamically
with the chrome developer tools is also
still super annoying because the script
constantly traps the debugger with the
debugger keyword we can disable the
debugger and still run it but then we
can't set any breakpoints if we do want
to pause going up in the caustic we can
see where this debugger call is coming
from and it's coming from this function
a and there we can see that a is always
repeatedly called with said time odd so
we can try to override the set timeout
with our own function which also logs
some information about the call this
hopefully disables the debugger traps
when we now reload the page it looks
really good we don't break but we also
don't see anything in the console but
that's because the code constantly
clears the console luckily the developer
tools also are cool and just tell us the
line where this clear is called so we
can go there set a breakpoint by
clicking the line number and boom the
debugger breaks here now we can analyze
the code capital I is the window object
there KN variable is the string console
and HN is the string clear so this
simply calls window console
we can also find the sign in our script
and can just comment it out now when we
reload the page we see exactly the
outputs and as you can see stuff tried
to call said time odd however also the
pop-under is not working anymore
so I guess it's just I wrote it and it
didn't help us let's revert it back
another thing we used was the
performance tab this one can be used to
record every JavaScript function call so
we can hit record trigger the pop-under
and hit stop again now it takes a moment
to gather everything and here we have it
this is the timeline and all of these
colorful bars are function calls so here
is clearly our start this is the
mousedown event later in here we also
see an on before open which is actually
a call into the demo j/s so this is a
library sold for advertisers and so the
library creator offers here
functionality that you can run code just
before and after the pop-under was
opened this means I'll pop under
creation should happen after this one
here interestingly the whole function
graph stops here now not everything
happens down in the hierarchy from the
moss down event there's a weird function
called later which at some point results
in open the orange functions are
generally regular JavaScript stuff like
events and all the JavaScript functions
and the pink ones are custom ones so
these are the obfuscated functions as
you can see from the name and actually
there are two of these blocks starting
from a weird arbitrary function call
which results in open and open is the
function to create a new pop-up or tab
so it does it twice I have actually no
clue what triggers this initial function
if it would have been directly called
from the most own event it would be part
of that block so that's weird but
looking at this I don't see anything
special there are no cause to create new
HTML elements nothing external is loaded
it's just these open calls that's super
weird we can also look at from where the
open is called by looking here at the
caustic and following that link so this
apparently cause open and these should
be the parameters of open let's search
for the snippet in the scripture as far
we have and then add some console.log
output
to print the parameters pass to open we
save the new script reload the page
trigger pop under and look at the
console so we see two opens both have
the first parameter about blank and the
second one underscore blank with a look
into the API reference for open we see
that this is the URL and this is the
name but the first open has additional
optional window features it defines with
hide and stuff like that
the second open didn't have that ok
nothing too special here either while
playing around I also noticed that the
anti debugger trapping is not that
aggressive so we can actually add our
own debugger statement here at the open
call reload the page disable the
breakpoints and then prepared to be
super fast because we can very quickly
reactivate the breakpoints quickly
switch to the browser window hope that
the anti debugging traps don't trigger
first click somewhere to create a pop
under and hope that our break point at
the openness hit and there worked here
we are now we can see the state of the
variables which we already know we can
also see their caustic and have a look
at where this call is coming from notice
how it says here post message acent that
will explain a lot later but when I
looked at it the first time I was just a
bit confused and looking at this
function here we see a variable I which
is a message event object with a data
attribute containing our window open
parameters hmm at this point I got a bit
frustrated if you have watched the
previous videos you know what kind of
crazy techniques were used to pull off a
pop under I didn't fully trust the
developer tools to be honest because
maybe they are tricks to hide stuff from
it I was expecting something really
really crazy and I decided to get out
the big guns
I wanted to directly look at the native
functions being called from JavaScript
so nobody can hide anything I went to
the chromium sources and followed the
checking out and building chromium for
MEC instructions if you want to follow
along and build chrome as well make sure
you have enough disk space not only did
it take me overnight to build it in the
end I also needed almost 80 gigabytes
disk space
for it so be warned but that's not too
bad because with minimal changes you
don't have to rebuild the whole thing
again it only has to rebuild the part
you modified so that's cool I also have
to give my kudos to the build team or
whoever's responsible for this these
instructions just worked
I had no issue at all it just worked
which I did not expect anyway so I want
to log important JavaScript function
calls for example the open call but also
things like create element or any other
API call all these calls somehow have to
be executed by the underlying browser so
you can't fake or hide anything in the
end these native functions have to be
called it's the first time for me
looking at these sources so I have no
clue what I'm doing but let's maybe
think about this for a second maybe you
have heard of v8 chrome uses the v8
JavaScript engine and there is a
subdirectory for the v8 engine with the
sources so maybe this is a good point to
start well maybe but probably not
v8 is just JavaScript we are not really
interested in logging when something
creates an area or so we want the api's
that glue together the browser and the
JavaScript and that is mostly the Dom
the document object model is what we can
use from JavaScript to interact with the
browser and the HTML
however chrome also has a lot of other
IP is like the notification to request
permissions and these are probably not
included in the Dom but we deal with
that when we need to let's start with
something easy and look for the document
create element function in previous pub
under videos that was a crucial part in
the trick so it would be awesome to log
that and so the dumb is most likely part
of the actual browser engine and in case
of chrome that would be blink I looked
around in the huge codebase for a bit
and then I found it chromium source
third-party blink renderer core Dom so I
open that folder and sublime and then
let's start searching for great element
oh we find something in a dot age header
file let's actually restrict to only C++
source code files so here we go we find
some functions in document dot c c which
i think is awesome because the
javascript function
would be document create element so here
we definitely find a lot of important
api's so great element here we go
entry point of create an element that
sounds perfect so I guess this is the
native C++ function being called when
you call document create element
JavaScript let's test it let's add a
simple recognizable printf here just so
we know if this is being executed then
we rebuild Chrome and as you can see it
goes pretty fast not only had to build
the change we made and then let's
execute our own chromium build I also
wrote the short test create script that
will call create element whenever we
click the link here but it doesn't seem
to work
damn no output it also links here the
specification of the HTML living
standard that defines these kind of
things and it says here concept create
element so not really sure what that
means but when I searched a bit more in
the document dot c c source code i found
the great element for binding function
which links to the Dom document create
element specification ok this one
actually sounds like the correct
function so let's add a printf here then
we compile chromium again open the test
page and we click the button and awesome
our printf works now we have all the
power to log every function we want it
might just be a bit tedious to add these
printers everywhere I played around with
it a bit more and it printf two
different kind of functions like get
elements by tag name and stuff like that
but it didn't reveal anything new it
just didn't seem to do anything weird at
this point I decided to sit down and
start to implement what I already know I
know a hundred percent that there are
two open calls and we know their
parameters we also know that it somehow
is all triggered from unmask down event
so let's do that as well and then we try
that it opens a pop-up but as expected
it only opens one the second open call
is blocked by the pop-up blocker the
browser allows one user in tection the
click to Oh
one window because if the user clicked
then one window is fine but not a second
one however let's just for testing
disable the pop-up blocker and allow
this page to create any pop-ups at once
when we now try it again
the second open call actually creates a
new tab and the tab gains focus see the
pop-up at this point is in the
background let's add a set timer to our
script to close a new tab after one
second again and try that we click on
the link it opens the pop-up and tab the
main window rains focus and then the tab
is closed when the timeout hits boom we
have a successful pop Unruh holy crap
this was damn simple as long as we can
open two windows one pop-up and one tab
we can get focus back to the main window
but with activated popup blocker which
is the default this doesn't work so the
creator of this pop under script
actually found the technique to bypass
the pop-up blocker and open multiple
windows and this is where the post
message comes into play from earlier
while looking around a bit more
looking at call stacks and stuff at some
point is stumbled over it again and it
clicked wait post message and here's the
message data may be the reason why the
two open calls were shown in their own
function book is because they were on
message events triggered from an a
synchronous post message that totally
makes sense
why didn't I understand that earlier so
I quickly implemented this I create an
unmask agenda which looks at the data
and either creates a new pop-up for data
one or a new tab which is also closed
again with two and then I simply trigger
a post message with one and two in the
pop under function this should create
both the pop-up and the tab let's try
that in the browser
clicking the link it creates both
amazing we bypass the pop-up blocker
this also means we can spam pop-ups no
if we just keep sending post messages in
a loop look here
so now we are done here I have reported
this issue to chromium and hopefully it
gets fixed soon
