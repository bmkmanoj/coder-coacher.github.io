challenge to evil from the Tom CTF 2016
by creating a dynamic analysis script
with radar before I knew I would write a
script for a diary I had to figure out
what the binary is doing so after I
downloaded the binary and check that
it's a 64-bit Linux binary I made sure
my vagrant Linux VM is running and
opened the binary for first analysis in
binary ninja let's head to main and
start reversing so first we have a
printf that is asking for the input key
the valid input key is probably also all
flag the eff flash just make sure that
the output is displayed and not held in
a buffer after that we have an F gets
which means that the input key string is
red the RDI register is commonly used as
the destination for this memory with the
flag symbol name is probably where our
input key is stored finally we can also
see that it's not just zeros but already
initialized with some fake flags then we
see an M map which is directly followed
by a mem copy which means that the
program wants a new memory segment for
something and copies some data to the
new segment because we have a reversing
challenge it's not unlikely that it
might have some self-modifying code that
uses this new memory it looks like it is
copying shc which probably stands for
shellcode to this new address which is
in register R 14 now when you look at
shc you can see this chunk of pretty
random looking data and it's also pretty
long hmm after it copied this long
memory to the new MF memory segment it
will perform a call to R 14 and our 14
contains the address of the new memory
segment so it will jump to this code
this means that shc contains actually
some assembler code so we can go there
and press P to tell binary ninja it
should make this an assembler procedure
so to grab you to make it easier to
understand the flow the first meaningful
instruction here is the move from our BX
to our ax and if you paid attention to
the move before the call to
r14 you know that RBX contains the
address to our input key this means that
our ax points to that address and it
will get the first bite of it in al then
it will perform a binary and with hex
four zero let's have a look at four zero
in binary you can see it has only one
bit set so if our input character has
this bit said the result will be non
zero
thus the je jump equal which is the same
as jump if zero will not jump and
continue over here if the input
character would not have this bit set it
will jump to the left and perform to a
Siskel's of right and then an exit so
this is not where we want to go this
means the first character has to have
this bit set to 1 in this branch we
immediately notice a loop which contains
an XOR inside of this loop memory at the
location of RSI is ex-ored with whatever
is in ax then the address is incremented
and we repeat the whole thing after that
we jump somewhere the jump target here
looks a little bit meaningless but
that's probably because it's not real
code yet this loop seems to decrypt the
next layer of exemplar and then jumps
there layer get it it's legal is German
for onion so looks like we removed the
outer layer of the onion we could now
use the XOR key and decrypt the code and
proceed but at this point I decide that
I want to see it executing so I copy the
binary to the shared folder so I can
access the executable in the Linux VM
then I connect to the Linux system with
SSH and execute it so we get the input
key prompt and decide smiley for failing
the key check now let's open it with gdb
but if we run it in gdb it immediately
gives us a set smiley without even
asking for the key what's going on when
we execute it with esterase we get a bit
more information if we look closely we
can see a failed pea trays in there this
looks like a typical anti debugging
trick houses an anti debugging trick see
when GDP is debugging another process
Oreste race
collecting a syscall trace they both use
the Petrus syscall to observe and
control the execution of another process
but if the process is already traced by
something the kernel will return an
error on calling Petrus so the binary
execute speed race basically trying to
debug itself and if that such call fails
it knows that it's being debug by
something and it will commit suicide
this is usually easy to defeat so let's
look for this in binary ninja we notice
here on the left that indeed the binary
uses P trace if we follow the
cross-reference we find this function
here using it which has two options one
kills itself the other just returns so
we can just knock this code here so it
will always return and we should have
defeated this anti debugging trick this
is very easy with binary ninja and we
can simply save the modified binary and
call it three volt two
when we now run it in gdb we will get
the key input prompt and it seems to
work well great now we can continue with
what we wanted to do let's set a
breakpoint before we follow the call to
our 14 so we can observe the decryption
now we can step single instructions
forward awesome here to move to Al we
can see that it references the flag
which is our input AAA and we can see
the end happening because character
capital a is hex for 1 the binary end
result will be nonzero and we continue
to the decryption loop if you look
closely at where the jump afterwards
would go you see that when we execute
the X or decryption the code is changing
so it really is decrypting the next
layer let's set a breakpoint after the
decryption loop before we jump into the
new code and continue then we hit that
break point and we can single step
forward and look at the new decrypted
code huh that looks interesting look at
that it again loads the flag into our ax
but instead of loading the first
character into al it loads the character
at offset hex one d then it again
performs a binary and operation this
time with two two in binary also has
only one bit set so this is also a check
if a certain character has a certain bit
set and following this check we see
another XOR decrypt loop basically the
same thing like before so we can set
another break point after loop and see
how that decrypt code looks like and
what a surprise basically the same thing
over again another character is taken
checked if a certain bit is set and then
continues with another decrypt loop we
slowly peel that onion layer by layer
and we get an idea what it is doing so
let's back off for a second and recap
the code performs the same actions over
and over again it will first check a
certain character if a bit is set if
that bit is set it will decrypt the next
layer in that new decrypted layer it
checks another character spit and
decrypt the next layer and so on
based on the two layers we have already
seen we know that the first character
has to have bit six set to 1 and
character 29 hex 1d has to have the bit
one set we can imagine now that this
will go on for quite a while and slowly
tells us all the bits it checks so if we
collect all those rules we can recover
an input that passes all those checks
now we have to think about how we could
do that there are multiple options and
I've thought about what could be the
fastest during the CTF but it kind of
depends what you know if you are good
with binary ninja plugins you could
build a static analysis tool that
decrypts everything and then you simply
extract the disassembled code but it
won't have that experience yet so I
chose red arrow tool because returner 2
is super simple to script with Python
and our tool pipe so the plan is to
debug the binary with rod RA like we did
with gdb and then always extract the bit
rule find the jump address after the
decrypt loop let it decrypt and continue
to the next rule to get this started
make sure we're adder is up-to-date
always run seuss installed on sh it
takes a while but radar is heavily
developed that if you have any issue
don't bother asking people if you are
not on the latest commit after that you
can install our two pipe for Python with
pip install our two pipe now you can
import our two pipe in Python and use it
like you would use radar in the next
video we will create the script that
will extract all rules and recover the
flag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
