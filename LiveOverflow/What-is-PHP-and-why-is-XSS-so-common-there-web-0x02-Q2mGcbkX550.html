at static HTML and how the HTTP protocol
is used to get files from a web server
in this video we will introduce the
programming language PHP which can be
used to create dynamic websites at the
end of last video I did a Google search
for our PHP tutorials and got very angry
so here is why when I started
programming and I wanted to learn about
PHP I started googling I look for
tutorials like this one and it looks
very trustworthy but this is one like so
many other PHP tutorials that are
responsible for so many unsecure PHP
websites and bad PHP developers I show
you why let's take this example code and
copy it into a new file called for get
PHP let's have a quick look at this file
so then here we have some HTML code that
we already know we have a form tag with
some input elements presumably to enter
your name and your age the method of
this form is get we will see later what
that means but at the top we have this
weird opening question mark PHP tag
which closes down here with another
question mark and inside we have stuff
that doesn't look like HTML well this is
the PHP code so PHP code can be mixed in
with HTML let's see how this effects
sites loaded from the web server we use
our PHP simple web server with PHP - s
again and if we now visit the site form
get PHP we can see the form with the to
input text elements now let's have a
look at the HTML source code right click
view page source this is the raw HTML
code the browser received from the
server when it requested this file ok
there is our HTML code but where is that
PHP stuff from before our HTML code well
when we requested this file the PHP
program read the
and check for embedded PHP code and this
embedded PHP code is never part of the
response it always gets removed but PHP
could modify the response as well like
here with those echoes but it found this
if statement and either name or age has
to be set so that it can reach those
echoes thus it's doing nothing now open
the developer console with the network
tab again and when we enter something in
this form and press submit we see the
page load again if we look at the file
name as well as your browser URL bar we
can see that it now appended a question
mark with some stuff to it this again is
part of how urls are structured after
the domain or address we have the path
to a file but if we reach a question
mark at some point then the file name is
complete and another part of the URL is
starting these so called get variables
so get variables are always part of the
URL and you can see that they are key
value pairs name is live overflow and
age is 12 and they are separated by an
EM person so even though we are loading
the same file form get Dutch PHP the
response is completely different no text
boxes anymore even if we look at the
source code there is no HTML left so in
the original PHP file we can see now
that this time the PHP block is more
interesting the first line of code is
checking if there is a get variable name
or a get variable age which is true we
have those now in the URL and if that's
the case then we echo the string welcome
which we append the get variable name
too in PHP you concatenate or append the
string with dots after the name comes
the BR tag which is the new line in HTML
the next line of echo prints you are
followed by the get variable age and
appends years all to that which is
exactly what we are seeing now in the
response and the reason why we don't see
HTML after this PHP block is because
inside of this
an exit call which basically means stop
PHP execution right here that's never
reaching the HTML down there so this PHP
code ran and echoed those variables we
often refer to this behavior as
reflected because like a mirror it will
return what we threw at it so in this
case we threw live overflow in the
number 12 at the web server and the web
server responded with exactly those
strings
now why is this code so shitty well who
prevents us from injecting HTML tags
let's start slow let's enter a B tag
which should print some text bold and
when we submit the form it works now you
could argue there is no harm in printing
something bold that is a nice feature
for customization for the users of this
website right well consider this you can
now inject all HTML you want which means
I can completely fake content off the
site oh by the way you can write your
strings directly into the URL no need to
go through the form every time that's
just how get parameters work so I can
inject a fake news article and I could
take this URL and send it to unaware
non-technical users and when they see
their trusted website asking them to
donate they might do it it's not even on
a fake domain like many phishing emails
it's on the real domain using this
injection to fake content this makes it
very trustworthy and efficient for
phishing attacks now this is already
cool but could you also inject
JavaScript you know JavaScript can also
manipulate the HTML but could also do
much more than that you can easily show
what JavaScript can do if you simulate
this attack for example in Reddit let's
say you theoretically found a way to
execute JavaScript with a special
crafted URL like on all shitty PHP
example before just make it clear reddit
is not vulnerable to this this is just
simulating what could happen so open the
developer tools and then the JavaScript
console because here you can write
JavaScript as if you were executing that
JavaScript on this side so I could write
a line of code which uploads the first
story on here by simulating a click on
an upload and if I check my uploads I
apparently uploaded this weird threat
here now imagine I had a URL that could
execute this line and I bought my post
now I spam a lot of users with it they
click on it and upload it without them
knowing and theoretically I could also
write code that sends no private
messages to random other
containing this evil URL thus creating a
JavaScript worm so I hope this makes it
clear that JavaScript execution
controlled by an attacker is really
really bad now the question is can we
inject JavaScript on our example PHP
code let's try to inject a script tag
that executes alert because alert would
trigger a pop-up which would be a nice
way to prove that we can execute
JavaScript so let's enter this as a name
and let's see what happens
no pop-up but the console threw an
exception the XSS auditor refused to
execute a script in bla bla its source
code was found within the request this
is the XSS auditor from chrome who tries
to prevent so-called cross-site
scripting short XSS attacks which means
injecting a script into a web page so
apparently we can execute JavaScript
because chrome prevents it if you check
the source code of the page you can also
see the violating script part
highlighted in red and that's why chrome
said and found this JavaScript source
code this alert in the request in fact
it was here in the URL as a get
parameter so damn our tech failed looks
like this page is safe after all I guess
not so shitty PHP well this is just half
of the story in this case it's actually
super easy to bypass the XSS auditor to
get your JavaScript executed but you
will have to figure it out yourself and
wait for the next video but before we
finish this video let's quickly talk
about how to fix this properly the key
word here is escaping we have to escape
user supplied input before we echo or
reflect it into the page in this case
our output from echo would be in the
context of HTML I specifically mention
this because output could also be placed
inside of an HTML attribute or inside of
a script tag those are all different
contexts that come with their own
challenges but in this case it's the
most basic example just echo into the
HTML code
the PHP function for that is HTML
special chars if we use that around our
get variables before we echo it then we
can't inject HTML or script tags anymore
if you try that with the form you will
see it will now display the greater than
and lower than sign instead and the
reason for that is if you look into the
HTML source code we can see that the
greater and lower than sign character
got replaced with an % GT for greater
than and semicolon this is now special
HTML code that is obviously not a tag
anymore and will be rendered as a
greater than sign when the page is
displayed to us this is making our
output completely safe or does it this
is mostly true
and I don't want to make it sound like
this can be easily bypassed
but there are some edge cases where this
might not be true anymore
so keep a lookout for a short slightly
more advanced series on angularjs
sandbox escape that will be released
soon and parallel to this web series
