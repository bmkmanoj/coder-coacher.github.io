videos so I want to take you along the
process of creating one of my episodes I
know that some parts could be more
efficient if I would know better tools
so while I obviously would like to show
you how I create videos I'm also looking
forward to get some tips and tricks how
to do things differently and maybe
become more efficient or create more
beautiful videos the video creation
process can be divided in three big
steps write the script record screen
footage fix mistakes in the script and
because the audio and finally as a last
step edit the whole video and draw all
the graphics okay
first step is researching and writing
the script usually I start by opening up
a Google Docs and start writing and then
I get into a research triad writed loop
in this case I make the second episode
about the DL malach heap unlink exploit
which is heavily based on frac issue
number 57 article once upon a free &amp;amp;
budo malach tricks in the last video we
developed our own exploit for unlink
which won't work because of no bites so
I thought as a narrative for this video
it would be cool to just explore what
the researchers back then discovered and
expose my audience to the true heroes
from hacking history so I reread what
they were writing back then and tried to
think about how I could / send it in a
in a video the next key lesson from this
video will be about setting the size of
the heap chunk to a value that doesn't
contain null bytes which seems huge at
first but you can abuse the fact how
negative numbers work while writing the
script I always read it out loud to see
how it flows and then make changes to it
at this point I may also fire up
exploited exercises protostar vm and try
it out just to make sure I get it right
usually I will catch some mistakes in my
script now and modify it once I'm
confident I got everything working I
make notes of the commands I am going to
use and put them on a second monitor for
this particular video this first part of
researching writing the script and
trying it out took me roughly three
hours
next step is recording the exploit
development to record my screen
i use obs and a low frame rate because
high frame rates are not really
necessary and makes the files smaller so
easier to work with in store for this
particular video there will be quite a
big chunk just explaining stuff with
figures so the practical part that I
have to record is not too long and with
my notes in the script it should be done
quickly if I make mistakes during
recording I either decide to incorporate
them into the script because I like to
have them as a learning opportunity I
redo a segment during recording I
realized that I should change some of
the text so I refine the script again
now I open up my little template that
has the intro and outro in it and record
the audio of the script this whole part
of recording the video screen footage
and the audio with refining the script
took in this case maybe one hour the
practical part was not too long next up
is editing stuff with all the graphics
that's the most tedious part after my
first couple of videos I really wanted
to add more visuals an arrow or a box
around something important goes a long
way in my opinion you find some older
videos of mine where I try to do this
with editing directly in Sony Vegas but
that was super slow and looked crap I
have not that much experience with video
editing so the only thing I knew I could
do easily would be get a graphics tablet
and draw them by hand this process is
simple I can take a screenshot of the
current scene and Beggar's paste it into
Photoshop draw the overlay on on a new
layer safe only that layer and put it
into the video timeline this is what I
do with any graphic it's fairly quick
and I kind of like the resulting art
style after the editing which in this
case took about four hours I render the
video and uploaded so crane this one
episode took about eight hours sprinkle
some procrastination in there and I will
be busy the whole day
