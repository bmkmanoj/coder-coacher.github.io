find videos about computer internals
with a focus on hacking and security
concepts I also record myself solving
hacking challenges it might be a bit
boring to watch but if you always
wondered how other people work and think
it might be interesting for you now let
me tell you a short story about why I'm
doing this year I was too young in the
90s and didn't exist in the 80s to be
part of the seemingly golden age of the
hacker culture when I was a teenager I
loved taking apart electronics and
looking at the green circuit boards
wondering with what kind of magic it is
imbued with once my dad brought home all
first computers and we got access to the
Internet
I found myself being fascinated with
hacking and wanted to learn more about
it but all I found was crap people
trying to sell old information or fake
products so never got into hacking until
much later I started programming and
Visual Basic I made my first website
with HTML eventually I moved on to PHP
and other programming languages some
years passed and I moved out to another
city to go to university one day I was
sitting in front of my computer coming
across this hacking game by stripe a CTF
where one level was to exploit a buffer
overflow I knew what his leg was and I
was able to read simple assembler code
from University classes but not until I
saw the shell popping up my mind being
blown and struck in awe I realized I was
at a position in life where I can pursue
a dream I had as a kid and I still wear
the t-shirt I got from the stripe CTF
with pride at the same time I had the
opportunity to join a hacker space where
I met so many intelligent people and I
went down a rabbit hole not many years
have passed since then and I still feel
I've only explored a tiny fraction of
what is out there the content I'm
creating here is an attempt to give
anybody who wants to understand the
of better nabek unity to start somewhere
I want to give to others what I wish I
had found when I was a teenager sitting
in a basement typing into Google how to
hack at the same time I see more and
more people making tutorials on how to
use certain hacking tools
rather than explaining the underlying
concepts I understand that it looks cool
and that you can feel very powerful but
there is more to hacking than that
understanding concepts understanding how
your phone and laptop to stuff
understanding on a technical level how
you are able to watch this video right
now that is amazing there's so much
awesome stuff to discover and break so I
invite you to join me on this adventure
and hack the planet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
