are not really security related but they
are great to do some first simple
network programming and just for the
sake of having a complete series from
exploit exercises we will solve these
challenges too
the previous two videos were already a
good introduction to networking sockets
TCP and so let's build on this
foundation by writing a Python script to
interact with this program over the
network especially for CTS this is an
important part because for many many
challenges you interact with a service
over TCP so we exploit you right has to
do this over the network let's have a
look at this level I won't go over the
meaning of all these unknown functions
because we have done so in episode x19
as we see in the defines or simply by
checking nets that on the VM we can see
that net level one is running on port
two nine and eight again we could use
net cat to talk to the server's but this
time we want to write a Python script
but let's first have a look at the run
function first run generates a random
unsigned integer and then we as printf
the number into fab of ub we haven't
seen s printf before so other than
regular printf which rides a resulting
string to STD out s printf will write
the resulting string to the address
specified in the first argument in this
case buff this means fu b will contain
the decimal representation of the number
in ascii and not containing the raw byte
values then right will write to the
socket that's sending us the integer
number
thus the raw bytes that's what we saw
returned by net cat after that the
program will wait for user input with F
gets once we send some data it will
override any new line or character turn
with no bite this makes sense because
when we for example use net code and hit
enter to send something it will include
a new line at the end because it's a key
we pressed but obviously this program
only wants a characters we actually
meant to send thus stripping away the
newline then it compares the original
number with the number it received and
either print success or fail so let's
start to write our Python script but how
do we do that maybe a first hint on how
to do network program could be to look
at how netcat connects to a server so we
can use s trays to trace all source
calls of netiquette now let's try
identify the important ones and then we
try to figure out how to implement them
in Python
first one is obviously the call to
socket so let's look into Python socket
documentation on how to do that in our
script so the call to socket uses
parameters PF e net and sock stream and
when we look here in the Python dock we
see something very similar except that
it suggests to use AF unit so I wonder
what's the difference between PF and AF
in it so at Google and surprisingly it
turns out that this is a remnant of an
idea that never really took off and in
fact in a little color it's now simply
defined as being the same as AF in it
huh learn something today and the Python
dock then uses connect to a host name or
an IP and port which we can see in the S
trace here is called with port 2 9 and 8
and the IP address one two seven zero
zero one so you can also just use that
cool now we can use send and receive
with the socket obviously we want to
read the number that is sent to us so we
use receive but we have to specify how
much data we want to read in this case
we expect an unsigned integer which is
32 bit large thus we have to read 4
bytes
now let's simply print the data we
receive and then test it cool by the way
I also notice that when when you request
a new number very quickly that a lot of
numbers are the same and not random
that's because in the code the random
number generator is seeded by the time
and seconds thus if we send fast enough
the second will be the same and thus
produce the same to the random number
don't you ever use a non random source
or seed Forbes pseudo-random number
generator if it's important and now it's
easy to solve it because we are already
very experienced with converting numbers
to raw bytes and raw bytes to numbers
from all the exploits with memory values
that we have written so we can simply
use the struct module and convert raw
binary data back to an unsigned integer
and then send it as a string back to the
server
remember that struct unpack returns a
tuple
so the actual unpack number is the first
element hmm it seems to hang let's try
it again no it seems to work the receive
hangs when it is waiting for data and
doesn't get a so I assume the server
sends too fast and there's no
buffer buffering the data and when we
are finally ready to receive data today
that's already lost in the void anyhow
it worked
doesn't have to be perfect as long as
you succeed once the attack was
successful this episode is so short and
these channels are not really about
security anyway so let's quickly solve
the next one to netwo is very similar we
again have a network set up with a
program listening on part 2 997 in the
run function we see a for loop that runs
4 times in each time and generates a
random number adds it to the sum of them
all and sends it over the network the
description also says that we have to
add 4 32-bit integers and it already
warns us about the possibility of it
rapping on proper terms it warns us
about an integer overflow which again is
security relevant okay so it's copy our
previous script and quickly modified to
read for integers and then calculate the
sum you can simply extend the struct
unpack modifier and then we can also
just create a sum over the resulting
tuple easy as that the code expects the
result not in an ASCII decimal
representation but as a raw binary so we
can use struct PAC to convert it to a
binary string and then send it Oh huh I
wanted to show that this doesn't work
because of the integer overflow if we
have a look at the result of the salmon
binary we can see that it contains more
than 32 bits and that cannot be an
integer is only 32 bit large so what
happens is that the integer is simply
overflowing or wrapping around this
means the carry of the highest bid is
just lost well it's not entirely true
the CPU is actually aware of this when
an arithmetic operation shot says in
addition ends up overflowing the value
in a register a special overflow flag is
said it could be checked but anyway in
this case our unsigned integer on the
server always wraparound and apparently
this old Python struct version actually
did that for us but this behavior got
deprecated so we can simply do the same
in our code as I said the issue is
called integer overflow and when you
search for this you will find many bug
reports about it let's make a simple
example of a
typical integer overflow issue let's say
you have a loop that keeps reading data
and adds the size to an overall size
variable once it's done with the loop it
will know for how much data it has to
allocate space for the issue is now if
you managed to send so much data that
the counter overflows wraps around a
smaller space is allocated for the huge
amount of data and then you have a
typical overflow condition we are slowly
heading into the final levels of exploit
exercises protostar and we start to see
a little bit more intricate challenges
so let's stay focused and tackle the
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
