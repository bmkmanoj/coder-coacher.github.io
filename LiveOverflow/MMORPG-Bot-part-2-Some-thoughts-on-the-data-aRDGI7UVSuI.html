dumb design decision of a goat was to
trading but author who decided it was a
good idea to leak the API keys from all
the bought users these API keys can be
used with the guild wars 2 API to get
all the character information I have
written a small script that has
collected data on all active bot users
along with their wealth for the past
three months and so I want to have a
look at this data and also talk about
the threat model of botting in MMORPGs
before we get into the data let's talk
about boating itself I try to approach
this topic as if I would design an
MMORPG and I'm well aware of the threat
that somebody could hack the client or
automate and brought certain aspects of
the game for me MMORPGs have two major
concerns they need to control in order
to have a healthy game one is the player
satisfaction this is purely subjective
it's about the feeling the players have
that are often completely separate from
reality and the other one is keeping
inflation of the in-game currency under
control if you ever play the game with
rapid inflation it is basically
unplayable as a new player and it's just
a terrible experience and there are many
many game design decisions that you can
make that affect these things for
example a very typical thing game stew
is to have a gold sink that means they
are very expensive luxury items that
just pull out masses of currency or
items to fight against inflation items
can become character bonds so they are
removed from the economy and much more
so what does this have to do with
boating so when most people imagine
botting in an MMORPG game they imagine
BOTS that run around kill monsters to
level or collect items and gold and so
ysus bad for a game first with each kill
gold or items are generated out of thin
air
more gold available in the economy can
lead to a higher inflation and because
boating can be scaled to hundreds
thousands or even more this can really
destroy the economy this is the main
reason why boating is so bad for a game
another issue is that when regular
players encounter bottles it has a
negative emotional effect on them they
feel cheated maybe even their kills get
snatched away they can't buy stuff
anymore because inflation and they can't
find real players to chat and go on
adventures together so if we design a
game to defend against this threat what
can we do
should we invest into obfuscating
decline making the network protocol
super complex implement or by scanning
solutions that behave like antivirus
software trying to identify bots or
hacking tool through heuristics but
these are all terrible solutions because
they are expensive and ineffective a
dedicated butter can always bypass those
locally running scanning tools it just
slows them down and maybe prevents
simple people from doing it but
professionals that earn their money with
botting they will find ways around it
much more elegant solutions are solving
this through game design for example
Guild Wars 2 doesn't have a concept of
kill experience loot or resource
stealing everything is shared so players
won't have bad experience with BOTS
stealing their kills you can also design
your game and server logic in a way that
you completely don't trust the client
for example let's say you have a dungeon
and at the end is a reward instead of
spawning the reward chest at the start
in having closed doors preventing access
you can have a mission timer or
different checks before the server
sponsored at the end
thus if somebody has a client-side
wallhack or even control over the
communication protocol they can't just
access the chest right away
you can also implement more complicated
boss fight mechanics that require
dodging and positioning so that BOTS
have to be really really smart in order
to form it you can also make a lot of
resources account bond so that a lot of
the good loot can't even be traded or
sold by the bot owners you can also have
instanced mmo's because then BOTS can do
everything without ever being seen from
players thus it helps against a bad
perception of the game it's kind of fun
trying to think of systems that make
BOTS less effective to protect the game
isn't it but what about trading bots
because this is a little bit different I
claimed earlier that the in-game economy
mainly the inflation is a crucial part
to keep a game healthy so how does a
gold was two trading BOTS affected the
game first I have to explain how the
Trading Post works when you have an item
you can list it for a price listing an
item costs 5% of the price you choose
that is paid right away then if somebody
buys the item another 10% of the gold is
taken away
basically you have a 15% sales tax on
each trade and placing a buy order does
not cost anything so this means that a
trading bot instead of printing in-game
money and actually removes gold from the
economy 15% at a time so a training bot
is in a weird way actually helping to
fight inflation also I would claim that
the casual regular player likes to buy
items when they need it from the trading
post and sell items right away to
somebody who offered to buy it that's
not the most efficient way but the most
comfortable way and so a bot who is
constantly trying to over bid on items
so they get buy orders filled raised the
price a casual player can sell an item
for right away and at the same time try
to undercut when listing the item so the
sale listing is sold quicker which
pushes the price down for cash
players that just want to buy an item so
it even has another positive effect
however there are also two major
negative points a training bot is
competing with all other players who
would like to maximize their profits or
engage in trading to the undercutting
and over bidding minimizes the profit a
regular player can have it also lowers
the bots own profit but a bot can
obviously do a lot more trades than a
human and can thus justify a lower
profit margin and another issue is that
if a player feels like they are BOTS
trading it can have a very negative
emotional effect a feeling of unfairness
and so forth in though may be
objectively our trading bot is not bad
regular players will not see it that way
so I believe a trading bot is unfair no
it's not bad or dangerous for the game
as long as players don't see them so
let's have a look at the data I've
collected I'm using a jupyter notebook
to work with the data and use it to
create all the graphs the code is
terrible please ignore it I've not
included the API keys so you can't find
which players were doing this but you
can find all the graphs in the
description below and so you can have a
look for yourself first of all over
there roughly three months of collecting
data I have seen 94 unique Guild Wars 2
API keys so I guess almost 100 people
have downloaded the bots executed it and
entered the API key however when you
look at the graphs you will see that
many have not actively used the bots at
the bottom you can see the time span of
the data collection it started on the
12th of November and it went up to the
7th of February my crawler checked the
API every hour so each point represents
a bot being registered online and having
some celibate data you might wonder why
there are only 76 spots and not 94
that's because 18 people basically
didn't do anything
these 76 however start the bot for a
brief period but even though they used
it they are still several that were
basically never really active so for
example user 72 downloaded and ran a bot
for a couple of hours on the 23rd of
November after that never again in
contrast to that user 25 has
sylia but running 24/7 for the whole
period by the way the skip over here was
my fault my crawler died and I didn't
realize it quickly enough
and then there's user 55 who used it
fairly actively but then stopped in
December maybe went home for Christmas
without the PC and then restart the but
again when they returned in January
these graphs tell a lot of interesting
stories now let's have a look at
individual BOTS across I think number 25
is awesome it's a really active bot and
I think it's the most active one that
I've recorded so you can see here dots
with several colors orange is the gold
they have in their wallet or inventory
blue is the gold trapped in items
they've listed for sale so blue is a
theoretic gold value they would get if
they would sell the items but now that I
think about it I think I forgot to
deduct the 10% Trading Post text from
that anyway blue should be a little bit
lower overall read other buy orders they
have so that's money that is waiting in
the Trading Post for somebody who sells
the item for this price and black is the
net worth basically it's just the sum of
gold value of the items listed for sale
and the buy orders it's the theoretic
gold wealth of this account at the
moment in time so if we look at the star
of this graph we can see that the bot
has constantly 400 to 1300 without the
1700 gold in buy orders and blue other
items being sold so these items wait for
a buyer and you can see their price is
always going up and down meaning that
new items are being listed for sale and
that people buy items now I think that
there's always a dip down on weekends
which could mean that because on the
weekend more players are playing more
items are being bought from this player
so money and listed items goes down but
I can't really explain myself those big
jumps so black is overall net worth and
I think there are clear upwards trends
visible here with around maybe 750 to
almost a thousand gold per week but
remember a lot of the wealth is kept in
items that might never get sold so it's
not all just raw gold but here with
those big jumps I think maybe the
calculation feels a bit and actually the
user
or by auras and so forth and then moved
gold away also there's a fairly sudden
drop in value of listed items so maybe
the person even cancels a lot of listed
items and relisted them lower or just
outright sold them to the highest bidder
maybe well I don't know speculation here
the strenght here I think is awesome the
listed items are slowly being sold off
which increases the available gold how
however the gold is immediately put back
into ordering new items so more and more
gold is now in the ordered items overall
because by selling those items and
ordering new ones the bot made a profit
and thus the overall net worth is slowly
increasing but the trading strategy
during this time is also ineffective
because ideally the listings wouldn't go
down there should be at least stable or
rising with the wealth but like I said
that's a very active bot and probably
the most successful one we can also use
GE W to efficiency with the API key to
spy a little bit what this player traded
so here they are these are the secret
items that apparently are very
profitable to trade the most money was
apparently made with the black poly
luminescence trinket the warbird skins
are also good by the way if you're
wondering why the listings are
flatlining starting around the 9th of
January this can be seen also on the
other graphs unfortunately this is an
issue with the good was to API the
listings are not updated so the data
there is faulty another very active but
number 3 seems to be less successful
here the net worth is pretty constant so
it's kind of useless to let the butt run
but dirty looks awesome but don't get
fooled by the slope and look at the
y-axis steps here the boss start with
around 200 gold and made maybe 500 gold
in about three weeks it's also not very
great and those drops look really like
the person pulled out winnings into
another account
unfortunately this users API key is
involved
maybe they got banned or maybe they just
removed the API key because they stopped
using the bot so it's a spot worth it
I'd say clearly
a lot of graphs are pretty much just a
flat line so the users don't choose good
items to trade and you have to include
the electricity cost hardware cost and
game key cost plus subscription for the
but I think it's a complete waste of
money and better spent on buying game
cards also should the average guilt was
to player be outraged over these unfair
BOTS
no absolutely not those are small fish
they don't really make a lot of gold
always risk getting bad and it's just a
handful of people this is not a problem
you should worry about I don't think it
has any negative effects on the game and
as long as you don't cause an
unjustified player uprising this is just
fine by the way if somebody from my
reading that wants the API keys to hand
out some 7-day warning pans send me an
email</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
