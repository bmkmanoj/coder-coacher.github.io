being bombarded with when auditing
testing reverse engineering and so forth
it's important and natural to look out
for patterns for example a lot of web
applications encode data in base64 and
one thing I immediately noticed in basic
C for Strings is a look at this string
does it tell you anything
well maybe you already can recognize
that it is basically fall without having
to attempt to decode it but anything
besides that anything about the data it
encodes without having to do a basic C
for decoding I know this is going to be
JSON data you see Jason starts with a
curly brace and the quote and that
results in E Y and being able to see
that saves time and allows you to
quickly find interesting data same with
debugging binary exploitation channels
when you look at the hex memory dump it
is very overwhelming when you start out
so many different values but eventually
you start to learn to see your patterns
that is a stack address I know that
because it's very similar to the stack
pointer and something you see a lot when
doing this stuff but also here does
fairly random looking data I don't even
have to decode values from it to see
what it is it is clearly ASCII these
bytes are in the ASCII range you can
generally see that based off the first
nibble ASCII really only goes from
around to something to seven something
2-0 is a space you might also see some
null bytes and obviously a or D also for
new lines but most characters are in
this range so over time your brain
develops this intuition to quickly judge
if most of these values look like s key
and so looking for and learning patterns
like this will help you to be much more
efficient when researching something
