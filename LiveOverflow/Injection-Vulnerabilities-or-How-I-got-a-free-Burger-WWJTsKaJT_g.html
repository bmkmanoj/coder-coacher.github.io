I wanna tell you a story how I got a free
Burger when I ordered food.
And use it to explain what injection vulnerabilities
are.
So last night I was super lazy, didn’t wanna
cook so I ordered food.
I ordered food there before so certain fields
like the address were already filled out.
But also the comment field was still filled
out.
And on the previous order, in the comment
field I requested a different sauce for one
of the Burgers.
I didn’t realize that and just continued
and paid online.
A little bit later the delivery guy shows
up and told me that he changed the sauce for
the Country Burger as I had requested.
Country burger?
I didn’t order one?
He said: yeah, you did.
Look here on the receipt.
And I look at it and I realized what happened
the comment I wrote was printed just above
the other items that I actually ordered, I
used capital letters to emphasize my request
and I didn’t notice that it just made it
look like it is one of the ordered items.
And so he actually thought I ordered a Country
Burger and the comment after it was just my
modification request.
I mean looking at it now everybody would say
it’s pretty clear that it’s not an Item
I order.
There is no price on it and it’s not bold.
But this is a fast food restaurant and those
guys have a lot to do, it has to go fast and
maybe comments are also not a common thing.
I can totally see how it happened.
I offered to pay for the Burger, but he said
it’s fine.
So that’s how I got a free Burger through
an unintended Burger Injection or unintended
social engineering attack.
So what does this teach us about injection
vulnerabilities in software.
You see, programs are just acting on instructions
that they have been given.
Like a guy in a restaurant has instructions
he gets from the order that gets printed out.
And in this case data, or this comment, was
mixed together with business critical information.
And whoever created and printed out this order
didn’t make it clear to the entity that
processes this data, that this is just a comment,
not an order instruction.
The bill could have been structured differently
so that it is very clear.
And this is always what happens with injection
vulnerabilities.
Let’s take SQL injections.
A programmer writing code that builds an SQL
query and doesn’t make it clear that this
user data is just a string, by wrapping it
in quotes and making sure that no quotes can
appear in the data by escaping them, then
whatever processes the query can be fooled.
Or cross site scripting.
The programmer writes user data into a surrounding
HTML document without explicitly marking this
data to just be plaintext without special
characters.
Thus somebody can inject HTML tags like script
tags and perform a XSS attack.
And obviously there are many many cases in
security where the underlying security issue
is an injection.
Yes SQL injections and XSS have a very different
impact and are very different, but only at
the surface.
The underlying principle is exactly the same.
So whenever you place data into some other
structure that gets then handed to another
entity for further procesing, may this be
a webserver, a database server, a browser
or a fast food employee, you have to make
sure your data is clearly marked as what it
is.
Just data.
Not an instruction meant for that entity.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
