we will use Linux because it allows us
to have a look at the Linux kernel
source code in this video we will learn
what those calls are and we will try to
understand what user mode and kernel
mode means by having a look at a
specific kernel function copy from user
if you have ever wondered what it means
to have an operating system in a more
technical way I hope I can show you some
very interesting stuff you may have seen
pictures where it says user mode and
kernel mode all those circles will ring
0 ring 1 and so forth they introduce the
stuff in school and even as a kid who
knew programming I had no imagination of
what that actually means you may even
have heard that sis goals are an
interface between those two worlds so
let's start by looking at what kind of
source codes exist and again you can
read about sis calls in the Linux manual
so men sis calls it says here that
system call is the fundamental interface
between an application and the Linux
kernel and system calls are generally
not invoked directly but rather via a
wrapper function in gilepsy often the
GHC wrapper function is quite thin doing
little work other than copying arguments
to the right registers before invoking
the system call invoking the system call
hmm we will find out what that means
soon further down we can find a huge
list of available system calls I
mentioned in an earlier video that the
Lipsy function printf is just a fancy
wrapper around t source code right and
you can see that when you use the
program s trace to trace all system
calls instead of showing printf it shows
us right the main page of read says it
takes three parameters first the file
descriptor then an address to a buffer
and account so let's create a simple C
program that calls this function the
first parameter is a file descriptor we
will talk about that value in another
video but we want it to be one which is
the file descriptor for the standard
output for the second parameter we want
an address in memory
that points to a string we can simply
write our string here the compiler will
find a place in memory for it and place
the address of it here and the last
parameter will be the length so in our
case five
now open it in red re with - D - debug
it and analyze all and seek - the main
function then print the function and
place a breakpoint at the right with dB
then DC to start the program and switch
to a visual view with capital V
exclamation mark with s you can now
follow this write function we follow
some weird stuff this is the procedural
linkage table the PLT section it's also
sometimes called function trampoline
again a topic for another video now at
some point we reach some more code this
is not the actual code from the Lib C
library and now we press s to step
through this huge amount of code I fast
forward then cut a bit there's so much
stuff in this Lipsy wrapper but at some
point in the end it reaches the
interesting part here it is it moves one
into the EAX register and then comes
these let's call instruction a peek into
the Intel assembler reference tells us
that this is a fast call to privilege
level zero system procedures and has the
opcode 0 F 0 5 it also says it does so
by loading our IP from the ia32 L star
MSR MSR stands for model specific
register so like a jump that sets our IP
to another value to continue execution
somewhere else
it loads our IP from a model specific
register MSR the address was configured
in this special register at some point
during booting of the system through the
WR MSR instruction to use this function
you have to be in privilege level 0 so
you cannot set this from a simple C
program because there you are in user
mode which is privilege level 3 and if
you wonder now how you could get into a
level 0 from being level 3 then the
answer is through an instruction like
Cisco but then you cannot control what
will be executed when you switch to
level 0 because it will jump to a
predefined address so do you get now
what it means to have different
privilege mode slows or rings when you
turn on your computer the CPU starts in
level Z
the colonel then configure stuffs like
the AR 32 L star MSR register with an
address through the WR MSR instruction
right MSR instruction then later drops
privileges of the CPU to level 3 now the
hardware is kind of locked down
we cannot reconfigure this register we
cannot reconfigure the hardware we can
only enter level 0 again through a Cisco
but you cannot control what will be
executed because that address is fixed
does that make sense so anyway let's
come back to this disk all invocation
what we do is we load a number in a
register in our case it was 1 and then
we Cisco to enter privilege level 0 by
jumping to a fixed address in the kernel
and the kernel takes the number from the
register and it knows which this call
that is so this nice table here shows us
that the rights of scroll has the number
1 so the kernel knows from a table like
this what it has to execute and it's
implemented in the source code file
readwrite see and here it is so this is
what will be executed in the kernel when
you invoke the right Cisco there's an
awesome free book called Linux device
drivers which goes into great details
how the kernel works especially how to
write a device driver and kernel modules
and in chapter 3 section 7 and reads the
code for read and write in skull needs
to copy a whole segment of data to or
from the user address space this
capability is offered by the following
kernel function which copy an arbitrary
array of bytes and sit at the heart of
most read and write implementations so
first what does user address space mean
maybe when you debug some programs with
gdb you wonder how it can be that every
program seems to use the same addresses
code is always at the same address stack
is always at the same address that
doesn't make sense how can all programs
use the same address in memory when they
all write each other this is why we have
mmm you a memory management unit the
colonel sets up the MMU with special CPU
instructions and configures registers
and so forth and this tell CMM you how
to translate between virtual and
physical addresses so when you use the
instruction move a X and an address in
your C program the MMU will know how to
translate this address for a given
process to an actual physical address in
your RAM so it might request address 7 F
5 to 7 3 to 0 but you don't have to care
about that the magic happens deep inside
the hardware this allows us to write
programs without having to think about
which addresses are still free so when
you are in the kernel after you have
entered it with a sis call you might
want to copy some data from user address
space for example to write it somewhere
else to do this you can use the copy
from user function and I thought it
might be interesting function to trace
through the kernel source code to get a
feeling how the code of an operating
system looks like so let's use the Lunas
cross-reference because it allows us to
easily search for labels so let's start
by looking for the function copy from
user and we get a list with multiple
places this function is defined then
it's so weird why are there multiple
places for that well if you look closely
at the file path you will notice that
each different CPU architecture has its
own folder so you can see here arm for
processes that you can find in your
smartphone or Power PC which is used by
the PlayStation 3 on antenna Wii and
also x86 which is probably the
architecture of your computer right now
so the code gets pretty crazy and I
don't know a lot about it but let's just
follow the main functions here and
ignore the checks and stuff around it so
copy from user cause underscore copy
from user that function calls access
okay on the from parameter which is the
address the user specified in our case
the address of the string we wanted to
write and this checks if the particular
process is allowed to read from that
address imagine if a process tries to
read some secrets from another process
and if everything is fine it calls
underscore underscore copy from user now
it seems to split up in either 32-bit or
64-bit and because we have a 64-bit
Ubuntu Linux let's follow that path this
looks like just a wrapper around copy
from user note check indicating that the
following functions won't check the
access rights again but luckily they can
already do that ok we follow that and we
arrive at a pretty big function so here
is a big switch case statement which
seems to check these size we want to
read from the user space so let's say we
just want to read one byte from user
space we would be in this case one here
so get use our ASM is a preprocessor
macro this gets into how a C file is
compiled in stages but it actually is
very simple the statements just a simple
copy and replace it means that this code
that is defined here is just simply
copied at the location it was used
earlier but before the compiler starts
to compile the machine code so you can
basically it also just treat it like a
standard C function and get user ASM
define some actual CPU instructions and
this move here is the instruction that
most data from the user space into a
variable here so I type in our type out
from the parameters up here and they
were set to be for a single byte in the
way how those preprocessor statements
work you just replace this text with B
so the actual instruction would look
like move B to 1 so this is 18 to
assembly syntax so it means it moves
whatever 2 is into B 1 now this is C
unlined a sample syntax and it refers to
the variables that are defined down here
so percentage 2 refers to the third
parameter 0 1 2 which is the address we
want to move data from and we want to
move it in two percentage one which is X
and that is the location we want to move
it to the move is wrapped with St AC and
CLI C which stands for set and clear AC
register and it has to do with s map
and he exploitation feature
and below the move we see something with
section fix up and assembler exception
table that goes into how the kernel
handles Hardware exceptions but there is
a great documentation I found and you
can read what it does there exactly
anyhow as you can see there was no code
that would somehow translate the user
supplied virtual address to a real
physical address it just executes the
move this is because the magic happens
somewhere else when it kernel executes
this instruction it will cause a page
fault because it tries to access a
virtual address and that is an interrupt
which means the CPU will jump to another
predefined code location in the kernel
where this exception will be handled
pretty similar how this is call
instruction made us jump to a predefined
address and in that page fault handler
in the kernel all the address magic with
the MMU will happen I will not go into
that because it's already enough
information for now but I hope this
random dive into the kernel code was
interesting and maybe even eye-opening
so many small people work together on
creating such a complex and amazing
platform almost makes me emotional
thinking about how the media celebrates
new iPhone apps while the real magic
happens down here don't worry if you
don't understand anything
well I even don't understand a lot of it
but it's important to just dive into
some own stuff once in a while and get a
first glimpse of what is out there and
I'm sure that at least subconsciously
you now have a feeling for what it means
to have a kernel I also worry a bit that
I may forget to explain certain things
that seem clear to me but you guys get
lost so please give me feedback on how
the first couple of videos of the series
were for you and what is still out here
so I can improve and make content that
helps as many people as</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
