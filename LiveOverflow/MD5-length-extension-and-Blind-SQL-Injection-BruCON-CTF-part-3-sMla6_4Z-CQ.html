Brooklyn CTF 2016 I didn't cover every
challenge but I think they were quite
diverse
but let's not waste any time and check
out the last three the first challenge
is called breaking the crypto there's
also a hint about Flickr which might
help you in researching what it is about
but in general either know how it works
and solve it in a matter of minutes or
your mind gets blown to be honest with
you I didn't know about this kind of
attack until I participated in the
Breaking Bad crypto workshop by filippo
at the cow's Communication Congress in
2014 he did a walkthrough of a Vimeo
crypto vulnerability and explaining it
in great detail how it works and I just
sat there in awe I'm not going into all
details right now because I do want to
cover this properly in a full episode at
some point but if you are interested in
it go research it yourself I would just
explain the abstract idea and show you
an easy tool the challenge itself is not
that cool the crypto tech is just so
beautiful and now that I completely
overhyped the attack this journal is
based on let's have a look at it I kind
of forgot to record most of the
challenge so I got a describe it to you
so the initial URL you are given points
to a login field and somewhere was a
hint that the secret key is 18
characters long besides that there is
not much looking at how the login or
session stuff is implemented we learned
that there are two get parameters one is
user and the other one is called Mac
user is a base64 string and decoding it
shows that in my case the user was
number 68 we can see the user number is
between two pipes our goal is to log in
or authenticate as admin which has user
ID 1 so first attempt would be to simply
change the basic C 4 string to contain
pipe 1 pipe but this doesn't work the
reason for that is the Mac parameter Mac
stands for message authentication code
like the name says this code makes sure
that a certain message is authentic
meaning trusted the question is how the
MEK is implemented we have two kind of
information about it first of all the
hint said that the secret key is 18
characters long a secret key is
necessary because this way the server
can verify that the message is trusted
you could almost say it got signed by
the key but but that that is not correct
the second thing we can assume is that
the Mac is implemented with md5 to space
on the length of the hash now a very
weak MEK implementation would simply do
the following it would take the secret
key and append the message it wants to
authenticate and then creates an md5
hash of the whole string next time it
will receive a message and the smack it
can then take the secret key again
append the message calculate the hash
and compare it to the Mac if that's the
same the message is trusted this way
only somebody who knows the secret key
can calculate a correct hash and thus
create a user parameter with ID 1 right
well here comes a mind-blowing part md5
is vulnerable to a length extension
attack what does that mean and the five
length extension attack basically means
that we can add more characters to a
string and update the hash so that it
stays valid in this case we have an
unknown secret key with some characters
we control afterwards and we know the
hash of one valid message you would
think you need the secret key to
calculate the new hash but you can
simply take the already computed hash
and develop message we know and then
extend it and update the hash so when
the server verifies the message it uses
the secret key and the message
calculates the hash and we'll get to the
same result as we do obviously it's not
as simple there are a few pitfalls if
you would completely implement it
yourself like petting and you would have
to understand how md5 is computed but we
will now just use a tool to do it for us
the tool is called hash pump we simply
pass the md5 signature we know the part
of the message we know which is the 68th
the secret key line
we know with 18 and the data we want to
append in this case the one the result
will be the new md5 hash and the new
extended message was some annoying
things in it like petting but I was just
hoping that the application will forgive
when it comes to the stuff and I was
hoping it will ignore it and just take
the last number so now you just get the
basics before encoding off the new
message copy it together with the new
MEK md5 hash into the URL send the
request and we authenticate as admin and
get the flag very easy but a lot of
points
the next challenge was my favorite of
the whole CTF not that it was
particularly difficult or a crazy
challenge just because they haven't done
it before and was somehow interesting
for me the challenge is called luck
analysis psql I the description says you
are good at hacking so what are you
tracking find everything you need and
make the flag the hint also said that
the flag will be the password of the
administrator or something so the
challenge was actually less vague then
the description makes it sound anyway
the title is already basically telling
you what it is about you have to analyze
a log of a blind SQL injection short be
SQL I and you are given a typical web
server access log the log contains a lot
of information such as IP address
request method the access path as well
as the HTTP response code for example
200 means everything is ok and some more
information like the size of the
response and the user agent so as a
first step I just try to get an overview
of what the log contains scrolling
around a bit and with searching for
interesting keywords you can quickly
find all the SQL injection attempts but
it's a bit hard to see what's going on
so I start to write a simple Python
script to explore the content more for
example I URL decoded each line to make
it easier to read and I stripped away
what I considered unimportant
information later it will turn out that
I stripped away too much and it took me
a while to realize how valuable some of
the information was but I keep exploring
the data set by changing the script
filtering for certain lines searching
for interesting keywords cleaning up
lines and so forth just trying to figure
out what it might be looking for the
challenge was clear that we should
analyze the blind SQL injection attempts
it's not hard to find these so when you
look at these requests you notice that
at the end it always does a comparison
with a number for example is something
bigger than 64 and this is basically
what the blind SQL injection does in a
blind SQL injection you won't get data
from a database directly as output but
you create a query such that you can
leak small pieces of information by for
example causing an error if your
question is wrong let me extract one of
those sequences
and explain it with that so basically
the automated tool uses limit to access
only one character in this case the
forest character of whatever it wants to
leak and then ask is the characters
ASCII value bigger than 64 and if you
look at the line afterwards we can see
that the next question is if the
character is bigger than 32 this means
that with the previous question it
probably got a different response and
was able to conclude that the character
value must be smaller than 64 so it does
a binary search for the correct
character next is checking of the
characters bigger than 48 this means
that the response of the bigger than 32
was probably correct and once you follow
that you get closer and closer to
deliver the correct character and at the
end is one last question in basic now we
know the character must have a skew
value of 49 or 50 now just fried some
code to extract those rules from the
lock file the code is super ugly and
just very crudely written so don't judge
me but here's where I got stuck at first
because I was left with two choices for
each character so I didn't know which of
these two is the correct one improved
forcing all combinations is too much so
I put the challenge aside and went out
for dinner I had sushi well I was
walking with my friends I had a
revelation that the access lock also
included response code and size this
might be the missing information I was
looking for we probably are able to see
difference if a certain question return
true or false based on the different
sizes of the return code and that's why
I said early I got rid of important
information anyhow once I include that
info I was able to correctly identify
the real character which allowed me to
dump all the extracted information from
the blind SQL injection and here's my
script in action and one of the blind
SQL injections did load the etc' shadows
file that contains the hash of the root
user and then I took the hedge and brute
force it with John the Ripper took a
couple of minutes but then I
successfully found the correct password
which is webmaster that was kind of fun
the last challenge was weird not really
a meaningful security
hacking challenge anyhow the description
says is is it encrypted or obfuscated
here's the content of the file and you
can immediately see that this is not
random so it can't be really encrypted
and some strings look awful lot like
meaningful strings especially the first
line reminded me of hash-bang and for
environment and that kind of told me
that all lines are reversed so first I
reversed on lines and then I noticed
that there are things in there that look
like the flag I know that the flag
starts with blue conan uses curly braces
and when you start looking for these
pieces you can slowly assemble the flag
and you're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
