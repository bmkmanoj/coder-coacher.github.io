did a small CTF with a couple of levels
unfortunately I wasn't at the conference
so the CTF was in the middle of the
night for me so I did not participate
while I was running but now I sat down
and I solved the challenges a couple of
hours later it's almost I didn't solve
the last level but this will be kind of
like quick speedrun basically of the
previous levels as altered levels before
and now I just basically do them again
so let's create a folder for the CTF
let's get started with the first level
so apparently this is like a message
board you can send messages to other
profiles and we have received one
message from the US Department of
national security and well it's telling
us that when you gain unauthorized
access you violate the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act and stuff like that and we
also had Ken seoeon profile here so and
here's a little reference to the hackers
movie so when you look at the messages
and just click a little bit around of it
we see the URL and we see that the
messages use the username so one
assumption because obviously the first
challenge and very easy there might be
access control confusion and now we can
try to access messages from this other
user and yes that just works you just
have to modify the URL and you get the
secret so let me save that and we can
continue with the next one so apparently
it is like a Twitter thing you can post
some stuff there are a couple of
messages if you try to log in it says
you cannot log in right now it's
disabled and if you click on a tweek you
can see tweets just looking at it a
little bit and then you see that there's
a get parameter a 1 so let's try to mess
with that and it gives us an SQL error
so we can assume that there's some kind
of SQL injection we can test this by
putting in a valid SQL expression see if
it still works and yeah it still works
no I'm I made a mistake because I used
the wrong syntax I didn't mean to use
Union join I try to figure out how many
parameters I need to
a union select from a different table to
extract some data apparently one
parameter is not enough it has to be two
values from the Union select so let's
take notes of that here's in clear-text
easier you do a union select with two
values and that doesn't cause an error
so you know that you need two values so
next thing is we want to find out what
tables do exist so we want a union
select the tables from the information
scheme or a scheme schema schema and in
the tables table and when we execute
that we get the list of all the tables
and we see that there's messages tweets
and users table available next thing we
want to figure out what columns
what kind of columns do exist in the
different tables it looks very similar
we we take the column name and to only
get the column names for a certain table
we can add the where clause that we only
want the table users for example and
when you execute that we see that the
users have a UID and a username and a
password and we can also now directly
Union select this users table and
extract the passwords in a passive looks
hash but we cannot look in any way so it
doesn't really matter to us but yeah we
are just exploring right now and trying
to figure out how we could how we could
find the flag we can also find out all
different different user names now let's
try the messages table so let's find the
column names for that and we find a
message ID from and to the message and
the message body so body obviously is
nice text so let's use the SQL
injections to retrieve all messages
available on the board and then we find
here that send me the password for the
next secret meeting and the password is
Marcus yellow so I assume that that is a
flag the the issue is that the CTF is
already closed so I cannot validate my
flags that is closed so I assume that
this must be the flag but I'm not enough
isn't sure I have to check once there
there are some write-ups
available okay up to the next level and
says it's a reverse engineering
challenge of the DNS world program so
you can can download those files and
check out the other files that are there
but most of them look like just like a
lot of text files I have no idea what's
in them because the chances it's a
reverse engineering challenge so for now
I think we don't have to deal with those
except we would get stuck and we
wouldn't wouldn't know how to get
further as I said I did the changes
before so I remember that I know that
the Linux binary I should have first
like you know do the obligatory check
and see that said Linux binary I start
my Ubuntu VM with vagrant so I can
actually debug button or run the program
okay cool so we can now have we have now
access to our Ubuntu machine and I
copied the DNS vault binary into the
shares folder so now I can you know we
can check that it's a Linux binary and
we can execute it but I forgot to change
the queue ripple flag and yeah we get it
the password vault and we can enter
password but it tells us the password is
incorrect
so now let's have a look at this binary
in hopper we load the binary and
obviously first we want to check find
out where all the important stuff is
happening so we look for the strings and
we find it please enter password string
and follow the reference so here in the
main function happens all the magic we
can check the D compilation attempt from
hopper and we can see that here it
prints the password and read some data
in with F gets and then there's a for
loop and afterwards it doesn't mem
compare on something and then prints the
apparently the password if it was
correct so we can a little bit sort to
reverse engines code so the saguaro
before is just it it the iterator the I
in the follow because you can see it's
like adding one every time and then
checking if it's 14 the bar 70 is in
related to the F get so that is the data
we input the bar 50 is used down here in
the mem
compare so the bar 50 is maybe like it's
definitely what has really compared and
the other one is apparently the secret
string so so that so some so it looked
because we are moving here DL into that
address that seems like we do something
with our input and whatever is doing
that is then going to be compared to the
two all these weird bytes at the
beginning of main and so that's how we
know that that this has to do something
like with scrambling the input and then
we can also see that it only like reads
hex 14 bytes we are not looking for
something longer than hex 14 and now we
can follow it here like it takes has the
iterator gets the offset so takes a
character and XOR the character with hex
42 and that one is then an EDX and that
hex or input value then gets written at
the secret input address and you know at
the end it will then those hex 14 bytes
will then be compared to this to those
secret bytes
so let's write a quick program because
the XOR is obviously you know you can do
the reverse so our input gets XOR and
then compared to those byte values if
you want to know what the clear text
input is to get to those byte values so
we can just XOR the secret here with the
with the hex 42 so I'm just preparing
the Python script to do a quick X or
decryption so we iterate over every
character from this string and we define
an odd variable and then we take the
value of the character XOR it with hex
42 and then we append it all out and
just then we print that Stuxnet the
planet okay that looks cool you see that
there are some triggers at the end but
it doesn't matter we get the flag the
reason why it doesn't matter is and it's
why it's a bit confusing is that you
have to just pay attention that they
only read hex 14 bytes and
only mmm compare hex 14 bytes at the end
so you know you don't have to think
about what happens with the rest is
think it's just to throw you off so up
to the next level level 3 so here it
says that it's an there's an encrypted
message and its own crypto and you can
do up shows and plaintext attacks so if
you just enter here a letter you will
get an encrypted output but it will be
every time random if you are very
careful and if you pay attention you see
that a single character always returns
four numbers and two values return eight
numbers so that might give you a little
bit of a hint what could be going on
there or it's definitely something that
you want to look into and think about
why why does it always have four numbers
but what is also interesting is that
they are everytime random they are not
the same and that took me a minute to
think about what that could mean because
it didn't make much sense to me how you
could reverse the random value but that
will all make sense in a second so I'm
now installed with Pip the patent
requests module so I can do easy
requests to that so we can automate the
the analysis of this so now I'm looking
for how to do the encryption request
with the chrome developer tools and I
see the post requests and the post data
is a string as well s key and then you
just send the value which is the
plaintext and then we can return the
content of like the whole HTML page that
will come back and then we can just make
a followed with a couple of tests so we
want to see what happens when you have a
couple of a's because they should be
every time the same right and then we
can just print and check what the
results are
yeah that doesn't help us much we should
only get back the encrypt text so I I
split it up for the new lines then we
have a list with every line and then I
just count the amount of elements have
to go back to only print the encrypted
text and yeah now we get back the four
numbers so as you can see they are
always different whoa
but but it's important to see that they
are always four numbers so what could
that mean so we can also add some it up
add another character so that we have
two characters and three characters and
see how it's behaving and we notice that
that it's always a multiple of four so
we're four and we have eight and we have
12 so that seems weird so maybe it's
always in blocks of four one idea I at
some pint head was just maybe looking at
the values of those numbers specifically
what happens if you sum up those numbers
like can you learn something from these
some of this and indeed all A's I have
always devalue 190 ok so now we
basically know how to break this the
same number we'll always have at the
same character will always have the same
number so now we can just iterate over
all characters and get their sum well
you they will be once they are encrypted
so what I'm doing here is I create a
character from hex 0 up to 255 so we
start with the character with hex 1 and
then we notice that it just you know
counts back from 255 downwards so the
whole algorithm what it's basically
doing is just it takes a value or
character for example capital a is hex
41 and then it does 255 minus those hex
41 and that number will then be split up
in a sum so it's now super easy how we
can defeat this we basically just have
to divide the message into four number
blocks sum up that number and then we
have to do 255 for hex FF minus that
number and the resulting number will be
the character that got encrypt and to do
this I quickly just search for Python
snippet that allows me to easily split
this list in
equivalent parts because I always forget
how to easily do this so and then we
just get the some of the of the
individual blocks we can comment out
here at the top because we don't need
that for now we have figured out the
algorithm and there is a syntax mistake
I screwed up the for loop
okay so now we get the individual
numbers and we also get the sum of it
and now we just define an out string
that will be the flag and so we just
take 255 minus the sum of those values
and from that we get the character and
that will be our clear text and we get
this week's decrypt the password is
don't bull run me bro okay we can save
that now and then on to the next
challenge
so here it is about a secure channel you
want to encrypt something with a public
key or private key and basically this
guy is telling you hey please send me
your PGP key it has to have the name
depth of national security agent and
this email attached and he will verify
that you really gave him the real key
and it's not man in the middle or
something by looking at at a color that
is generated from the key
so usually you compare fingerprints of
the keys or the key itself and check if
there if that's the correct key but in
this case there is a color generated for
the key and you can see up there that a
fingerprint is very long with a lot of
different characters so they are quite
unique while in this case they only
generate a handful of colors and compare
this color and it has to be blue so what
I'm doing now is I want to script this
maybe because I'm not sure how much of
brute-forcing this may end up to be so I
installed new PG for Python and we start
by getting a GPG object which takes a
path as a parameter the home directory
usually that would be your users home
but in this case I'm just using the
current directory as the home okay let's
see how we generate a key we scroll down
a little bit and we find the air is
first of all a generate key method and
then to use that we have to specify the
parameters in this case we also want to
control the name as well as the email
address assigned with the key because
not only will be
the color the key will later have be
verified if it's blue but also it the
name and the email address will be
checked and then we can use export keys
to get a askew representation of the key
which we then can paste into the website
to see the verified color it test let's
try to execute it but I get an arrow
that there's an unexpected argument new
PG home which is weird because that the
documentation said that that would be
the parameter I'm also trying to remove
it because maybe the first parameter is
generally maybe the path or something
but also doesn't seem to work so the
next thing to do is I check maybe if I
install the wrong package and then I'm
kind of not sure it's not patent new PG
or his just mu PG but still doesn't
change anything that's the point where I
should maybe check if maybe this parrot
is really exists so I just import this
module and use pythons help on this
object to see what kind of parameters it
has and when you look closely there you
see that there is a home dear parameter
so it's not new PG home but it's not
home dear so apparently the
documentation that I found online is not
it's not the current version and then we
can successfully execute the program and
we get the public key which we can now
take and paste into the website and it
displays the fingerprint of it and
generates a color but it's not the
correct color so we now we generate a
couple of more keys and we test them on
the website
until we finally find a key that has a
blue verification code cool this one is
blue so we can take that one on the
original side and this person accepts
now our key and sends us a risk message
back which is encrypted with the public
key that we just sent them now we just
have to use our private key to decrypt
it so I didn't save the private key on
purpose but this new PG module will
I'll save all the keys that generated in
this home directory so at the moment
actually all this key though all those
keys that we just generated are all
saved and when we try to decrypt the
message it will look for the correct
private key to to be able to decrypt
this message and yeah and that key is
still still in there so we can look how
to decrypt it and we can simply then
just call GPG decrypt on this message
and it will find the correct private key
from all the keys that will generate
before and the flag is tiny key space is
bad for business so basically there's
only one challenge left but I haven't
solved this challenge and really spend
too much time on looking at it basically
all I did was just clicking on
downloading the files but once I saw
what kind of files they were I didn't I
was not very I was not motivated to
solve it but I'm quite satisfied with
how quickly I got through these and I
think they was still quite fun
