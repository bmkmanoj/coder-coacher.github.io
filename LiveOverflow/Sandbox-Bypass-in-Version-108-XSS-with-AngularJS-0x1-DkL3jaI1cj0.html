angularjs sandbox bypass series in the
previous video I have provided a quick
overview of angularjs now we'll dive
right into angularjs internals by
debugging why alert in an angularjs
expression doesn't work the research I'm
showing off here was not done by me I
build upon the research done by other
people most notably Mario and Gareth I
have not found an angularjs sandbox
bypass myself but I understand them now
so I want to pass on this knowledge now
let's execute the expression with the
alert by submitting this form the site
loads executes angularjs the expression
gets evaluated and we hit our first
breakpoint
the first breakpoint is hit in a
function called getter FN that means get
our function you can see that in the
call stack to the right I've also added
some comments here get her FN is a
function that creates a string with some
JavaScript code the variable with that
code is called code and because we hit a
breakpoint we are currently in that
context so we can access this variable
code in the console and look at what it
contains you can also see that it
somehow includes the alert that we used
in the expression it looks like this
code checks if alert is a property of s
or K or and tries to get that property
from SRK and right below the breakpoint
you can see a call to the function
constructor the constructor is called
with s and K meaning those are the
variables that should be known inside of
the function and third parameter is
finally the JavaScript code as string so
this function constructor is fancy
JavaScript stuff that creates now a
function with two parameters s and K
with the code that was created as a
string and that function could then be
actually could be called so that
function contains some dynamically
generated JavaScript code trying to get
the property alert of s okay let's
quickly make an example what getting the
property means
javascript so here is a simple object a
with two properties B and C you can now
check that a has the property B but not
the property F and you can access the
property's value with dot B or in
brackets that's the same also the object
a automatically has the function to a
string so functions are also just
properties on an object instead of
getting a value like one you get a
function back call it by adding the
parentheses for the function call
okay so the scatter F and function and
angular creates a new function what
tries to get the property alert from an
object passed as parameters s okay if
executed let's see what happens when we
continue in the code the next breakpoint
is hit and we are now in a function with
the name underscore function call this
function prepares arguments for a
function to call our expression attempts
to call a function alert so that makes
sense our first argument of our alert is
the number one so this function parses
the parenthesis with the arguments in
crates and array args with all the
parameters and args is not an array with
only one element the number one below
our breakpoint you can see a call to a
function called FN with the scope as the
first parameter let's see angular app
scope we have talked about earlier if
that will return nothing no up will be
used instead so what is FN FN is a short
function calling another function getter
when we click on getter we can see what
Gator is getter is set here as a result
of getter FN and we know what get
happened does geta FN creates a function
that tries to get the property alert of
an object so getter is now dead function
and getter is basically FN if n is
called with the scope so all this FN
calls tries to do is to get the property
alert from this scope if that was
successful if n PTR function pointer
would contain a reference to the alert
function from the scope but the alert
function doesn't exist in a scope object
thus FN PTR will become no up and no up
is just an empty function doing nothing
and this is why the alert one fails
because the scope has no function alert
defined okay now we understand angularjs
expressions better angularjs evaluates
those
freshens it parses them and that's some
fancy JavaScript foo so when you write
an identifier like username or in this
case alert into an expression angularjs
tries in a fancy way to get the property
alert from the scope object and then
call this as a function so we know now
basically whatever we type in an
expression it has to exist in this scope
this is basically a JavaScript sandbox
angularjs expressions are kind of
JavaScript syntax but our parsed and
evaluated by angular and you are only
allowed to access variables on functions
from the scope object you are not
allowed to access global functions like
alert or the cookies now we want to
break out of the scope object and try to
access those dangerous global functions
so here it comes
how can you break out of the scope the
scope object is like any other
JavaScript object it automatically has
the property constructor the constructor
of the scope object gives us the object
constructor and the constructor of the
object constructor gives us the function
constructor that's like the highest
constructor in Java Script the
constructor of a function constructors
again the function constructor and we
have just learned what the function
constructor can do from getter of n we
can create an arbitrary JavaScript
function so for example we can create a
function containing the code alert one
the constructor created now a new
JavaScript function and then we can call
this function by adding parentheses and
get an alert so because we can get the
function constructor from the scope by
using constructor two times we should be
able to create a function with alert and
execute that at least it seems to work
in the console does it also work in an
angularjs expression to put it into an
angular expression we simply have to
remove the scope in the beginning
because each expression gets already
evaluated against the scope so it's put
it in there and try it
so the first breakpoint is again the
getter FN function
and when we look at the dynamic code
that got generated this time we see it
attempts to get the constructor of s so
that seems to work this means it will
then later try to get the property
constructor off the scope which
obviously does exist and that looks good
and if we let the code just run we get
the alert awesome the next part of the
series we will have a look at a more
advanced and more recent bypass for
angularjs version 1.4 seven
