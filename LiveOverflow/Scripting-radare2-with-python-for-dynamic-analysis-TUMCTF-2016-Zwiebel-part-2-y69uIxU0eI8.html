in Python with our two pipe to extract
the encrypted code and recover the flag
last video we reverse engineered the
algorithm that is used to verify the
input key the flag with binary ninja and
gdb the challenge is called svevo from
the Tom CTF 2016 and that's the German
name for onion we learned that the
binary will decrypt itself layer four
layer and check different bits of the
input during each step now we want to
create an automated script that performs
a tedious reverse-engineering task for
us first make sure that your radar
installation is up-to-date always work
with the repository not install it from
a package manager then simply runs us
install as age which will update to the
latest commit and make sure you have our
two pipe for Python installed now we can
access radar from Python the API is
super simple after opening a file you
simply execute commands as you would
with red arrow command line so let's get
started open the binary with red arrow
tool then use do o which reopens the
binary in debugging mode then I take the
address of the call r14 and set a
breakpoint with DB with DC we can
continue the process execution which
will ask for the input key after that we
hit the breakpoint now let's do the same
in our script first we need to import
our two pipe and then we can open the
executable with Roderick and then we can
simply execute those commands with the
CMD function it's that easy
here's what I'll try to do I will write
this script here and in this small
window I try to show you the radar a
command descriptions and what it does
then I hope it's easier to follow so the
first command was do au which reopens
the binary in debug mode after that we
want to add the first break point which
is dB then we resume continue the
process with DC which should hit the
breakpoint at this point we should be
just about to execute the call to our 14
which is the
code doing the checks and the decryption
loops so we want to do a step forward of
one instruction into that code I think
it will step a few times so let's define
a helper function step which will
execute D s which is a single step and
when you execute a single step then
obviously the instruction point of the
CPU moves on but the current address of
radar does not update so we want to also
seek to this new address we can use s
our our IP which will seek to the value
of the register our IP cool we will use
that function in a moment so now we can
start writing the loop that will perform
these same steps over and over again so
our first step is to extract the current
bit checking rule how does this look
like we can scroll back up there where
we looked at this in gdb and look at how
this looked like an assembler so we are
somewhere before this code and what we
want to is now extract all those lines
of a sampler until we reach this jump
equal so we will define a list this s
which will hold each line then we do the
following loop we first step one
instruction forward and then use PD
which prints the disassembly of one
instruction at the current address of
radare that's why we seek to our IP in
the step function but actually we will
do PD J because that outputs JSON
information instead of just a text line
and in Python we can call this now with
CMD J which will automatically return a
Python dick to easily access this JSON
data let's quickly see if our script
works by opening a Python shell and copy
the code looks pretty good or nope
somehow it all hangs hmm we kind of
forgot to handle the input the process
is currently waiting for a key which we
can't enter I start to Google a bit and
found this so I created a round profile
that specifies that the process shall
receive this string as input we can set
this profile through radar s environment
variables
so we add this command to our script
then we can try it again to run and
indeed it now proceeds at the breakpoint
after the key input is hit now let's
continue with the script let's add the
current instruction opcode to the list
pdj returns a list of instructions so we
get the first element and then we get
the opcode value of the dictionary then
we also check if the instruction type is
a conditional jump see jump if that is
the case we reach the jump equal this
means we reach the end if the bit check
was OK it will continue the decrypt loop
afterwards this means after we break out
of this loop we have a list of
instructions and the last one is to jump
equal the one before is the binary value
and the one before that is the move that
gets the character at a certain offset
so this first instruction is the
character offset the syntax of the move
opcode has the offset plus something
after RA X so this is a clip item but it
gets the job done we split the string at
ra X and the second element of the
result minus the last character is our
offset value as a hex string now
sometimes the first character is
reference then it doesn't have a plus
hex 0 so if we got an empty string we
simply set the offset by hand to 0 then
we can convert the hex offset value to
an integer number next instruction is
the binary end value which will tell us
which bit is checked similarly like
before we can take the opcode string and
split after the comma and that is the
hex value which we can convert to an
integer cool one more thing we need now
is a variable to build our flag I'd
suggest we simply make a long list of
numbers which we then can add single bit
informations that we extract to I
initialize it to hex to 0 which is the S
key space so once we got this info we
can simply update the flag at the offset
and set this particular byte with a
binary or operation after that we can
write some code to print the current
state of the flag we loop over each
number if it's between a certain
printable ASCII range we convert it to
the ASCII character otherwise we append
a space to the output with s
odd right we can directly write to the
output because Python print appends a
new line this way we can use backslash R
instead which makes the script look
really cool the next step in our script
will be to perform the decryption if you
remember after the loop instruction we
have the jump into the decrypted code so
we could simply perform single steps
forward and check after each step if the
opcode of the current instruction is
loop
and if you found the loop instruction we
can stop
the instruction afterwards is the jump
so we can use pdj to to get the current
and the next instruction and from the
next instruction we can take the address
where it wants to jump to we can extract
that value easily thanks to the JSON
data and then add a breakpoint at this
new address next we simply continue
think we are basically done let's test
it now syntax arrows but something else
seems wrong
it stops way too quickly after only a
few rounds let's add some debugging
output that this plays out some of the
instructions when we run it now we get
the instruction that check the bits and
when you look closely you can see that
it's not always jump equal they are
actually some jump not equal so that is
the inverse of the jig we know the
normal one checked if a character is a
certain bit set to 1 the jump not equal
check will make sure that a certain bit
is not set so it's zero and we don't
have that logic yet let's write the code
we can simply check the last opcode of
the jump was jump equal and then set the
bit to one with the binary or that we
already know or if we have a jump not
equal we set the bit in the flag to zero
that's a bit more tricky but basically
you use a binary end with a bit sequence
of all ones except the one bit you want
to set to zero to get this binary
sequence you can take hex FF which is
all ones and XOR it with the bit you
want to set to zero this will produce
the bit sequence with that one bit zero
just play it through on a paper it
becomes clear but there's another
problem which is our input flag because
we specified in the run profile that
it's a fixed AAAA string which will
eventually fail the bit checks and
that's the real reason why it stopped
but we could add some code that bypasses
this check and always continue to the
next layer these conditional jumps je
and jane year are sometimes also called
jump if zero and jump if not zero the
cpu has a register that contains flags
and one of those flags is the zero flag
which will be one if the previous
calculation resulted in a zero and will
be zero if the result was non zero this
makes sense because if you want to
compare two values you can simply
subtract them from another and if the
result is zero
they were the same and the zero flag
will be set this means we always want to
make sure the zero flag is set to zero
or one whatever makes sense for the code
to continue we can set those registers
in radar during debugging with dr and
then set Z F zero flag to zero so the
jump equivalent will not jump and we can
set it to one so the jump if not equal
will not jump oh and we should remove
our debug output now let's run it and
see what will happen well um for Daria
outputs every time we hit a breakpoint
that's not pretty but does it on the
standard error output so we can simply
redirect sed arrow to death null now we
have a very pretty output the program is
running decrypt each layer extracts the
rules updates the bits in the flag and
displays it to us it slowly recovers the
flag no look so elite and there we have
it I hope you didn't peel the onion by
hand awesome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
