risk you embedded hardware CTF basically
it's about hacking an embedded device as
part of a competition and if you want
more details about it
check out the introduction video and the
playlist also at the time of releasing
this video the competition is over and
the sources should be available and you
can set up your own arduino nano board
to follow along you find some links in
the description but now let's check out
the challenge
so now that we have solved the first two
easy challenges and jumpy was already
pretty hard for me I decided to write a
little program that crossed the current
scoreboard and counts which challenges
have the most sauce this way I can see
which challenges I should be capable of
solving it looks like the photo manager
will be our next target
it's another exploitation challenge the
story here doesn't tell us any technical
information so let's head right into it
download the hex file flash it onto the
board and start a screen session to
interact with it so the first time I
approach this challenge I didn't really
follow a structured path and basically
just played around with it
I found him back quickly but then I
tried to actually solve it with the back
I found and I didn't have a good mental
picture on how to move forward basically
all my information was jumbled up it's
difficult to explain what I mean because
my solving attempt itself was so messy
that's not possible to explain my
thought process because I was none
sometimes that approaches ok because it
can be very quick if you get lucky or
know what to do but here I failed
I wasted actually like 2 to 3 hours on
that until I decided scrap all that
start over again which was the right
decision I kept turning in a circle for
the second attempt I didn't try to rush
the solution but properly structured the
attack basically we follow the
scientific method first we observe
behavior then build a mental model of
the system on which we can create
certain assumptions that we can try to
prove or get them disproven and adjust
the mental image this means we go step
by step first what can we actually do we
see a menu with two options lock-in and
memory manager with the log in we can
apparently enter some tokens of the
length eight that contain these letters
if we do that we get a welcome message
and those eight characters back there's
also a memory manager option that
displays a total memory space at the
currently used space so in our mental
model we can take note that the login
name seems to be our only input we have
so whatever our attack will be it's very
likely that it will at least start with
some login input the memory management
seems odd for now but
probably might be important information
why else will it be there we can also
enter some more characters this time
less than eight and noticed that the
previous aides are still there and we're
simply overwritten interesting maybe
useful maybe not it also didn't change
our memory usage we can also try what
happens when we enter more than eight
characters in this case I tested 16 it
did overwrite the ace but still only
eight characters are printed and again
memory usage is not affected by this
okay so we can assume some kind of fixed
global buffer for the input because we
always overwrite and work on the
previous entered data so if this is some
limited memory space let's see what
happens when you enter a lot of data I
keep the letter a press to send a lot of
it and suddenly we get a stack cookie
corrupted message awesome so the buffer
we operate on seems to be on the stack
and has a cookie at the end a stack
cookie is a simple buffer overflow
mitigation which means you place a
random value after your data which is
checked before for example the current
function returns and if the value is
still the same the cookie was not
overwritten right so no buffer overflow
took place but in this case the
application doesn't quit or reset and
thus may be not regenerate the cookie
this means we can slowly brute force the
correct value even if the cookie were
always random it might only be one or
two bytes long which we can simply guess
correct by chance because we can
automate it and let it run for a while
so to explore the state cookie further
we first need to know how long the input
has to be to override it let's write a
script we can copy some code we have
written before to interact with the
board because we still don't know what
the memory usage is for we better not
ignore it completely but keep it
information with us so we select menu
option 2 and read that data then we said
like option 1 to login and simulate the
keeping a key pressed by always only
sending one character after each
character we check if the board sent us
the corrupted cookie alert and if that
is the case we break we leave the loop
otherwise we increment the counter which
counts how many characters we have sent
at the
we can print the used memory and the
lengths we need to overwrite the cookie
when we now run it and you pay attention
you might notice that the used memory
number changed actually it changes every
time when we make a new connection with
the board and not only dead now we see
that the length that is required to hit
the stack cookie also varies doing some
simple math reveals that the memory
usage and the length required for the
overflow is correlated this means by
knowing the used memory we can calculate
now how long the input has to be to
overflow the cookie cool
so let's write a loop that brute-force
us the cookie value we don't know yet
how many bytes the cookie will be so
let's start by brute forcing the first
byte and then go from there
basically we loop over every possible by
value then wait for the menu to be
written select option 1 to lock in send
enough ace to fill the buffer plus the
character that will overwrite the cookie
actually I had that calculation you're
wrong because I never found a correct
value I sent one a too much anyhow once
we would find the character that did
return a corrupt message we can stop the
loop and use that to explore the next
byte also the loop should not start at
zero and also not include new line or
carriage return which is hex a and D
because they probably end our input
prematurely and we don't want that so
once we find the valid cookie we can
then basically use the same loop again
and brute-force the next byte after the
cookie obviously we don't know yet what
the next byte means maybe the stack
cookie is 2 bytes long or maybe is
something else so let's remove the break
here and let us see the response for all
possible bites when we run this now
you'll find the bell cookie quickly and
then go on to our right to buy it
afterwards and that byte seems to
control the length of the input see how
all writing it with one on the outputs
one a are overriding it with eight we'll
have a taste and you see that after
eight will it will start complain to say
that the input is not too long and it
does exactly the byte value again this
spite controls the length interesting no
idea yet what that could be used for but
we can update our mental model on how
the memory mate layout looks like mainly
we have to explore a couple of more
bytes and find something that could be
used for an attack
uh what the flag I'll loop finished and
it looks like the highest value for that
by T X of F or 255 in decimal triggered
the flag output that was unexpected but
I take it this change was really a good
reminder for myself that it should not
approach a challenge without a plan but
follow a structure make notes and really
think about what I'm doing once I did
that it was really straightforward there
was not even ambiguity in our mental
model each step was a logical
progression from the one before that's
like a very simple Sudoku where you
don't have to pre calculate multiple
steps in your head in order to figure
out if our values correct or not just
keep going forward step by step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
