loopback video about the recent events
first of all we will talk about the new
logo and intro then about reaching
10,000 subscribers that's why we are
doing also a small Q&amp;amp;A and then a little
bit of outlook into what's coming next
so that was a new intro some videos I've
edited before I create this so don't get
confused if we see the old one again but
what do you think about it I know it's
not the green Hecky Rabbit console thing
anymore which I used to appeal to these
people who are drawn to these
misrepresentations of hackers and show
them the correct way but I'm also kinda
sucker for these hacker stereotypes heck
the planet but I think these new style
of videos with the hand-drawn overlays
match this new intro better I think it's
more professional and future-proof let
me know what you think about it
especially constructive criticism the
channel hit 10,000 subscribers recently
which is amazing because it's such a
niche topic but that shows me that
there's real demand for this kind of
content and people appreciate it as
valuable information which makes me
really proud so now I'm going to answer
questions I got I have to say not many
people sent me questions for just a
bummer but actually I think it just
shows that you're more interested in
technical content rather than the social
youtuber interaction personality thing
which is also why I don't show a face I
want this place to be about learning new
things about computers not me no let me
do a 180 on this opinion and answer some
personal questions do you practice these
things a lot most of what I do is
practicing or learning in a way
especially playing CTF you have easy
stuff you have done before and you just
get faster or new things to practice new
tools or techniques one benefit of this
channel is it forces me to not brush
over topics but to make sure I
understand it properly so creating these
videos is very convenient practice do
you make money with those girls I work
as a freelance penetration tester or
maybe better described as an applique
Asian security analyst a look at code
and software mostly web from customers
and try to find vulnerabilities it's a
lot of fun and I'm very lucky I can do
this kind of work and it allows me to be
very flexible especially because I have
to finish my master's degree at the
University - do you have an or many
idols someone you look up for one or
more reasons everybody who is better
than me in something so that's a lot of
people there are just so many who I
admire for their contributions to this
field so that I couldn't even start a
list there is no single Idol I follow
but more of an ideal that I thrive
towards would you consider yourself
skillful cognitively gifted or both I
would say I'm not stupid
school was pretty easy with a few
exceptions like with languages but I
have seen a lot of peers understanding
things a lot faster a lot deeper than me
and I benchmark myself against these
people and you have to understand that I
spent most of my life in front of these
computers and I have days where I don't
leave the apartment and my friends are
also not really the types that
constantly do stuff so all the skill I
have I have because I spent an
inconceivable amount of time doing this
and I'm still no expert I still fail the
hard complex challenges I still don't
haven't created an iOS or browser
exploit I'm trying to catch up but it's
hard and so knowing how much time I've
spent and I've not been able to compete
with people at point one or cts shows me
that I'm not gifted and there are many
people who are much faster and better
than me
what are some things you're currently
trying to hack there's always work
related projects I can talk about or
things that will make it into a video
like the embedded hardware CTF that is
currently running so yeah when you get
exhausted during a challenge what
symptoms do you have and how do you
mitigate them usually I start turning in
a circle I try the same things over and
over again hoping it would magically
work or that I've overseen something
that is a time killer either also
sometimes just start watching YouTube
videos instead of doing doing the actual
work the best thing I do is I just take
a break I take a shower I go shopping or
I watch a TV show do you or did you at
some point play video games yeah I do
play occasionally not much for a long
time I used to play Guild Wars 2 I did
some cool acts with that maybe it's
something I can show off sometime but
because it's still a very active game I
feel a bit uncomfortable is closing it
and currently I like to play overwatch
because I can play quick rounds when my
brain needs a break
have you found any zero-day bugs yet and
if so how did you find them
I did find bugs you can consider all day
but they were nothing great
nothing world breaking not in any way
comparable to cool remote memory
corruption bugs and poplar software so
I'm still hunting for a cool one
the ones I found were mostly web related
and font during work so also something I
can't talk about at this point but
believe me nothing exciting what are you
using as your productive system I use a
macbook for most of my work with VMS as
I need them and I also have when Windows
desktop PC for editing or overwatch as
well as multiple laptops with Linux or
whatever on it but mostly I work on Mac
so now what will come next we are almost
done with exploit exercises protostar
that will be a great milestone for me
this basically means I have now a whole
series that covers basics of
exploitation which I believe is one of
the better tutorials on this topic on
the Internet I will push through this
with two videos a week on Friday and
Tuesday which I have done for a while
now but it can't keep up this pace for
much longer I spent too much time on
this and while it's fun I can't neglect
my real responsibilities too much so
with Christmas coming up and finishing
protostar I will start moving to a once
a week schedule and hopefully the one or
other video in between but ignoring this
huge disappointment we will slowly move
into modern age of exploitation with ASL
RDP and so forth also in February the
embedded hardware CTF will be over so
you will get a bunch of low-level
related videos then I current plan to
make Life overflow stickers which if
they turn out to be ok I will bring them
to the 33 c3 Congress in December and
will distribute them on the well-known
tables around the conference for people
to grab thank you all for your ongoing
support it means a lot to me that people
asked how to donate but the best thing
you can give me is to comment and share
the videos with more people who might be
interested in them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
