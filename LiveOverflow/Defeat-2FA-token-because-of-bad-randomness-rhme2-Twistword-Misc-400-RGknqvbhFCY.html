authentication is and there exist
hardware tokens for example you bikies
or even your Google Authenticator on
your phone that can generate some code
that you have to enter as additional
proof when you want to get access to
something in this video we will break a
bad two-factor implementation and learn
something about randomness
this example is a special challenge from
the risk of embedded hagia sofia it
actually has 400 points that's an insane
amount of points looking at the other
challenges that I struggled with but I
still solved it how I solve the
challenge in an unintended way which
coincidentally teaches you something
about randomness so let's head in
twist work a company is developing a new
hardware two-factor authentication token
for the employees as existing solutions
are too expensive
the development team got many complaints
about the slowness of the first version
and sometimes it was not even working
most likely this is due to resource
constraints of the u.s. board you
managed to get one of the first boards
with a new version of the system that
was given to a few users to test if it
has improved or not however is it also
secure let's have a look at how this
looks like on the board when you connect
to it it says twisted Inc secure token
earth 2.0 debug build again a message
that they change the algorithm
presumably made it now smaller and maybe
more insecure and then they ask for your
two-factor authentication token now
would be the moment you take your actual
hardware token generate the key and hand
it in if it matches the one the board
calculated you get in but when you enter
an incorrect one it will tell you what
the token was that is expected that will
be very helpful so what can we do well
one of the first things that comes to
mind is Mersenne twister because of the
title twist word the Mazon twister is a
pseudo-random number generator this
means you give it some kind of seed and
then it will scramble flip twist around
the bits if you so wish in order to
create a new random state to the random
because it's not truly random the same
seed will produce the same values but
it's random enough for a lot of
applications and actually with
two-factor tokens you want pseudo-random
generators because the token generator
as well as a service you want to access
has to generate the same
you so it can be compared right also
when you scroll a bit further down you
can read that the algorithm in its
native form is not cryptographically
secure the reason is that observing a
sufficient number of iterations 624 in
the case of mt 1 1937 since this is the
size of the state vector from which the
iterations are produced allows one to
predict all future iterations so this
must end Twister can be implemented with
different values and parameters and mt 1
99037 defines one such implementation i
assume that for this challenge i use
their own parameters and you have to
research how this attacks works how you
can recover the state with enough
samples another idea I had was that
randomness is really difficult to do for
computers they are deterministic
machines that just execute instructions
there's nothing random about them so
what you can do is you can try to
collect entropy from different sources
on PCs you S&amp;amp;C that they tell you to
move your mouse a lot because that
movement is hard to predict but what do
you do on an Arduino I assume one of the
most likely ways would be to read an
analog value from one of the pins you
know reading a digital state would be a
0 or 1 but the Arduino can also read
analog values from some pins well it
uses an ADC analog to digital converter
to convert the voltage at one pin to the
digital number if the pins are not
connected it could pick up interference
from the background radio noise or
something and that's pretty random so
maybe you just have to pull all pins to
ground so make them zero this way the
initial random seed would always are
often be the same I thought that's a
cool attack but I felt like for 400
points it would actually be harder than
that so I assumed it's about cracking
the math of it in order to do this I
first want to start with capturing a lot
of tokens that I can later work with the
board is so nice to respond with the
expected token so I wrote two scripts
one would connect via serial and then
just enter a wrong string and collect
all the expected tokens and the second
script I wrote would always reset the
serial connection which resets the board
and should newly initialize the peer
energy I figured that maybe I can learn
something interesting about the initial
States in this data collection takes a
while especially the method with
resetting the serial is very slow so I
let the data collection and run
overnight the next morning I did a first
quick check of the data I didn't expect
much because I was sure the real work
now just started having to research how
to recover the initial state and the
data just helps testing so it's casually
looking over it if I notice anything and
what the one of the files contains
a duplicate value this cannot be the
case these numbers are so big that a
duplicate is highly unlikely in fact
there were a couple of duplicates
something is fishy if this is about
calculating the state of the PRG and
predicting the next value this wouldn't
happen so I went the easy way I modified
my script - now just send this one
duplicate value all the time also a peer
energy like I said earlier starts with
the seed and then all the following
values are predictable if you know the
implementation and parameters this means
when we got a duplicate value the next
expected toking should have been also
the same so if I had saved the first two
expected tokens after board reset and I
had encountered the same first token a
second time I could have just used the
previous expected second token and win
so let's write a script for that and let
it run overnight and I'm sure I get
another duplicate this is a script I
wrote these functions you know them
already just helped me to interact with
the board to read what text it sends me
the most important variable here is a
list of tokens I encountered before and
at the beginning it's empty I also will
write every top compare that I see to a
file so that when I interrupt the script
I can simply reload previous tokens I
collected to not lose any data and
that's what I do here so I rerun this a
couple of times it just adds the
I found before to the top lowest anyway
in an endless loop I then create a fresh
connection with the board then I wait
until I get the text that I have to
press Enter
then I read until it wants me to enter a
token and send one of the duplicates I
got the audio maybe I get lucky but most
of the times I won't so then I read the
token that was expected now I extract
the token and check in my tokens list if
I encounter the top before if I did I
know what the next token will be if it's
new I will just enter an empty token and
get the next expected token which I also
extract and save it together with the
first token in the tokens list and down
here I have some fancy debug output so
theoretically this should just work it
will just take a while in my case I
think it ran for three hours or so and
then it found a duplicate so my script
sent the token it would expect
afterwards and surprise surprise it's
the correct token and we get the flag
now that was way easier than I thought
it was also not the intended solution
but it really highlights how hard it is
to properly initialize the PRG with a
truly random seed in this small Arduino
I don't know how they try to get this
good random seed value but it clearly
didn't work randomness is not trivial
for computers lessons learned by the way
there was another small annoyance with
this challenge so when I found my first
applicant it didn't work I saw that I
predicted the correct value because the
second expected token was the same but
it didn't work and it was an issue with
the line endings let me explain what
happened it basically comes down to not
being really user friendly and flexible
regarding input but basically it
expected 32 bytes of input followed by
some kind of terminator like when you
press ENTER typically that could be a
newline or a carriage return or even a
newline and a carriage return so in this
case it only expected a carriage return
so there are basically two stages when
communicate
the buffer and the data that is actually
handled so at first I sent a carriage
return and the new line so the battle
was filled with this data and then the
application read 32 bytes for the token
and the carriage return and that meant
it was done now it asks for the second
token now the new line was still in this
buffer it was never read by the
application so now I supplied the second
token which got written into the buffer
and when the application then read 32
bytes the first byte was a new line
so obviously the expected token and the
one I sent were not correct this was
really frustrating but they got a hint
regarding the issue and then I was able
to solve it at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
