more annoying the goal is to open a
pop-up in the background pop under the
current window so that you won't see it
until you want to close your browser and
you don't know which side created it
creating a pop under used to be fairly
easy because there are actually
functions called blur and focus which
exists solely to focus an element with
focus or prevent focus with blur so you
would blur the pop-up window you open
and focus the current main window and
the technique still works in for example
edge but chrome will always try to focus
the new window that's preventing
pop-unders but it did some research into
this and found the demo site that
actually is able to create a pop under
which obviously caught my attention the
sky even sells a license for JavaScript
library that can create pop-unders in
any browser and ad networks pay good
money for it so want to know how the
script manages to do a pop under on
chrome 59 as other libraries can't do
that so I started to analyze it
let's check out the demo for the
pop-under I click the link and yes
indeed here is a pop under let's try to
figure out how it's done obviously one
of the first ideas is to look into the
sources the solution should be right
there but shortly after you open the
developer tools a debugger statement
triggers a breakpoint
you can't just continue as this is
constantly called on a timer it's an
anti debugging attempt you can disable
breakpoints entirely but then that also
prevents you from setting breakpoints in
the sources themselves and you may would
want that for debugging so that's
annoying but first let's look generally
at the script the main page loads a
loader JS file which loads three other
scripts scripts chairs licensed images
and demo J's
let's have a quick look at each of those
demo J's seems to be the script
potential client would use it configures
the better J's pop module and allows
developers to react on before and after
popup creation otherwise not much else
is there
the real functionality is probably in
better J's pop itself licensed demo
could be interesting in how licensing
works but when you look at the code it's
heavily obfuscated even if you pretty
print it it's completely rubbish code
and script Egeus which is presumably the
main script looks similar there are some
easy functions and nonsensical functions
which you can clean up like these here
just return the argument or perform
simple operation but even if you clean
it up it still looks terrible and it's
long so how do we figure out what it
does I will go now over the path I took
but it would be awesome to hear from you
how you would have approached it as I'm
sure there are many different techniques
to go about this and I don't know if I
know them all so the first thing I did
was mirror the whole site locally I
didn't really test it but I assumed if
they put so much effort into licensing
for the mains and have a demo here that
these scripts will check the
they are loaded from and won't function
properly if loaded from somewhere else
so you can't simply use the demo on your
site that's why I not only downloaded
each file and place it in the same path
but also modified etc' hosts to point
the domain to localhost this way when I
visit the site again it attempts to load
it from one to seven zero zero one which
means we can start a simple PHP or
Python server on port 80 and load the
site in the browser and make a small
modification to the local file and
remove the embedded video and image and
clean up the site a bit now you can
easily see that it loads this version
instead of the live web version so the
reason why I want a local mirror is that
I have all the freedom of modifying and
playing around with it but where do I
really start now in theory in the end
the JavaScript code will have to call
the main API functions functions like
windows open and windows the timeout or
like create element or appendchild but
we can't easily search for this in the
script as these calls are heavily
obfuscated but we can try to hook or
proxy or intercept those calls this way
we can learn more about what's happening
I'm using a proxy object for this it's
like a web proxy that sits between you
and your destination a proxy object in
JavaScript sits between the caller and
the actual function target the proxy
object is used to define custom behavior
for fundamental operations for example
property lookup assignments enumeration
or function invocation so now I'm
defining a handler function that can be
used to intercept and lock all the
function calls
then I can override functions I want
with a proxied version and because we
want to learn more about pop-ups I
wanted to intercept window open which is
the function to open the pop-up oh and I
write this code before the loader loads
the other scripts so it can override any
functions it would use I disable the
breakpoints and reload the page but when
I click the link I don't see any call to
open which is super weird but then the
console I noticed two deprecation
warnings and one of them is interesting
deprecation using the notification api
from an iframe is deprecated will be
removed and chrome will stick to one
around September 2013 you will consider
requesting permissions from the table
frame or opening a new window instead
wait that's so weird
first why the heck does it call the
notification API what does it have to do
with the pop-up and what's up with the
iframe I feel like this must be a key
component some kind of trick to achieve
a pop under hmmm as there are no iframes
in the HTML code let's see if we can
hook the dynamic creation of those
iframes it probably uses the create
element append child and remove child
functions to achieve that so let's proxy
these as a pen child could be called on
any HTML element I can use the prototype
of the general element object to
overwrite the function for all elements
if we reload the page now we can already
see that it works for some dip but let's
see what happens when you click the link
I look at that it creates an iframe
unfortunately we can't inspect what the
I prime is for because later the iframe
is removed with removed child around
this time I start to get really curious
about the stuff that pops up briefly so
weird so I decided to record it in order
to slow it down and see what happens
when you go step by step you first
notice a pop up when your being opened
in the bottom right corner so the user
might not really notice it then the
notification permission request pops up
and around the same time an alert box is
shown with chrome PDF viewer what the
 and then they disappear again what
the heck is going on at this point I
realize what seems to be the basic idea
behind all of this to create a pop under
you somehow want to get the main window
back and focus and it looks like with
this weird combination of notification
requests in alert box you can get back
the focus of the main window
knowing this let's move on with some
debugging the removed child prevents us
from inspecting the iframe as it's gone
by that point so instead of calling
remove child that's all write it with a
custom function we could use the proxy
object and not call the original
function but I just wanted to show
another method how you can change the
behavior of something a proxy object is
cleaner but this works also well so now
instead of removing an element we log
the element and try to remove and let's
try it again and it looks like that
removed child was necessary to remove
the notification permission request and
the alert box because they stay now here
but you can also look now into the
iframe hmm it basically just defines a
function mkp which cause window open
that's the trick used why we couldn't
proxy window open because here they will
dynamically create an iframe and use its
clean new default window open function
stet this is not meant to throw up
analysis it's actually a simple pop-up
blocker bypass some basic blockers
simply override window opened like I
attempted to do and with this trick you
can get back the original window open
function so it's just a bypass for
simple popup blockers you can also check
that window mkp which I guess stands for
make pop-up exists here in our global
scope pointing it window open so clever
but let's move on because a few steps
later there is a second iframe created
and if we look into that one we see that
it executes a script that request
notification permissions so that's why
we get the deprecation warning here not
sure yet why notification permissions
are requested but now we know when and
where they do it at this point I felt I
understand what was going on more and
more and I started playing around with
since knowledge myself doing simple
tests I first opened a new window and
then caused a notification permission
request as it turns out with a
notification request chrome focuses the
main window again but once the user
clicks this box away the focus goes back
to the other window and two things to
observe here first we get focus of the
main window which is exactly what we
want
question is just how to keep it second
problem how do you remove the
notification requests again
automatically both shouldn't be really
possible but we know that remove child
with an iframe could be the solution so
we can try that first we create the
iframe and append it to the dom then we
execute the JavaScript in the iframe and
after that use a timeout to wait 3
seconds and remove it again and testing
that shows that it works but what's up
with the PDF message we see when you
think about it
it kind of looks like an alert box so
let's play a bit more with our tests to
remove the iframe with the notification
for now and instead call alert and we
get the same behavior the main window
gains focus because of the alert but as
soon as the user clicks it away for
because is restored to the pop-up
unfortunately a simple iframe won't help
here to remove the alert box because
alert blocks and pauses everything but
anyway we can try to combine these two
now like we saw in the slowed down video
and so we trigger the notification
permission request then we wait a bit
with the set time out and trigger an
alert and then we wait a bit longer and
remove the notification again let's run
it
and when we now close the alert by hand
and the notification request is
automatically removed surprisingly the
pop-up window stays in the background
the main window is kept in focus so last
question is how do they now remove the
alert box automatically it looks like
the alert is triggered from the PDF
viewer it said please wait so soon maybe
it happens if you load a huge PDF also I
did some tests but it didn't work out I
also couldn't find useful information
about the weighting dialog online so I
decided to take a step back and analyze
the demo further and besides the iframes
there is another element created an
embedded object that defines a data URI
of the media type PDF and basically for
encoding so we can decode that and find
the raw PDF file which contains a
JavaScript app alert please wait
so it also calls alert just from a PDF
and that's the trick because that alert
box can be closed again by removing the
embedded PDF from the Dom to not steal
anybody else's code we can also create
our own minimal PDF that cause alert and
convert it to basics before now
everything falls into place we first
open a new window then dynamically embed
a PDF with an app alert and create an
iframe that requests notification
permissions and after a short moment we
then remove the iframe and the embedded
PDF again and that's it if it doesn't
work then maybe you have the timing
wrong it's not 100% reliable but wow we
created a pop under what is interesting
hopefully chroma fixes so I don't have
to experience these annoying pop-unders
anymore
