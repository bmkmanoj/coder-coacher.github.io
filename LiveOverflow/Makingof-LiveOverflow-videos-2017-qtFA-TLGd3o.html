video making process and since then I
made several changes and improved it so
I wanted to give you an update on that
so it's easier for you to start making
CTF video write-ups I'm not saying
that's how you should do it but I will
tell you about my experience and why I
do it this way so if you consider making
videos I think I can give you some
valuable information here and then you
can come up with your own process
so the process changes slightly
depending on the topic but in this case
here I will cover a CTF video right now
the CTF challenge is from the Google CTF
2017 there was a hard challenge called
1/7 gql first of all I moved away from
Sony Vegas to Adobe Premiere because I
was hoping and had better integration
with Photoshop to draw my overlays to
improve my videos well that didn't turn
out to be true but I still think the
move was worth it doing any missions
like moving graphics and rotating them
and so forth directly in Premiere is
much easier than in Vegas but drawing
and making the graphics for it is still
not integrated into each other very well
and another downside is that Adobe
products cost quite a bit per month but
I really enjoy making those videos so
it's worth investing into my hobby ok so
I start with the template that has the
intro animation as well as the outro
already in there and then I add the
recordings I made with OBS during the
CTF then I go over each video file and
label it with a challenge it was about
so the first problem is that CTF
challenges take time and are often a
mess
I don't record 12 hours of my screen and
then try to extract 10 minute of content
from it and even more important is that
the recording is not really optimized
for video right up I use a big screen
resolution sometimes multiple screens
and multiple devices it's just enough
great footage I will get into that a
little bit later when we come to editing
so usually I always record a little bit
during the CTF when I have a feeling I
made substantial progress in this way I
also don't forget my steps then I open
up a Google Doc for the script and start
going through the footage and start
writing a 7vq l was a hard miss charge
and so forth while writing I already
tried to imagine how I would show that
with a video and I think about what
errors I like to include and what I will
leave out what I would like to focus
more and and what is unimportant trying
to come up with a nice story so some
videos become more base
others become more advanced and usually
I aim for about three pages in Google
Docs with Arial font 11 that will create
a nine to twelve minute video so I
continue writing my script check and
verify some stuff and try to find the
parts in the recording and so for now I
am already a page in and I basically
just started with the challenge so start
to wonder if I can cover it in three
pages in this case there's quite a bit
of code we have to read and understand
and it's always a bit tricky for a video
when you do the challenge yourself you
spend a lot of time reviewing the code
and maybe comment everything
maybe you extract pieces and run them on
their own but for a video you have to
keep it short and kind of point out only
important part but that could mean the
audience doesn't understand the
application at all so that's just
something to keep in mind and it's
difficult to balance after a while the
first draft is done way over my three
page limit now I use a timer and read
the script out loud again fix some minor
grammar or flow issues and check the
length looks like this video is going to
be a bit longer now I have to decide
make two parts and flesh these out more
or make one longer part this one is hard
because it's right there at the border
so I decide to go with one video for now
I could always split it later when I
feel like the script is done I go back
to Premiere and record my voiceover and
fYI up until here took me about three
hours now I start to assemble the video
and edit it like I mentioned earlier the
video recordings from during the CTF are
often shitty tabbing around having
personal information in notifications
visible small funds crowded terminals
this means I usually reenact most of the
stuff again so for example I want to
record how I researched or Westbay seven
again some things to consider when
recording footage try to match the
aspect ratio of the video with your
windows a small trick to do that is use
some kind of image or the video preview
to make clean browser window in the
perfect 16 to 9 aspect ratio
try to light the font big enough that it
could be read without full-screen or
high quality there are a lot of mobile
phone users out there typing is always
slow speed those parts up and have very
determined mouse movements try to not
include the spelling mistakes and
corrections try to focus as much on what
you want them to see and minimize
unnecessary information if you are
typing in terminal try to leave a border
at the bottom are always clear the
terminal so you write at the top because
when you pause in YouTube the bar stays
on top and covers up what you type super
annoying I like with any write up you
have to clean up your code that's
another big reason why using the footage
from during the CTF is so bad it's
always messy at some point I'm done
arranging and editing the video in
Premiere because I had to reenact and
record so many things and look through
footage it probably took me around four
hours but I'm not fully done yet
first I had to export the video in
Premiere and then open it in Photoshop
yep you heard me right I open the video
in Photoshop because Photoshop can do
video editing and this is pretty cool to
draw my overlays so basically I go on or
through the video and create layers on
which I can draw with my graphics tablet
and it's super easy and chill and goes
pretty fast
that's basically my secret of doing my
overlays unfortunately I can't animate
stuff here so I can't animate moving
graphics also if I planned to do that
then I usually create the graphics first
and import them into premiere but it's
pretty tedious I really would like to
better process here because animations
would be really cool then I render the
video and photo shop which is buggy
because sometimes the audio in the
beginning cuts out which apparently
happens when the disc can't read the
video source file fast enough and I have
the footage on a huge hard drives not an
SSD so what you can do is quickly play
the video with VLC but then it seems to
be in memory or so and then I have no
problems anyway this part took me about
an hour so so it's pretty fast next
is uploading so going to YouTube oh good
well is streaming right now better go
watch this instead
after procrastinating but also learning
awesome new stuff I finally do the
upload and create a thumbnail for it
then some other small stuff has to be
done like adding the transcript for the
subtitles and adding the endcard if you
pay attention to the upload date and
look when I publicly released it you can
see that quite some time passed I
actually always have videos in the
pipeline when I made this video I hit
six unreleased videos which means I have
a buffer for over a month and that's
important to me because I always have
bursts of motivation and I go crazy a
few days making videos and then I need a
break again and for example in the
recent weeks I had a ton of work and was
travelling and couldn't make any videos
so now I have only two videos left
that's also the reason why I don't
really make up-to-date news videos often
basically there was only the Nintendo
switch in the dirty cow video I made it
feels really good to release a video
consistently every week but they don't
want to have the anxiety and the
pressure to create another video I can
go comfortably on vacation or just play
a game without feeling guilty
my mind it's Mach overall you can see it
takes me about one full day to create a
video without the time it took me to
solve the challenge or research the
topic in the first place it would care
less in making the footage look good or
not write a script and be good of just
talking and improvising it could be a
lot faster but that's how I like to do
it right now and I'm curious how I
change my process over the next year in
my videos have changed a lot from when I
started I hope it helps I want to see
more CTF video write-ups</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
