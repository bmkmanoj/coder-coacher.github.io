program from previous part just in a
different language the C program got
compiled by a compiler into machine code
that can be executed directly Python on
the other hand is an interpretive
language to understand the difference I
try to make an abstract example you can
imagine a program written in C as a
machine build for very specific tasks
and Python itself is such a machine
written in C but it's a special machine
like a robot if you want which is built
to interpret different language of code
Python code so in a trivialized sense
somebody wrote a C code in a file Python
C then use GCC like in the previous
video to compile the source code into a
binary with the name Python you can see
that when you use the tool file to
display file information when you use
file on our C program matrix from last
time it says it's an elf executable and
when you do the same for the Python
program it also says that it's an elf
executable now when you execute the
python program you will get a prompt
where you can enter text and python will
interpret the text for you
or just path multiple commands in a
Python script and it will execute it I
hope that makes a little bit more sense
now so let's create a new Python script
called matrix Pi alongside we will also
open our previous code to compare it we
can do that with vim by specifying both
filenames with a - capital o this tells
them to open the files split vertically
now check if the cursors in the correct
document if not you can use ctrl W and
then arrow left or right to switch
between the views now enter the insert
mode by pressing I and let's get started
in Python we don't have to specify main
function the code will be just executed
sequentially from the start of the file
to the end to access the command-line
argument RV we have to import a Python
module called sis with Princess RGB we
can print the content of this variable
so let's see how the search stored Arg V
variable looks like first we save the
file with escape : w then you can use :
exclamation mark to execute a command
for example LS you will see that the
editor disappeared into the background
and it displays the result of the LS
command so let's use that to execute our
Python program go back by pressing enter
: exclamation mark python to start
piloting and as a first argument we
specify the script name which is matrix
py instead of writing the name you can
also just use percentage mem will
automatically replace the percentage
sign with the current file name you can
now see that the first argument was
matrix py like I explained in the last
video the arguments passed through the
program start with the program file name
now let's add a few arbitrary arguments
a normal one one with quotes one with
spaces and just a couple of more words
maybe even with more spaces in between
them just to see what happens okay so
here's the output so the brackets
indicate that it's a list and the
elements are comma separated and each
element is a string
starting with the file name and the
stuff replaced afterwards I hope that
makes command-line arguments a bit more
clearer okay now to the check if we have
two arguments we don't need a counter of
arguments like Arc C we can just check
if the length of the suits are B list is
equal to two note that Python doesn't
use curly braces to define a context
like and C we have to use indentation ah
when I press tab I get tabs which is
ugly I prefer everything to be filled
with simple spaces so you can use set
expand tab with Shift with equal to four
soft tab stop equal to four now we get
four spaces when we press tab so let's
print the first argument with print and
Python special format string syntax we
can exactly do the same like we didn't
see inside the string with curly braces
we define which following format string
parameter shall we place there and we
start counting with zero and obviously
our first formal parameter will be the
second item of the re list now we do the
else case and to print to standard error
we have to access standard error
derivative through the source model so
sis dot standard error dot right and
then again the usage expression with the
curly braces with a zero to indicate
that here should be the first parameter
and the first format variable is the
first element of the arc violist
which is the file name note that the
simple print doesn't need the backslash
n for new line but the write needs it
that's because Python says that printing
with a new line at the end is pretty
common so let's do that automatically if
I reprint but if you use a bit more
low-level access function then we have
to edit ourselves also the fact that we
use write to output text should pique
your curiosity
sounds like writing to a file well
everything is a file as you may remember
from the Linux introduction video so
keep that in mind when we talk about
this a little bit later ok it looks done
let's test it save it and quit BIM to
fully close them you obviously have to
close two views so you have to do the
: q2 times now execute the matrix or pi
with python matrix dot pi and it works
just like IOC program if you don't want
to type Python before your Python script
all the time we can do something about
that open the script again and create a
new line above the import remember how
you can press o instead of I to enter
the insert mode which creates a new
empty line below your cursor guess what
happens when you use shift o and creates
a new empty line above your cursor and
enters insert mode now a chi bang with
the path to the Python binary there's
also a nice Wikipedia entry about
shipping so check that out this line
tells the program loader that this is a
script that should be executed with
Python so it basically does Python
matrix of Pi for us now we can execute
it like our C program by using the path
to the Python script Oh
permission denied what's that let's have
a look at the permissions LS - l 8 to
display all files along with their
permissions but also use matrix star
this basically means that it should
display all files that start with matrix
and anything can then follow when we
compare our matrix binary with the
matrix python script we notice that it
has a couple of X X stands for
executable but our file only has R and W
which stands for read and write
permissions so to be allowed to execute
it we have to add the execution
permissions to that file we can use
chmod for that which stands for change
mode bits for a file remember to always
check out the main page to learn more
about those commands so now we can use
change mode plus eggs and the file name
to add the execution permissions we will
now list the files we can see that we
have this expression
but before we continue let me quickly
talk about the tab-completion I
mentioned this in the very first video
briefly but maybe it's a good moment to
talk about it a bit more
tap completion is extremely handy for
example when I start typing the current
path with dash and hit tab twice it
shows me all possible files that could
follow so we want matrix so let's just
type one letter m and hit tap again now
it will automatically fill in matrix
because there are multiple matrix files
it has stopped at the part where they
start to differ double tap to display
all the options now edit dot which makes
the only available option left matrix py
tap again and regard the whole filing I
use Python a lot almost anything I
program I write in Python so most of my
examples will be written in Python and
it's also language I highly recommend to
learn in general so maybe check out code
Academy's Python courses or just Google
yourself before we finish let's keep our
system updated type sudo apt-get update
to update the package list from your
repository
and then up get upgrade to install new
versions for software you have installed
this may take a while if you have never
done it or haven't done it in a while
you should always keep your system
up-to-date and you should preach that to
your family members even if they are
annoyed at the windows update make sure
that the systems are always up to date
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
