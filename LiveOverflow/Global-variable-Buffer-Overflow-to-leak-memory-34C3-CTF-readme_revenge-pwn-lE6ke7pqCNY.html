34 c 3 CTF and in the end 30 teams
solved it difficulty easy ish you can't
only if I don't use lip see right right
we can download the binary here and this
was the IP and port to interact with the
challenge when I read the title I knew
immediately I had to try it you see two
years ago at the 32 C 3 CTF that was a
challenge called just read me back then
I tried to solve it but failed after the
CTF was over I looked at the write-ups
from other people and tried to
understand it and even made a video
about it and two years ago I did not
have the skill knowledge or experience
to solve it so when I saw that there is
a read me revenge at the 3043 CTF I just
felt like I had to solve it it was my
personal challenge and in some way it
was very close to my heart it was a
challenge I failed two years ago and now
I can prove to myself that I improved so
let's have a look at it
like I said the challenge reminded me of
this older challenge and I assumed it
was pretty similar and it was easy to
verify for that challenge you didn't
have to get code execution but the flag
was actually embedded in the file and if
you look at the strings of the binary
you can see a placeholder flag so the
binary running on the server contains
the real flag instead and that is also
where the name comes from readme your
task is to read or leak this flag from
the target binary the solution of the
original rickman challenge was super
creative and really blew my mind at the
time so I encourage you to watch it
because I had that knowledge in the back
of my mind when approaching this
challenge so while it was obviously not
the same challenge it was a revenge of
the readme challenge it was similar in
many ways so I had a pretty good idea
already but let's check it out when we
run it the program waits for input and
then greets us with highlife overflow by
so it just reflects what we write I
immediately checked for format string
vulnerability and entered a format
string modifier like percentage x but it
didn't do anything I also just write a
long input and to my surprise I
immediately got a segfault well that's a
good start
let's look at it in gdb so I run the
binary with the long input fYI if you
don't know why my gdb looks so colorful
it's because I used pone debug gdb
extension but that was my second
surprise the binary had all the symbols
still included so we get all the
function names that's neat
so where did we crash we got a sec fault
in print F inside of Lib C to be more
precise in parse one sec come I don't
know that's weird the instruction that
costs the seg fault is a compare where
it calculates an address based on our ax
and our DX and our ax is clearly
overwritten with a z' so I try to access
bad memory I didn't let's see does this
mean printf of flip C has a puff
overflow vulnerability well we will see
let's have a look at me disassemble main
it's super short
have a scanf to read in a variable
called name and then we call printf with
that name there's a small but important
detail here with the variable name
usually local variables are placed on
this step so they are referenced as
offsets from the stack pointer make
sense right
but in this case the variable is stored
at an offset from the instruction
pointer our ap this means it's not on
the stack if it's an offset of the
instruction pointer so an offset to the
binary itself this means it's a global
variable stored in a data segment you
can see here gdb has already calculated
or resolved as address for us our IP at
this point would be this address plus
this offset here so hex 6b7 3 e 0 and if
we look at the virtual memory map of
this process we see that this address is
in here it says it would be heap but I'm
not sure why it says that because I'm
pretty sure that's not a heap if we look
at the sections defined in the elf
binary with object dump we can see that
the address belongs to BSS which is used
for statically allocated variables
anyway let's go back to the crash if we
look now at the location where name is
stored we can print the memory here we
see that there was a bit of a size
allocated for the name however we wrote
much mores than that because we have all
the symbols we can also see which
variables we have all written so we
overrode DL static D TV Airy no idea
what that is we all ripped the a lazy
variable I mean we have killed a lot of
stuff and apparently Lipsy printf
referenced something from in here hmm we
have a very clear buffer overflow and we
overflow global variables and many of
those variables are Lipsy internal
variables the binary was statically
built with Lipsy which means the whole
Lib C functions are part of this binary
that's the reason why those variables
are part of our binary data segment
usually when dynamically referencing and
loading Alip see these variables would
be located in the dynamically loaded
lips in memory anyway here we have found
the vulnerability so how can we turn
that now into
reading the flag from memory clearly
just blindly overriding data doesn't
work so let's do this systematically
I wanted to carefully control what I
override so let's take a snapshot off
the memory without an overflow to do
this I set a breakpoint at the end of
main then I rerun it with a small input
and then I print the memory starting at
name in four byte or 32-bit chunks
I just keep enter pressed until I
reached the end so now I can get a huge
list with all the memory and the symbol
names then I copy the whole thing into
sublime and use some text editor hotkey
magic to quickly reformat this data I'm
removing all the pony back prompts
making it all Python comment and then
taking the memory value in the end I
want to rebuild the whole memory with
the correct values so I will use a
buffer variable where I will append the
raw bytes and in a second I will define
a new function P 32 that will convert
this memory value to raw bytes I can do
this with import struct and then struct
or tack with a capital I for 32-bit
values I will also create a function B
64 because we have a 64 bit binary so
might come in handy as well so now this
Python script prints the whole memory
cool theoretically if we use this to
overflow the buffer it will overwrite
the memory with completely safe values
basically not changed anything and
indeed it seems to have worked and we
didn't get a sec fault but now comes the
true challenge what do we overwrite that
could help us to leave the flag from
memory well I didn't know in the old
readme challenge we smashed the stack
cookie in a buffer overflow on the stick
which executed the stack smashing
detection function that function would
print the program name and the program
name is referenced from a pointer on the
stack and so overriding that pointer
with the same overflow on the stack with
the address of the flag caused the flag
to be printed when a stack got smashed
so I kept that inspiration in mind so
it's just going through the symbols one
by one and try to find one that sounds
interesting
the aesthetic DTV
Lawton foulest DTV gaps TLS generation
domain binding ket counter exit function
called prefetch multiple threads debug
nothing immediately jumps out to me
oh let's see are gree and Lipsy argh see
so there's a pointer to oxy and RV as
well and keep that in mind the old
reitman challenge also used an overflow
of the program nine pointer to point it
to the flag so might be useful again
this all means nothing to me
nothing screams hey I print you a flag
if you change me but then have reached a
printf function table and function table
always screams changed me and you can
read a record execution but why is there
such a thing as a printf function table
if we look up this in ellipses source
code we can maybe learn more about it a
comment here says array of functions
indexed by format character and in here
is also a function called register
printf specifier so if we google for
that function we can quickly find that
there are such a thing as customizing
printf the GNU C library lets you define
your own custom conversion specifiers
for printf template strings to teach
printf clever ways to printf the
important data structures of your
program the way you do this is by
registering the conversion with the
function register printf function let's
read up a bit more about this the
function takes a spec a handler function
and an arc info function if spec is
capital y it defines a conversion for
percentage capital y you can redefine
the built-in conversion like percentage
s and the handler function is a function
called by printf and friends when this
conversion appears in the template
string the info function is the function
called by parse printf format when this
conversion appears in the template
string that sounds perfect our printf
template string contains a percentage s
if we somehow could redefine the
conversion for percentage s we could
define our own handler function and
could execute any code we want i mean we
can't really call register printf
function but we could maybe
we'll write and modify the underlying
table directly if we look again into the
source code of the register printer
function we can maybe figure out how it
would work if we want to redefine
percentage s so we would pass in a small
SS spec and would give it a function as
converter and arcinfo
and down here it simply uses spec as an
offset into printf function table in
print of our info table that sounds easy
we know there is a pointer to the printf
function table in memory that we can
overwrite so we could point it to some
other memory and that memory should then
have a function redefined at the every
position small s so that would be offset
hex 7/3 or entry number 163 in decimal
cool let's try that first let's look for
some memory error we could abuse for
this let's try here
PL static D TV let's hope it's not
important so now we want to override the
printf function table to a point there
let's try it out we write it into a file
set a breakpoint in gdb and use the file
as input now let's see the memory oh
it's not there but it should be there
this is the stuff that could drive you
crazy but you need to chill and approach
it logically so the overflow happens
because of a scanf the scanf used
percentage s to read input so let's
check out the main page of scanf the
scanf family of functions scans input
according to format as described below s
measures a sequence of non whitespace
characters the input string stops at
whitespace aha
so maybe our memory dump contains some
white space so what are typical
whitespace characters of course hex to 0
a regular space as a whitespace
character but also a new line would be a
problem and basically all of these so
hex 0 9 hex 0 a b c and d so let's make
sure that these can't a corne our buffer
i just add a few lines of code to
replace these with a regular capital X
let's try it out
Oh SEC fault ok we clearly did something
now let's check out the memory
and yep there is our value but wait
that's not quite right y5 8 at the end o
our address had a space - well good we
caught that
so let's point it at 2 4 instead cool
next we want to try to set a function
for percentage s so from our new table
address we have to get the error entry
for s q value S which is hex 7/3 which
means we have to take that times 8
because we are on 64-bit so each array
entry each function address is 8 bytes
wide cool so let's go to that address
and write there a test value let's see
if we successfully redirect code
execution rerun it with the input but
seg fault let's look at the code why and
try to calculate our CX plus our DX
times 8 hey that looks almost like what
we just calculated our DX is also in
fact hexane 3 so the letter S but our c
x is 0 so this calculation points to bad
code but why is that happening
didn't we override the function table
entry with a value it shouldn't be 0 but
if we look at the disassembly of this
function we see that it references the
arc info table just before it ha we
didn't modify that so once we point a
debt to the same address we can try it
again both tables should be ok no it's
rerunning with that and we get a sec
fault add a call our ax and our ax is
the value we wanted it to be awesome so
what to do next
I feel thought about pointing it to
printf and maybe we can somehow control
the first parameter - based on how this
printf modifier function is called but
then decided to use the technique I have
learned from the old readme challenge
using stack check fail let's get the
address of that function that could work
but to print the flag we also have to
control the program named pointer and
pointer to the flag but remember there
was some kind of ugly pointer in there
tool previously it pointed into the
environment variables on the stack so
let's
pointed somewhere else here and this is
now a list of argument string pointers
and so the first point that has to point
to the program name so we pointed to the
flag instead this is the address of flag
in the file I am excited will this work
now we pipe the exploit output into a
readme revenge and boom stack smashing
detected and here's our flag so what we
did was we overflowed the printf
modification table and really find what
to do when printf encounters a
percentage s upon finding the percentage
s it took the address of our modified
function table which pointed to stack
check fail instead that function is then
executed and gets a program name to show
it in an error message but we also
modified the pointer to the program
arguments argue me and pointed the
program name which is the first argument
to the flag
so the arab printed the flag and here is
a screenshot from when i did that during
the CTF to grab the real flag printf is
so fun sometimes i'm so proud of myself
because this really shows me how much
I've learned in the past two years and
how I improved back then I would have
not been able to solve this but now I
did pretty straightforward makes me feel
really good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
