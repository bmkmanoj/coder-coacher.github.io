this can only mean one thing it's a
board from the embedded hardware CTF by
rescuer so let's see what's in there we
got a couple of stickers very nice and
an anti-static bag with the Arduino
board let's remove the staple and see
inside
so we got a couple of connectors that we
can solder to the board and the board
itself as you can see the board has a
mini USB connector a reset button for
LEDs and several connectors we should
solder these connectors to the board in
order to be able to more easily attach
cables if needed and we can stick it
onto a breadboard to solder the board I
use a third hand that holds the board
for me I apply some soldering flux which
helps and then I simply apply some
solder so now we got the long row please
don't judge my solder job I know it's a
bit crooked I don't do this a lot and
then we turn the board around and
connect the other six pins to stick out
the other direction once we are done we
can place the Arduino board on a
convenient breadboard which is great to
attach other wires and so forth but
turns out I suck at soldering and it's
so crooked that I can't really get the
board and so I use a paper towel to
cushion the pressure a bit and apply
some force to get it in there then I do
some sanity checks to make sure I didn't
accidentally connect ground with another
pin that shouldn't be ground if you hear
beeping that means these pins are
directly connected but these ones are
all fine now let's have a closer look at
the board we can remove the sticker from
the microcontroller to reveal the exact
model number and we start collecting
information about the board that might
be important later for example knowing
the exact chip identifier we can look up
the datasheet and learn more about the
hardware so here we got an Atmel mega or
atmega328p I mean this is not surprising
we already know that the embedded system
is an Arduino Nano from the CTF
description but it's good to know we
also might understand now that this is
actually not an official auto inner
board from the other you know company
but an Arduino compatible board based on
the open arduino design so now let's get
really started let's put the stickers
that came with the board onto our laptop
to make this legit now we are allowed to
connect the board with a mini USB cable
to our laptop the green power LED is
turned on and the red LED is blinking
slowly indicating that it's working now
we can log into the CTF website but
before we can start with the charges we
have
to personalise the board so the board is
preloaded with a custom bootloader which
is capable of decrypting the challenge
binaries and flash them onto the board
to tell the bootloader the personal
secret key we have to flesh this
personalization binary at least that's
what I think it does
I think the spidery might be encrypted
with a master key that is known to all
boot loaders are simply obfuscated and
will then place our real personal keys
somewhere into the board maybe it
overrides parts of the bootloader data
or gets burnt into it another way I
don't know to load this binary onto the
board we have to run a program called
AVR dude which is a program that allows
to flash code onto microcontrollers
risky already tells us how to do this we
have to run our for air do to tell it
that it's an Arduino board the processor
type atmega328p which we already know
then the connected 0 USB device the baud
rate for the serial connection some
other flags and at the end of flash
command to flash the setup dot hex that
is the personalization binary I think
the easiest way to get a working AVR
dude setup is to simply download the
arduino ide which is used normally to
write and program arduino boards it
contains an offer for air dude binary
and Conflict already ok knowing that we
have installed arduino we can look for
the binary in the application package
and there this now we need to find the
device to communicate with it we can
save the current list of devices in /dev
and then connect the board to it again
and if these two to find which is the
correct connected USB sierra device but
it doesn't show up this means that I
don't have a compatible driver that can
communicate with this USB serial chip
what we can do is check the device
manager and have a look at the connected
USB devices and we will find a USB 2.0
serial device that is what we want to
talk to it has here a product and vendor
ID each USB device has that and when you
plug a device in your system will check
if it has a driver that can communicate
with this particular device in our case
it can't find the working driver but we
can use these now to search on
line four a driver that supports this
product and we find other people having
the same issue and we get links to this
Chinese vendor side with a driver to
download so the trick to not get
compromised from a shady Chinese driver
that you are going to install with very
high privileges which you download over
an insecure HTTP connection is to just
do it very very fast so that your brain
can tell you not to do it
click faster faster click Google and
maybe you actually disable even more
security mechanisms to load the shady
driver once you did that and you feel a
bit dirty
you can check again the device is under
slash death before and after you plug in
the board and there it is a TTY and a
CEU USB serial device now you can also
start the other Ino IDE and it will show
you an available board on this port I
added an alias for the AVR youth binary
because it's in such an obscure long
path also you probably need to specify a
config file which is also somewhere in
the other Inno directory so I added that
one as well with - capital C now you can
flash the personalisation binary cool
and next we can flash our first
challenge I suggest to go with the
secure file system it's the first one I
had a look at and you can use it to
learn how to communicate with the board
properly because that is already a first
challenge I'm sure most of you will run
into the issue to not be able to send
something but you can figure it out your
board is not broken
you should also join the IRC channel rh
m e on freenode there's a lot of
hardware reversing talk going on and I'm
sure after the competition is over in
February a lot of write-ups and
explanations will be happening there ok
good luck to all participants I hope we
all will learn more thanks to riskier
and specifically the people who worked
hard to create the CTF I'm really
looking forward to this and I hope I
will solve at least some challenges
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
