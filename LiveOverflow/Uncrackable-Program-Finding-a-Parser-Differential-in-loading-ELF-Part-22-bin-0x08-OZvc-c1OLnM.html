engineer the license check out rhythm
and write a keygen to generate valid
keys
obviously this algorithm also can become
very complex but generally if you put a
lot of work in it you can figure it out
now you tell that your manager but he's
the smartest and tells you then you
should stop people from being able to
reverse-engineer the binary then you
direct yourself back to the desk and you
come up with a new creative way how to
stop somebody from debugging and
reversing it because you're a pro you
understand that an executable is a very
complicated file format with object dump
we have seen that this executable has a
lot of information in there that is
needed to load and execute it
but you also realized that a program
like gdb has to parse the executable to
be able to disassemble and debug it as
well and radar has to read and part the
executable file to show us stuff
so could you modify the executable in a
way that you can still execute it with
Linux but gdb and radar
tell you that something is broken what
we are looking for is a partial
differential we hope that the parser
from X agree from the nukes differs from
gdb Parsa we hope that the parser from X
agree and Linux differs from the gdb
parser in an ideal world every program
that reads input would do it in the
exact same way but every tool implements
a parsing algorithm a bit different so
if you screw with the input a Linux
might see a valid file and execute it
well the gdb says it's broken and cannot
be disassembled let me show you a very
naive way how to find something like
that with fuzzing so let's create a new
python script called facade pi first we
import some modules we need import
random and import OS first function
you're right is called flip byte as a
parameter it takes a big string which
will be the whole executable file later
then we select the random index I
between 0 and the maximum length of this
input then we select a random character
that we will use - all right abide in
the program so character by it from a
random number between 0 and F F which is
255 then we return the original bytes up
to this index I the next character will
be the random created one instead of
their original character I at this point
and we append their remaining original
bytes if you want to understand this
fancy bracket colon index stuff in
Python just Google a path and list so
just a quick example of this function
print flip bytes and a string with Yui
you can copy this line and with P you
can paste it multiple times and now you
can see that a random character got
changed to something else
with TV you can delete those lines again
now we want a function that copies the
original binary but flips a byte and
saves it in another file we call this
function copy binary
so we open the normal license - and a
copy license to fuss with FRA Texas
now we read the whole original file pass
those bytes to the flip byte function
now this returns a copy of all license
to executable just with a random byte
flip and then we write this to the new
copy now obviously we flip weird stuff
and the file might not be executable
anymore so we should check if the
program still works the same way this
means that it should print access
granted with the rel of key so this
output should be the same for the
original and the fast program that's why
I redirect this output to a file called
original output now let's write a Python
function that runs the first binary once
a bytecode flip and let's check if its
output is the same thing a really ugly
way how I do this now just because it's
less code I actually hit the same
command like I just did just type the
output into a first output now I add a
function to compare the original
output with the first output and also
let the result returned from the check
output function okay so this function
checks if the binary still executes
normally now let's think about how we
can check if gdb still works basically
we don't want people to disassemble main
so you can use echo and pipe the
disassembled main command into gdb to
get the output so this echo basically
just types the command and with the PI
we redirect this into the input of gdb
this looks good so let's simply redirect
this output also to a file that I will
call original gdb now let's basically
create the same function with check gdb
and then we compare those two files
again well now let's do the same for add
arrow tool here we just use commands AAA
then seek to the main function and PDF
and also store this output in a file and
now again we create a check read our
function you can use shift V which you
can use to hide out multiple lines and
with y you can copy it and paste it with
P again okay almost there now let's
create an endless loop where we first
create a new copy then we check if the
executable store works if that works we
want to add our and GDP to fail so not
check gdb and not check Vdara if we
reach this here we print success and we
also print the tail off the adhara and
gdb output just to have a visual check
if the disassembly really failed with
raw input we can halt the Python program
until we hit enter now let's run it
another small mistake this should be F 1
instead of F n 1 and I just discovered
another mistake ok
it found something but we clearly see
disassembly there so let's continue
until we find an output without
disassembly
ooh that looks good let's investigate
the binary stove works
gdb can find the main function
and radar also has problems huh that's
cool
admit this is very ugly this is not a
real good technique you should use in
practice but that is basically how
fasting works and how you might discover
cool new tricks to hide your malware and
make it harder for people to analyze it
if you want to learn more about this you
can read this one block here which calls
this a novel technique but it's not
really new and there's a bit more
in-depth research on elf file format
from ioactive
and you can go even deeper and read even
more crazy elf file format tricks in the
Holy International Journal of
proof-of-concept or get the out
issue zero my binary can be found in the
github repository and you can try
different tools like copper or Ida and
see if they still analyze it
automatically but I suspect they do so
this is just one small trick which can
annoy somebody trying to analyze it now
it can go back to your manager and tell
him that he should hire some web
developers and move the product into the
cloud so that the code only runs on the
server to control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
