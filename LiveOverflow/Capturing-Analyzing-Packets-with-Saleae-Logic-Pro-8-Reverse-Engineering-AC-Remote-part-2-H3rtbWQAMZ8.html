engineering the protocol of my
air-conditioner remote last time we
implemented our own poor man's logic
analyzer but this time we will use
something more advanced
last time we try to log the digital
output with an Arduino in serial
communication to the laptop though that
was a little bit too slow we could try
to speed up the implementation by for
example not sending the text via serial
in every iteration because that is slow
we could do this by implementing a
buffer and an array that always saves
100 samples and then pushes them out but
I want to show you a real logic analyzer
this time this is the sealy Logic Pro 8
this is a professional analog and
digital logic analyzer let's hook this
one up to the circuit and collect
samples so this one can collect a lot of
signals in parallel but we only need one
in this case we connect the black ground
wire to the ground pin it uses these
precise hooks which can be easily
attached to a pin and the orange wire
goes to the data out of the IR receiver
the Arduino is only still connected
because we use it for the 5 volt power
supply then we connect it to the laptop
and launch the Sailor logic application
with the big green button we can
configure the device we can select the
sample rate the speed it collects data
points with so for example currently it
will collect 500 million samples per
second of digital data and 50 million
samples per second of analog data in
this case our orange cable was channel
number 3 and we can also specify to only
look for 1/10 of a second that should be
enough but we really don't need to
collect such a crazy detailed trace we
can select the way slower sampling rate
like with our Arduino we can now define
a trigger we want to trigger the
recording only when the input drops too
low because then the IR receiver saw
infrared light let's try it we press
Start wait for the trigger
pressing a button on the remote and boom
there's our collected trace so first of
all you can see two traces of channel
three the top one is the digital trace
then the bottom one is the analog trace
so what does it mean let's zoom into one
of those edges okay as you can see the
top channel always has a sharp vertical
edge down because in digital logic
there's only 1 or 0 but in the analog
world
we measure a voltage and we can see that
we measured almost fivefold at the start
and then over roughly maybe 5
microseconds the voltage slowly drop
down to basically zero volt in the real
analog world obviously voltage doesn't
drop immediately it takes a short amount
of time to drop down and when it dropped
under roughly 1.5 volt that's a
threshold the logical interpretation
becomes then a zero you can see how many
sample points the device can collect we
have here I don't know hundreds of
collected points per peak but with the
Arduino we only had one two maximum
three samples per peak and this trace is
also now much more beautiful there are
no wider Peaks they all have the same
width
just some of bigger gaps between each
other now last time I already hinted at
the bit interpretation of this trace
this is a very typical pattern for an IR
consumer remote as far as I know it's
based on the protocol created by a
company called NEC but it can vary in
bandwidth and frequency and so forth but
in general the idea is the same you
always have a pulse and then either are
short or long pause until the next pulse
and a long pulse refers to a 1 and a
short pulse refers to a 0 this means we
can now extract the bits of a
transmission and try to reverse-engineer
which bits are used to do what so let's
start ok that's definitely a 1 that's a
1 this is a 0 that's a 1 ah I already
have enough this is annoying so this
application also has a cool feature
called analyzers protocol analyzers so
we can select from a big
low level protocols how we want to
interpret our data the issue is only
that it doesn't have the NEC or IR
consumer protocol by default the one you
see here in the list is the one I have
written myself so that's what you have
to do if you face a protocol that is
either unknown customer just not
supported but Sayle offers an analyzer
SDK which you can use to implement your
own protocol analyzers and that's what I
did the documentation of the SDK was a
bit rough and it was C++ and it took me
several hours so will not do this here
again but I will put my code on github
so it hopefully helps other people in
fact you can even install the logic
application you don't need the device
for that and compile my code to check
out the traces yourself I will also make
them available now let's add my analyzer
first of all we have to tell the
analyzer some information in this case
it wants a pulse will you will see in a
second what I mean by that then we can
also define if it if it wants to
interpret +5 volt as 1 or 0 usually it's
seen as 1 but in this case we might want
to invert this just because the output
is low when the LED of the remote is on
but in the end it doesn't matter we can
also select what we want to display so
in case let's go with single bits and
save let's also set the text output to
hex only and then then let's have a look
at the data that looks pretty cool you
can see those blue bubbles over the
digital data telling us if it was a 0 or
a 1 and you can see the long pauses are
1 and the short pauses are 0 you can
also see those white dots which I have
added to show you what it's interpreted
as a pulse width you can see in a long
one there are basically four pulses in a
short 0 there are basically two so if we
hit the poles within a longer or shorter
then we wouldn't be able to read the
data properly for example if you would
use 530 then you see the pulse will
slowly drift away and then kind of
corrupt the data we read another
available setting is interpreting the
data as a whole word so now the whole
packet becomes one frame
and the bits are shifted into a 64-bit
variable now let's document our test
properly that we can collect a longer
sample with a lot of different commands
and we are able to identify which one is
which so let's start
I suggest we start with turning it on
and while it's set to the lowest
temperature which is 18 and then we
increase the temperature up to a maximum
of 32 after that we turn it off and on
again then we cycle through the three
modes afterwards we cycle through the
four fan modes while we are on AC then
you switch to the mode fin and we cycle
through those three fan modes back to
the AC mode then we switch from Celsius
to Fahrenheit and back I honestly don't
know how the timer works I ignore that
one last two modes are they weird feel
good home thing and the silent mode and
then we finish it by turning it off
again cool we stop the collection and
now we can inspect them on the right you
can see the decoded protocol view which
is super cool because it displays as
each individual captured packet and we
click on one we automatically jump there
we can now also export data as a simple
CSV file for further analysis in Python
now let's explore this data in Python we
open the file and read it split it by
new lines to have a list of each line
but we don't want the CSV header and the
last empty line so let's slice that and
we can use Python list comprehension to
already split each line at the comma and
we loop over each command by the way you
can execute Python scripts directly in
sublime with control be or should be or
whatever next let's convert the hex
value to an integer and then a binary
string
because we did like a sequence of
commands it would make sense to compare
each line and visualize which characters
change so let's always save the last
printed value and dip it with the
current one we can simply define a
function diff which iterates over both
strings and adds a character if their
characters differ
and then we can take this output and
analyze it further so the first packet
was 18 degrees Celsius and then we
incremented it up to 32 and we notice
that this one bit here changes every
increment and then the second bit here
changes with every second increment this
looks like a counter just reversed so it
looks like we do want to change the
endianness of those words and we can do
that by changing the settings in the
analyzer and export it again
so it looks like up to five bits are
involved in the temperature selection
it's not good quite regular binary to
decimal but it's definitely incrementing
after that we turn it off and on again
it looks like this bit is responsible
for that next we cycle through the four
different modes first one is the
humidifier simple increment but the one
after is fan which has a different fan
intensity than the other modes so those
two might be the fan intensity and we
look closely at the commands after those
where we tested changing the four fan
settings we can see that those one are
now incrementing after that we switch to
fan mode which again changes also the
fan intensity but then we tested the
different fan levels here too and we see
those change as well I guess you get the
idea now how it works this is how we can
slowly reverse-engineer which bit is
responsible for what so now it's your
turn
can you figure out which bits are
responsible to change the screen from
Fahrenheit to Celsius or activate the
silent mode the silly logic trace as
well as my analyzer code and exported
hex values are available on the github
for you to play around with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
