and this is the ionic private wipe a
cloud hub I actually got to because I
wanted to get into cloud computing for
real and this little device was not only
cheap but has all the amazing features
we want from the cloud it got Wi-Fi
normal USB port SD card slot so already
better than your new MacBook Pro and it
supports Android Windows Mac and April
thought so I can't wait to set this up
and expand my home network wisdom cloud
first of all we don't need these manuals
because we are geeks and we know
computers so let's just burn these make
a statement against all the stupid
people who don't understand technology
the building capabilities of the papers
seem to indicate that it's not natural
and full of chemicals so thumbs down for
them but let's not waste any time and
set up the private cloud it does have a
battery so once charged you can bring
the cloud anywhere you go but for here
at home I will plug it in but now
without further ado let's click the
button and put our head into the cloud
hmm hmm it doesn't do much where's the
Cloward maybe I should check the menu ah
fuck what do I do now hmm
only thing it says Wi-Fi so maybe I
check the Wi-Fi menu ah there it is
private cloud amazing let's connect to
it
no where's the cloud let's check our
network interface configuration for the
Wi-Fi we got to sign the IP 10 10 10 100
in this netmask
so let's scan this network range with n
map and find the thing there it is with
IP 2 5 4 and it's already found some
default port but let's do a proper full
port scan for it this will take a second
there we go so what do we have here
where is the cloud we have a talent
interface which may allow us to remote
login there are three different web
servers a light TVD an apache and go
ahead web server
well why we have a Sun bar file share as
well as a weird geeks box you share with
some telnet protocol interesting and an
apple VAP share service and some
universal plug and play discovery see I
told you the small device has all the
features you need let's start with the
standard web servers on port 80 looks
like some kind of configuration back-end
of the private cloud on network settings
this allows us to change the SSID of the
Wi-Fi I like to use XSS vector as Wi-Fi
name because sometimes you get really
funny results when shitty unsecure web
interfaces try to display it the name
but it doesn't seem to accept the name
change but for the windows file share we
now know a username but the password is
hidden which is not a problem we can
simply get the clear text by changing
the field type from password to text
now we have a username and password that
might be handy another menu point here
is Wi-Fi huh and alert one how did this
happen
looks like this is supposed to show the
SS IDs of Wi-Fi networks nearby ah it
tries to show the name of my home Wi-Fi
which like I said is set to an XSS
vector and this can execute JavaScript
others one if the input is not properly
handled let's check out the other web
service on four three six eight nine hmm
requires a username and password so
let's try the one we found ah it's a web
interface for the echo file share let's
try to access that she'll also ask for
admin admin credentials if you have a
USB stick plugged in you can now browse
that file cool let's see what's up with
the tenant interface we can use net kit
or telnet to connect to it but looks
like the admin user is not allowed to
log in that's a bummer I want to access
my cloud but there was one more web
server on port 8000 rail link also looks
like some management interface quite a
lot of settings you can access here
system command huh that sounds
convenient
whoa we can enter commands here that's
useful here is etc' password 8 which
also explains why the admin user can't
look in the login shell is set to no
login you would need the puzzle of the
root user or we can simply modify this
file I created a fake pass with a file
on my laptop and put it onto the USB
stick and then I simply overwrite the
one in et Cie password a with mine which
should add a life overflow user without
a password when we now try to tell not
logged in again it works we can also use
the USB stick to copy interesting files
like the convicts or shell scripts from
the device to my laptop where we can
explore it and why looking around for
username and password stuff I found this
change path with a shell script which we
can also use to change the root password
let's write a new lead exploit for this
thing the most important aspect of an
exploit is a name so it took me a bit to
come up with the Red Star cloud but I
think it's a good name it's ominous red
blood as well as referring to a
dictatorship which symbolizes power
anyway let's add a command-line argument
so you can specify the IP of the device
before we can issue shell commands via
the web interface we just discovered our
expert first has to grab the username
and password from the non protected
configuration interface you can check
the URL that is accessed to grab the
credentials and use that in Tison oops
wrong format specifier even the best
hackers in the world make programming
mistakes ok that prints down the result
of this request and now we just have to
extract the username and password of it
I use a simple red X for this red X is
perfect to work with context-free
languages like XML next we want to use
the username and password to issue the
system command we can again learn how to
do that from the browser development
tools it's a post request and the
command dissenters post data and we also
need an HTTP header with the credentials
but to get the results we have to do
another request this time we just do
some string splitting to get the
response
that looks good let's actually put this
into a function we call eval so we can
always issue a command and get the
result and we can even put that into a
loop so we can read an input command
send it and show the response now we
basically got a full exploit but it
could be cooler so I add colors to the
command line program this will look so
lead I define a simple class to work
with it and edit in various places oh
and also we can modify the exploit
slightly to not have to use HTTP
requests all the time but simply change
the root password to route with change
pasady and then connect to device via
telnet and log in as root then we can
simply use the talent interface for
communication okay let's check it out oh
this looks so good red star cloud
exploit heck our hacker elite firstly
connects to the specified host and grabs
the username password then uses it to
issue a command and change the root
password and then starts a telnet
session to root so easy and now what do
we do with it I still don't know where
the cloud is but it does have GPIO s and
I found out how to turn on and off a
single led so cool hmm you didn't see it
here closer it's a red LED exactly where
the blue LED is so it looks kind of
purple or pink when turned on oh this is
amazing Wow
well I hope you enjoyed this as much as
I did I thought it's fine I got this
device recommended by a person named
Lydia's he wrote me an email telling me
how broken this is and that it might be
interesting to make videos about he also
has a blog called tech correlation where
he will slightly post a lot of
information too and I think he's right
while this product is absolute garbage i
think it's cheap embedded device there's
so many security issues and it's a great
learning platform and i'm going to use
it to show various real-life examples i
don't want to only cover the weapon
software stuff for this device but also
want to go a bit deeper into the
hardware and maybe explore things like
slashing your own dinner
which on to it all so you can get
creative what you use it for it's a
Wi-Fi router with a built in battery so
it could theoretically be used to take
with you and drop somewhere or remote
shellow something I'd love to tell you
to buy one too and follow along and
practice so the ionic one is only
available in Germany or Europe but it
looks like the device is not
manufactured by ionic but just licensed
by them because I found the strontium
mobile Wi-Fi clock which looked exactly
the same it seems a bit more expensive
but maybe it's the same thing somebody
should test it feel free to post your
own discovery or research about this or
other devices on the subreddit this
could be a fun learning experience I
also want to give away one of my two
devices you can hack on it yourself all
you need to do to enter the random
drawing is to LIKE comment subscribe
just click send me an email to let power
flow at gmail.com or write a comment
with suggestions about projects or
topics you like to see as a video it
could be another broken device an
interesting bug some cool research you
came across or just some area to still
struggle with it would be very helpful
to me I think I can ship this thing to
any country so all of you can enter so
in case the shipping cost is crazy high
or some other issues with you I will
reserve the right to send it to someone
else for more information about this
project check the description and
subreddit and tax the planet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
