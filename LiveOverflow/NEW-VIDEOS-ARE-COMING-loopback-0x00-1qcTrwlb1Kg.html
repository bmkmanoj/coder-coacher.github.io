where I want to reflect on the current
state of the channel my work and my
project so good news I created a new set
of videos and they will slowly be
released over the next couple of weeks
on months I also will start a web
security series in parallel to the
binary stuff because I figured this
could potentially increase the audience
of the channel and may get some binary
people into web security and some web
security people may be into binary stuff
a few of these new videos are an exploit
walkthrough video I had this idea a
while ago that I take real-life exploits
and try to explain them on a technical
level how they are working so I prepared
one of these short series about a web
vulnerability a real-life exploit that
was found in a JavaScript framework and
I think it's a lot of fun and quite
interesting and this is again a little
bit more an advanced video so it might
not be good for the people who just
started with web security but might be
interesting to people who already
understand what cross-site scripting is
so this means that I hopefully have for
the roughly next two months a video
schedule of maybe one to two videos a
week depending on how much time those
videos take now that we got the news out
of the way let me reflect a little bit
about the channel I wish more people
would discuss each video on reddit I
think that would benefit everybody and
everybody could contribute answering
questions and then we could collect all
these details in those reddit threads
and if somebody has additional questions
about a video they could look it up
there or ask it there also in the past
months basically the past half year I
haven't really played a lot of CTFs and
I didn't make any videos I was just too
busy with real life and work but I hope
I will be able to build a proper
schedule no I also realized that my
first schedule that I had with two
videos a week is kind of unrealistic it
depends a little bit on how much work of
video requires usually it takes me about
five to eight hours of concentrated work
to get a video done and sometimes even
more with additional research or if I
have to
what an example and on top of that I try
to answer every question that people
sent me by a male reddit or Twitter and
because I procrastinate and I'm lazy
some of these video take me a whole day
getting up starting to work and I will
render the video sometime at night I've
also decided to turn on monetization for
my videos to accumulate a little bit of
ad revenue I expect most of my viewers
or all of my viewers to have adblock
enabled anyway so it doesn't have
shouldn't affect you and if you don't
use adblock and you like to be exposed
like this then fine by me it will help
me to hopefully accumulate a few dollars
to buy some nice toys like proper
software licenses for tools I haven't
used yet or nice hardware to play around
with also what I tried was putting an
advertisement in POC or gtfo magazine
because I this is the audience I wish
that would be watching me they were
thinking about putting this ad in the
magazine but in the end it didn't appear
there and I also get that many of them
really don't like this new fancy YouTube
video stuff so I'm a little bit sad but
it's fine I understand I have also some
ideas for the future I've been thinking
about starting streaming again and
basically the idea is that I stream my
episodes that I created on YouTube but
watch them very slowly like always watch
like 30 seconds and talk about what just
happened and talk about what you can see
on the screen and then go way more in
depth into what I'm showing there people
would be able to answer questions right
there for this video and we could then
look at other examples and do it answer
certain questions on how to use GDB and
all this kind of stuff and then I could
take the recording of the stream and
upload it as an additional video and
this will be then the long version of a
certain short episode and I think that
could maybe be very beneficial so if you
have some feedback for that let me know
another idea I had that I really would
like to do would be some kind of podcast
interview style video basically I would
like to talk to other security
researchers about their work about their
projects how they got into it and then
showing off something
cool they had discovered and how they
discovered it some backstory their
failures how they are working all this
kind of stuff that is interesting me and
that could be beneficial to all those
other people because often we only see
the technical part but we rarely see
exactly how people work and I think that
would be really cool I was a contacted
one group of researchers and asked them
if they would be up for something like
this they were thinking about it but in
the end they never responded anymore so
I guess they weren't interested in it as
well now let's cover some of the
questions that have come up in the past
it's their video and where to find good
CTS for beginners I have no idea
I guess not many people make CTF videos
anyway and I haven't done one I also
don't know that many CTF so I haven't
played all of them so I cannot really
say if those are good CTFs but I
generally advise you just go with
popular ones that have a lot of
write-ups available online there are
other CTS like IO smash a stack that try
to be very protective of write-up so
that you can actually that your progress
is actually like a proof of skill but
there are others that are not like this
for example exploit exercise calm and I
really like that one because there are
many resources online and I create also
a lot of videos for those what I'm
saying is that you will fail anyway with
whatever of CTF you start with but then
you are able to read the write-ups and
see what other people did and explain it
to you and then you are able to maybe
solve the next challenge you encounter
so just go for something like exploit
exercises or bone hop and try to see if
there are write-ups
especially for the beginning I noticed
in your own humble videos your gdb
automatically prints out stacktrace
after each step how do you set it up
well I use PETA or pony back actually
but I also in one videos of my episodes
I showed you how you could do this with
just raw gdb itself so just watch that
one again now I'd like to recommend to
you some YouTube channels first one is
general I hope that's how it's
pronounced from the Drang sector CTF
team he started streaming advanced
exploitation stuff a while ago and
uploaded uploads it to YouTube
unfortunately it's mostly
and I wish he would do them in English I
could learn so much from him but if
you're speaking polish or if you just
follow along with the screen it's
awesome it's one of the coolest things
and I wish I could speak I wish I could
understand polish then there's also John
Hammond who's is a cool guy who made a
lot of programming videos in the past
but then discovered CTFs and now he has
a lot of recorded CTF challenges with
commentary and it's also an awesome
great resource to learn more about and
it's really cool to see him learn and
explore the CTF world and then there's
up there had a very tight sorry if I get
this name coming wrong he also is
recording a lot of CTF solutions and he
has been very consistent though I wish
he would add commentary to it so it's
just like real techno and mouse
movements and stuff but it's still a
good resource if you play the CTF and
you want to see how somebody else is
working so it's still pretty cool and I
appreciate that he's doing it and before
we finish this video I just want to
remind you that I created an old life
overflow CTF like a year ago maybe and I
offered reddit gold for somebody who was
recording themselves solving or working
on these these issues and both
commentary and stuff like this because I
think that's that would be so great to
see but unfortunately nobody has claimed
this reward yet so if you feel motivated
to record a video and working on these
things that would make me super happy
and I will if you're ready go for them
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
