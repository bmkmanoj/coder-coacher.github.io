input to some software to see what happens.
This could be a crash or just general errors
or interesting behaviour.
Whatever you are looking for.
Now fuzzing is not easy.
There are a lot of different challenges like
speed, scalability, detecting errors or whatever
you look for, but also how do you even generate
these interesting input test cases in the
first place?
that’s basically the whole art of fuzzing.
For example if a software wants an integer
as input.
What kind of fuzzy tests would you like to
do.
Other numbers, leading spaces, small numbers,
large numbers, larger numbers, leading zeroes,
negative numbers, floats, text, long text,
arbitrary bytes?
There are so many options.
Now if you need a simple but fairly powerful
general-purpose fuzzer, then check out radamsa.
Radamsa is a test case generator for robustness
testing, a.k.a. a fuzzer.
It is typically used to test how well a program
can withstand malformed and potentially malicious
inputs.
It works by reading sample files of valid
data and generating interestringly different
outputs from them.
The main selling points of radamsa are that
it has already found a slew of bugs in programs
that actually matter, it is easily scriptable
and easy to get up and running.
Let’s revisit our example about this fictional
program that wants an integer.
And then we use radamsa by giving it one example
number, by piping it into the standard input
of radamsa.
And radamsa then prints a potential fuzzing
test case.
Now here it returned a huuuuge number.
Next it actually returned nothing.
So you would test an empty input
Then it returned a small number 2.
Then 256.
Now echo also adds a newline after the number
we pass in, so for this testcase radamsa simply
decided to remove this newline.
A few test cases later radamsa even introduced
some unprintable characters.
You see radamsa is pretty smart in generating
good fuzzing input.
It tries really hard to create useful input
that is not just random bytes but actually
has hopefully some meaning for the targeted.
Let’s even try it with a simple HTML string.
An svg tag with an onload javascript alert
attribute.
You can for example see here a testcase where
radamsa seems to be aware that that’s a
number and changed it, and here added some
arbitrary bytes before the equal sign, it
also constructs invalid HTML by repeating
opening or closing tags.
Now see we never gave it an empty opening
tag, but for some reason it still used one.
If you have an XML parsers this is really
good test input that stresses the hierarchical
structure of XML or HTML.
Radamsa is pretty smart and powerful but it’s
also so easy to use that you can rapidly prototype
a fuzzer for some software you want to test.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
