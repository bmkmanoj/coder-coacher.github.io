we read a simpler code and
reverse-engineered how our program works
and we even have written our first
exploit by using a buffer overflow
vulnerability in our program written in
C in this code I want to show you how
you can learn how to read a sampler
produced by C code yourself that is
simple just write some C code with
different C language features then look
at the assembler code that is produced
by compiling it
this is often part of normal research
for example listen to what I n bear from
Google project zero says during a talk
about his research on inter-process
calls on OSX one approach to reversing
water to understand how this kind of
thing works would be to sit in Ida and
just reverse the serialization and
deserialization code and slowly build up
a picture of how it works but another
kind of quite nice way to do it is just
write a test program to send little
messages and then find the right place
using ll db2 break and just start
dumping hex so because he had to
understand a fairly complex data
structure he simply wrote a test program
to analyze it instead of reversing a
full application or there was a talk and
a paper from blackhead USA in 2007 about
how to reverse C++ programs by looking
at C++ concepts and how they look like
an assembler so now I have created three
different C code test cases you can find
them in my github repository or just
write it yourself
one is about variables and data types
one is about function calls and one is
about control flow of stuff like loops
and ifs so let's start with the variable
c first thing i want to point out are
those triple exes those triple exes are
defined as an assembler knob instruction
the reason for that is later when you
look into the disassembly we can find
those knobs which are separating our
tests and that is pretty neat so this
makes it easier to see which line of C
code is responsible for which
and assembler I will not go over every
single test this is something you could
do yourself simply pause the video at
certain points or clone the repository
anyway let's get started first we define
a couple of numbers unsigned and signed
integers and floating point numbers and
different sizes with you and 32 or you
and 64 the letter is important because
normal integers might have different
sizes depending on 32-bit or 64-bit
architecture so it can lead to bugs so
better use data types you are guaranteed
to get a certain size if you want to
learn how to program C properly there's
a great article called how to see as of
2016
after that we create an array with
32-bit unsigned integers and we access
one of the elements of this array then
we look at a single character and then
also a string and maybe you know that a
star means pointer and C so we are
defined a variable that is pointing to a
string I have added a make file so you
can simply type make in to the terminal
to compile off files or make clean to
remove the binaries this will create a
32-bit and a 64-bit version of the
variables program but as you can see I
get an error trying to compile a 32-bit
version with - M 32 on this 64-bit
machine so I have to install the 32-bit
libraries first to be able to build the
code after installing those the build
works fine
a mic file is just a little script that
defines how a project has to be compiled
so let's open the code 32-bit and 64-bit
version next to each other in gdb and
disassemble main and also open the code
okay now let's look at the first integer
examples with negative values and signed
and unsigned values first of all all
those local variables are stored
somewhere on the stick you can see that
because they are referenced relative to
the base pointer then you notice that
the assembler code doesn't know negative
numbers they are ever have something if
you are interested how negative numbers
are displayed watch my tenth episode
about numbers and also there is no
difference between variables that are
signed or unsigned but there's one
interesting difference between 32-bit
and 64-bit code because we define one
number to be 64-bit long but in 32-bit
the registers are only 32-bit so if you
want to write full 64-bit you have to
write 2 times the floating-point numbers
are also interesting because they got
stored somewhere else in the program
that value is then moved into the local
variable
the area is also interesting we created
an area with ten values but only set the
first five values to a default value as
you can see those values are stored on a
stick and then it moves from that
location on the stack to the real error
location instead of writing it directly
to the area it does it this way no idea
why and you can see down here when we
reference the third entry so you can see
that this is the real location of the
array on the stick
next come the strings you can see that a
character is just the bite it doesn't
matter if we have an unsigned end with a
bit or char it's the same in strings are
also referenced over an address so the
local variable is not an area of
characters the local variable contains
an address pointing to a string now
let's have a look at the control flows
open it in red re analyze all seek to
main function and enter visual mode
first we set a variable to 0 and then
comes the if this is done by loading
this local variable into a register and
comparing it to hex FF and then jump if
it was less or equal so you can see
which branch it may take then comes a
while loop we load the local variable
again in a register compare it to a
value and either jump inside the block
or leave and inside the block we load
this value again incremented and write
it back now compare it to the for loop
it's basically the same we start by
setting the variable to 0 then we
compare it if the loop condition is
still true and inside the loop block we
can see our knob and at the end of the
block we increment the variable by 1
exactly the same like the while loop so
you can see that for and while loop and
C are basically the same next let's have
a look at how functions are called
again open both the 32-bit and 64-bit
version
first thing you notice that the 64-bit
version moves 0 and eix no idea why
otherwise the function call looks the
same except look at the addresses if you
have no a SLR then 64-bit code is
generally a text for you something well
a 32-bit code is that hex 80 is
something knowing stuff like that is
helpful because if you see an address
with 40 something you know immediately
that is pointing into or your code so
the next function returns a value and we
save it in a variable and you can see
that in both cases the value is taken
from the EAX register okay so apparently
return values are handled via EAX now
functional 3 is interesting because we
pass a parameter to it in 32-bit you can
see that the value is loaded from
somewhere and then stored on top of the
stack and then the function is called
but on 64-bit we see that the value is
loaded into the EDI register this is our
first big difference functions in 64-bit
seem to be called with parameters in
registers while in 32-bit the parameters
are stored on the stack next function
uses two parameters and again you can
see how 32-bit just places the value on
the stack first parameter on the top of
the stack the second a bit further down
but in 64-bit you can see that it uses
ESI and EDI for that now we get curious
what does 64-bit do when we have so many
parameters that we cannot keep them all
in registers
first of all 32-bit code again you can
see how the parameters are stored on the
stack and the first parameter is on top
of the stack and the last value moved
that is what we would expect in 64-bit
we can see that the first couple of
parameters are stored in registers EDI
ESI EDX and so forth but from the
seventh parameter on they get stored on
a stack as well
awesome now you can identify all kinds
of different assembler patterns you
don't need a decompiler all the time you
can do this all in your head and when
you reverse more and more programs those
patterns become more easy to recognize
it will not feel overwhelmed again with
the mass of weird instructions you will
be able to scan over function and say ah
here is the local variable then calls
this function with the variable as a
parameter and then the return value is
used in a loop and you can use the same
method to understand how different
disassemblers like hapa or a direct gdb
display code or for example how
different the AT&amp;amp;T assembler syntax is
from the Intel syntax I hope you have a
lot of fun next time reversing a program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
