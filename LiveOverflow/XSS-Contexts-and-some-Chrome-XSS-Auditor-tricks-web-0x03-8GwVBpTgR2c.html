example of cross-site scripting due to a
shitty PHP F but in the end we fixed our
PHP code by escaping we use a supplied
string but I got this code from the
tutorial website and that one is still
vulnerable so let's play around with
that one the code here is loaded in an
iframe below an iframe is like another
webpage embedded in this main webpage
with right-click we can investigate this
iframe and for example display its
source code now we also know that direct
URL to this example so last time we try
to put a script tag with alert into the
name field but when we do that there
there will be no alert pop-up box and we
get an error in the JavaScript console
showing us that the chrome XSS auditor
prevented the execution of it the XSS
auditor is special to Chrome not every
browser has such a protection for
example Firefox does not have an
equivalent and will happily execute the
alert but we want to dig deeper we want
to not give up because of something like
this so let's try to bypass the XSS
auditor for Chrome in this case we do
not only have one get parameter that
reflects input in fact there is the
second one the H parameter and once
there are multiple inputs the XSS
auditor is basically broken so we can
try this to split up our XSS payload the
first parameter name will open the
script tag and start the alert but end
at the quote now we expect a string and
for the age we start with a quote close
the alert function parentheses and
finally close the script tag and when we
submit this we get an alert box
displaying us BR you are let's see what
happened when we look at the HTML source
we can see that we simply wrap the text
between the two outputs into a string
and use it as a parameter for alert and
this is already enough to confuse the
XSS auditor as soon as you have multiple
injection points you can try to get
really creative to fool the XSS auditor
let's try to push this one step further
and replace this First Alert with
something silent so we can put an alert
with our content afterwards one way is
to still wrap the text in quotes but
instead of using it as a parameter we
assign it to a variable a and afterwards
we can still write our JavaScript code
and do the alert with something we want
okay neat
in the last video I briefly mentioned
that there are different contexts for
XSS and each might come with its own
challenges or tricks so I made here a
simple test PHP page where you can play
around with some XSS attempts so there
is the normal HTML context where it
simply echoes into the page but in also
two cases where the echo is inside of an
attribute one with quotes around the
other doesn't have quotes and then a
script context where the echo is inside
of script X at the end I have a small
little XS auditor trick which is quite
fun anyhow so we basically covered the
first injection already with the last
video so let's directly move on to the
attribute context the first one is
handled with parameter B let's open this
page in the source view so we can see
the resulting HTML which makes it easier
to work with the parameter B is
currently XSS which you can see got
placed inside of the source attribute of
this image theoretically we could now
set B to an image URL and we would get
an image displayed but can we also
execute JavaScript here well what we can
try to do is inject the quote which
would end this attribute then we could
inject a tag closing greater than sign
and then include a script tag that looks
good
that could work but unfortunately the
XSS auditor caught this attempt as well
so this doesn't work in chrome but
generally it would be an XSS for example
in Firefox also the red highlighting
makes it super cool to see if our
attempts injected valid JavaScript so
that's cool would this work with HTML
special chars which we used last time to
fix the code we can test that with
parameter BB nope doesn't work the
double quote and the greater than sign
get encoded so this looks safe but there
is a third test what about single quotes
then work no wait the single quote did
not get encoded maybe we can still turn
this into an XSS we just can't use the
greater than sign luckily image texts
have an event handler that fires if an
image couldn't get loaded
this means we can inject an on arrow
attribute that calls alert and yeah that
worked chrome recognized the attempt of
executing JavaScript awesome so HTML
special chars does not protect you in
every case for example in the attribute
context with single quotes it's not
enough the PHP manual documents this it
says you have to specifically set the
ent quotes flag otherwise single quotes
are untouched another lessons learned
and read the frickin documentation let's
move on to the next one this one is easy
like the previous example we are in the
attribute context and now we even don't
have to take care of quotes so even if
single quotes are escaped you just
simply don't use any quotes in the
attributes so the injection were with on
arrow works great with and without HTML
special chars now the last example is
the script tag context this looks even
more simple just write alert 1 and it
should get executed looks good but the
XSS auditor did not catch this one if we
try this in the normal view we trigger
the XSS and this obviously works despite
HTML special chars so these examples
showed you that using HTML special chars
is not enough every time there are many
places where things can go wrong so be
careful and be aware in what context you
output user-supplied strings but now
what's up with those tricks down here
the first trick is just an example how
somebody might try to prevent XSS it
replaces all occurrences of script this
means you cannot inject a script tag
there are two possibilities first one is
simply not using a script tag for
example use the image payload we have
seen above an image tag with none error
attribute to fire an alert though the
issue is that the XSS auditor catches
that but there's a way around it we can
use the lame attempt of XSS prevention
by replacing script to our advantage we
can randomly place script inside of our
image tag payload
and the occurrences of script will be
removed and now the URL parameter does
not resemble anything that is found on
this page
thus Chrome cannot guess that this
parameter is responsible for this image
tag here so this bypasses the XSS
auditor the second trick here is fun so
first we have to understand this
JavaScript code first a variable a SD is
initialized and set to a value and then
this script checks if a SD exists if the
variable a SD does not exist you would
execute the alert
but how could you redirect code
execution of this JavaScript so that it
would execute this alert I give you a
second to think about this okay here's
the solution we abuse the XSS auditor
who would have thought we use a fake
parameter with the first script as a
value
now Chrome things that this parameter is
responsible for this script tag and
we'll disable it prevent its execution
thus ast never got initialized and we
successfully redirect code execution to
trigger the alert we can see the alert
popping up amazing that's so cool
