into reversing C programs to be specific
we will talk about the global offset
table short G ot and the process linkage
table short ELT let's start by creating
a very simple C program that just caused
a couple of low C functions
so I just write to print deaths and an
exit these two functions are clearly
external functions I haven't defined
them myself and they come from Lib C
when I compile this binary with GCC Lib
C will be dynamically linked to the
Spiner e which means that Lib C is not
included in the program with LD D we can
see the dynamic library's reference from
the Spiner e and it shows that it won't
slept see and it also displays the path
on my system where my ellipse e binary
is this is great because then the
program can be much smaller and let C
can receive updates without having to
recompile my binary but this also means
that the addresses in Lib C might be
different from each version so how can I
compile a binary to assembler when I
have to know the exact address so I can
create a call instruction well this is
where the PLT and G ot comes into play
let's open this binary in hopper
disassembler and let's have a look at
the main function so first thing we
notice is where the hell are printers
why are there puts calls
well the temple saw that we specified a
constant string that a dynamic format
string that's decided to replace the
printer with puts well anyway we have
here our 3 function calls and hapa
decided to prefix the name of the call
location with a J probably for jump not
sure so if we follow this call we notice
that we don't end up in Lib C puts we
are still in our binary also how would
we because Lib C is not included in this
binary we landed in the PLT section the
process linkage table and D call to this
year is immediately followed up with a
jump to an address stored at another
location
and this location got the name puts ad G
ot
let's go there now we are in a segment
called G ot the global offset table and
the jump will jump to whatever address
is stored here and at the moment the
address that is stored here is
referencing an external symbol so what
are they doing here during compilation
we don't know the address of puts or
exit so we just create a function
tremplin we call a location we know
where this the PLT section which
contains a jump with the jump location
reference from this list or table if you
want so all we have to do to be able to
use external functions from a library is
somehow write the real address of Lib C
function in this table and this is what
happening when we execute the binary as
you know by I know an elf binary is not
just a plain assembler code before our
code gets executed the complicated elf
file format is parsed and based on that
the process is set up by the kernel and
during that time references like that
might get resolved so let's debug the
spine area let's just use hop at this
time first we set a breakpoint in main
by clicking the red column in the on the
left here then we open the debug
interface with the button on the top
right so let's step forward until we
follow the call to put as expected we
arrive in the PLT section and are just
about to jump to the address reference
in the global offset table let's step
further and let's see what happens
oh nope we don't go to puts in Lipsy
somehow we ended up right after the jump
and a push value now on the stick as you
can see every PLT entry we have this
push off a number and then a jump to
this address up here and when we follow
this jump we end up in a function called
DL run time resolve we can use the proc
file system to have a look at the memory
Maps of this process and we can see that
the address from the runtime resolve
belongs to this LD as oh binary the main
page for LDS or tells us that this is
the dynamic linker or loader so this
library helps us to set up the external
references tulip see this function does
magic no idea what it does in detail but
we'll find the address of the puts
function in Lib C and updates the global
offset table and also executes puts now
the second time we want to execute puts
the Geo T got updated and we will jump
to the address stored in the global off
the table and we directly jump to puts
from FC
the slogan of the table is very useful
in writing exploits because there are a
couple of things you can do with it for
instance we have an arbitrary right we
can write a value wherever we want
anywhere in memory you can simply
overwrite the address in the global off
the table for a certain function and the
next time this function is called the
code will be redirected to whatever you
entered in the table let's say you have
a memory leak for example through a
format string Floyd like from the
previous video and the binary doesn't
use a SLR well the system itself can
still have a SLR enable that the
location of Lipsy will always be random
but the addresses of the global offset
table in our binary is always fixed so
when you can read from an address you
control you can read an entry of the
global offset table which is an address
in Lib C which you can then use to
calculate the offsets to other locations
of Lipsy which is useful if you have to
find Rob gadgets or you want to do a
return to Lipsy attack sometimes we even
have above overflow on arbitrary right
in a function but the function itself
never returns because it calls exit or
loops forever
that's overriding the return pointer on
the stick doesn't help to redirect code
execution let's exactly the challenge in
this form at level 4 of exploited
exercise com
we cannot overwrite the return address
on a stack because we never return well
we cannot write it but we will never
return and we can thus never redirect
code execution so we have to rely on a
different technique to gain control over
the program execution see you next time
when we use a format string
vulnerability to overwrite an entry on
the global offset table to redirect code
execution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
