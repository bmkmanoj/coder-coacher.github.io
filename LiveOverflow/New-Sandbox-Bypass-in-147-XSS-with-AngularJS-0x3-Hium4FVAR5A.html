simple sandbox bypass from version 1.0 8
and checked why it doesn't work anymore
for 1.47 after that we started to look
at the sandbox bypass from Garrity's for
this new version in this video we will
continue where we left off last time and
debug the angularjs code evaluating the
evil expression that will lead to an
alert so as a quick reminder the sandbox
bypass looks like this it has two parts
the first part attempts to override the
chart function with another function
which hopefully screws up angular
internally and the second part is dollar
evil which is the angular evil to
evaluate an expression so this is
basically a new expression inside of the
other expression also remember that a
lot of stuff has changed internally from
the old version the concept is the same
angularjs parses in an expression
evaluates it and some are executed just
how it's done has changed you will see
what it does by stepping through your
code
ok let's start for real here we are at
the first breakpoint that we hit after
we load the page I place this breakpoint
into a function called Lex this is the
elixir Wikipedia tells us that lexical
analysis is the process of converting a
sequence of characters into a sequence
of tokens the lexical analysis is
basically the first step in a compiler
so if you are a computer science student
and always wondered why the heck you
ever need to know compiler construction
here is a real-life example also if you
look at the call stack you can see that
the lecture is called from somewhere
with the name ast compiler which stands
for abstract syntax tree compiler
it sounds weird but that is literally
what it is
angularjs implements a compiler that
takes an angularjs expression which
looks like JavaScript and compiles the
two real javascript there is a damn
compiler inside of angularjs a compiler
that compels something like JavaScript
to JavaScript anyhow still freaks me out
back to the lexer so this function is
one parameter called text and text
contains the current angularjs
expression according to Wikipedia this
Lex function should parse the string and
extract tokens from it and after our
break point we can see a while loop that
does exactly that thus while loop
iterates over the full length of the
text and in each iteration it will use
text dot
char ad to get the next character of the
string so the first character would be
the single quote from the string a when
we step one step further we get to an if
the checks if the character is a single
or double quote which is obviously the
case so we will follow this and call the
helper function read string because this
single quote is an indication that a
string starts and this whole while loop
is full of ifs and helper functions like
that but in the end we will get an area
of tokens so let's continue until this
next breakpoint now we should have all
tokens extracted from the expressions
this tokens is now an area of objects
the first object or token is C string a
because it's a fixed string this is also
considered a constant the next token is
you dot between the string and the
constructor and the third token is the
constructor which is considered an
identifier all variable names and
function names etc are identifiers also
for example the eighth token is the
equal which is an operator and before
that we have the charged function name
which is also an identifier now when I
press continue until we hit the next
breakpoint a lot of stuff will happen
and we escape that basically this
lexical and
analysis to extract tokens was the start
of compilation and now we will have a
look at the result of the compilation so
we skip the whole complicated compiling
part so continue and now we are here at
the end of AST compiled just before our
break point we have here this variable
called FN string stands for a function
string and I printed that string to the
console locked down here and this is the
compiled JavaScript code that is the
result of compiling our angularjs
expression to JavaScript this looks a
bit awful to read so let's copy it over
into JavaScript beautifier to indent it
and properly and have a look at it sweet
that looks more readable it might look
crazy and complicated first but it's
actually pretty simple so first of all
this code starts like our expression
with a string a installs it in the
variable 4 then it attempts to get the
constructor from variable 4 so the
constructor of the string after that
angularjs added a function and show safe
object to check if the constructor of
variable 4 is safe and because that's
just a string constructor it's
considered safe where that this function
was responsible for the exception when
we try to access the function
constructor with the old bypass after
that the Constructors moved into
variable 3 and checked if it has the
property prototype if that's the case
the reference to prototype is saved in
variable 1 and as last step we check if
the string prototype stored in variable
1 has a chart property now we are done
with the left side of the assignment up
next is the right side here we start
also with the string string B it's moved
into variable 5 and follows it up with
referencing concat of it moving it into
a variable 0 then angle J's checks if
charit of variable one is a safe object
but that's obviously just a normal chart
function and that's considered safe
afterwards variable 1 itself is checked
because we are about to assign something
to the string prototype in variable 1 an
angle J's wants to be sure it's safe to
assign something to that object oh man
if
anger js4 just know what is about to
happen now the crucial part we assign
the concat function variable zero to the
charge function of the string prototype
in variable one now the first part of
the exploit is done at this point charge
should have laid an alien egg inside of
anglers body which is about to hatch
breakout of anglers chest the following
flute lines are then the second part of
the exploit which is fairly short it
basically gets dollar eval now from the
scope object does some checks on those
variables including the string parameter
we pass to dollar eval but it's just a
string so all is safe and Abel is called
which initiates another parsing
compilation and execution of the string
now that we understand the compiled code
let's see what happens with it after our
old breakpoint event string is used in
call to the good old function
constructor which will create an actual
function that can then later be called
at the end it will return this function
event I'm about to hit continue again so
we will jump to our next breakpoint go
boom okay ensure a safe object in the
cost egg we can see that we are coming
from FN and if n is this compiled
function you can print this code by
clicking on the curly braces in the
bottom left of the source window yep
this looks familiar just what we looked
at before here's our string a and
getting the constructor of it etc when I
now continue we are again a natural safe
object this time further down in the
code actually right before we assign an
override chart just one more check
before the ensure safe assign context ok
let's continue a bit more until we are
back inside of the alexa but why are we
here again
well as you can see in the caustic we
are coming from F N and F n called
dollar Evo and dollar euro is just now
triggering evaluation and execution of
this new expression string and as
expected text is simply what we pass to
dollar Evo but let's step further we are
again heading
into the while loop that is supposed to
extract single tokens from this
character sequence the index starts
again at zero so now energy is tries to
get the first character from the string
with Charlotte but chart is not charged
anymore the alien hatches and feeds on
Angela's intestines char at zero appends
now zero to the string instead of
returning a single character so CH is
super long and that's not the start of a
string it's also obviously not a number
but the validation function is ident
thinks that this is now an identifier
remember that usually variables and
function names etc are identifiers that
means that usually identifiers do not
contain special characters such as equal
or curly braces whatever we have in this
string and if we continue now to the end
of the loop and look at the tokens we
can see that there is only one token and
it's an identifier with our whole string
that's just wrong an identifier should
not have those weird characters inside
if we continue now we hit the next
breakpoint at the end of compilation and
we can have a look at the resulting
JavaScript code let's again copy it over
to J's beautifier to see what happened
can you already see here the part two of
our exploit embedded in the JavaScript
code you can also see that it's s dot
exploit blah blah remember that all
expressions are evaluated against the
scope object
well because angle J's thought we had an
identifier in our expression it placed
that identifier in the compiled in the
compiled code by checking if the scope
object has such a property in this case
this totally blows up because the
identifier had non valid identifier
characters when you ident it properly it
becomes more clear you can see now the
start of our expression with the exploit
equals one and then the three closing
curly braces then the break point and
then the alert one so when we continue
now we should hit that break point boom
indeed we are inside of the compiled
code at the break point pretty printed
again and let's enjoy this beauty for a
second
then hit continue and we will execute
alert awesome and this is how the
angularjs sandbox bypass for version 1.4
7 works we override the chart function
that is shared for all strings which
will break how angularjs parses
expressions allowing us to inject bad
characters as an identifier in the
compiled code which we can abuse to
break out and write arbitrary JavaScript
