from the thirty-fourth c3 CTF where you
had assigned firmware update and your
goal was it to find a flaw in the update
process that would allow you to somehow
exploit the process in this first part I
would like to go over the source code
and tell you about thoughts and weird
ideas we had and how we approach this
challenge the actual solution shows what
a blockhead I am and quite embarrassed
Lee involved some fairly simple math
that I should have known but my
intuition was completely off and would
like to explain the solution a bit more
detail because it kind of blew my mind
it's an awesome practical example of
what's usually abstract math anyway
let's head in
software update in the end 23 teams
solved it always remember to keep your
router firmware up-to-date connect with
teller to port 20 23 and files to
download difficulty easy myth when you
connect via telnet you are presented
with a proof-of-work request this is not
part of the challenge and can be ignored
it's just a way to rate limit the actual
challenge server so people can't easily
dos it like a CAPTCHA you can download
the Python script call it like that and
then wait for a few seconds or minutes
depending on how powerful your machine
is then enter the proof-of-work solution
now you have access to the actual
challenge welcome to super secure router
limit it's super secure router tunnel
interface you can upload a software
update here this is where the actual
chung starts in the downloaded source
code you can find a challenge dot py
file that contains this part you can see
that it loads a public key from
somewhere and then expects an input
which is then basics t4 decoded and then
saved as a temporary file so basically
it expects a firmware update as a base64
encoded zip file string then it will
call verify and install software update
from the Installer module with the zip
file path and the public key in there it
will check the size of the zip file if
ok read the information of all the files
in the zip then looping over this
information and check for each file the
file size if everything is safe here as
well it will unpack the zip into a
temporary directory and call check
signature and if the signature check was
valid it will call do install one
example firmware update zip was also
provided if we unpack it we find the
following directory structure a
signature as well as signed data folder
with a post and pre copy script some
patch notes and a new file for /bin if
you look into do install we can see how
the actual firmware update works first
the pre copy dot py script in the
firmware update is executed then all the
files are copied into the root of
file system so the some router stuff
would be copied in to /bin and then the
post copy script is executed but the
install only happens if the check
signature call was successful let's see
what's going on there this function will
call compute hatch on the unpacked
firmware zip then the signature file
inside the firmware image is read then
this hash is checked against the
signature with pkcs1 PSS which is a
signature scheme based on RSA and the
public key used is also known to us but
we obviously don't know if the private
key so we can't generate a valid
signature for any arbitrary other hash
next let's have a look at the compute
hash function this one gets all files
and folder paths with glob and then
loops over all of them if the path was a
file it will create a char 25:6 hash
from the file path a no byte separator
and the file content if it was only a
directory a slash is appended to the
path and then shot 25:6 hash is created
with an additional null byte at the end
the resulting hash is then ex-ored with
the previous hash round
so all those hashes generated from files
and folders are XOR together and the
final XOR result is then what is
returned by this function compute hash
and check if it matches the signature
signed with the private key that matches
the public here we know let's try this
out when we connect by a net cat to the
port I first have to execute the
proof-of-work script and then I can send
over the basics before encoded zip file
so I can do cat software update zip and
pipe it into base64 be careful some
basics t4 tools add new lines but on Mac
its default just one long line then I
can also pipe it into PB copy on Mac
which places it into the clipboard so
now I can just paste it into the net cat
session but some kind of buffering of my
terminal is effed up so it always stops
no clue how to fix that to get around
that I can do it this way I can first do
a cut - which simply echoes whatever I
enter because first I want to
the proof-of-work solution and then I
want to cut the software update and
basically for encoded and pipe it into
the input of the netcat session so I
placed both commands into a parenthesis
and piped both into netcat so the first
command executed is the cat - so I can
simply execute the power script and send
the solution now to stop cat - I can
press control D which will indicate an
end of transmission and cat - terminates
next the cat of the software update zip
is executed which is basics before
encoded and then piped into net head
this will apply the update but we get an
error
preparing to copy data processing you
update there was an error installing the
update permission denied for bin some
rather stuff but based on this output we
can also see that it mostly worked
preparing to copy data was printed by
the execution of the pre copy script
from inside our zip and the permission
denied was likely caused by the attempt
to copy the files into the filesystem
root which means the copy tree call
failed and post copy was never executed
this might seem odd but it's fine it
probably means that the actual update
replacing and copying new files is not
really part of the challenge and the pre
copy script was executed so if he could
control that one we could have code
execution but where's the vulnerability
here so we knew it was a crypto
challenge so we of course thought we had
to focus on the crypto part which is the
hashes and the signature verification we
spent quite some time looking for
weaknesses in the RSA signature scheme
for example we checked if there's a
public key was weak but the public
exponent was large and the modulus we
can extract from the key had no entry on
factor to be and was really large - so
brute forcing was not realistic we also
tried to look for crypto papers on this
topic because sometimes there are weak
edge cases that could happen but the
signature scheme looked pretty solid so
after a lot of times
research we explored other ideas in the
do install function we also noticed the
symlinks flag which we thought was odd
so we were wondering if we could do
anything with siblings the zip file
format standard does support siblings so
maybe we could sim link something that
could result in a RCE or maybe overwrite
some important system files after a copy
but the copy was also the part that
failed and we still probably had to
figure out how to break the hashing and
signature verification to get a symlink
into it in the first place but we were
still trying to come up with creative
ideas so it seemed like a valid path to
investigate to play around with this we
can write a simple Python script that
uses the functions off the Installer to
test the verification locally you have
to make sure to get all the dependencies
installed like pi crypto but then we can
add a debug prints in various places so
I added a print in each condition for
file directory or else if you run the
script now you can see all the files
that are being hashed now let's add a
symlink for example to etc' passwd you
can see that it's recognized as a file
and verification fails but while playing
around with that we noticed a few
interesting things first when the sim
link did not point to a valid file it
would not be recognized as a file which
means no hash is calculated for it and I
thought we could maybe combine that with
a file copy part we could let the
sibling point to a non-existing file
then the verification succeeds and then
the copy tree happens that could fix the
sim link to point to a valid file not
sure where that would get us but it
sounded like a creative idea but then we
noticed verification fails even though
the invalid symlink didn't get hashed
this uncovered another small bug the
head of the previous loop iteration is
XOR it again which means the previous
hash canceled itself out
which means with a second invalid
symlink the hashes exhort a third time
restoring the original ballot value
we really thought we were on to
something here because this bag would
allow us to create any other file in the
firmware update and cancel the X or hash
with an invalid symlink we didn't really
know what we could do with arbitrary
files but we can figure that out in
another step so we wanted to try that
but then we quickly realized that
pythons zip file extraction doesn't care
about siblings it will not unpack them
so symlinks won't work
oh man but still with this XOR cancel
out back I really thought it would be
the trick and I looked up other
supported types and zip files I read
something about device notes but it all
led nowhere and the fact that it's
supposed to be a cryptid challenge also
kept bugging me one other thought
somebody had was what if we somehow can
control the hashes or the XOR result but
controlling the hashes is unlikely
because there are no no one shot 256
collisions or similar attacks and now I
was thinking how could we control the X
or if we can't even control the sha-256
hashes but still I was googling a bit
about XOR inheres and their
cryptographic and randomness properties
but it didn't lead much to anything
hashes are random data and the intuition
I had also told me this is not possible
the only thing I could think of and what
else I found online was that the same
hash would canceled serve out again and
so one last idea I tried to think about
was if we somehow can get two files to
generate the same hash the hash of a
file is generated by the fair path and
the content so the basic idea I had was
if you could move parts of the file path
into the file then we could have two
different files but it would result in
the same hash let's ignore the know
about for a second for example a file
with the name ABC would have the same
hash as a file with the name a and the
content BC but this doesn't work because
of the null byte you can't get a null
byte into the file path so while I
thought the idea was clever it just
didn't work out so you can see we really
a lot of different things but luckily
some other team members were a bit more
persistent and had a better mathematical
intuition than I had
the trick here was in fact exploiting
the XOR of the hashes it was actually
fairly simple math that I should have
known but for some reason I just didn't
realize that we are looking at it is a
simple math problem it really blew my
mind but I want to dedicate its own
episode about the math in detail so see
you next time
