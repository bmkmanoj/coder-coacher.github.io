competitions have nothing to do with
paintball or shooter games but they are
awesome to learn hacking they can be
very challenging and teach you a lot of
new skills in this video I want to tell
you about what kind of challenges there
are and how you can find CTS to play
generally there are two categories of
CTF jeopardy style and attack and
defense while the second one sounds like
a lot of fun personally I have never
played one so I will only focus on the
chappati style especially because it's
easier to get into so typical CTF offers
a bunch of different challenges that you
have to solve most commonly you have to
exploit some kind of servers so you get
remote access to the server so you can
then read the content of a file that
contains a special string the flag which
is proof that you hacked the system you
can then enter the string in a form and
you get points depending on how hard the
challenge was for your team usually a
challenge has a title a short
description and may be in force on how
to reach the servers or a file to
download oftentimes the title or
description is already a small hint so
for example here was a challenge called
sha-1 l code at the hit Con CTF 2014 and
without really looking into the
challenge I already assume that you have
to write shellcode and it has to do
something with sha-1 hashes maybe
writing shellcode in the form of sha-1
hashes and indeed that was a solution in
the end there are a lot of different
kinds of challenges but the typical
topics covered are reversing honing
crypto web and maybe miss core
programming reversing usually comes with
an executable a program you can download
and run locally the program implements
some kind of algorithm that checks an
input key if you find the correct key
which is oftentimes already there
correct flag then you solved it so
solving it requires you to
reverse-engineer and understand the
implemented algorithm to detect the
correct input key a good example for
that is my speed video right up for
pawning challenges
you often get also an executable but
with it an IP address and port of a
server running this program so you have
to figure out how to exploit the program
to gain remote code execution you
develop your exploit locally and then
use it against the server where you can
then read the flag file these challenges
range from simple buffer overflows to
very advanced heat feng-shui stuff and
they are the most interesting ones to me
the cookbook challenge video right up on
my channel is one example of such a
challenge crypto like the name says is
about cryptography sometimes it's about
attacking self-made cipher or very
simple crypto texts like weak random
generators but it can also get really
advanced in mathematical where you are
basically lost if you are not up-to-date
with the research and papers from that
field I have a simple video right up
from the internet Vox ETF that gives you
an idea but they are way more advanced
ones where I just yield you should check
out Hellmann's write-ups web channels
are also clear they are about web
applications usually you get a URL and
you have to exploit maybe an advanced
SQL injection or bypass authentication
sometimes even XSS or CSRF challenges I
also have a web challenge right there
where you can get a feeling for what it
is about misc basically covers anything
else and programming is also
self-explanatory mostly it's about
clever implementations of solving some
kind of problem now that you are excited
about solving some of these challenges
let's talk about where you can find them
the best platform for all of this is CTF
time it's made by the CTF community for
the CTF community you can see which CTFs
are coming and you get information like
forward when it happens and where to
register you can also see the archive of
competitions in the past so for example
the hit con city of recently and below
you see the final ranking of all teams
each CTF has points attached to it
hearts ETFs have high numbers like 50 or
75 points easy CTF health may be only 5
or 10 points you can get for them so if
you participate in a very hard CTF and
do well you are rewarded with more than
for easy College CTF where you can
easily get
during one but those CTS are also really
damn hard at least I struggle a lot with
them over the year the CTF teams collect
these points and have an overall ranking
being in the top 50 is quite challenging
but how to find a team well it's like
finding a group of friends there is no
one way how to do it I found my group
from another security competition I
participated in and we kept hanging
around on IRC and started playing other
CTS and suddenly we had a serious team
before that apply CTF solo which meant I
would maybe solve only one challenge per
CTF but it's fine I can't compete with
crazy skilled people anyway and I just
play for my own curiosity but you could
also check out the reddit CTF team open
to all which is like the name says open
to everybody but all these CTS are
usually short they are over a weekend
maybe 48 to 72 hours but there are also
websites where these kind of chances are
available forever so I played a lot on
w3 Charles smash a stack and over the
wire in the beginning you will realize
you know nothing you fail every
challenge you try but that's normal
so what I always do I will look up the
challenge after the event because people
create write-ups or upload to exploit
script and then you can work through
those solutions you can research topics
you didn't know about you see how other
people solve it and you start gaining
experience and you will see that after a
couple of CTS you start to be able to
make progress yourself so for that
purpose you should look up the write-ups
on CTF time or the CTF write-up github
repository maybe contribute yourself
gathering other people's write-ups and
create a pull request or simply hang
around on the IRC Channel of the
competition because people will start
discussing solutions afterwards I hope
this quick overview was helpful to get
into challenges yourself and maybe
consider recording yourself solving them
during the CTF just make sure you don't
beg for flex solutions and hints respect
the competition be excellent to each
other and accept your lack of skill and
convert it into a meta vation to learn
more
you
