Ponyville KR portable cars standard
Morgaine CTF kinda challenge and it sets
here in the rules and tips that you
shouldn't pose solutions online but if
you insist post the easy ones do not
spell too much so what I'm doing is I
only play a couple of the early levels
and they are already unlocked you can
find solutions already online so I don't
feel too bad of making a recording of it
but definitely play them yourself if you
got the time because you will learn a
lot more so let's have a look at the
first challenge you can see with the
dotted border of that level that I have
already solved it so the but the other
levels are new I just thought after
solving that one up maybe would be a
good idea to record those so I copy the
SSH credentials from the channel just
challenge description and then I logged
into this machine the first thing I do
is obviously look up what files exist
and I see that there's FD program and
the source code FD dot C and when we
execute it it also tells us that we can
pass a number to it and if we look
closely in the code we see that the
argument that we can pass to it is
converted to an integer and then it's
subtracted hex 1 2 3 4 from that integer
and that is stored in FD and then FD is
used in the read function call as first
parameter which is the file descriptor
and it reads 32 characters from above
and afterwards
buf is string compared to let me win so
what we want to do is somehow we want to
get this FD value to 1 because we want
to read from standard input and standard
input is the file descriptor 1 so
basically we want to enter a number that
is hex 1 2 3 4 plus 1 that after the
subtractions the result is 1 and then
read is call on file descriptor number 1
and we can type in whatever we want as a
string and that is read and then
compared and it's correct and then we
get the flag that was a bit fast but
just you know go back and look exactly
at it yourself so up to the next level
called
coalition and it says here daddy told me
about md5 hash collisions so let's see
what it is about we log out of the
previous channel challenge and login
into the next one so let's again check
what files are available again there's a
program called call and their source
code available for it as well and let's
have a look at it
so first the argument count is checked
if it's one and two because we it needs
a passcode to supply and you can see it
when you execute it one's a passcode
then it checks if the passcode you
entered is 20 bytes long if not it makes
an error but if it's 20 bytes long then
it will call check password up there
which has a little function a little for
loop going over the passcode that you
supply and it's calculating some integer
value and it's then later compared to
the hash code so it's kind of like a
simple hashing algorithm not quite md5
but you know some kind of hashing
algorithm so we want now to find a way
to collide those hashes basically we
want to provide an input that will
create these same hash code and we can
now look at this in this assembly to see
maybe to figure it out how exactly this
algorithm works before loop does add
some well.you so it makes sense to
create a breakpoint at the add
instruction to see exactly what kind of
values are added on this hash that is
generated to see maybe how it works so
again well we have to start the program
with 20 characters so we can just simply
use a pattern that we can easily
recognize in the function and we at the
breakpoint so let's look at the
registers and yes the value should be an
ax that is added so we see that in the
first round its ace in the second time
it's B's so apparently it's just looping
over the pass code that we supply and
always four bytes at a time and then
just simply adds the hex value or the
number representation of those bytes and
then the result has to be the hash code
so now I try to think away how would be
what would be an efficient way to get to
this hash collision those calculations
so first make a quick test by passing
the pesco
would buy a Python inline script to see
if that works I mean I know their works
it I don't know what Wyatt does at this
moment and was probably just you know
thinking then I thought I need five
pairs of four bites to add up to this
hash code value so wow I'm so
intelligent why not make all the pair's
zero except for one and then we add
basically hash code on it and install
fine while writing this at some point I
realized wait a moment this cannot work
because the argument will be checked
with string length if it's 20 and if I
have zero bytes in there then string
length will not have this length anymore
because strings end on a zero by it so
it would just be zero length so that
wouldn't work then I realized I mean I
need five equal parts so or like I need
some equal parts we'll just divide this
by a number and then I realize I could
just you know add the division result of
this on top of each other four times to
reach this number at this moment I
didn't realize that I made a mistake
that it has to be 20 long so it needs to
be divided by five and not by four thus
my attempt right now of using four times
this value doesn't work but you know I
will get I will realize that in a second
so I think at this moment that four
times this string would allow me to pass
this test because four times that would
add up to the hashcode value but
obviously the pass code should be 20
bytes and oops i did it with four
instead of five
so let's check again how can we divide
this value by five in a realist dam it's
not a it has a remainder so I cannot
simply divide this by five
but you know I have to slightly change
the single values so that it matches
the next idea I have is I could simply
add up a certain value like hex one one
four times and then add the remaining
stuff on it to reach the hash code but I
realized that one one is already too
much and that there's a negative value
so basically I have to make the value
that I add up four times a bit smaller
and I decide on I could also just use
hex zero one zero one zero one
this means that this is the amount for
the fifth for byte pair to add up to the
hash value so I make hex to get this
value so if I have four times zero one
zero one zero one and then this one DDD
at the end one time this those will all
add up to the hash code so that's what
I'm doing now I am specifying to print
the hex one zero one zero one zero one
four times and for the fifth time then I
add this value that I calculated with
the subtraction from the hash code this
one dd because those will then add up to
the hash code that we want and notice
here that we have the endian Nestle we
have to basically you know specify the
bytes from the reverse order and
congrats we created a hash collision so
we can use this flag and see if it's
correct and yes we receive some points
for it next level BOF now that told me
that a buffer overflow is one of the
most common software vulnerabilities is
that true so let's have a look at this
we can apparently this time download the
file instead of having SSH to connect
because then we connect with netcat as
you can see there in the description so
we first we have to analyze the binary
locally and then use this to exploit the
remote binary so now I asked open hopper
to load the binary in hopper I should
have probably looked at the source code
first because we did get the source code
so I don't know why I opened it up in
hopper immediately okay so
still not looking at the source code and
yeah that's the net kid we can connect
to this server and it says also me now
okay so let's look at it so main cause
funk with a certain number and then this
key is compared if it's different so it
passes that beef but inside the function
funk it checks if it's caffeine babe so
somehow we have to change the key but as
you can see this function never changes
the key so this is a common buffer
overflow we have to overflow a certain
value so that we can overwrite the local
variable key on a stick I created some
more extensive videos about how above
overflow works and how you can how those
local variables are stored on the stack
and stuff so check out my hacking
instruction playlist where I go into
this in more detail basically what we
want we want to throw a lot of
characters edit it so that it's
overflowing the buffer and then
overwriting the key with a value that we
want I'm now going on this server before
just to help be on the same system so I
can debug this because I obviously am on
a Mac machine and I need a Linux machine
so I can test some stuff and instead of
opening up my own virtual machine with
Linux I just want to use the machine
from Ponyville but I think they prevent
you from using W get or generally
connect to services from inside the
Foreman's like that those servers not
that you use it for like but as a botnet
to you know does somebody or something
so I use SCP to upload the binary to the
to the server
then we can connect to it again and then
start analyzing this binary
obviously TMP is not readable because
there are other users on the system
playing the same game and if you could
read TMP you could read and see what
other people are doing but we know that
we created that we uploaded BOF so we
can now analyze this here
so we want to make a breakpoint at the
compare of the function so that's the
disassembly of the function and so we
can run it and then I fail to make it
executable so do it again we set a
breakpoint at the compare where we
compare the key to the specific number
but I get still some weird arrows it's
executable but still some weird arrow so
I at this moment I am a bit confused
so I create my own directory because TMP
is you know not readable and maybe gdb
has a problem with it and but but inside
our own directory we cannot read so I
try it again
yeah and now it seems to work so let's
create here our break point in this gdb
session
first of all just assemble the function
again just so that we can see it nicely
and then we create a breakpoint at this
address so we start this and we type
something in and now we hit the
breakpoint and we can look at the
registers and in if you look in the
disassembly it loads the value from EBP
plus hex eight and that value is
compared to cafe babe so it's still dead
beef obviously so it's restarted again
and let's create a pattern so that we
can see which what with what power we
can overflow may be the key variable
so we hit the breakpoint we can look
again at this address and apparently we
have overwritten the key with for a for
a for e we can use Python to see that
for E is the character n so apparently
those many this many characters resulted
in an is the padding or the offset and
and then from that on we can write the
specific value so what we want is
basically we want to write until M and
then basically want to write the cafe
babe
and again I cannot simply just copy this
because I I need to do it from backwards
so it's it's ending with B E and B a F E
and C a and then I throw it against it
but I forgot the pipe stack smashing
detected terminated why is that stack
smashing detected means that there was a
stack canary a certain special value on
the stack and if that forgets
overwritten and the function tries to
return it will simply terminate so I
have somehow written this value which is
clear because we have overton stuff on a
stick but if you look at the source code
it we shouldn't return we should have to
shell before so we have to use this
trick with cat because the echo will
close the input and with this cat come
together we can still have opened the
input and we can then read the flag you
can see the same technique used in other
videos of mine if you don't know that
one okay up to the next level and that
is called level flag again this is
apparently a reversing top challenge we
only have a binary file you can check
it's a 64 bit of linux executable so
basically first thing checking the
strings may be the password or the flag
is already in it
and it says here this file is packed
with the upx executable pecker so this
is a strong indication that obviously
it's upx packed and we need to unpack it
and that we find so much random garbage
is probably because it got script is
packed with upx and it creates a lot of
random strings
so now I do decide to start my VM
because maybe I need some more debugging
or reversing tools so and that's why I
need a Linux machine
and I go in the share folder the share
folders shared between the virtual
machine and my Mac so I can play some
files in there and work on them on both
machines but I can also simply just
download the flag again
so now I just install upx because that
should allow me to unpack this binary or
decompress or whatever so I look in the
main page and try to find again how
exactly you decompress or unpack AUP
expect binary
my search for like unpack and extract
and try to find what the parameter was
again but I cannot find it so I quickly
search online again how maybe it says
somewhere else how it works and then
decompress and then I find maybe upx - D
so you px minus T and minus T is a flag
contested and finds yeah this one is you
P expect so if with minus L we cannot
know with minus L we can check if the
flag is if it's packed with you px
I think I missed the minus D to
decompress that's why I'm looking around
here
it was right there but I must have
missed it so I'm searching again manual
unpacking of course that's interesting
very interesting I've never done it
actually but you know if you know that
the tool works and sometimes you just
use it okay now I see it it's you px
minus T and the ID unpacked one file
cool so we can look at it again and it's
not packed with upx anymore so it got
unpacked so now we can do a strings on
it and yeah that looks much more normal
and common for a normal binary
so this is weird there's a lot of stuff
in this binary that's a bit interesting
so maybe let's just execute it first
have to make it executable I will mail
like a string copy the flag there take
it okay so it will string copy the D
flag somewhere this means it will be
then later in memory so let's let's
analyze this binary a little bit
obviously we have to we can also open it
in hopper
I'm going to my tools - the vagrant
shell folder and open the flag
okay here's main takes a while to
analyze it's a very loaded one I don't
exactly know what's in there what maybe
some interpreter or something I don't
know
so now I'm looking for string copy
because it said it would string copy the
flag and but we cannot find any
references to string copies so not so
sure what I'm do no flag is also no
results okay so this seems to be the
like the main function where it prints
this stuff so there's the real main here
and yeah we can also see the melech here
so that's cool and maybe this one is the
string copy the the questionable call
there so we just break at the end of
main now we are there so now we can just
look around and then I note I'm looking
around and I see that on the stack there
it looks like that there's a string
because we're a RI X is pointing to and
it says upx our soda but now I get
annoyed because pone debug or gdb cuts
the string and doesn't it doesn't
display the full string it makes me very
annoyed right now
and I have no idea how to tell gdb to
please print the whole string so what I
do know is I have an idea I could maybe
go via the proc file and just cut them
process memory but that doesn't work and
maybe and I actually don't know if I'm
not sure if that worked like I thought
that you could simply read the the
memory of a process like that if I mean
if you are rude but now you have to look
into this again now I'm thinking maybe
it was not man maybe it was a different
a different file and proc but it says it
should be it should be should be mem but
then I realized I have to know where
exactly it's mapped in memory and I have
to probably seek to those special
addresses and stuff so that's not as
simple as cat
and I think about maybe with print I can
something and then I can maybe do printf
to just print this as a string but I
don't really know exactly the syntax how
how that works with gdb maybe like
regular printf no form of string missing
but actually there's an example so it is
without parentheses
no just the correct parameter and there
there it is you pick sounds like a
delivery service and that's the play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
