be another let's play series on the life
overflow gaming channel we are going to
play an MMO together this game was
released in 2015 and now I finally get
to play it
pony Adventure 3 Pony Island is a
limited release first-person true
open-world MMORPG set on a beautiful
island where anything could happen
that's because this game is
intentionally vulnerable to all kinds of
silly hacks flying endless cash and more
are all one client change or network
proxy away are you ready for the mayhem
wait what
no really we have security professionals
that want to help game designers
understand how and why players are able
to take advantage of design and
programming flaws by creating a game
that is intentionally flawed we can
create an example for developers of what
not to do so this game was made solely
for a security CTF competition in 2015
back then I was getting into CTS and I
heard of it happening and I remember
feeling so envious of everybody who was
able to play it back then I had no clue
and thought this is just insane what
people can do it I didn't even bother
trying it because I had no idea where to
start and it was scary this is until
antonin Bonjour wrote me on Twitter
telling me that he was offering
trainings with this and told me I could
make a video about it and he could help
me I really appreciate him reaching out
to me and I was really grateful of the
support I got though I couldn't just use
his material or any other write-up for
that matter this is another personal
challenge of mine similar to the rittany
revenge challenge this is something that
I looked up to some years ago and I
finally think I'm at the point where I
understand enough about computers to
play it myself so he's the reason why I
finally decided to look at it and of
course I would like to thank the cradles
of pony Adventure 3 pony adventure 3 is
the brainchild of one rusty Wagner he's
responsible for their idea the planning
and nearly all of the execution
programming level design quests and so
forth without him there would be no game
special thanks also goes to the ghost in
the shell code organizers for their
support during development and testing
and down here you can see the logo of
vector 35 rusty Warner is from vector 35
and maybe you know that company because
this is also the company that develops
the disassembler binary ninja these
people are amazing anyway I know this
video is a bit more casual but this will
probably lead to many videos and so I
want to have a light introduction into
it and give you an outline what to
expect so the next video will be about
setting up the private server they still
have one
public silver running but it can't
handle many concurrent users so better
deploy your own server the game comes
with a server to run on Ubuntu 14 and
clients for Windows Mac and Linux so you
can play and hack the game on any system
but of course techniques and tools are
very different for the different systems
and because I have most experience with
Linux programs I will start with the
Linux client but I can imagine that
occasionally I will look at the other
clients as well and maybe see how to
replicate certain attacks on their if
you are interested in trying this
yourself I will link some resources
below and there exists plenty of
write-ups about it out there already
you should totally look at them if you
are interested in solutions I've for
myself just want to have a blind run as
much as possible it's a personal
challenge to me I'm almost a bit nervous
what if I fail and I still don't know
enough but I hope this shows you that if
you look at certain challenges that you
can't solve now that it's not because
you are stupid it's just you need more
time learning and practicing you can do
it too and for the rest of the video
let's just have a casual let's play off
the game and get a feeling for it I have
not played it yet and I'm eager to just
see it before we dig into anything
technical so join me on exploring pony
island for the first time okay let's see
what level flow lets place will be like
I'm super excited but nervous at the
same time I'm so scared that I will not
be good enough or able to hack and find
all the stuff but look at this it looks
amazing
if the music oh my gosh
so beautiful okay so let's head in so
I've set up already at the server for
myself so that's a private server okay
okay create a character character
creation process amazing I mean there's
only one option it's this guy because I
need a black hoodie yeah that's the only
one with a black hoodie great then
drawing okay okay escape the lost cave
explore the cave let's see okay we can
jump it's a little bit low gravity like
it feels very we can sneak when you
press shift we have health and we have
mana it looks incredible and it's all
just for CTF there's a bush
entering a lost cave press e to inspect
path block the way is blocked by a large
bush you must search for a way to remove
it
Oh another pretty music is gone so
excited it's their fault damage that's
right no fall damage okay press e to
learn spell acquired great balls of fire
new achievement goodness gracious
okay so one is now okay with what with
one two and three we can switch the
spell and with mouse click we can cast
the spell now and it uses mana okay cool
can we damage ourselves with it oh wait
wait wait
most important check thus fire heard
ourself do we burn most important test
in games
terrible game no fire damage all full
game knows go 360 amazing quest complete
escape the lost cave Oh
a giant rat underground sewer
oh poor rowdy I love rats
there's another rat
there's another one
oh wow what a violent game so I guess
this game is not full fantasy if they're
those are sewers and electrical lights
oh my gosh it looks so amazing sewer
access can we destroy the the boxes
doesn't look like it okay
looks like there's nothing here
entering Pony Island pipe the crapshoot
sewer management are the music another
song oh my gosh this game looks amazing
okay so we have literally no guidance
what to do next but I guess we just
follow the street and just enjoy the
nature okay so they are at some houses
and something down here
Pony Express fast travel system tap the
screen to choose your destination no
destination available okay I guess we
first have to like unlock certain places
before we can fast travel to them most
likely interesting we destroy something
here no okay so two houses let's check
this one out there's a person mayor pain
Oh EDD weapons can take them press e to
talk welcome to my gun shop what do you
need I need guns lots of guns
I've heard some legendary weapons on
this island do you have any just
browsing I need guns lots of guns ok so
we have 0 pound coins and I can buy one
for bone currents ok
I heard some legendary weapons out on
this island do you have any there are
many legendary weapons to be found but I
rarely have any to sell the best weapons
are found by adventurous completing
quests but many can be found just by
fighting the enemies around here though
those Reds didn't drop anything I will
seek them on my adventurous amazing ok
stairs so why can't we just steal the
weapons like in any other good game can
we crouch to the window or something I
don't think we can crouch are there like
controls somewhere ok so this is the
menu high resolution obviously oh shit
oh shit no well I guess we try to log
out okay so be right back
aqua so we are now out here in this
region live overflow pone squad black
hoody zero Flags join and we are back
here amazing ok so I guess it's a little
bit interesting because we were up here
and so we spawned down here this I guess
like each region has like a certain
spawn point where you would come out
again I think that's that might be
important to know I know for example
guild was - there's such a thing as
avoid jumping where you would go out of
bounds and when you reload into the game
the game would try to set you to a valid
location again and if you were out of
bounds it could teleport you on top of
things that you usually couldn't reach
so you know I don't know stuff like that
might be interesting and there was a
person downstairs so let's talk to that
person
Justin tolerable I got out of the town
of adventure because of the Bears and
moved to pony island and guess what what
happened the same bears are here too
they are following me what are you going
to do
I will pay anyone for bear skins I just
want to see those bears dead especially
after my new discovery and your
discovery what are the best doing now
the Bears are defending yet another big
legendary chest of valuable treasure and
they figured out our old tactics I could
whine about this all day you're buying
bearskin can I help
Qwest started unbearable revenge find
the bear's treasure sure go over the
unbearable woods and defeat those Spears
you can keep the treasure I just want
them gone I receive ok selling nothing
to sell
ok find the best treasure I just
realized maybe we should check if we
have a map I press M nothing happens and
I guess let's trust the game designers
and just follow the path Oh
enabling PvP in okay so if you press V
you start PvP inventory is I that makes
sense
Oh L is achievements that might be kind
of like the flags as well maybe I don't
know the right to arm bears
okay let's continue entering Coney
Island
lucky quest started block his revenge
okay so that's a different can we see
our quest somehow okay wait options
there's nothing here for assume game
okay
Opie oh my gosh oh oh my gosh is amazing
or matrix available quest with J
unbearable revenge block his revenge
okay cool can we get more information
no okay okay so solve the puzzles and
four blocks press e to toggle okay okay
so I guess now with puzzles like this
you always have to wonder are you just
stupid and you can't solve them or or is
or did you have to exploit something but
okay so these were just simple simple
logical gates basically more logical
gates okay so let's see what do we have
here okay all three on this is taking
the inverse and that might be an or so
if we disable yeah that's an ORAC okay
so these these are inputs
that's an or gate and that's and what's
the name I have to Google this it's a
not gate of course okay so this is a not
gate and this is an or gate and so we
solve this amazing pew pew pew pew pew
okay so what do we have here so that I
guess okay this is I think a gate it's a
new gate and that one also looks
differently so let's see how it behaves
so if we turn wait okay so if we toggle
that so all of them are on now all of
them are one so this one maybe that's a
an end let's see if we turn one off
output is on and if we turn this off is
off oh no so that's an XOR
if both are on yeah so okay so that's an
X or it's one when they are different
and the this is those are not gates
again okay so
they said okay where's this connected
orders over here so let's turn this one
off but this one one instead yeah it's
quite logical okay oh shit okay
so this looks like a computer holy shit
holy crap Wow okay so these are bit
inputs and this is definitely a computer
that you know more complex logic gates
holy shit might be you know a calculator
or something all right it's amazing yeah
oh fuck okay glad we can't die holy shit
okay this is more certainly something
you probably wouldn't like solve in game
mapping out all these connections that
seems extremely like a lot of work a ton
of work
okay so all these input things arrived
here at the end and then there's a okay
so that is that is definitely an error
like an error flag thing
each of these are error flags and they
are all like put together and they are
all with or gates put together and so if
one of these arrow pillows is one the
whole chain will be one and then the the
output fails so you have to get all of
these turned off like this one here and
like this one here but obviously that is
probably not as easy with these input
you would have to match the whole
logical thing yeah I wonder if you have
to draw this all by hand or if you can
somehow like if you have to we have to
figure this out by hand or if we do this
somehow like reverse engineer the game
itself yeah curious interesting oh and
here's a glass so we can't get in and
that's amazing chest is so cool
okay so I mean the solution for this is
you could map all the inputs and look up
all the gates like go high up up there
and look over everything and draw on a
piece of paper or the logical gates but
oh man that's that would be a lot of
work and you could easily make errors
that might be something that we have to
do reverse engineering on the client or
maybe brute force let's walk back and
see how many inputs this thing takes
okay so oh it does take quite a lot of
input so 1 2 3 4 5 6 30 31 so these are
quite a lot of bits depends on where
this logic is like if we can identify
this kind of logic implemented in
assembler easily then like an easy
function if we find like a check check
binary function we can like extract it
that is route forcible but it also
should be reversible like if you map out
all of these logic gates that is like a
fairly probably a fairly easy thing to
solve but yeah that is like doing that
by hand oh my gosh that's too much this
is cool I love this we need more games
like this
okay so let's head out off the cave and
and go the other other path we
definitely need a teleport heck walking
so slow or speed heck okay so we are
back so where was the path there's the
path so let's that's how do we want to
continue here oh my gosh
this island is amazing I don't know
where to go so there were the houses
yeah let's let's head down to maybe the
shore
so with Jay we can change the quest to
find the Bears treasure oh my gosh it's
so beautiful yeah what is that a giant
rat are they ours down more rats
phew a sniper
oh I failed shrine rats okay so I guess
there's no like level system and terms
of ax XP and and and leveling up join
rats giant rats amazing bam bam oh you
dropped something
I got pwned coins more pong coins no
rifle ammo Oh amazing okay I guess
what's this where we started yeah that's
where we started
rifle ammo rounds for automatic rifles
you don't need to be a better shot you
just need to shoot more bullets there's
also some stats of our magic spell
okay so where do we go now I'm not a
giant rat
I haven't done anything in this game
basically and I love this game already
oh there's something are those stairs
Oh another building looks like a
restaurant of some sorts
look at this view holy shit this is
amazing
Neil
you gotta believe damn it so cool
how do I know in which area I currently
am
ah there's a house of farm is that a
ship over there
entering gold farm sheeps I thought I
get gold from you there's another person
I pick the other looks us like a
forester should check that out something
something wrong
welcome to gold farm I farm all day to
provide for this island but it has all
gone wrong what's wrong my cows are
missing one night I heard a massive
amount of thunder then my house had
disappeared I have no idea where they
went
I will let you know if I see them okay
until cows come home find the lost cows
so what's that that looks like
a hunt power those are over there's a
whole village the Pirate Bay can't climb
no The Pirate Bay
okay I mean at some point I definitely
want to explore the ship but right now
I'm still looking for those bears more
giant rats their loot own coins this is
so pretty okay I really hope that over
there where it looked a little bit
foresty it's maybe the forest and it
should be closer to the area where we
got the quest I would assume so I
shouldn't wander too far off and I'm
kind of circling around the mountain no
I think I think if my orientation was
not completely screwed up
oh there's an entrance to something
oh that's brought that's that's another
fast travel maybe we can fast travel
back to where we were entering gold for
okay fast travel town of Pony Island
Faust fast travel now you are thinking
with portals
I'll have the references are way too
much okay wait oh I already traveled
adjusting notice I'm back okay cool
so instead of going up the mountain
let's go to the right of it or the game
just crashed that's sad
okay so we are back here and we still
have everything of course it's an online
game so we don't lose any progress
earlier we took the path up there so
let's see what's down here
Luud oh wait how did we switch the view
again the chief at a PPP I was people
shotgun ammo pistol ammo it's a new
fashionable place the unbearable woods
okay so we we literally went the wrong
way the whole time I get the music
amazing I'm hyped I'm hyped there's a
bear boom boom boom boom easy no skull
360 easy easy easy
I got a bear skin amazing there are more
bears back there there's another one
pew pew pew pew
oh yeah robear's okay so how many did he
say how many we need I don't think so
so the fine fine oh no find the best
treasure I guess we can only sell to him
bearskins as well
okay so let's explore a bit more for
them all those Bears charging
the music is amazing let's head in there
over there with the fires that looks
like a main area it's like old school
MMO farming pull all the mobs and then
kill them all oh shit I'm out of mana I
forgot that we have mana that's
unfortunate
okay there's a treasure chest I don't
trust it to be honest I don't trust this
game at all
okay so timer five minutes sure oh shit
oh fuck forty health
I wonder if we can like stand on a stone
and they can't reach us because stay
within the circle oh shit
okay I've tied to a bear
yeah I I would assume that we are just
like not strong enough not deal with
these weapons I'm sure you would get
swarmed with so many bears that you just
can't do it legit I guess let's try it
one more time and collect definitely
collect the bear skins and now let's not
deplete our mana already by shooting
painlessly around
okay let's collect the stuff okay let's
just let's try if we can stand like on
here
oh no okay we cannot this game is good
okay so I guess that's head maybe I
don't know what you do I guess we slowly
reach a point where we have to look more
into the technical stuff on the side
like how can we defeat them and we could
also try to get some guns like farm a
bit of money and see if they're worse
but no I'm sure there's somehow a way
how you can increase the damage
and I'm sure there's a way the game
prevents I guess all gold chests are
suck you can only get to them if you
somehow you know exploit something hex
something so let's explore for a little
bit more so the pirate ship was over
there so let's try to go to the pirate
ship as well so we have seen the ship
and maybe let's look over there and the
island as well and just so we get a good
overview of of the world what's here
imagine how this must have been when you
started the CTF thank you you load it in
with your team and characters and you
started exploring this for the first
time you have to time pressure off the
CTF trying to find those flags and you
run into those bears and there are so
many other players trying and at the
same time
I must have been so interesting yeah
let's check the boat set it chest as
well I don't trust it Oh DLC oh I I
guess I was wrong with the free to play
I guess you have to pay unlock unlock
code enter this not valid try again okay
I guess we know what we have to do here
okay oh are we walking on water
we are jaysus tail mountains spiders
poor coins angry bear videos also angry
bears oh shit
they have a lot more HP I'm glad
oh shit I did not see that bear coming
monster kill achievement what was so
special about this one mister kill an
elite enemy okay was not very elite I
have to say thank you that you were
bugged oh fuck
give me that loot
ouch didn't expect this to be so quick I
gotta write the Kaif we saw from all the
way over there okay quest started fire
and ice' investigate the molten cave
spider just this lava at least kill you
I assume I guess I don't know Mack maroc
oh shit I assume I cannot kill that dude
and get his chest let's just hear like
pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew let's
steal it
oh no I can't access it oh you can
destroy the fireball oh shit I fell in
the water
magma lava there was another past the
other direction let's try that one
okay so that's ice I guess up there fire
and ice okay
oh what's that what are these things
yeah oh shit
what are these things do
hey I did quite a lot of damage to that
thing
did I bug it behind the thing amazing
look at this I'm hacking this game
already
look how difficult it is to create like
online games and stuff you know if you
have a back like this and this is easy
to farm then it's pretty terrible like
we didn't even do anything technical yet
and it's just you know it's it's a
challenge to implement all this path
finding and coalition checks and
everything okay so it's dead
okay okay more sauce chill out it's your
cool okay I'm not sure if this is how it
was intended I think maybe we should
have not been able to do that on the
other hand it was pretty weak I assume
if we would like you know buy weapons
with home coins we farm it would be able
to to kill that it's just Mitchell odd
obtain it oh we got a nice spell I
didn't even notice
BAM
oh shit nice what a genius who made this
game okay let's try this again
yeah that's easy easy easy look at these
skills I have this movement oh shit what
is he doing now
He healed kikyo okay I guess that's not
the way how to do it he's he healed up
I guess that's that's where you have to
either be much stronger or you know
figure out a different way to go crazy
that's crazy okay let's head out again
ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch die die
I'm so cool the fireball is slower than
the ice so you can kill your own
fireball yeah I think this is where we
died earlier to one of the angry bears
and I think we have seen most of it
maybe there's more to discover but I
think for now we got a really good
overview basically all the chests those
are the challenges the flags for the CTF
I guess and we have seen quite a few
that we could potentially you know try
to tackle so I think that's a good point
now to stop it for now and then let's
stick into the technical stuff and do
some information gathering and see how
far we get and if something jumps out to
us that could be useful to solve one of
these challenges that we have here so so
one last thing before we end this
there's an offline play as well so let's
just really check that out and yeah so
you can also play it offline I guess I
don't I assumed like a lot of the text
still kind of work it just wouldn't be
about networking it would just be
changing local client stuff but yeah
awesome
