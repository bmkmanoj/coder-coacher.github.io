license check program from last time you
can get the same compiled 64-bit binary
from github and you can also watch the
last video where I went into more detail
how to correct the simple program I will
show now different simple tools and
techniques that exist to analyze a
program like that to circumvent the
license check this should show you that
there are a variety of different ways
how to solve this challenge the file
command is very useful to check what
kind of file you have so file on your
binary says it's an elf 64-bit
executable for Linux you can also do
file start to get the information on all
files in the directory and it then also
finds the C source code here so that's
very useful let's open the program in a
text editor
like vim as you can see it looks very
weird I have introduced S key before so
you know that every character is
assigned a number but there are numbers
that don't have printable characters
assigned if you look at the main page
for ASCII again you see for example
value 0 2 X 1 F are not normal
characters as Keys also only defined up
to hex 7 F or 127 but because computers
work with bytes so 8-bit this number can
range from 0 to 255 and ASCII only has
half of them so all those weird blue
values in BIM are such numbers that
don't have printable characters assigned
you can also do a hex term of the file
to get the actual values hex temp - C
license 1 and you can see that there are
many many zeros in this file hex temp
displays them as dots but in wim they
are the blue stuff but when you look
closely there are quite a few meaningful
strings in there for example right at
the beginning elf which is a magic value
hinting that this file is an elf
executable you can also find some
strings to libraries such as slip C
which defines functions such as printf
and string compare
and here we also see strings we know the
Czech license access granted
wrong and the usage message and also
this weird-lookin AAAA sion 42 okay
string hmm remember from last video that
there was a string comparing it might
get the license key we enter compared to
this string let's try it
ooh access granted indeed the license
key of this program was in there all
along there's a great tool called
strings that is doing what we just did
just nicer it will scan a file and print
out all printable character sequences
with at least a certain length so let's
try it with strings license one and
there are strings last time we use gdb
to read the disassembly and also debug
the program this time let's just use
object dump for the disassembly object
dum minus D licensed one you notice that
this file has a lot of more code than
just the main function that is because
the compiler puts a bit more stuff into
the actual binary you know computers are
a little bit more complex than they seem
at first but all this is just standard
stuff you basically find in any GCC
compiled binary and usually only the
user created functions like main are
interesting to us object dumb can be
used to get a lot of more information
about this program let's print every
header with object dump and pipe it into
less for easier navigation so first it
says the file is an elf binary for x86
64 architecture the stack is not
executable indicated by the missing X
which is interesting once we will look
at classic buffer overflows and maybe
the last interesting info here are these
sections we can see where certain data
will later end up in memory interesting
for us here is the text section this
section holds our code and installs at
address 4 0 0 for D 0 and is hex 1 e 2
big and if you check the address where
the main function was you will notice
that it's in there the other interesting
section is our Oh data which is the
read-only
a section so our strings can be found in
there if you open up gdb and break at
the string compare you can check the
registers and one of those registers
will have an address from this arrow
data section you can print this address
with X / s and voila there's our key
again let's have a look at another more
active tool it's called s trace and it
can trace system calls and signals when
I introduce programming in C we use
printf to print text that was a nice
function that we added to our program
from the Lipsy library but printf is
just a wrapper around the function that
the Linux system itself provides Linux
itself offers many different kind of
functions called sis calls you can read
more about them in the main page to
source calls one of those functions is
write and write can be used to write
texts to the standard output which we
can read on the console so let's execute
the license program with s trace this
first line is X Sigma e which is the
function that tells the Linux kernel
to now execute this program license 1
and then a lot of magic stuff happens
that we ignore for now and somewhere all
the way at the bottom here the code that
I have written starts basically the main
function and you can here see the rights
as calls that were executed with the
text that we know that's interesting huh
there's another cool tool called elk
race similar to esterase it trades a
certain functions but this time it races
library functions functions like printf
or string compare come from the Lipsy
library so L trays can show us their
occurrence so first you can see the
printf and then comes the string compare
and it shows us the actual strings it
compares so that also tells us how the
license check works in a pretty cool way
let's throw this file in a graphical
user interface I will use hopper on Mac
as you may know either Pro is very
expensive but hopper is a great
alternative which is actually affordable
hopper sees that it's an elf executable
and it can automatically analyze it for
us it places our cursor at the function
called start and not at main like we've
seen with object dump before there are
few more functions created by the
compiler and this here is the real entry
point of the program by what those
functions are doing is not important
right now
we are only interested in the main
function so we can look for the main
function in the list of labels so here's
our main function
like in gdb just a bit more colorful and
hopper can also show us with arrows
where our branches are going at the end
of the last video I have already showed
you the control flow graph which you can
access at the top right and a very cool
feature from hopper is the D compiler
decompiling sounds like it would simply
reverse assembler code back to C code
but that is not easy the compiler of
changes and optimizes stuff and and you
just cannot simply reverse it but hope I
can guess how it might have looked like
sometimes it makes mistakes but often it
looks pretty good so it shows us here
how it checks if we have supplied the
license key and then it does the string
compare and it prints either access
granted or wrong so that's pretty cool
to the left you can also find a button
to display all strings and as you can
see it also found the key when you click
on it it will jump to the address where
the key is located an xref stands for
cross reference that means this address
is referenced somewhere we can follow
that xref and we can see that this is
the assembler code where the address of
the key is moved into the ESI register
this prepares the function parameters
for string compare some kids may have
the opinion that make users suck to
please them we will install now radar a
two by cloning the red arrow to
repository with kit
you might have to install kit with sudo
apt-get install git first to instant
read our run sis install SH and wait
once it's installed you can go to the
licensed one program and open it in
radar with our two license one you may
remember this address from object them
earlier this is the start of the text
segment that contains our code first-run
AAA to automatically analyze and auto
name functions then use AOL to print all
functions that radar phone each
character and radar means something and
with question mark you always get
information about the characters you can
use so a performs analysis of code a
question mark shows us that we can
append F to analyze functions and AFL
lists those functions make sense right
okay so AFL shows us that it found a
main function so let's change our
current location with s to seek to the
location of the function main you can
also use tab completion here
now the location in those brackets
changed with PDF we can print the
disassembly of the current function like
hopper it shows us the assembly with
nice arrows where branches go to and it
created comments for us with strings
that are referenced in there you can
also type capital VV to enter visual
mode this shows you a control graph view
of this function you can move it around
with the arrow keys and the blue border
indicates that we currently select this
box with tab and shift tab you can
select other blocks when you have a
block selected you can move the block
with Shift + H JK or L with P you can
cycle through different representations
for example with or without the
addresses in the beginning or this
minimalistic view which is useful if you
have a damn huge function and with
question mark you can display your help
The Help tells you that capital R is the
most important shortcut you will ever
learn for adhara
so press shift are and be happy you can
also use red array like gdb to debug the
program to do that start radare with the
minus D flag seek to the main function
analyze all with a a and display the
disassembly with PDF now place a
breakpoint at the start with D B now go
into the visual fuel with capital VB
again like with rim you can enter
command mode with : where you can type :
DC to run the program now we hit the
breakpoint 1 and if you look closely you
notice the our IP in the first box this
shows us where the instruction pointer
currently points tool with s you can
step instructions but we should use
capital S otherwise we follow functions
which we don't want to so shift s to
step further damn
we didn't supply a license key but you
get the idea
I hope this helps you to explore more
tools and techniques and remember that
no tool is better than the other they
all have different features and
representations of information it makes
sense to master them all except radar
some say that radar is best but nobody
ever masters radar
