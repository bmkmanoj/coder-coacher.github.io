hardware CTF a long time ago
Raj me too I have a whole playlist
covering various different challenges
two of them cover reverse engineering a
binary that would be running on the
Arduino board which means the
architecture is AVR and if you are not
very familiar with reversing embedded
devices or AVR I would recommend you
watching these videos before continuing
here this video will be about another
reversing challenge but explained by
Zeta 2 I didn't solve that challenge but
he was really excited of sharing this
write-up with us this video was planned
for a long time and because I still
don't have a good process for working
with other people I screwed up the first
time we recorded this so thank you for
sitting down with me a second time so I
am Carl or on the internet known as Sita
2 and I play a lot of CD f's but before
we fully head into the technical parts I
want to highlight something I know from
the time when all of the stuff was new
to me that reverse engineering and
reading all of this assembler code and
figuring out what it does seemed so
impossible how can anybody ever know and
learn all of that the truth is we don't
know all of it it's a mix of knowledge
experience gut feeling research and
guessing and assumptions then over time
all of these things get better more
refined and you are able to understand
more and more complex systems and so
when you listen to call I want you to
pay attention to his language even when
he is fairly certain with something he
uses language like it looks like it
could be maybe if we assume and it makes
sense because we are exploring an
unknown target we have to start
somewhere and piece together the puzzle
early on you can make guesses like this
blue could be the sky in the top of the
picture but maybe later you realize it
was actually part of a blue car and I
think a key takeaway here is how
important is it to always make
assumptions try to picture the whole
thing but try to verify it somehow and
be always ready to accept that an
assumption was wrong and that is
probably the key to success
anyway let's head in
frigate reverse-engineering 400 points a
senior technical manager of a fridge
manufacturer demanded the ability to
update the firmware it turned out that
the cpu that comes with the fridge does
not allow self upgrading the firmware so
the developers built a VM for the fridge
software a crafty customer has been able
to reverse engineer the software and
programmed the fridge with different
software his goal was to build a digital
safe are you able to crack the password
we have been able to extract the full
firmware image of a slightly different
fridge and a memory dump of their fridge
we hope this is enough and we get the
challenge binary which you could flash
onto the board which is basically the
same as the firmware dot pin and the
memory dump as you can see our Gemma to
had this neat map for the challenges and
here is a fridge said this was one in a
series of challenges about reversing
virtual machine on the AVR you can see
that the path connects two more
challenges but let's look at the first
one so call will now retell how he
reverse engineered and solved this
challenge and obviously it all starts
with Ida the first start is to load this
in Ida so I'm using my old idea so I've
already named stuff but we'll go through
how you can come up with these names and
realize what is what like the reversing
process so Ida
is a reverse engineering tool that helps
you puzzle together the pieces it helps
you to visualize code flow and some
other stuff and you are able to add
names for functions and add comments so
these function names were not here from
the start call gave the name to those
functions based on what they do and so
he will now walk us through some
important functions and how you can
figure that out but some other names
reference for example this memory
location here called IO you see as R 0 a
is how Ida can help you one thing that's
very convenient that's probably the
absolutely first thing you should do
when
versing some kind of embedded thing and
I did this at some point but it took me
a while is to get the memory mapping of
the device so that you can name memory
areas properly so if you look at some
data sheet for the processor there will
be a list of what memory regions are
mapped to what function different
registers have special meanings what he
describes here you can see my AVR
reversing video in a bit more detail but
essentially small CPUs like this atmega
have to interact with other hardware for
example maybe it supports serial and you
know serial is this high low high low
protocol at a certain speed and you
don't have to program that yourself an
assembler this chip has this as a
feature and all you have to do is to
write an assembler which symbol you want
to transmit and a certain memory address
is mapped to this Hardware feature so
when you write a value to that address
in assembler code some part of the chip
in the hardware will receive that value
and then perform the proper low high
serial communication that's what map
memory means very simple concept but
very powerful and additionally their
memory in general like the ROM or Ram
are also mapped to certain memory ranges
and you want to know where is what in
order to understand what is referenced
by addresses in the assembler code and
you can find all of this information in
the manual the documentation of the chip
used and in either there's support for
having configuration files where you can
define a processor and that you can tell
it all the memory areas and what their
names are for the atmega328 which is the
one used in the cdf there isn't one in
either but I actually found some forum
post the way someone had created one
like this so I just copied it into my
Ida AVR config file so this is a
definition file for the atmega328 where
you have names for all the different
registers and point of this is that then
when you low
the binary into Ida you will have things
named from the start if you go here you
will have some memory areas named in Ida
and this is very nice because then you
can look for interesting registers and
look where they're used in the code and
you can start working your way backwards
from there so for example one very like
basic thing that we want to find out is
like how and where in the code does it
communicate like send and receive data
on the serial port so if you look in the
manual you will see that it uses this
register to communicate on the serial
Airport so you can see where this is
used you will find function and this
means that this is a function
responsible for sending data on the
serial port wait how do you know that
it's sending data here exactly
it basically tells is I'm gonna send
stuff and then it loads data into this
register then gets sent away on the
serial so basically we're looking for a
place where something is writing to this
register and also conversely it receives
data by reading this register so if we
look where this register is used we find
exactly two places so one place it
writes data into this register and one
place it reads data from this register
so basically we look at this function we
see that first it checks the status of
this register and basically what is
doing here is checking that it's clear
to send data that it's not busy
so it just loops here until it's ready
to send and then it sends one byte and
the other way around if you look at the
other function you have here so it loops
until it's ready to receive and then it
receives one byte and returns that so it
felt very natural to name these IO
receive and IO send and we can then see
where this is used and it's used in a
number of places and for example this
function which I have named print text
so it's basically calling the iOS and
function in a loop so the function does
me it basically takes a pointer to to
some data and then it loops over that
data and
one bite at a time and in the same
fashion we have on the receiving end
there are functions using this to to
receive data that's nice
we'll check deeper on that track later I
think but for now we can just go back to
like where the program start this is
also a thing that you get from loading
the config you get all the interrupts
able or what do you call it so and the
reset one is basically the entry point
for the processor so this is where
everything starts running when the
program starts and this is basically
like a standard thing where it's copies
some static data into some location and
it clears a memory region so up until
here called sounds like he knows exactly
what he's doing like if you read the
stuff every day and yes this is clearly
coming from experience how programs and
chips work and being able to read the
documentation the manual of the chip and
making sense of it but of course he
doesn't know everything
it's a puzzle other parts of the picture
take more effort and time until he
realizes it in the beginning I thought
it was really this was important but
then I realized this is just like a
standard setup thing it's like the the
start function before the main function
in a regular x86 program so he had an
assumption at the beginning which much
later turned out to be wrong I mean I
think I moved on but then I revisited it
later and I realized that what it's
doing it's copying static data from the
ROM into the RAM so I think here maybe
yeah
basically the RAM is empty when you
start and then the program loads
basically global variables and constants
and things like that so it's a loop
copying data from the ROM into the RAM
at a certain location and then there is
this part which just zeros out basically
the rest of the RAM so this is just
setting up
the whole Ram region and then you call a
function which eventually ends up so
this is more like the main function
where interesting things starts to
happen so now that we know where the
main function starts car goes into the
section here which uses the very obvious
print text function it's not far-fetched
to understand that the loading
instructions before the call load the
data for the printing I mean if you look
down here a little bit and look at these
addresses so in the ROM we have some
string constants embedded basically
there is these strings related to
loading a program into the machine and
there's something here that looks like a
debug menu and something here that looks
like a table of registers so and here's
this frigate console so it looks like
all of this is related to like debugging
this thing remember that the challenge
description said that the developers
built VM so this is some kind of virtual
machine built on top of the AVR so we
could then guess that there is some kind
of debugging feature in the virtual
machine here you also have this
interesting thing with the AVR that it's
basically an 8-bit processor but it has
16-bit addressing so you load some
addresses you load them one byte at a
time so these are the two halves of an
address which is pointing to this string
before these were named this region
already looks interesting because it has
this repeating pattern like load two
bytes call a function load two by its
caller functions you can guess that this
is actually like doing something that's
interesting so it's also the same
function maybe it's like you know
setting up some data or encrypting or
decrypting I mean it didn't know before
it so first of all it loads into the arc
24 and 25 registers and you have this
other
thing with the AVR that you have these
regular numbered registers and you'll
have these like meta registers XYZ which
are 16-bit registers that consists of a
pair of registers so basically if you
look at this code you can see that it
takes this address store in the are 24
25 register it loops over it and calls
the iOS and function so we can name this
function print text and then it's very
natural to see what this part is doing
is it's printing out a menu so it says
that we should provide a bootrom and
then it prints out this like prompt
thing so a natural guess is that the
next thing that's going to do is take
some input from from the user right I
think this is a good point to cut this
episode we have used the atmega manual
and an Ida conflict to load the binary
identify important registers that are
used for communication and trace the
usage backwards to functions that
clearly read or print data with it and
then we also went the other way around
and started at the real start of the
processor and found the main function
that is using the print text function
from earlier so see you next time
