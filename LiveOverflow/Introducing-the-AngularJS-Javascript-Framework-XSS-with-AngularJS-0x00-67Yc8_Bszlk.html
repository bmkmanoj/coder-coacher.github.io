real life exploit we will have a look at
a JavaScript framework called angularjs
you can use that to create fancy modern
web apps while the concept is pretty
cool the framework suffers from kind of
a design issue any exploit I will show
in this video was not found by me
references and credits are in the
description and displayed here and a big
thank you to mario from cue 53 and
Gareth Hayes from pods Vega web security
block most of what I show is based on
their research and work in the first
part I will give a very quick
introduction to how to write apps with
angularjs if you haven't used it before
take some time and follow a simple
tutorial to understand it better
for example the official angularjs
getting started tutorial and after we
had a look at a simple angle J as
example I will explain my setup here and
how we can debug angularjs so that in
part 2 we can focus on stepping through
the code of an older version of
angularjs where we try to bypass the
sandbox and learn more about the angular
internals and then another video we will
then show off some more advanced and box
escapes for more recent versions but
let's start I have written a very simple
angularjs testbed meaning a place where
you can easily play around with angular
let's start by looking at an angularjs
example app look at this table on the
left you can see angularjs expressions
in double curly braces basically how you
would write them into your HTML and on
the right you can see the result after
angularjs evaluated those expressions
and I've made here several examples with
a variable username and some functions
also note that the alert function did
not trigger a pop-up the result is empty
but where do those values variables and
functions come from let's have a look at
the HTML source code just to make it
clear again angularjs is a pure
JavaScript framework so there is no
server part
all those expressions are evaluated on
the client-side in the browser after the
HTML page got downloaded you can see now
that we use angularjs version 1.5 7 and
then we create a new angular application
with the name scope example and then
attach a controller to it with the name
my controller we can pass different
variables to the controller but most
important to us is the scope the scope
is just an object from angularjs which
is available inside the app and you can
see in the code we write that all
variables and functions we define are
attached to that scope they are property
of that scope object and when we look
again at our table where we use the
double curly braces to get the user name
angularjs will basically evaluate the
expression and check if the identifier
username exists in the current scope in
this case there is a user name in the
scope and it contains the string world
thus the result is world similar with
the function say hello the scope has
this function attached and thus we can
call that function within the expression
but alert is not in the scope we didn't
define that so this function doesn't
exist and thus has an empty result two
more things I want to point out the
first column has also curly braces but
they are not evaluated because they have
the ng non bindable attribute set that
deactivates the angularjs for that
element the other thing is the dollar
evil this is not the normal JavaScript
evil function its dollar evil again this
is evaluated against the scope we didn't
define the function dollar evil
ourselves but angularjs has it already
attached to the scope object and that
dollar Evo is similar to regular
JavaScript evil but it doesn't evaluate
arbitrary JavaScript it evaluates
angularjs expression thus dollar evil
say hello is equivalent to double braces
say hello double braces also evaluate
angularjs expressions okay
now let's dive in let's open the testbed
for angularjs version 1.0 8 which is
very old but we need that to understand
later exploits so this is a very simple
PHP app if you look at the source code
you can see a form where you can enter a
text and then whatever is the get
variable Q will be HTML escaped and
safely echoed into the page you can see
that when you try to inject the script
tag to pop alert it doesn't work it's
properly escaped so are we safe from XSS
from cross-site scripting no we are not
angularjs destroys everything that we
have taught web developers escaping your
string is not enough in this case the
crucial detail here is that our input is
reflected into an HTML element that has
angularjs enabled two things to mention
here first of all this is not how
angularjs apps are supposed to be
written angularjs apps should not be
mixed with server-side templating
meaning that the intended way for
angularjs apps to get data is via API
calls after the static HTML site is
loaded so mixing here PHP with angularjs
is a bad practice does it mean that this
example is irrelevant no in real life
this happens all the time
some older PHP app gets extended with
some fancy angularjs and boom you have
just genetically engineered a monster
you can test for angularjs expression
injections by using something simple
like 1+1 if the result shows 2 instead
of the curly braces then you'll likely
have an angularjs or similar framework
injection ok so let's start let's first
explore why alert doesn't work by
looking at angularjs internals open the
developer console and then go to the
sources tab on the left you can see
available JavaScript source code files
and in the center you see the actual
JavaScript code to the right you can
find stuff like the call stack the
variables
breakpoints etc which is important when
you debug JavaScript code and step
through it we will make use of that
shortly and at the bottom maybe you have
to hit escape first to open it you have
a console where you can type in
JavaScript code if you pause at a
breakpoint you have access in that
console to all the variables at this
point in the execution before we execute
it let's quickly take a look at the
angularjs code this is not a minified
version meaning everything is nicely
commented and indent it i've also
modified the code by adding the keyword
debugger in different places
those are like breakpoints when
JavaScript executes that statement it
will stop execution right there and we
can look at the state of the variables
etc okay now let's execute the
expression by submitting this form these
side loads execute angularjs the
expression gets evaluated and we hit our
first breakpoint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
