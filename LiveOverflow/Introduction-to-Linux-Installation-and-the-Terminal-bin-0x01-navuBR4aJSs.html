enter an operating system that allows us
to easily understand how the whole
system works Windows and OS X are closed
systems that make it very hard to
understand our technical level though
actually OS X is very similar to Linux
and a lot of concepts can be transferred
but we will use Linux because we can for
example have a look at the Linux kernel
source code to dig deeper and also most
people come from a different OS namely
Windows or Mac so it will be cool to
learn something new there are many many
distributions of Linux that all have
their own flavor
for example there's Kali Linux formerly
backtrack which is a Linux operating
system that has a lot of pre-installed
tools
intended for penetration testing there
are other Linux distributions that are
more aimed to be used a standard desktop
environment for example Ubuntu a lot of
people run Debian on a server tool some
websites and big companies that need
operating systems with support and
service contracts they often use Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and I know many people
that build their own Linux experience
with Arch Linux and there are hundreds
of other distributions out there so just
google them when you first want to check
out the notes it's difficult to decide
what to go for and you are kind of
whelmed and generally I just suggest go
with Ubuntu it's a very popular
distribution it's easy to use because
it's kind of aimed at people that have
never used Linux before so that's what
we will do but if you are already
experienced with Linux why not take a
weekend and check out arch linux and
built your own system from ground up who
will fail the first time but learn a lot
so I will install Ubuntu as a virtual
machine it makes it easier for me to
record and create those videos but it
also shows another important tool that
is often used for security research
because you can quickly set up new
systems to test something oftentimes you
only have one physical device but with
VMs you can just run a lot of different
systems on a single machine so first
download and install the VM workstation
player as you can see you can download
it for Linux or Windows if you are on a
Mac you might want to try VMware fusion
but it only has a 30-day trial
alternatively use VirtualBox then
download the Ubuntu 64-bit LTS version
if you want you can make sure that you
have the same version like I do but
doesn't really matter this is the VMware
Player and it's like a computer inside
your computer it emulates a real PC
basically you simply create a virtual
hard drive and install anything you like
on it we will use this to install and
run Linux as a so-called guest operating
system which runs inside the real
operating system now let's create a new
virtual machine this will launch a
wizard for easy installation but we will
install the OS ourselves then select the
Linux operating system and also specify
Ubuntu 64-bit if you want to install a
different Linux distribution try to find
it in the list if it's not there just
select other Linux and select the
matching kernel version give it a name
and just use the default settings
imagine this to be like a real physical
computer to install Linux or another
operating system on it
you would have to insert the
installation medium so we will insert
the Ubuntu ISO into the virtual CD drive
when we now start the VM it will boot
from the CD and guides us through the
installation there are no important
settings for us here right now so just
click Next and in a later video we will
probably talk about partitions but for
now just ignore it and continue
after the installation you have to reset
the machine but make sure to remove the
installation medium again to can't boot
from the hard drive where it was
installed
login and welcome to Linux first thing
you notice is that the window is
inconveniently small so we want to
increase it we can use the search field
to find the display settings but the
menu doesn't have an option to set it to
a proper 6 to 9 ratio the 6 to 10 ratio
is slightly too big and we have scroll
bars so let's go crazy and immediately
check out the command line to fix this
the option X wiki is a great place to
learn more about commands that you use
so it tells us that X R and R is a tool
that allows us to configure the monitor
to open the terminal click on the top
left and type in terminal in the search
bar in those two commands just add a new
option of 4 1920 x 1080 now we also see
the option in the display settings cool
now let's just play a little bit with
the command line to get a feeling for it
how it works and it's compared to them
may be more familiar graphical user
interface on the left you can see the
terminal and on the right you can see
the default File Explorer which
currently displays the content of the
home folder
in fact the terminal on the left side is
in a sac same place the first part shows
the current user and after the add is
the computer hostname after the colon
you will find the current location and
the tilt is an alias for the for your
users home folder for example if you
execute the PWD command it will display
the current location which is the home
of the user live overflow before we look
into more commands let me show you one
of the most important source of
information for the Linux system it is
the Linux manual so let's type man
followed by what we are interested in in
this case PWD you should get familiar
how those pages look like because we
will use them a lot right here is the
top it says that PWD will print the name
of the current working directory at the
bottom you get the information as you
can press H to display a help or cue to
quit and get back to the command line so
when you press H you will see a summary
of less commands I will show you later
what less is but for now just think of
it as some kind of text editor that
displays fire content
and this editorial uses key input for
navigation so let's press Q to exit the
help and Q again to exit the manual now
I will quickly go over some commands to
navigate around the file system if you
don't know them I would like to know
more about them you should check out the
main features let's start with LS which
will display the files of the current
folder you can see it looks almost the
same except the graphical interface
shows a shortcut to examples while LS
shows an example desktop file that's
weird let's use cat to look at the
content of the file and investigate this
issue cat just prints the file content
in the terminal and you can now see that
it seems to be some kind of special file
that defines a type link and named
examples so the terminal just displays
the actual file while the peripheral
user interface pauses the example
content file and displays it in a
different way
this is one reason why many people say
that Linux command line is very simple
because you don't have to know all those
weird features that are different in
every program now execute the LS with
the option l to display the files as a
list which also provides more
information like the file permissions
ownership and date the first character
indicates if the file is the directory
maybe you want to know why I say files
while they are all directories the
reason for that is that in linux
everything is a file
Wikipedia even has an entry for
everything as a file and it reads this
is a defining feature of UNIX and its
derivatives a wide range of input-output
resources such as documents directories
hard drives modems keywords printers and
even some inter-process and network
communications are simple streams of
bytes exposed through the file system as
a file over time we will understand this
better now add the option a to display
all files a and L are single character
option switches which is indicated by
the - prefix doesn't matter if you
combine them or specify them separately
but suddenly you see a lot more files
that start with a dot those dot files
were hidden before historically this was
a backhand you can read more about it in
this post but now it's a feature
dot files are often used for config
files now let's look at the file system
we can use CD to change the directory
let's go to the top of the hierarchical
file system which starts at slash now
you can also see that the total changed
to slash which is on your current
location if you specify a path without a
slash it's a relative path going forward
from your current location if you have a
slash it will be an absolute path so
here's just some examples if you look at
the LS output again you notice that
there are two files with dots a single
dot is referencing the current directory
so LS and LS dot is exactly the same and
in double dots go one hierarchy up so
when you are in your home directory you
can use two double dots to go to the top
okay slow enough let's speed up a bit
mkdir makes in your directory touch
makes a new empty file our M deletes a
file if you want to delete a folder you
have to add the recursive option echo
and a character sequence just prints
this text you name and unit with
different arguments provide information
about your system ll is a shortcut file
s with multiple parameters free shows
your current memory usage and with the
parameter age the numbers will be shown
in a human readable format DF shows
filesystem disk space and again with
parameter age the numbers aren't here in
readable format PS gives information
about your currently running processes
with parameters you can also show all
processes with memory usage CPU and more
NID shows you your current user ID one
last important feature to learn about
our pipes and redirection linux becomes
very powerful once you connect multiple
commands together for example echo
prints a string and you can redirect
this output into a file by using the
arrow when you print the content of a
file with CAD you can use the horizontal
line or also often called pipe to
redirect the output from cat into the
input of another program for example you
can pipe the output of the cat command
into the input of the hex dump command
a tool that shows you the actual hex
values behind each character and here
the hex a for example or decimal 10 is
the newline character you should start
becoming familiar with hex because you
will use it a lot check out the main
page of SK characters you can navigate
up and down with arrow keys and exit
with Q one last thing you can press
arrow keys up in the terminal to quickly
enter previous commands and even more
powerful is ctrl R which opens the
search from so if we want to do the hex
dump command again we can type it in and
just hit enter once it's found if you
want to leave the prompt or generally
want to quit a running program you can
hit ctrl C ok cool now when you enter
the beginning of a command you can hit
tap for tab completion so that's it for
now let's shut down the system we're
shut down now Oh what is that you must
be rude to shut down the machine the
root user or also called super user is
very powerful because this user can do
everything but we are currently only the
user life overflow it's good practice to
not use the root user all the time
because you can do a lot of damage with
it but there is a command prefix called
pseudo which elevates your privileges
execute ID with sudo first enter your
password and then you will see that you
executed it as root so now you can use
this to shutdown the VM see you next
time when we will create our first
program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
