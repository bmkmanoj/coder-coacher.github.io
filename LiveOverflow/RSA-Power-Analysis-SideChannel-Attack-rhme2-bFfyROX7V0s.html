chip and the hardware is to encrypt or
graphic operations it can leak a lot of
information for example because of
variations on power consumption in this
video I want to explain what power
analysis is as well as showing you how
to prepare an arduino nano board to
perform this attack
I'm sure you have heard about those
stories where illegal mariana farmers
are being busted because of unusual
electricity use it it's not typical for
any private home to suddenly use this
crazy amount of electricity that has set
up with thousands of heating lands and
air conditioning systems required so the
authorities are just abusing a power
analysis site channel to find potential
illegal mariana farms and that is
basically what this is about you can
imagine that a piece of hardware or to
be more precise a chip draws different
amounts of power depending on what
operations are being performed so let's
do an example recently I made a video
introducing RSA which I'd recommend you
to watch if you haven't yet but the
important part here is that if you sign
in a message
you basically encrypt the message with
your private key that somebody with your
public key can decrypt thus verifying it
came from you the owner of the private
key and encryption works by
exponentiation you take the message to
the power of the private key model of N
and as a developer you now have to
implement this mask luckily you have
heard about a simple algorithm to
perform this exponentiation we Square
and multiply method and this is how the
pseudocode looks like the important part
here is that you have a loop over each
bit of the exponent and for every bit of
the exponent you square the intermediate
value but if the bit is a 1 you do an
additional multiplication so if I just
give you a list of square and multiply
operations like this here square square
square multiply square multiply you can
recover the bits of the exponent that
lead to these operation that's the
secret key so 0 0 1 1 now you can
imagine that a multiply operation will
have a different power consumption
footprint than squaring here is how a
power trace can look like and you can
figure out the operations and that's the
bits square multiply square square
square multiplied ok theory is fine
but how the heck do you do this in
reality a processor can run really
really fast for example the other
internal runs with 16 megahertz also the
difference in power consumption must be
really really tiny so you need something
that can measure small variations very
very fast so digital oscilloscope seems
like an obvious choice Maya Rygel can
capture data with up to 70 megahertz so
that seems enough but there's one issue
if you didn't sleep in physics class you
may realize now wait doesn't
oscilloscope not measure our voltage and
we want to measure current the power
consumption that doesn't work well Ohm's
law to the rescue Ohm's law states that
the current through a conductor between
two points is directly proportional to
the voltage across the two points
against easier to understand with this
formula current is equal to voltage
divided by the resistance let's solve
this equation for voltage because the
oscilloscope can only measure voltage
then we get voltage is equal to the
current times resistance so when we have
a fixed resistor sitting somewhere in
our circuit and we measure the voltage
across it then we realize that the
voltage we measure is directly dependent
on the current this means when the
current changes so the device and the
test draws more or less current the
voltage will change it must change Ohm's
law tells us that science it works
bitches okay so using a resistor to
measure the voltage and that's
indirectly the current is called a shunt
resistor Ohm's law also tells us that
the bigger the resistor value the bigger
voltage difference we will measure but
we can't just use an arbitrary big
resistor because then the voltage drop
across the resistor will be too big and
it's not enough to power the chip
anymore but like 50 ohm or maybe even
100 ohm could still work with this
Arduino so now that we know how to
measure the current where do we place a
resistor an easy solution would be to
cut a you speak
Abel and insert a resistor into the
power line but it won't work first of
all we will measure everything that
draws power including the LEDs and the
other USB to UART chip on there that's
too much noise we want to be as close to
the chip as possible we want to insert a
resistor directly into the power line to
the chip so we are going to lift the
actual pin of the chip up so we can
insert the resistor in between the chip
and the PCB oh man I was so nervous
first time doing this and if I screw
this up the competition will be over for
me there is no replacement board I
looked up the datasheet to be a hundred
thousand percent sure I D solder the
correct pin I even checked with my
multimeter to make sure the pins really
match and I mark it with a marker I
placed it on a breadboard and use
double-sided tape to stick the
breadboard to the workbench so it
doesn't slide away then I take my
soldiering iron this is a very pointy
tip in another metal tool and try to
push up the pin with it like a lever the
heat should make the solder liquid and I
can bend it up that actually worked
better than I expected so now that the
pin is bent up I want to insert the
resistor this is really difficult to
solder a very awkward angle and it's
also tiny but with a bit of flux I
actually successfully solder it to the
pad and the pin the moment of truth does
the device still work plug it in the
green LED is on awesome then I realize
that connecting directly the measurement
equipment might not work so well because
the resistor has really stiff legs and
you could easily break off the pin or
pad if you handle it carelessly so I add
two flexible wires on each side perfect
this looks like a good setup
you measure the voltage in a relative
difference to each other so for example
you can place one end to G and D
basically zero volt and the other end
too after the resistor just for
reference I also place one before the
resistor theoretically we should see a
voltage drop across the resistor
depending on how much current you draw
so when you overlay the two measurements
you should see a slight difference so
that's my first attempt but when looking
at the oscilloscope measurement I see
just noise it would expect a lot more
difference I didn't expect to find the
crypto leaking part but at least some
variants in the consumption when it's
all just noise and the difference is so
small what's going on is my resistor too
small let's try a different measurement
setup like I said you measure the
voltage potential between two
measurement points so nobody is stopping
you from putting the ground part of the
probe before the resistor and the probe
itself afterwards this way you should
measure the voltage difference between
these two points you just have to be
very very very careful with ground loops
if you plan to connect something that
usually belongs to ground to something
that is not ground in this case
basically class-size world it can be
really really dangerous
if you plan to do this research ground
loops luckily I read about this before
so I knew what I had to do I had to make
sure the device and the test and the
measurement device don't share a common
ground if the Arduino is connected via
the laptop to the power strip as my
oscilloscope is connected to they share
the same ground line and when I then
connect your solo scope ground to +5
world I basically create a short circuit
plus 5 volt flows directly into ground
through the power strip boom something
will die hopefully not our expensive
equipment but what you can do is run
your laptop from battery now there is no
ground connection anymore so that's what
I did and then I can connect the one
single probe around
the resistor I also thought it would be
good to make a comparison measurement
with the real five fold just to see if
there are any differences might help to
validate if everything works so I attach
the second probe and what the
happen
what did I do I panicked so much that I
also accidentally broke off the resistor
and thus ripped off the pin and ped this
was probably game over for me
 what went wrong I was so careful
huh
after close inspection I realized that
despite careful and slow planning I
 soldered the wrong pin
I did not solder the resistor to the
power input I sold it to a ground pin so
when I connected the other probe to
actual +5 volt I created a short circuit
between the +5 volt in the ground
through the probes fog that's why I
measured so much noise and rubbish there
was no real signal there how stupid am I
well after the initial shock and
assessing the situation I figured out
that the chip has another gruntin so I
should be totally fine it just have to
replace the destroyed diode on the other
side and then solder a resistor to the
correct pin me but this time I
learned from my mistakes
i soldered female cable connectors to
the pin instead this way I'm able to
switch out and try different resistors
also to make sure not to rip off the
cables I put a drop of hot glue on it to
keep it in place and remove any tension
from the delicate pins unfortunately I
didn't have a proper SMD diode at hand
so I had to solder this Frankenstein to
it but that's fine it works
another tip if possible remove as many
capacitors as you can capacitors are
like small super fast batteries they
charge up hold the charge and release it
again if the voltage drops this is great
to smooth out a noisy power supply but
we actually want to measure these
differences so I disconnect the
capacitor by tombstoning it I also
experimented with disconnecting the
others it
make you bored a bit more unstable but
should improve measurements it turned
out later that it was probably not
necessary but at the time I had some
problems I will explain next episode
which I thought would solve the issue
but yeah this setup looks now much
better I can exchange the sisters and I
have the correct pin now so it should be
said to solve the first power analysis
side-channel challenge for the embedded
hardware CTS easily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
