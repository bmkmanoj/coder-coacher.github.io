about the ionic Wi-Fi cloud hop router
thing the previous video was more
lighthearted less about the security
issues and more like a sketch so I want
to use this video to focus a bit more on
the security issues
first of all when you simply unbox this
device and start using it it will create
an unpredicted Wi-Fi for anybody to
connect to and as you have seen in the
last video
anybody can then easily connect to it
and get code execution generally we want
product to be secure by default because
most people don't want to bother or
simply don't have the knowledge to
secure themselves thus this is a huge
issue regular home Wi-Fi routers at
least in Germany come with a long random
Wi-Fi password by default obviously it's
a good idea to change it anyway because
you trust the manufacturer and so forth
but first of all you are safe from just
a random person abusing your open Wi-Fi
for malicious activity and it's also not
a default key shared between all devices
and of course something like this costs
a lot of money during manufacturing
because each device has to be
personalised it's just an additional
step you don't want if you produce low
end consumer electronics but let's
explore a few more things last video we
have seen an admin interface that allows
executing system commands so it was
absolutely easy mode to get route on
this device but just for showing off
some other techniques
let me show another way how you can
execute system commands as you know
there's a web server running on port 80
which can execute programs via CGI and
this web server allows exes to browse
files on the USB stick as founded by
reviewing the web server convicts after
I already got root access but you could
figure this out by either unpacking the
foamer or checking out the android
application which has the URL where we
can find the USB stick content in there
and you probably know already where this
is going we can simply create a shell
script that can execute system commands
and put it onto a USB stick we can do
this by first specifying what
interpreter is used for this file in
this case it's a shell script and then
we read from standard input a string and
execute it and the result will be simply
printed to STD out CGI defines how
programs
interface with HTTP requests and the
post data which is basically the body of
an HTTP request is passed to a program
as standard input
thus we can simply send the command we
want to execute this post data and the
output of the program will be sent back
as an HTTP response we have set now on
the USB stick plug the USB stick into
the device and then simply access this
file from the URL which will cause it to
be executed now we just have to simply
send a command with the post request and
we get the result pick another basic
root shell if you remember from last
video
besides the admin there was also a root
user with a password that we didn't know
I try to use hash key to brute force II
hash in intercept password a but I had
not much luck my one graphics card is
not that good so I tweeted and asked if
anybody has better luck cracking the
hash and who would have thought a little
bit later dissector comes back with the
password his rake was way faster than
mine so thank you very much for helping
out this means we can use this password
now to log in via telnet and we don't
need the exploit from last video to
change the root password and every one
of these devices shares this root
password so no need for an expert just
log in as root with this password you
could cause the backdoor all being less
paranoid as simple developer debugging
credentials left on there carelessly
either way it's bad but let's take one
step further and look at the device as
if a user would have enabled encrypted
Wi-Fi because all these attacks require
you to have network access to the device
you could argue that these are all
trusted services locked behind the
secure Wi-Fi but being only connected to
this Wi-Fi is really annoying because
you don't have any internet connection
but the device can also act as an access
point the Wi-Fi list with the XSS issue
is actually intended to connect to
another web site if you do that there
are two ways you can use the device if
the device is connected to another Wi-Fi
and you connect to the Wi-Fi of the
device it's basically a router you can
get now access to the Internet through
it this means all traffic going through
it can be analyzed so it could be an
easy device to open an unencrypted Wi-Fi
that
confuse the internet through it and you
can then man in the middle of the
traffic the other way to use it when
it's connected to another Wi-Fi is to be
in that other Wi-Fi and now access the
device via its assigned IP and here's
the issue even if the device is Wi-Fi is
protected it doesn't matter because
anybody on the other side of the network
can still access it and it's badly
configured because it exposes all these
ports and services on that interface as
well this means when you use this device
in any untrusted Network or have an open
Wi-Fi it can be easily taken over
there's one last thing I want to show
all those weapons faces don't have a
CSRF cross-site request forgery
protection this means we could build a
website that when visited will send you
a request to execute a system command
basically what we have done with our
pipes and exploits in the last video to
do this we first start with an HTML file
that contains a form this form will
target the URL that is responsible to
execute system commands and we can set
the HTTP method to post and if you
remember the command is sent simply as
command so we add a hidden form element
for the post data I think it would be
fun - all right the index.html with a
string that we Hecht it our plan is to
use this form to submit a post request
to the admin back-end when a victim
opens the website we control and to do
this I create another HTML file that
will be the actual landing page and then
use an iframe to embed the attack HTML
side with the form and then we can use
some CSS to hide the iframe from the
victim so we can simply add a short
script to the attack HTML code which
will automatically submit the first form
on the side so it will trigger the post
request we can use a simple PHP debug
local web server to test this so now we
can access this website in a browser we
are low close on port 8080 now the site
loads it loads to hidden iframe the
hidden iframe will then auto submit the
form but we run into the issue that the
admin back-end requires a username and
password but that's not a problem
can simply add those credentials into
the URL now it should not bother us
again so if we reload the page now the
loaded hidden iframe will submit the
form which will issue a post request
with a command that should overwrite the
index page of the Wi-Fi hub router
didn't work
oops the main index HTML pages actually
in the control subdirectory so let's fix
that do it again and now instead of
showing the administration interface it
says the device got hacked nice changing
the admin password to protect against
this wouldn't help in this case because
remember the forum to change the admin
password is not password protected
either so we can do the technique we
just used cross-site request forgery to
change the admin password first and then
issue the code to execute the command
fancy-fancy I think in the next video we
are going to have a closer look at the
hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
