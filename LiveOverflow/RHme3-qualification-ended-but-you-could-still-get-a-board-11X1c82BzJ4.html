me3 has just ended this is an embedded
hardware CTF organized by riskier and
Argos and the reason that there was a
qualification round is because you need
a board to participate it's an embedded
hardware CTF so they posted also a
picture of the prototype of the board on
Twitter and this is what you will get
and so to decide who will receive such a
board for free to participate they had
to do this qualification round and there
were three challenges that you had to do
and I solve two of them and so you can
look in the scoreboard that there are
quite a few people that solved all three
challenges yeah there are really a lot I
only saw two so here a lot of the two
people and then there are bunch who only
solved one challenge but it was enough
to qualify because they will give out
500 boards but as you can see not quiet
500 people have qualified and so risk I
was thinking what to do with the
remaining boards and I was asking them
hey is there a possibility for me to
give some away and to kind of like make
you be able to qualify even though you
haven't solved one of these challenges
and that's why I make this video to
announce to you that you still have the
possibility to participate you only have
to basically do a thing so I still don't
know how many boards I will able to give
away but risk you like the idea and so
I'm just making this video very quick so
it's out there that you can get started
with whatever I want you to do and then
we will later see how many I will be
able to give to you and obviously it's a
bit difficult to figure out who will
receive a board even though you haven't
solved the qualification chandos because
these qualification challenges where
they are for a reason and so you didn't
solve it and so what what will I do that
allows you to receive a board
so I was thinking and my whole channel
is basically about I want to teach
people to learn something and to
motivate them to play CTS because I
believe it's a great place to learn new
skills
and I guess also some of you try to
participate here and try to solve one of
these qualification challenges they that
were not quite the easiest thing to do
and maybe you failed and that's kind of
frustrating I understand this but I want
to give you another chance and so here's
what I come up with so first of all I
want to say this will be a highly
subjective giveaway solving these
challenges was a way to do a very
objective evaluation of everybody and
give everybody a chance based on the
skill level so my selection will be
extremely biased extremely subjective
and that's just unavoidable with the way
I will do this now so what you have to
do is you have to send me an email and
basically explaining why it is a good
reason to give you a board what I really
would love to see is if you did attempt
a challenge here and you failed now you
start looking at the write-ups from
other people and work through them
understand them analyze where and why
you failed and then tell me the story
like why did you fail and what did you
miss and how would you do it differently
in the future for a similar challenge
try to analyze yourself that's something
I would find entirely fascinating also
having some hardware knowledge increased
expectation challenge for example and
the white box I guess - were software
things and maybe the traces is like a
hardware tech but as a hardware hobbyist
those are three things you have probably
never touched before but it's a good
chance that you will do fairly well with
some of the hardware challenges that
will come with the physical board so if
you are and hardware enthusiast
and the hobbyist and you have tools at
home tell me about your lab at home or
the projects you have done with hardware
show me that you would have equipment at
home that you can even participate
because with this board it's very likely
or would be good that you also have some
hardware at home that you can work with
I don't really want you to write a
full-blown job application basically
that's nonsense it doesn't really help
me and you also don't learn anything you
waste your time that's why I would like
you to whatever you write me show me
something that you
learned that's why I would really like
you to work through the failed
challenges or the chances you haven't
looked at it at all and like just tell
me your experience walk take a write up
walk through it and maybe re explain it
with your own words show me your own
implementation of it show me your own
tutorial make a new write-up about it or
whatever just so you show me that you
have learned something and a good thing
about this is that even if I don't pick
you and you don't get a board that the
time you have invested into this
application wasn't wasted because you
walk still away with having had a
motivation to look at these at the
write-ups and work through them and you
have learned something so if you send me
an email and I can clearly see oh this
person learned something here that is a
good chance that I would potentially
pick you if you can also tell me if you
have some hardware equipment at home or
at least some experience with like
Arduinos or maybe even with soldering
and maybe even designing your own little
board or making some LEDs blink because
if you have no knowledge about how
electronics or microcontrollers work
this is probably the wrong CTF for you I
know these rules are and what I want is
kind of fuzzy I can't really put them in
words because in the end it's a highly
subjective thing all I wanted is to give
some boards away because I've chatted
with many people during the CTF that
really tried hard to solve them and
spend days and couldn't do it in the end
and I would like for you because you
learned a lot to get a board so this way
I can hopefully in the people who will
then write me by email find some people
that hopefully deserve to to still
qualify and again I don't know how many
boards I will get I don't know how many
people will write me and so I feel
already very bad for the people who
invest time into writing me and don't
get a board in the end but at least I
hope that so keep that in mind that
whatever you should write me it should
benefit you even if you don't get the
board because you sit down and you learn
something that you haven't learned
before I hope that makes some sense and
you will trust my judgment for the
boards and then we will see and I hope
see you then once the CTF is actually
running find all the details in the
description as well as my email address
and please use the keyword freedos
flavor twist in the email so I can
filter out already the low effort
whining emails also this is my favorite
snack so if you ever come from the US
and you want to bring me something nice
that's what you can bring me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
