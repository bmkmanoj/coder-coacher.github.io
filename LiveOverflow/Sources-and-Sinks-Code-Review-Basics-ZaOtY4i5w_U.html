concept for security code reviews or
finding vulnerabilities in general those
terms are also often used in the field
of taint analysis and that's basically
what we will talk about I think it's one
of these things that are super obvious
and many of you have already developed
this intuitively without having a name
for it at least that was true for me but
also once I learned about the concept
this intuition transformed into an
actual technique for me so I figured
there must be others that might be at
the similar point and it could help
sources and sinks what does that mean
sources are where data is coming from
attacker or untrustworthy sources of
data and things are places where
untrustworthy data could do something
bad let's do a very simple example we
have maybe seen my video let's play a
game
where's the deadly back here where we
look at a very short PHP program and I
explained to you my thought process and
finding the security issue so I think
it's a very good example of this concept
being applied
I didn't explicitly use the terms
sources and sings in the video but that
is essentially what I did so let's
quickly identify the sources here
sources are where data is coming from
and in this case there are three post
request variables these are fully user
controlled but data is also coming from
the secret environment variable so in
terms of security we have to think now
is that particular source relevant to us
and in the video I was contemplating
about that but determined an attacker
has probably no control over it
so I excluded it from my mental list of
attacker controlled inputs the sink in
this case is pretty obvious it's this
dangerous exit function and now we have
to figure out how or if sources are
connected to the sinks if we find the
connection between attacker controlled
input the sources too dangerous
functions the sink then we probably have
a security issue make sense right to
figure out if this is the case it can be
super easy but in this example it was
not straightforward I mean the post
variable so one of the sources is
directly passed to the X action and
that's bad right but it's not that
simple because before it we have a lot
of conditions that try to protect exit
in this case the idea was to use HTML to
authenticate the command path to exit
which means only the admin who knows the
secret could do it and the admin could
also just log into the so with as its H
and execute any command anyway right so
it's not inherently a security issue we
have to prove now that an untrusted
person and in this case this means
somebody who doesn't know the secret
could pass malicious code to exit and
how we figure that out you either know
already or I recommend you to watch that
video anyway there are a few methods how
you can
with sources and sinks for example when
you want to review some code you could
start by looking for all the dangerous
functions let's stay with a PHP example
you could then look for every function
considered dangerous
there's this really nice to go a flow
question that collects many of them so
there are a lot of dangerous functions
that are obvious such as exec and system
and eval but the issue is not every
function is clearly dangerous for
example there is really obscure stuff
like the old PHP preg replace function
which is used to perform a regular
expression search and replace but it has
this /e modifier which can lead to a PHP
code execution through one of the
parameters another example is that the
developer could create or construct a
dangerous set up themselves for example
a function that creates a file and
stores user data in it but the file is
also accessible from a PHP web server
and so if a user enters PHP code into
that file it could be executed by
visiting that file so you see it's not
that easy to find all the things in a
program but the concept is clear you try
to find places that could be dangerous
if user controlled input gets there the
other side the sources are also not that
easy I mean it's pretty obvious that get
and post parameters are user controlled
but some inputs are not clear for
example my Wi-Fi name is a simple XSS
test in one video where devices was
listing my Wi-Fi so it caused an XSS the
developer did not anticipate that the
Wi-Fi name could be malicious input and
especially with frameworks that abstract
away a lot of stuff it sometimes is
really not clear what exactly is user
controlled which means it's like this
thing it's not something you can always
just search for but the concept is clear
we want to find all the sources of
untrustworthy data and then we try to
put sources and things together you can
either do it forwards backwards or a
combination of both forwards means you
take one of your sources you just follow
where this data is going essentially you
try to taint analysis by hand ok this
input is then split that a comma the
first element is passed to this function
the second element is passed to this
function and then you continue look at
both functions along the way you
remember all the transformations of the
in
or sanity stations like a certain
characters are removed or what kind of
checks exist and you hope it eventually
leads to a dangerous sink the backwards
path means you take a dangerous sink and
try to follow the path back up where is
this data coming from what kind of
checks have to be true in order to lead
down here and you try to figure out if
it leads to a source of untrusted data
and which method to use totally depends
on the target for example if you have
code with a lot of command executions or
SQL queries then looking backwards from
all the sinks could be too much and what
easier to just follow the five inputs
but maybe it's easy to find all the
dangerous sinks but just the input is
not very clear so you try to track back
so deciding what to do is very much just
a bit of experience and a lot of gut
feeling so the concept of sources and
things is very easy and I think this
methodology when talking about
vulnerabilities is very useful so next
time you have to find a vulnerability in
some code for a class assignment or a
CTF try to use a method like this here
one other thing I want to mention is
that it appears to me that the concept
of sources and sinks is used a lot more
in the client-side web security
community than in other areas especially
in the area of Dominic success so you
have like classic exists as well the
server code places untrusted data into
the generated HTML sent to the browser
but in Dominic sucess it's not like that
some untrusted input is passed to some
JavaScript function and that leads to
J's code execution for example if an
attacker can control the content pass
through the JavaScript function inner
HTML which will write HTML then of
course you can write a script tag as
well which is executed and because there
are so many JavaScript frameworks being
used with weird stuff it's a typical
thing for researchers to share syncs
with each other so you find a lot of
lists of sources and things for various
frameworks I like this kind of sharing
would love to see it being more adapted
to other languages as well documenting
dangerous functions especially when they
are more obscure is a really helpful
thing so if you are developer and you
work with some kind of framework in any
language and you come across some
functions that do something really fishy
be easily misused or are more powerful
than people think
documented tweet about it with hashtag
sink and the hashtag the name of the
framework or write a blog or something
this is just basic everyday research
that can be really really helpful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
