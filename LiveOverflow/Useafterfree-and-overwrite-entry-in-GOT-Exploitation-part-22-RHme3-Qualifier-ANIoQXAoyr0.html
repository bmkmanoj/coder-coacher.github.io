So last video we started to reverse the exploitation
qualification challenge from RHme3 and we
had just figured out a rough plan for exploitation.
So rewatch this if you don’t know what’s
going on.
But we also pickup here just where we are
about to develop the exploit.
And while this is about a specific challenge,
the technique to get to the final shell, is
very similar for a lot of CTF challenges.
So even if you are not doing this challenge,
it could still show you some generic techniques.
Remember in the last video that at the start
I was already thinking of what probably our
goal is going to be?
So in the spirit of doing this whole challenge
from the reverse.
Let’s think about which Global Offset entry
we could overwrite.
Ideally I would love to overwrite a function
there with system(), which has a string for
the command to execute as first parameter.
So we are looking for another function that
has a similar pattern.
Some people contacted me and had issues once
they got so far to have an arbitrary write
and could overwrite an entry of the GOT, what
to do now?
They tried to use ROP gadgets and so forth,
but most of the time, at least for the eaiser
exploitation challenge, it’s mostly enough
to somehow execute /bin/sh to get a shell.
In a previous stream I did I showed how to
find a one-shot execve gadget that just calls
/bin/sh, so check that out, but another technique
is to just look for a fitting function.
So system() takes a string as the first parameter
as a command to execute.
So what would happen if you overwrite puts()
with system()?
Well then everytime the program would call
puts(), it would actually try to execute the
string as a system command.
Makes sense, right?
But it’s not really useful, so in our case
we are looking for functions that might have
a user controlled string as the first parameter.
Let’s see.
Strcpy could work in some cases.
Or strlen, or puts.
But also free could get passed a pointer that
coincidentally points to a string.
For example if the name is freed, and the
parameter would be a pointer to that name
string.
So there are a lot of options, and of course
it could break the program, so you have to
be a bit smart.
But I chose strlen in the end, as it’s getting
called on a string that is read by the user.
Infact it’s reading the name input here.
So that’s great.
So to recap.
We want to overwrite strlen with system, so
we can execute /bin/sh when we enter /bin/sh
as a name.
To do that we need an arbitrary write, and
the name pointer in the player structure could
do that for us, if we control it.
We also know we have a use after free, which
means we interpret a value on the heap as
a pointer, eventhough the player should be
freed.
So hopefully we find a way to overwrite that
freed memory with data we control, and thus
control the name pointer.
Sounds like we are almost there!
We just have to find a sequence of operations,
where we get control of this pointer.
In general this should happen when we create
some players, select one, remove some and
add some again.
So I just sat there for a bit and just played
around with different name lengths to somehow
make one name overlap with the pointer.
But it kinda didn’t work right away.
I think that’s because the modern heap uses
different kind of chunks, namely fastbins
and so forth.
And they are maintained differently.
So in many cases the malloc of a new chunk
would skip the freed space.
But I’m not 100% sure what exactly happened.
I just suspected that must influence it.
But if somebody could link me a writeup that
has a better understanding of the heap and
goes into that issue, I would love that.
Anyway, I guessed that this should still be
the solution, so I just have to find the correct
case where the overlap would happen.
And at some point I did!
So it happened when I register 2 players with
32 byte long names.
Selected the second one.
Deleted the 2nd and first one, then allocate
a new player, with 19 bytes.
And when we then show the selected player,
we get a segfault!
I got the 19 bytes from playing around with
the lengths and it perfectly overwrites the
name pointer.
You can see the segfault happened in printf,
probably because the pointer was pointing
into invalid memory.
Which would be a success.
But also you can see our debug prints before
the segfault and you can compare the state
of the memory where the player was selected
and still healthy, and the overwritten object
we now used.
So you see the name of the third player we
created smashed the stats and the name pointer.
From here on now it’s easy to write the
exploit.
We just have to do one minor thing, and that
is defeat ASLR of libc.
Because even if the binary is not using ASLR,
other system libraries on an ASLR enabled
system will have randomized addresses.
But that’s easy with the name pointer we
control, because we can not only use it to
write data, but also read memory when we show
the player and try to print the name.
So we can read a libc function address from
the global offset table and then calculate
offsets from there.
In our case I would like strlen, so we can
take the GOT address of strlen and use that
in the name we use to overwrite the name pointer.
But let’s just start developing the exploit.
I’m writing it in python.
So first I setup a socket to connect to the
port 1337.
I also implemented a recv_all function that
reads data until no data is read in a certain
timeframe.
So until there is a timeout.
Then we can simply send the inputs, that correspond
to the menu selections that trigger the bug.
So here.
add player.
Name. stats.
Select player.
Delete the two.
And then create a third player and include
the address we want to set the name pointer
to.
In our case the address of the global offset
strlen entry.
And then we send a 5, which does show_player,
thus printing wherever the name pointer points
to.
And then we do some stuff to extract those
raw bytes, because it should point into the
global offset table and print the address
of strlen.
After that we use the cool telnetlib trick,
that just simply hands over the socket to
us, so we can send and receive data.
And when we run it doesn’t crash and outputs
the strlen address.
We can also now press 5 again to see how the
player looks like.
And these weird bytes here are the address
of strlen.
And so we extract those.
Now we want to calculate the base address
of libc.
The address where the libc binary is loaded
to.
To do that we can simply open the provided
libc, or your local libc, depending on if
you develop the exploit locally or for the
remote server.
And then you look for strlen and copy the
address.
It’s different for not ASLR binaries that
have their loading address specified, but
in this case the addresses start at 0, so
this is the offset inside the binary where
this function starts.
So when we now take the absolute address that
we leaked from the server and subtract the
offset, we get the address where libc starts.
And then we look up the address or offset
for system, and when we add this offset to
the libc base, we get the absolute address
of system on the server.
We can run it, and there it is.
That’s the address of system on the server.
And then we can use the edit player, edit
name function, which will then change the
name, but the name is pointing into the global
offset table of strlen, so we will overwrite
that address.
Some of you might have thought that wouldn’t
work because you noticed a realloc on the
name, but in fact that realloc only happens
if the string you entered is longer than the
string already stored.
And the address of system is not longer than
the address of strlen, so we bypass the realloc
and just write to it.
And now next time we change the name, we can
enter for example /bin/sh, and then it will
call strlen on this input, but strlen was
overwritten with system in the previous name
change, and thus executes bin/sh.
And we drop into a shell.
So now we can simply find the flag file and
read the secret.
There we go.
Done.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
