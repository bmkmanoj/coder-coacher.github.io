cookbook challenge from the Boston Tea
Party CTF 2016 I actually solve this
challenge during the CTF this time so
it's not a video right up based on
write-up from other people and I've
tweeted about it because I spend plane
Falls or so on this challenge which was
a little bit over my skill but I learned
a lot along the way and so I'm gonna
show you now how I did it the cookbook
challenge gave six points which was one
point more than the other point of all
that were released at the same time and
it says that the top chef wrote this
cookbook for me but I think it has an
Excel secret recipe and it was provided
a target set and the server and port for
this running service which you could
connect to during the CTF and interact
with the service to exploit and gain
remote code execution when we unpack the
target set we find the cookbook binary
which is a 32-bit Linux binary so that
is pretty cool because then I can
actually use my ID license which only
has 32-bit and we get a Lipsy which is
an indication that the binary uses a SLR
or at least the system has a SLR enabled
because we then need this when we leak
addresses of Lipsy to calculate offsets
of different functions and stuff like
that so that is a good indication on
what we will face I use vagrant as a
VirtualBox wrapper so I now connect to
my Linux machine to my Linux VM running
in VirtualBox and I copy the target set
into the shared folder so I can access
the files in my Linux system so this is
at the moment the Linux VM running I
connected to it with SSH so unpacking it
and ready to go so let's have a first
look at it with when we execute it it
asks for our name and has this cool s
key cook and then there's this menu
where you can type in certain letters to
navigate the menu and you can list
ingredients and look at recipes you can
as you can see you can add ingredients
you can create a new recipe you can
discard the recipe you're working on
right now you can see that you can print
it and so forth or there so fairly
complex menu where you can in interact
with it you can you know for example I
just added an ingredient to a recipe and
a hex 41 of that ingredient so I add
another ingredient like water a hex 40
of it and then I can list the
ingredients that are in this current
recipe so that's the functionality
basically of this program just to get a
feeling for it and not to overlook
something just play around with it a
little bit and so you get a mental
picture of the functionality of the
program there's also a functionality to
name your cookbook where you have to
specify the length of how long the name
of the cookbook should be and then you
can enter the name for it and here I
show you something an error that will
occur which you might find while just
playing around with it but maybe you
don't which you could also easily fast
if you're just random stuff against it
so now we remove the cookbook name and
if you remove it again just trigger our
again we get this error a double free or
corruption on top which is indicating
that there is an you know a double free
with the heap it's basically very clear
so this is something you could find
during initial investigation I
personally didn't I looked at the I
started reverse engineering it in Ida
and then realize those issues but it's
clearly something you could find also
with just throwing randomly the menu
items against interests fuzz it so now
I've loaded the binary Ida and I start
reverse engineering it so but where to
start so the first thing I do is I look
at these strings embedded in the binary
because we know there's a like this
string menu and if we look at what the
start of the program basically is we can
figure out and start tracing the
execution in Ida from the start so the
first string when we execute the
cookbook is what's your name so this is
also what we want to look for an Ida
but what I also do is I start taking
notes of the functionality and certain
stuff of the behavior which is important
because it's a fairly complex menu with
many with a lot of functionality and so
you want to know which you know which
menu item is responsible for a certain
behavior so I write down now that the
first thing that we get is what's your
name and then after that we get access
to the to the menu and then let's
explore the menu so I'll just list the
ingredients our printed receipt book but
edie ingredient provides us another
submenu for adding a new ingredient so
I'm just taking notes of this fact that
when you get add ingredient we enter a
different menu so I'm cycling through
the other things and if we get type C we
create a recipe which is another submenu
so we also just take notes of that oh
yeah and otherwise you know there are
some more functionality but it's not
really a sub menu so for now I just you
know leave it at that
now let's find this string in Ida what's
your name there it is so then we can
look for the cross references what is
referencing the string and we find this
one function here which seems to to
print this this question and then you
can also see it does it allocates 40 hex
bytes and then afterwards it doesn't f
get so it's reading the reading your
name into the allocated 40 hex big area
and this function is called from this
other function here which looks like
maybe the main function because there's
an indication that they use alarm which
is very typical for CTF challenges
because they will create an alarm which
is basically the second a timeout they
wait for in case the binary hangs they
can kill it which is typical for CTF
chances that they don't have many a lot
of hanging processes so we can also look
at the next function and that is called
afterwards which looks like printing
some ASCII stuff and in fact it's
printing this cup here as you can see
here so this is definitely the function
that will print the cook what is the
next function in this list so this
function says calls to different
functions let's have a look at the first
one there seems to be some names like
onion and water that looks like the
initial ingredients that are already in
the binary
the menu or that are already available
if you list them so this is probably
initializing the ingredients for this
binary you know those are just names you
come up with now maybe later you realize
the functions doing something else but
for now this is what I think it's doing
and then it calls for each of these
ingredients in calling another function
so this might be a function that adds an
ingredient to something you know I
already reverse engineer so I know that
there is a list of ingredients obviously
where I can kind of like an array but
sort of real area it has its own
structure so I know that it has to do
with adding this ingredient to the list
but yeah the next function after we we
initialize those ingredients is looks a
bit more convoluted up a bit more it
looks different but it also has those
strings in there and if you look at
those strings closely and if you think
about what else was already initialized
at the start which is what's those those
basic receipts that were already in the
binary so this is probably just
initializing the recipes available at
the start of the program so that is in
it the recipe and this all is then just
initializing the cookbook okay what's
the next function ah that it looks
familiar that seems to be the main menu
with all our options available and
there's this huge jump table where
depending on the input we will execute
different things so we can just start
going through them one by one and start
understanding what they are doing after
you read F gets a value this is one of
the options you can choose so it looks
like a loop it's looping from the bottom
to the top again so it seems like site
cycling over something you can also see
the dashes and you might be able already
to guess what it is but maybe we don't
know for sure so what I'm doing now is
the next step of as kind of also
dynamically analyzing this I take the
address of this function and I set a
breakpoint and I just run this program
and then I just hope I find the menu
item that
triggers this breakpoint playing around
with it a little bit and there we hit
the breakpoint so this is obviously the
last action I did was I was listing the
the ingredients available so that lists
the ingredients and this ingredient list
has to start from somewhere and there is
this global variable in the data segment
and this is a special segment because
even though we use a SLR this is like a
global variable and will have a fixed
value which is loaded from this address
here so it loads the first one whatever
is there and moves it into a local
variable and we can see that it's then
doing stuff on it and again I looked at
it more closely but this is something
you would figure out when you step
through it that it's cycling in a
certain way over the this starting from
the first pointer you have there and you
can now name this global variable the
ingredient list so let's get to the next
function so there's a string the
percentage s cookbook and if you print R
we know that this is the current receipt
book that we can print so we can name
this function now and then proceed to
the next one the next one seems to start
another menu and if you look at the
strings this seems to be the add
ingredient submenu as you can see in
this function it will print the options
in the menu and then again there's this
huge jump table you can see this very
nicely on the graph overview on the left
and Ida that you have all those
different options and it looks a little
bit more complex than the main menu but
anyway it's just it's very similar so
let's move to the next function the next
function again seems to specify a new
menu and we know that this must be then
the add recipe menu the next function it
says how long is here is the name of
your cookbook so that seems to be the
functionality to give your cookbook a
name because that is asking for the
length of the name
and we can move on to the next function
so this one just seems to take another
global pointer from the data segment and
then free it so there seems to be a menu
item that just takes it and then freeze
something so let's make a breakpoint
here again in Ida and see which which
menu action triggers this breakpoint can
try a few things and eventually if we
press R so remove the name of the
cookbook it will trigger the breakpoint
so this is the remove cookbook name then
this global pointer here must be the
cookbook name and if you closely there
it doesn't set this cookbook name now to
zero and that is why we get this double
free arrow if we press capital R two
times because it tries to free the same
memory again without having any checks
in place and if we look at the gift
cookbook name now we can see that
there's a call to malloc with the size
that we previously entered with F gets
and then the mail logged the point of
return by Mello which is the area where
the cookbook name will be will be stored
in this global variable cookbook name
then let's move on with the next
function so here you can see the goodbye
thanks for cooking with us so that seems
to be quitting the quit message and then
here is the which ingredient to
exterminate so this seems to be the
location that will jump to when we want
to remove an ingredient and it and when
we want to remove an ingredient it seems
to call this other function here we look
into it it looks fairly complex and
doing seems to do a lot of stuff so for
now I put this aside and I don't want to
reverse engineer that one but we can
guess that this might be the function
because there's a free afterwards it
might try to find the ingredient that
you want to exterminate and remove and
free it so maybe that is what it's doing
so let's note this down now that we are
done with the main menu we can move into
one of these sub menus
the first entry of this submenu seems to
me log something so let's set a
breakpoint at this address and see which
actually menu item it is first I thought
I was in the ED ingredient submenu and I
was confused that nothing of it will
trigger it so I looked again around to
verify in which submenu I'm currently in
so I got a quit out of the ED ingredient
menu and get into the crate recipe menu
from there I can type N for a new recipe
which will trigger the breakpoint so
apparently this may log here will
allocate a new recipe on the heap and we
can see that it CL ox or melis or
whatever sex for 0c bites on the heap so
we can take notes of this now that this
particular menu item will may log this
size on the heap and the result of the
CL OGG will be stored at another global
variable which in this case must be the
current recipe we are editing we are
creating a new recipe it's allocating it
and then storing that address in a
global variable and the next menu item
which seems to free that area we can
verify this by you know D which seems to
discard a recipe and triggering in two
times when again will create a double
free error on the heap because we are
try to free the same location twice
because it doesn't get set back to zero
so we know that the discard recipe menu
item will free the global variable
current recipe which was earlier set
from the malloc and we can now fill in
also the other stuff that I kind of
forgot in the beginning when we give you
a cup of a name we can specify a length
x and then it will allocate the or Malak
the cookbook name with this size and
remove cookbook name will free this
global pointer again which is again a
double free because it does not reset
the cookbook name we can look around a
little bit more and the next block seems
to be the add ingredient functionality
and recipe but you know it is maybe not
that important right now and maybe we
move on to the add ingredient submenu
the add ingredient submenu again is a
very similar yet demon printed menu and
then the big jump table so the first
entry also moves a global variable in
the X in checks if it's null or not and
then either will do something with it
call something or print now and this
globe variable is again used quite often
so we can already make this assumption
that this is probably current ingredient
we are editing because the first item in
the menu is also list ingredient so or
print a list current stats basically
printing the current ingredient so
probably the first function here if we
also look at the strings in it with name
calorie and price is exactly what this
menu item does so this will print the
current ingredient and based on the
current ingredient pointer global
pointer data set and so this must be the
the new ingredient functionality because
it does smell log and the result of
malloc will be moved into this global
address and we move a little bit further
we can also find a free which is taking
this global pointer again and then is
freeing it but this free is much more
interesting because suc this submenu
generally checks if current ingredient
is zero or not and then printing can't
do it with no and the free will also the
up or after the free it will set the
global pointer to zero and thus
preventing us from double freeing it
then there are more menus you know you
can look just at the strings they that
are using it and if you are unsure which
part is which menu item you can always
set a break point and then just check
out the recipe and see which
functionality it might be and give the
name to the ingredient with G will
trigger the break point and you can also
see in the information where we broke
where the breaker was hit that there is
an air lock so this seems to allocate
the buffer for the name for a particular
and then that one is stored in a local
variable for now the the location of the
string or the the allocated area and if
there is a current ingredient be edited
then we will eat then we will do an F
gets and read it into the local the
address of the local variable so it will
read into the stack at this allocated
area and then it will move the this then
it will mem copy this string that was
read in to the location of the current
edited ingredient but not add directly
start it will add ex8 on it so it will
move the current ingredient address
eight bytes ahead and then mmm copy the
string that was read at this location
maybe we can also have a look at this in
gdb now because we know that this is a
global variable which will always have
the same address so we can just look at
it what kind of value it will have so we
already have created a new ingredient so
there should be actually a value stored
so this seems to be an address where the
current ingredient is and we can print
this and yeah it looks nala doesn't seem
to be much there but as you remember we
just started to write a name to it so if
we continue and type something in that
will be the name of the ingredient and
when we look at it now we can see that
at offset plus 8 so that is plus zero
next one is plus four and that is plus
eight at this location we will store the
string that was read and remember that
reading the string came from we first
read into a newly allocated buffer
that's why the name is there doubled if
we take a look again at the giving and
the name function we see that after we
the mem copy we copied it we will free
the area that was previously allocated
and this one FCC one is the so-called
wilderness that is the last value on the
heap which indicates how much free space
is there on the heap so everything that
comes after that value right now is
freed heap and free doesn't set
magically the memory to zero so
obviously we you can still
find the strings that were previously
stored at this area but it's not used by
the application anymore
so let's look around and maybe you know
start working through the other stuff
I'm looking for one particular function
I want to have a look at and again if
you look at this and you don't know what
it is you can take the address and
create a breakpoint in gdb for it and
see which menu function will trigger it
if you set a price for your curry
ingredients it will not trigger it but
if we set some calories with s then we
will trigger it and we can have a look
at it first l arcades on your area and
we know that this is not a set of
calories and then it checks if the
current ingredient is zero or not so if
we have currently ingredient and if we
have one it will call a to I on the
string that we read which will convert
it to an integer and then the result is
coming from EAX that it's a return value
stored in this local variable of our 20
which we can now rename to the calories
integer that we have read from
standardin and then it also takes the
current ingredient address EAX and then
it stores at the location of this
ingredient it will store the calories so
remember the string was started offset
+8 but the S the the calories for an
ingredient seems to be stored at F set
offset zero and we can verify this by
just specifying a number and have a look
at it so I will now give this current
ingredient the calorie count of 1 and I
will give it the price of 2 and then we
should if we look at the ingredient in
memory we should see exactly 1 and 2 in
the first thing also note that the
string is gone in a second because I
accidentally screwed some stuff up this
is a new ingredient that I added which I
didn't specify a name at this at this
point but as you can see the calorie
count is stored at exactly the address
of the current ingredient the price is
stored at
the offset plus for the second value and
after that at plus eight you will have
the string the name of the ingredient
and we can take notes of this again in
our notepad so the price ingredient will
write at the offs at the current
ingredient plus and it's actually wrong
it should have been plus four it will
write the integer that we can read and
say calories at four so I actually mix
this up but you get the idea so
basically this is how the reverse
engineering works and what I did and
obviously I did a lot more because I
spent a lot of hours as you know on it
so you just work through the idea and
understand function by function maybe
you start to get the ideas obviously
that you can free memory and still write
to it and still free it again and stuff
like that you know that there must be
bugs that you could abuse so what I'm
doing now is I give a a show my of my
exploit and then we will see in part two
of this video a walk through of my
actual exploit in the end and now you so
cut now to simulate the server's it will
open a TCP port on port 66 6 and when I
connect to it it will execute the
cookbook and I can interact with it like
it was with the life challenge now I
will open my exploit because I have to
do a slight modification with the server
and port and then we can also use net
get ourselves to see if it's working so
netcat connecting to one to seven to
localhost I'm currently on the Linux
machine also that's why it's localhost
and then it's presented us with the name
and the menu so this is how we can
interact with the with with the binary
and it's like the service like the CTF
challenge was when it was live and you
can see now if we trigger the double
free we can also see the arrow on the
silk head server side but the service
you'll are looking at is just you know
dying now let me show you my exploit
first and then in the next part we will
have a look at it more closely so there
are multiple steps to this exploit as
you can see and I passed it every time
have to press ENTER to continue and it
looks very complicated but we will have
a look at it and in the end you are
presented with a shell where you can
execute shell commands and it works
nicely you can see that my exploit looks
very complicated seem to be a lot of
steps in wealth and I have seen
write-ups already or proof concept codes
from other people on IRC that were
simpler than what I did but I'm proud of
it myself I did it myself and I'm very
proud of it and in the next video we
will step through the exploit and look
at it what is actually happening here is
also the output of the alive server when
I got the flag and you can see here the
user is running with and here the flick
itself hey my girl doesn't work here and
if you remember my Twitter message from
the beginning what it did was I had this
sha-1 hash in there which was generated
by concatenating life overflow - with
the flag so just basically as a proof
that I got the flag and solve the
challenge before the end and this time I
did not just work through writers from
other people I solved it myself which
makes very happy so when you debug the
binary in gdb and gdb will basically
disable a SLR for the spanner binary and
all the addresses will be static and in
the end to your exploit has to work with
the ADSL are on the system enabled
anyway and also write your exploit to
interact with the remote service so what
I do is I show you now how I can deal
with it so I sought the exploit and it's
now waiting at a certain address and
basically now I can use can look in the
processes and see that cookbook is
running and Ike it can get the process
ID from it and then I can use gdb to
attach to this process ID so gdb - - PID
equals to and then the PID off cookbook
and then I can attach to this process
and then I can start setting breakpoints
investigate the memory with the exploit
running and this is basically how I
developed and my exploit I always
written a little part interacting with
the process set breakpoints investigate
memory and
and so forth see you in part two to
analyze my exploit the best step
