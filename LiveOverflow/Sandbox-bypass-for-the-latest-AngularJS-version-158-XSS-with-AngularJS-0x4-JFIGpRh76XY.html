version 1.4 7 but very quickly a new
bypass was found the old bypass which
overrode the char ed prototype function
to screw with angularjs internals got
fixed but the fix was incomplete very
quickly a new bypass was found that was
initially kept private eventually
somebody else discovered the bypass 2
and reported it publicly on github so
let's try to find the bypass for the
incomplete fix ourselves let's start by
testing the old bypass no alert and when
we look into the console we can see the
error assigned to a constructor is
disallowed what does that mean let's
have a look at what ensure safe assign
context is doing so this is a function
that takes an object as a parameter and
performs a couple of checks on it it
basically checks if the object passed to
it is some kind of constructor as we
have seen with the first bypass
constructors are dangerous in that video
we use the function constructor to
escape the sent box and in the last
escape we access the prototype of chart
via the string constructor to screw with
angularjs internals so it makes sense
that these sandbox tries to prevent you
to assign something to the constructor
well the name assigned context indicates
that this is a check used in assignments
I set a breakpoint with the debugger
keyword here so let's see what kind of
objects are passed to this function
so the first object path to it is the
string a the second object path to it is
the string constructor which will
obviously then throw the exception now
let's check where this is called from in
the call stick it's coming from F N and
F n is again this dynamically generated
JavaScript code representing our
expression we can take this generated
code here and compare to the generated
code from 1.4.7
and you can see that the fix is not
super big it only added two function
calls to ensure safeassign context
anyhow let's try to understand what
assigned context means in what cases as
angularjs check an object with this
function we can do this by using simple
expressions so for example one plus one
doesn't trigger the breakpoint sono
check here that's not surprising we
would expect some kind of assignment
anyway right so let's do an assignment a
equals two one okay this triggers the
breakpoint and the object passed to it
is the scope object remember from the
first video that any variable you use is
evaluated against the scope so the kind
of makes sense let's look at the
function angular generated so we zero
variable zero is the one that we want to
assign the tool variable to up here is s
our scope so it also makes sense so now
it here checks if V two is a safe object
for assignments and yeah the scope is
safe object we assign to it all the time
after that you see the assignment
happening with v2 dot a so a on the
scope gets assigned the number one as
you can see it always only checks the
left side of an assignment so the object
to the right is never checked this means
we can still do stuff with the
constructor it just can't be on the left
side so we can assign it to a variable
on the scope just fine but is that
enough now that a is the string
constructor let's see if we can assign
something to the prototype of a first
check is the first assignment
which is fine but the second check will
fail because a is the constructor hmm
playing around like this is enough to
find the bypass for the incomplete fix
so go ahead pause the video and try it
yourself head over to the testbed at
live overflow comm slash angularjs you
can do it in case you didn't get it or
you just want me to tell you well here
we go so we can use those evil objects
on the right side of an assignment so we
can assign them to anything we want but
they can't be on the left side but the
only evil object that can't be on the
left side is the constructor so what we
could do is we could assign the
prototype to a instead and then we use a
torch our head in the next step
theoretically this should work because a
contains now a prototype and not the
constructor which means ensure
safeassign context will not find a
constructor and be happy so let's try it
first assignment is on the scope so that
is safe and the second check is on this
weird object here but that's just the
prototype and when we let the code
continue we pop an alert that was super
easy let's compare our bypass with what
iron found on github his exploit is a
little bit over complicated but in
essence it's the same he assigns the
prototype to a property Y of X and then
accesses char add via the property same
thing we just used a simple variable
also this bypass still works in the
latest version 1.58 but angularjs has
announced that they will remove the
angularjs end box in 1.6 this means that
we don't need any fancy sandbox bypasses
anymore and exploitation will become
trivial it sounds counterintuitive but I
think that's a good thing but let's
discuss this in another video now let
you understand angularjs sandbox
bypasses I highly recommend you to watch
the talk an abusive relationship with
angularjs by Mario Heydrich
he gives a great overview over the
history of angularjs sandbox bypasses I
just finished editing the video and I
realized I forgot to give my disclaim
and the proper credits like I did in the
previous videos so here it comes a bit
late I did not discover those bypasses
myself great researchers like
monohydrate iron Heke Gareth Hays and
many more are the true brains here I
merely tried to explain their hard work
in a video so look them up and follow
them on Twitter
