controversial so I wouldn't mind a civil
discussion about this afterwards in the
comments on reddit and if you watch this
video far in the future please don't
blindly assume that I still hold the
same beliefs because I will obviously
adjust my worldview is based on new
information scientific method and stuff
but in this moment I believe this is
generally an issue that we have to deal
with and figure out where we as hackers
security researchers the InfoSec
community at large stand so let me make
my argument
before I go into a very specific example
that motivated me to make this video I
would like to approach this topic from a
fundamental level this is about mobile
security on mobile app security in
particular so what makes a mobile app
secure or insecure generally the apps
that concern us are more than just
applications on our phone Facebook
whatsapp wire snapchat various banking
apps PayPal Bitcoin wallets and so forth
all interact via some API with some kind
of online service some private user data
is cached and stored on the phone but
probably most of it lays on the servers
which means generally a security audit
of a mobile application should include
an audit of the server component or the
API as well
I have done a lot of mobile app security
audits and I personally find them pretty
boring don't misunderstand me
I love technical channels debugging apps
with Frida and maybe defeating some
obfuscation or reversing a weird of
school layer of crypto super fun but
with boring I mean more the impact the
severity of vulnerabilities that you can
find because our mobile phones are
probably the most secure computers that
you can get if they would get security
patches in Android so let's consider an
up-to-date iOS or Android device both
platforms were designed with a tech
service reduction in mind it starts with
the permission model where each app can
define which api's they want to use
that's very different from a regular PC
where basically every program can access
anything though to be fair that also
gets better we get sandboxes namespaces
on Mac you have sip system integrity
protection and so forth
anyway so these mobile apps run in this
very restricted permission model and
have limited access to those API s and
only if permissions were granted now
obviously a big issue why mobile phones
might not feel very secure is that the
general public doesn't pay attention to
their permission and might install
trojan eyes apps from the Google Play
Store that requests access to every API
and maybe even higher privileges through
device admin and so forth or a user has
a rooted phone and runs a Trojan as root
and it's obviously very bad for the
users naked pictures but that's not
really application security is it so if
we audit a mobile app we have to look at
how this particular app protects the
user's data and like I said the apps and
boxes are generally great if the
developer follows the development
security guidelines for example when a
developer uses the internal storage the
developer even doesn't have to think
about protecting that data because you
get that for free from the system you
can save files directly on the devices
internal storage by default files safe
to the internal storage are private to
your application and
the applications cannot access them nor
can the user when the user uninstalls
your application these files are removed
so the users data is secure of course
some developers save data on the
external storage then for example
somebody could take out the SD card and
get the data through that that's an
issue that then should be fixed another
example is the update mechanic which you
don't have to care about the Play Store
or App Store is perfectly safe to push
your updates you don't even have a
chance to that up with downloading
unsigned updates via HTTP and executing
it then generally Android apps are
written in Java so you don't have to
care about memory corruption
vulnerabilities of course an app can
play some stuff in native code which
some do often for possession or anti
reversing reasons which might actually
introduce memory corruptions and sure
that's then an issue too but even then
you wonder what's even the attack vector
for that how does an attacker even reach
those code paths so let's explore one
example in a bit more detail Android
applications can define so-called
intense
they are basically entry points to your
app that could be called externally for
example you can register a broadcast
receiver for action battery low which
will then be called when the battery
gets low and these intense or basically
external interfaces can also pass data
around for example the Android Facebook
app will most likely use that to
interact with the facebook Messenger app
and sometimes developers forget to
probably restrict access to only trusted
apps or didn't realize that what they
expose is bad
and so you can have very interesting
vulnerabilities where for example
application a implements a vulnerable
intent that reads a user's SMS and
returns the text exposes this intent
publicly and then app B which doesn't
have the SMS reading permission can
piggyback on app s and tend to get
access to the SMS and I have seen
terrible intense and yes they should be
fixed but let's be honest how realistic
are those attacks some intense might be
reachable from a URI
in the browser but then that also isn't
really interactive it's not like a page
can invoke and intent and steal SMS text
and so generally we are talking here
about other malicious apps that abuse
these intents and mean how likely is
that I'm not saying that it's not an
issue it should be fixed but how
realistic is it that a user installs a
malicious application from the app store
that particularly targets this one other
application now here we get into things
like banking Trojans because we know
those exist so yeah a banking app with
an exposed intent that allows money
transfer without user interaction that's
bad a banking Trojan might target debt
but beyond that who really cares to me
the impact is fairly low rare very
targeted nothing people really have to
worry about mostly because it's
something that can be very easily found
and fixed because these intents are
defined in a simple XML file and so apps
that get audits are generally safe you
can kind of compare to CSRF on the web
but on the web you just have to hide a
hidden iframe that performs the attack
in an ad or just send them a link that's
bad and Google even pays quite a bit for
that on their platform but exposed
intense you have to get a user to
install another malicious app and at
that point they have much bigger issues
than the exposed intents of another app
but this is probably as bad as it gets
for Android app vulnerabilities like I
said the sandboxing and permission model
is great it's not much you can do on a
phone you can kind of compare most
mobile apps to the browser the browser
renders and runs a JavaScript HTML
client application on your computer
which interacts with a server in the
background and so does your mobile app
it's just a piece of UI written in Java
and interacting with the server API and
browser client security has a lot more
impact because web applications in the
browser share the same browser while
apps are very isolated from each other
and have to be installed first
now the much more serious issues like
with web security obviously lie with the
server component for example the API
could have access control issues where
one user is allowed to request messages
from other users because the developer
forgot the authorization check and you
know a whole bunch of more issues but at
this point it's basically web security
and so if you find an issue with the Web
API would you classify that as a mobile
app issue I think the issue here is not
the mobile app and the service is in
direct control of the vendor and can be
immediately patched while mobile apps
have to get a new update via the store
and many users might not update for a
long time calling these kind of issues
mobile app issues is I think misleading
but there's also a big part in between
the app and the server and that is the
network which I think is probably the
biggest risk and threat model for mobile
apps because over the network you will
send all the users private data session
tokens and so forth and mobile phones
are very mobile a lot of people connect
them to open Wi-Fi and we generally have
accepted that network is untrustworthy
that's why we use SSL and so of course
if an app communicates with the server
over HTTP then that is bad somebody just
has to sniff the air and I would
consider that an issue with the mobile
app now even if HTTP is used it has to
be implemented securely that means you
have to have a valid trusted certificate
and you don't ignore SSL errors if you
do ignore those errors in your app then
it can be very bad if you have an
attacker in a man-in-the-middle position
but if you use SSL correctly with a
valid certificate then the connection is
secure okay so up to this point I hope I
was able to kind of show you with a few
examples that Android apps are pretty
secure you can screw up some stuff but
it generally also easy to fix and if
there are issues they generally are very
targeted and are not scalable as for
example in authentication bypass on a
web api which could be automated to take
over every facebook account there is and
download the private messages
now let's move on to one particular
example that motivated me to make this
video and let's start with how a
particular research was described in the
abstracts and short summaries about this
work it's from 2016 and is about the
banking mobile app from number 26 and 26
here is Reuters a very reputable news
agency Vincent Howard a research fellow
and PhD student told the Chaos
Communication Congress in Hamburg how he
and two colleagues found n 26 security
defenses riddled with holes that could
have been used to defraud thousands of
users for example Howard said he
compared data from a leak of 68 million
account credentials from online
file-sharing company Dropbox with
information on N 26 users to identify 30
3026 user credentials without being
thwarted by the N 26 anti-fraud system
from there he said it could have been
simple to send a phishing email to send
these and 26 customers that could
potentially have allowed him to break
into their accounts wait I thought
Howard got 33 thousand user credentials
where does he need to send out phishing
emails
well Reuters kind of misunderstood what
the guy did and 26 like almost every
website I know will tell you in some way
if an email is registered with the
system or not so he just took a list
with millions of emails and found 33
thousand of them had an N 26 account and
he could use that to target them with
phishing he was able to identify 33,000
and 26 user credentials without being
thwarted by the end 26 anti-fraud
systems I understand not his fault in
this case reporters have also mixed-up
stuff that I have said it sounds
terrible to the reader those are nuances
they probably don't understand but let's
move on in response and 26 said in a
statement
it made customer accounts more secure by
reducing and encrypting data transfers
wait
they now encrypt data transfer did they
not use SSL holy for a banking app
that would be bad let's look at hoppers
official app store
of his research that he had presented on
the 33 c3 here he writes we succeeded
independently from the use device to Lee
customer data manipulate transactions
and to entirely take over accounts to
ultimately issue arbitrary transaction
even without credit entirely independent
of the use device we were not only able
to reveal and 26 customers and to
manipulate transactions in real time but
also to completely take over a victim's
account this sounds insane if that were
true this is massive and I can only
explain this kind of impact if you
somehow can either men in the middle
everything for example when they use
HTTP or the API completely up
authentication and that's why this makes
me so mad because this is not the case
and I better insert here now a
disclaimer I'm going to rent now a
little bit and I don't want to attack
this researcher but I will criticize the
scientific work and he just happened to
be the scapegoat now because he was very
public about this research with a lot of
media attention but this is not a single
isolated example I know he didn't
deliberately mislead or manipulate in
fact I know more people that agree with
his assessment of the vulnerabilities
here then I know people that agree with
me and that's why I said in the
beginning that this video could be
controversial and I would like to see a
discussion because it's not quite black
and white and there is a fine line here
so let's see what the vulnerability
actually was I'm going to play the
crucial part of his talk shut up and
take my money the red pill of n 26
security just to talk about like the
infrastructure of n 26 basically they
have two apps one for iOS one for
Android and they communicate over
adjacent based protocol TLS encrypted
the back end is at API dot Tec 26.2 de
how do I know actually that this is a
JSON based protocol because I used a TLS
written attack a man-in-the-middle
attack to allow the protocol I actually
suspect that I only needed to install a
certificate a bit of proxy certificate
on the client
actually I was surprised that and didn't
need to touch the client because they
didn't implement any certificate pinning
so why is the audience laughing and
clapping here
what is the surprise here ssl performs
verification of the certificate with the
local CA store of course if you install
your own certificate on the device the
device will trust it and the application
did nothing wrong here it checked the
certificate via the local trust store
and found that the user trusts it this
is how SSL is supposed to work and yes
there's criticism about the CA system we
have issues with it certain CAS are
untrustworthy weird incidents of
compromised root certs and we have
rampant problems of middleboxes and
antivirus software that install their
own certificate into the local CA store
but there's not that much evidence or
data on actual attacks of SSL
man-in-the-middle but take a step back
from mobile app security and let's look
at the web there is HP KP which will
actually be deprecated now because it
has its own issues we have the Chrome
public key pinning preload list and some
of the big sites are listed there but as
far as I can see for example PayPal
doesn't do it for their website why is
nobody screaming how insecure people is
because they don't use pinning on the
web SSL has its issues no question but
it's also holding up surprisingly well
realistically how many real-world
attacks on SSL connections do we
actually see public key pinning can be a
defense in death strategy but claiming
that an app that doesn't do it is
insecure that I don't agree with all
most of the web can be considered broken
let's continue with the talk because now
he makes an example how that could be
turned into an attack that the first
thing that comes into mind is like let's
do real-time transaction manipulation
that means we manipulate a transaction
that the user does but we will change
the recipient and the user won't see
nothing about us remember in his
abstract he claimed that he will show
how to manipulate transactions in real
but also to completely take over victims
bank account so if you look at this
graphic again what if an attacker could
get the DNS record of API to tag 26 D
under his control this would would mean
that all traffic is routed over the
man-in-the-middle attack a server and as
there's no certificate pinning we could
just issue a let's encrypt TLS
certificate and the app is going to
trust the certificate what I mean we
have seen DNS hijacks and bank heists
before but if you can hijack the DNS
record of a domain to redirect it to
your own server and now man in the
middle everything of course you're
screwed what is a surprise there but
does that count as a vulnerability of n
26 no the issue the vulnerability our
attack would be the weak DNS system or
account they used maybe through social
engineering of brute force credentials
everything that happens after the DNS
hijack is pretty much just creative ways
how you can to cost damage and yes again
pinning might have helped here to
protect the transactions but we don't
know what other systems and data could
have been compromised through a DNS
hijacking like that so at best it would
be a defense and def mechanism and sure
a nice-to-have improvement but it don't
agree that this is a vulnerability of
the app that leads to a complete
takeover of accounts and in the paper he
describes this s if Natak ur can launch
a man-in-the-middle attack the
transaction can be tampered with
transparently yeah if it were HTTP but
you can't because SSL is used but he
argues this becomes possible because
even though the N 26 app makes strict
use of HTTPS they do not make use of
certificate pinning a best practice that
prevents unauthorized third parties from
breaking the confidentiality and
integrity of the transmitted data strict
use of HTTPS does ensure confidentiality
and integrity without pinning you don't
lose that and he lists three claims how
this could be done a trusted certificate
authority issues the certificate
vulnerabilities in C Ava
processes sometimes allowing techno to
take hold of a certificate for the main
they do not own okay yeah could happen
theoretically but you know how realistic
is that this would be used in an attack
against an 26 is that the real risk or
just a theoretical risk also isn't that
then a vulnerability in the CA and not
really a vulnerability in the app both
Android and iOS are frequently the prey
of privileged malware that is malware
that performs a privilege escalation
exploit before executing their payload
it is a trivial task for privileged
malware to place a certificate that
doesn't make even sense why would a
malware that use the privilege
escalation exploit even bother to
install a certificate so somebody can
perform a man-in-the-middle attack why
not just extract the credentials from
the app hook the functions to change
recipient or do whatever but there is
malware that does infect install
certificate sometime because they run a
local proxy to inject ads into
everything that's a common thing but not
for men in the middle attacks like that
and if you have a malware on your phone
a privileged malware that is you have
other problems this is where obfuscation
comes into play as a possible defense in
their strategy but come on if we talk
about theoretical a text like that then
theoretically you can always reverse
engineer and steal stuff with the
privileged malware nothing helps a user
can be tricked into installing the
certificate through phishing or other
means of social engineering the user is
the weakest point in the system so the
app should pin its certificates in
general a text using phishing or social
engineering are particularly dangerous
and have a high success rate a user can
also be tricked to install a malware or
an-26 developer could be phished for the
NS account credentials or to install a
malware and grab the SSL root
certificate that they are pinning it's
not a good argument and so no N 26 does
not have a massive security issue once
you have the man in the middle set up
you can hijack all the stuff obviously
now N 26 had some API design issues that
the reason
also goes into that we are quite
interesting some logic issues with some
card number and two factors I think
these were a valid API design concerns
because n 26 clearly wanted to implement
something in a certain way and he showed
that it was a bit flawed but nothing
that would warn this large negative
response now I want to summarize the
media will obviously Xsara gate certain
security issues or just make genuine
mistakes not to understand the impact
but in this case manipulate transactions
in real time but also completely take
over victims account I find this to be
very misleading wording coming directly
from the researcher and seeing through
that is particularly difficult because
his research is not there's a
lot of good information and research in
there but it feels like the impact of
them were a bit artificially inflated
and so you have this kind of half true
half theoretical mix for somebody who is
not very experienced with it will lead
to a wrong impression and I think that's
dangerous and maybe even a little bit
unethical and very early in the video I
mentioned that I don't think he did this
intentionally because I know that many
people hold this belief that no
certificate pinning on mobile is a valid
issue I already explored earlier why I
don't think its initial my thesis is and
the main point of this video should be
that I think mobile apps are so boring
because issues are generally very low
impact that somehow the security
industry researchers our community
agreed that missing certificate pinning
and only implementing SSL correctly is
apparently not enough and I think what I
say is true because nobody really
complains about that on the web nobody
says using only SSL for your website is
an issue that can lead to a traffic
manipulation and full account takeover
because SSL is actually the technical
solution to exactly those issues and
like I said there are certain weaknesses
in the whole CA system but there is
something else that is a different
research field now the researcher also
announced a talk for the 34th c3 most of
the information including the
abstract only seem to be available in
German for now it's again about banking
apps banking apps are often target of
banking malware and there's a lot of
inert malware so what a banking melville
usually does for example on your desktop
PC it will hook into your browser and
steal your credentials or use your
session to wire money and basically they
would do similar stuff on Android as
well as long as the malware somehow gets
rude either through old and patched
Android exploits or because somebody
runs a rooted device and gave malware
root permissions and so banks obviously
don't want that their customers get
hacked because of malware so banks
invest money into solutions attempting
to mitigate that but obviously banking
apps can't prevent it it can try to
implement route detection and refuse to
run or obfuscate itself so hard that
it's not easy to hook into the app and
steal credentials but it's always going
to be a cat-and-mouse game the bank just
tries to make reversing expensive enough
that it's not economically feasible
anymore for the malware author it's just
the best effort in order to protect
users from themselves now if a malware
is able to bypass any anti debugging
anti reversing or anti root detection
mechanism is that a security issue of
the banking app an issue of the
obfuscation solution is it fair to blame
the bank for it and that seems to be the
gist of his new talk at least from what
I can understand from the abstract and
the few interviews he seemed to have
implemented some kind of hooking or
dynamic or static analysis of the probe
one of physician and is able to
basically do what Pearlman tries to
prevent in this best effort approach
which is need it's probably some really
cool stuff and I'm looking forward to
the technical details I'm obviously just
speculating here and the talk and paper
could be actually much more but if I'm
right why is this talk not just called
defeating Pro Mon and going down into
details of how Pro Mon works and how you
can get around it that would be a cool
technical talk why does this talk have
to focus on banking apps and
fear-mongering leading to countless of
media titles claiming her third
banking apps are insecure and hackers
can hack them that's only half true we
are talking here about already
compromised devices and a best-effort
approach of banking apps trying to
protect users from their infected
devices why shame the banking apps what
is the purpose of this if not just for
self promotional reasons making the
research sound more scary and impactful
and at the same time ignoring the damage
it does in the public perception of what
our actual threats and what are hackers
capable of this to me is FUD
