internet rocket city of 2016 we will
have a look at crypto 60 70 and 90 so
let's start with crypto 60 Alice wants
to send something to Bob and it seems to
have to do something with RSA and when
we download the files we see that we get
a couple of public keys three public
keys and an encrypted message and also
when you print the files they do look
indeed like normal public keys how you
would expect them and then the encrypted
file has three basic C four strings so
that is probably encrypted data in a
binary former just encoded as base64 so
let's have a look at the public key with
open SSL I didn't remember the command
so I had to quickly Google the command
again but with this one we get all the
necessary information from the public
key and we can do this for all three
files and what open SSL shows us is the
Malolos and the exponent of this public
key RSA and other crypto algorithms are
basically just math so the public key
and private keys are actually just
special variables for this mathematical
algorithm in this case it's a special
exponent and modulus this goes into how
RSA works but what you should know
mostly is that the modulus is the
multiplication of the two private
Prime's and with those Prime's they have
to be kept private if you figure those
out those Prime's then you could
recreate the private key and decrypt any
file and the modulus is the
multiplication of those two and RSA is
so hard to break because getting the
factorization of the smaller loss is
extremely hard this prime factor
factorization is extremely extremely
hard especially for long strings it's
basically impossible except for brute
forcing but for especially small
moduli and special other wikis we may be
able to easily factorize those models so
what i'm doing now is i'm extracting the
modulus in a proper number as a proper
number so I'm removing the colons and I
just used Python to then convert the hex
value to an actual integer and once we
have that we can use services online
that help you to figure out if there is
a public factorization known for this
number let's have a look at the
Wikipedia page of RSA again to see
exactly where this weakness comes from
it's not necessarily weakness
mathematically speaking it's very very
hard but again if the modulus is
especially small or for whatever reason
one of the prime leaked you can our weak
prime was used you can easily calculate
the missing prime and from that on you
can find out the decryption so you can
see here that the public key is defined
as n and E and n is the number that is
used for the modulus operation and E is
the public exponent and this modulus n
that is included in the public key is
the multiplication of P and Q and P and
Q are those randomly two distinct chosen
Prime's that you need to keep private
again if one of them leaks you can just
you know divide n by P for example to
get Q so it's integral and very
important to keep it secret
also Wikipedia says here that P and Q
have to be kept secret because if you
can factor this this modulus then you
are able to create the private key and
there's this great website called factor
DB and factor DB is a database of
factorizations of numbers so when you
have a very weak key you can maybe just
give it this big modulus number and
maybe factor DB knows how to factorize
it in this case we actually get a P and
a Q value we get two Prime's that
multiply together prove create this big
modulus number so
now with this P and Q and theory we
should be able to generate the private
key or use them to create the
information for the private key again to
decrypt this information so let's do
this for the other two model e as well
we could now use those values to
calculate the remaining variables that
we need and then we could perform the
decryption but there's this cool script
written by somebody you can just give
the script a P Q and model a value and
it will generate nice open SSL valid
private key which you then can use to
let open SSL decrypt the data now let's
save this script somewhere and then
let's see if we can execute that okay so
we are missing a patent module so I
create a virtual environment and then I
can enter this virtual environment and
then install GMP why only for this
particular session so virtual
environments are pretty cool for patent
development and if you do write scripts
in Python I highly recommend to you also
use virtual environment okay so there
was another same thing missing but now
it seems to work cool so let's supply
the arguments that we need the PQ the
moduli and the public exponent and then
we can execute it and it will calculate
the other values especially this T value
for us - oh we can also specify a file
we want to write the private key - cool
now we have a private key file so let's
do this for the other two public keys as
well okay now the second one and the
third one
and if you print them they look indeed
like normal private keys now let's see
if we can use the open SSL errors a
utility to decrypt the file that was
provided well it doesn't look like so we
get an error it's probably because all
those three base64 strings have to be
first extracted and then decrypted with
the specific private key on their own
see if it just works with the basics
before string like that so let's say if
there's enough file and try RSA utility
again but nope it still gives an error
so maybe we have to first base 64
decoded and then we can maybe apply the
private key to it so let's save this
output in a file and then try the RSA
command again and indeed we get in week
or so that looks like part of the
internet waha CTF flag format so cool so
let's do exactly the same thing with the
other two basic C 4 strings so let's do
it with the second one that seems to
work the second one was the third key so
the third one with the second key and
then we can combine those three strings
properly together and we get the flag
internet waha weak RSA keys are so bad
so let's move on to crypto 70 hash
designer there was the student hash
design contest all submissions were crap
but promised to use the winning
algorithm we hashed our password and God
zero zero six eight something brute
force isn't effective anymore and the
key algorithm had to be collision
resistant so did that work or not we
will see the service is running on a TCP
port somewhere so we can connect to it
and see what we have to do so you need
to provide your proof of work a sha-1
hash with the last two by it set to zero
and it has to have a certain specific
prefix and if we type in something else
it will just not let us pass and says
it's wrong so it's download also the zip
file provided with the challenge and
have a look at the files that we get in
this it was on my hash Python script
let's have a look at what it's doing
hmm looks complicated and seems to have
nothing to do with this sha-1 thing I
suggest we first look into passing the
first barrier which is brute forcing or
finding a sha-1 hash with a certain
input which has a special prefix and
produces a sha-1 hash with two bytes set
to zero that's why I'm searching for the
simple brute forcing algorithm for
Python so we can write a script to find
such a sha-1 hash we also need some code
to interact with the server and I will
just reuse code that I have written for
the 32 oc3 CTF which connects to the
server and interacts with it and sends
data and receives data ok cool now we
have some code to connect to a server
and specifically more importantly this
receive all function which pulls data
until you'll receive a timeout let's
start writing some code first of all we
have to import a couple of things to use
those code snippets here we need import
socket for the TCP connection to the
server and I use time because you know
sometimes you have to use a little sleep
we also have to define this variable
server which needs to have the IP
address as well as the port we want to
connect to stupid mistake here the IP
should be a string I will realize and
fix it in a second but we can start to
create now a connection to the server
and then we start to receive the first
message when we connect to it and
obviously when I try to execute it now I
get the syntax error so quickly fixing
that try it again and we can read this
message where it requires us to provide
a proof-of-work now we just want to
parse the string so I'm very cheesy and
very bad way but it goes fastest I just
split this string and from the spaces
and then it always the same position of
this new list we will find the prefix
that we need for the sha-1 hash and yeah
at offset 21 that seems to work so we
get the prefix and now we can start to
brute-force a sha-1 hash with that next
let's import hash lips so we
can write the sha-1 code so H will be a
shale one instance I always have to
Google I'd always don't remember exactly
how it works so lets me just copy it
then I remember I need the brute force
code in this script here that's a pretty
cool neat little code which I often copy
actually it just creates a generator
which will constantly create and brute
force passwords based on the char set
and the length that you want this
password to be so we start defining if
we found a valid hash and if not we will
constantly loop and continue to look for
it then we use update on the sha-1
instance with the prefix which was
required by the proof of work and the
random string to brute-force tesha one
hash to brute force random string which
I append to the prefix I use random from
Pattin and it's not the fastest or
coolest way but it's very easy and
quickly written so I define an alphabet
I want to choose and then I create a
list out of random characters which I
then join together to a string so that's
a pretty easy way how to do it and then
we can give this string that we just
generated to hashlib just quickly
checking how to get the hash and once we
have the sha-1 hash of this input we
want to check if the last two bytes are
zero because it's in hex format that is
those are the flasks for characters that
have to be 0 and then we sent the input
that found this hash I'm getting rid of
some syntax errors and then we should be
good to go oh that one quick we found a
valid input with the correct prefix that
produced a hash which has two bytes 0 at
the end but the issue is that it has the
wrong length we need an input that has
to pass this test here so it has to be
15 characters long so I fix the
generation of the random string but you
still get that it has a wrong length or
wrong prefix so maybe the 15 characters
have to be included with the prefix so I
have to check the length of the prefix
and then generate the missing amount of
friend
characters afterwards looking for the
Heche and we found one and then it says
please continue with the login process
and asked us for a password so that's
pretty neat that worked
we found a valid hash we can also maybe
print the hash output just to see that
the last two bytes are in fact zero so
let's generate it again yeah super fast
and we found a valid hash with a certain
prefix of the input that produces a hash
with two zero bytes at the end okay so
let's continue with the next step of
this challenge we were provided another
hash algorithm that we probably have to
find a collision for because it's asking
for a password
now I'm poking just what it requires and
when I sent the same password again it
says that the string has to be at least
18 characters long
the next part doesn't have to be
interactive because the hash is fixed in
a challenge description so we just have
to find one well that password that
generates this hash that it's comparing
to and I also realized that I don't need
the brute force code that I first got
because because my Python lists joining
is pretty effective
I guess so now I'm just modifying the
code that was already provided because
it has the algorithm for the hash
calculation inside so let's create a
random string that is 18 characters long
and then call the function to generate a
hash so my hash of the password that
I've generated so let's try it out but
alphabet is missing so quickly fix that
we can check if the hash works and yes
we generate a lot a lot of different
hashes so now I just have to get the
hash that is required and make a check
for when we find this hash and then we
want to simply print the input that
produced this special hash so let's let
it run let's see how fast we find the
valid input that takes a couple of more
seconds then the sha-1 brute force more
second send me sha-1 brute force but I'm
sure eventually we will find one okay
after a minute or so we found an input
that produces this same hash now let's
plug this into our original script that
is interacting with the server and send
the password and then we should be done
I guess
a small modification of the code sending
this fixed password that we now know and
then let's run it and indeed we found
the password
fuck-you hash my ass it's head to the
third crypto chunks that I'm showing off
which is crypto 90 it's a bank everyone
knows that banks are insecure this one
is super secure and only allows 20
transaction per session but I always
wanted to have a million bucks so let's
see what we are dealing with again we
are given a service running on a TCP
port 1 0 0 6 1 and when we connect to it
we are presented with the bank back-end
where we can create new transaction with
a certain amount so I just play around
with it get a feeling for this program
so we create one transaction we create a
transaction for 9 and 9 nine dollars but
if we try to create a transaction with
too much money it will not work and with
every transaction we initiate we get a
verification code which we can use to
complete a transaction using the ID of
the transaction and this transaction
code then this transaction will be
executed and we get the money on our
bank account but the issue is we are
only allowed 20 transactions so how
would we ever reach a million dollars if
we are not allowed to make transactions
for those high numbers so there must be
a flaw in there somehow so let's have a
look at the code we can see this is the
main menu here where it checks the
command that we input and if it starts
with create it will call eventually this
create T function as a parameter uses
this a which is an integer from the
command that we supply and create T
seems to create a new transaction and
this transaction is then appended to the
internal transaction and underscore T
list and also the a the number that we
supply is not allowed to be over a
certain maximum in this case over 5,000
so 5,000 works but 5,000 1 will not work
but if we supply a lower value then
eventually we will create a new
transaction and will get appended to
this one list so new transaction gets
created also with this pair
so that's the amount that we want to
create a transaction with and there's
also the length check of the cell phone
the score no score t lists that it will
not be bigger than 20 transactions so
transaction will be initiated with the
amount and this random value this is
probably something to do with the
verification code and then there is this
also V variable which is a boolean which
is default set on true and when we
complete a transaction and we try to
complete it again
it says that we cannot complete the
transaction twice so there seems to be
some protection and that is what this B
value is if we already verified a
transaction this value will be set to
false and we are not allowed to validate
another transaction anyway once we
created a valid transaction the next
step is that we call encrypt on this
other class and we encrypt this T
variable and T is the transaction that
we created that was returned by a create
T and the result here this TC will be
printed as the verification code so this
encrypt creates this verification code
that we need to verify a transaction so
we have the cipher class here which
defines a crypt and it does some
calculations so it takes it gets an X
for it and this X is complicated
calculated and there also is this K
value that was randomly generated before
and it's randomly with every transaction
that we create so let's debug this a
little bit just use good old print
debugging let's just put in a a bunch of
prints of important variables to see
what is behind them and how this
encryption actually works and what
exactly is encrypted and how the output
looks like you also notice that this is
a for loop over probably characters and
then the character gets XOR with this
number that is generated somehow so this
is an XOR encryption so what we will do
is I will create a list where I pentas
XOR encryption key and have a look at it
as well how does it actually look like
and then we do the same for decrypt
let's print there also some interesting
values but then I realized there's a
problem with how I print the key that is
used for the XOR because generate next
will then completely screw with the
encryption so we have to assign this
encryption key to a variable K first so
that we encrypt with the same one value
that we also print cool so let's try
this and let's see what's behind those
decryption and encryption functions a
doesn't work we need to import the flag
obviously the server has this flagged
and in a special file so let's create
this module so we can actually run this
Python program locally it's just an easy
variable that is set in this file and a
Python module is also just a Python file
so that's easy anyway so we started now
we can run it and let's create a new
transaction with 5,000 ok so it encrypts
the string in capital letters
transaction colon space 5,000 and the
list behind that those are the XOR keys
that are used for the XOR algorithm and
when we now complete this transaction
it will decrypt that string and out of
it comes the transaction 5,000 again and
that's pretty cool now let's have a look
at the complete function what it does so
it it reads the data from the command
line checks if this transaction ID is
even valid and checks if the
verification at the correct length and
then it initiates the decryption and
initialize this encryption with the
transaction ID that was applied and all
of this decrypt function comes a
variable T N and that T n is then added
to a and a is the account
so whatever decrypt does that the end
that comes out will be added to our
account so when we looked at decrypt
again it takes two parameters T and C T
and T is the transaction that we want to
verify and C T is the encrypted string
so this verification code which is
actually you know and encrypt the string
it's not a hash or something so what it
does then after the
Crypton after the decryption it replaces
or rather removes the transaction string
part of it and so what is left over is
only the number of the transaction
amount that you want to have and that is
converted to an integer and then the
transaction amount is set to this number
this means that if we are able to modify
the transaction amount in this encrypted
verification code we would be able to
set a new different amount and that is
actually easier than it may seem on
first sight so let's create a new
transaction so we created a new
transaction with 5,000 so how can we now
modify this 5,000 with a higher number
maybe like 9999 so now I changed if you
look closely I changed a few bytes at
the end an T value changed and if you
look at our balance we actually got
those seven so it that the idea we just
have really works if we are able to
modify the amount that is inside of this
transaction we are able to get much
higher numbers on much more money on our
account and of course we want to get
more than a million because when we get
more than a million or account the flag
will be printed so we have to do at
least 20 transactions with 50,000 to
actually reach this goal but it seems
like even if we could flip all the
values in this encrypted string to nine
and a nine it may not fit because
remember the verification code is only
allowed up to a certain length and
obviously we cannot simply add stuff to
it but before I get to how we can
exploit this let's start writing the
script that will talk with the server so
I create a new script and it I base it
on the previous crypto level so I just
replaced the part where we interact with
it so what we want is basically we first
want to create 20 transactions and then
we get the verification codes for it and
we remember the verification
cause for now and then we have to come
up with an idea how we can turn those
verification codes into something that
will create much more money for us
and maybe you already had the idea when
you saw that the encryption is XOR
because we know the plaintext of those
transactions and when we know the
plaintext and we know how the encrypted
transaction string looks like then we
can also get the keys by simply X oaring
the hedge verification code with our
transaction 500 string and with those
keys then we can then create a new
transaction which will have different
values or which will have whatever
include whatever we want so let's define
a new function that we use to get the
XOR key from a certain transaction given
the verification code so this test this
funnel with only truth times X when we
create and then we have the codes in
this list we loop over this list and
print the XOR keys and yeah looks pretty
good and with those keys now we can
obviously create a transaction that
includes a different amount of money so
we have to define a new function which
will take the keys that we leaked and
the string that we want to XOR which
will be the transaction amount and then
we'll return that and then that should
already work so for each code that we
get we get now the keys and then we
create the new verification code so for
each transaction code we create now a
new verification code with the string
transaction nine and a nine that seems
to work and then we sent this to the
server with the confirm command which is
actually not confirmed I made a mistake
it's complete so we have to provide the
transaction ID and then the verification
code so now that works and now we get
our balance and we see this indeed it
works we our balance is much higher than
it used to be and we got the $9,999 with
each transaction so the logical next
step is to increase the amount we want
to get but the issue is now that it
doesn't work mainly because we don't
have enough keys to encrypt the next
character
but also I think the verification
lengths would be - along with it not
100% sure right now but there's another
trick you can do to get the high amount
and that is with this space because if
you look at the replace method it just
replaces the colon it doesn't care about
the space and the int function just
strips away the space but so we don't
need the space we can remove the space
we win one our character which we can
replace them with another 9 so now we
should be able to get nine a nine a nine
a nine
so let's run us and indeed we got almost
200 thousand amount money so now we just
have to increase the for-loop two more
transactions and we should be able to
get the 1 million money so let this run
takes a couple of seconds first we
create all those transaction with 5,000
and we have collected now all
verification codes and now we modify
each verification codes and step through
it and boom we got the million there's
the flag shut up and take my money so
let's copy the flag and let's hand it in
correct flag awesome we solved crypto 9
