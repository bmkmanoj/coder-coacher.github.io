can match a string of characters for
example ABC would first look for an A
then a B and then a C you could also
draw this pattern as a finite state
automaton or a finite state machine this
is the kind of theoretical stuff you
learn in computer science so we start
here then we can move to the next state
when we see an A to the next one we see
a B in to the last one when we see a C
which means we match the string and
obviously if our string would have been
ax C instead then we would find the a
and move forward but there is no path
for the X so our pattern doesn't match
the string ax C and if you think about
these reg exists as these graphs all the
other features of reg X become very
clear so it's really helpful to draw
this if you find a more complex reg X
you don't understand or if you want to
come up with the regs yourself maybe
start drawing a finite state machine
instead and then translate it into the
text version there's this really awesome
website called debug X which basically
does exactly that for you and I use it
all the time because reg eggs are often
used to validate input and it can be
really helpful to see if you can somehow
get malicious input through here's just
an example a simple male reg X and while
you type you can observe here the pink
cursor that shows you what characters
you are allowed to use next until it
matches and if it doesn't match you can
easily explore where it happened
now debug X is not the only service for
this you can find plenty of reg X
debugging tools and they are all cool
and sometimes a reg X is better
visualized by one of the others I just
happen to use teabag X mostly no
particular reason
