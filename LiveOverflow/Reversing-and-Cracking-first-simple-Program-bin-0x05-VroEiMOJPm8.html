supposed to be a simple license check so
you can execute it and you can supply a
key as an argument and it will be
checked our goal is to crack this
program so we don't have to use a valid
license key I've made this program
available through a github repository
you can download it from github comm
slash live overflow and the repository
name live overflow YouTube or you can
install git with sudo apt-get install
kit and get the whole repository with
get clone and the address you can see on
github we will probably talk more about
what get is later for now it's enough to
know that it's a way how developers can
program together on a project and I use
it to share some stuff to have a look at
the binary assembly code we can use a
program called gdb the new debugger so
type gdb and the path to the binary so
every C program has a main function
remember so let's type in disassemble
main which will display all assembly
instructions from the main function but
do you see how ugly that looks
that's horrible horrible AT&amp;amp;T syntax so
type in set disassembly flavor Intel
remember that you can use tap completion
here as well now this is my main again
and now it's much more readable okay so
it looks complicated
but you can ignore most of it first of
all get a high-level view of it it
doesn't make sense to start going
through this instruction by instruction
this main function obviously calls other
functions so just draw a mental picture
of the rough control flow I will
actually print out this assembler code
and use a pen that's how I did it in the
beginning and still do it when I
encounter more complex code and remember
to just ignore most of the stuff
concentrate on the actual flow so at
this start it arrives at a compare with
number two and afterwards a jump not
equal so something is checked if it is
too
if that is the case we proceed to a
printf which we know is a function to
display text then comes a string compare
if you don't know that function with man
page of it man three string compare so
this compares two strings and return 0
if both strings were the same
after that call we see another jump not
equal
so if the zero flag is not said there
will be a puts call use the main page to
figure out what it does but it just
prints texts like printf
so if the original compare with the
number two was not true then it would
jump to the address four zero zero six
two three
so in that case it print some other text
with puts and exits
I always add the address or at least
part of the address from important
locations so I know where I am
this will help you later when we step
through the program now we have one
branch missing
which also just prints text
some jumps are still missing but you can
add them to get a nice control flow
graph now let's actually execute this
and step through it you can then draw
which path through the graph you have
taken on your paper to do this we first
set a breakpoint at the start of main
with break main breakpoint is set now
you run to start the program starting
the program and we hit the breakpoint
one at this address a breakpoint is a
point where execution stops now look at
the registers with info registers here
you can see the ROP the instruction
pointer points to the first address in
main now use si to step one instruction
now we are at the new address in main
and for registers and you see the
changed instruction pointer
so now just step through it and follow
the addresses in your control graph but
use an eye instead of si because si
would step into function calls but we
only want to step through with this main
function and not follow stuff like puts
okay did you notice when we jumped the
jump was at 50 zero and then the next
instruction was at sixty two or three so
we followed the jump which means
whatever was compared to two was not too
and then the program printed the usage
information after six to eight which was
the last puts call so we can write down
that this puts print the users
information
now it's pretty clear that we didn't
pass a key to this program which means
the check was looking at the arguments
if we supply the license key so let's
not run the program again but this time
with a random license key
yes we want to solve the program again
now do the same ni and i and i now we
are at 5d zero again will we jump this
time no cool so the next branch we
expect is at 6:09 let's an eye and see
what happens
ah another print X so that printf is the
info that a license key will be checked
and I know comes the branch okay we
arrived at 6:09 let's see where we are
afterwards at 6:17 so we did jump which
means that the string compared failed
and when we continued with an eye we see
that it's wrong
okay let's set a breakpoint just before
the last compare and run the program
again remember that you can easily copy
and paste values in the terminal by
simply marking something and pressing
your mouse wheel now run again grape on
one now continue this will run the
program normally again until we hit the
next breakpoint now it stopped before we
execute the test e^x e^x e^x just refers
to the first 32-bit of the 64-bit RA X
register so it's value is hex e let's
set this to zero which would indicate
that the string compare was correct and
returned zero set dollar x equals to
zero in four registers and you see that
it's not zero now use an I again to step
and follow your control path
access granted yay so we circumvented
the license check
you can always write your own little C
program trying to make it more secure
and then crack it yourself again you
will notice that it's impossible to make
a program uncrackable those kind of
challenges are called correct me
people create small programs that have
to be correct or more often you have to
create a valid keygen if you think
something like this is fun
check out crack mini e creating control
graphs like we just did is pretty useful
that's why there are some programs that
do that for us here are three different
example of the specific control graph
first is from the hopper disassembler
second is from Ida and the last one is
from radar it see you hopefully next
time we're going to use some different
tools to explore this license check
binary a bit more
