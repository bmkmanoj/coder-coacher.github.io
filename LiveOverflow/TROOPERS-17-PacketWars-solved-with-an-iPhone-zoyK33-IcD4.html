Heidelberg Germany which I intended in
2017 one fun event that happens there
every year is Pekka Dwarfs it's kind of
like a CTF competition during one
evening but only for a few teams and I
didn't have a group to play with but it
was held in this restaurant we were all
at and the task was shown on a beamer
this was one battle one whale spotting
identified the email address of the real
Trump and achieved bonus objectives on
the way we have 45 minutes to solve it
and we get points for various objectives
some for the email address for evidence
of the whistleblower assassination and
if we identify a favorite coffee shop to
organize a boycott so my friend the vamp
and I had nothing else than our phone
but we were really craving to play so we
tried it first we looked up the obvious
Twitter handle and found this account oh
and this is all going to be screened as
I made from my phone while playing the
latest tweet we can find says that we
should ignore the tweet before because
it wasn't relevant so obviously the
first step is to look into for example
the web archive because we hope that had
safe to delete a tweet and yeah there
are it was it was a URL to some kind of
report we clicked on it and downloaded
the PDF unfortunately certain parts were
blacked out but I assume they were just
overlays because that's such a typical
PDF redaction fail so I simply tried to
copy the whole page into a Notes app and
yeah that worked it revealed the text
underneath but it turned out that the
text was actually an image and it had
this cipher text on it which looked like
some kind of simple substitution cipher
like Caesar or Visionnaire so we had to
get the text out of the image and we
didn't want to type it on our phone so
we pulled up an online OCR servers and
uploaded the image and now we copy the
text into an online cypher solver which
rude forces the key in applying some
heuristic if the result sounds like
valid English and we got this text out
it's not quite perfect because the keys
a bit jumbled and maybe OCR was also not
perfect but you can guess most of the
text after some further research
blahblah and eliminate them so that is
the evidence of assassination and we
solved the task but there were more
tasks so where's the other stuff we
checked back to the web archive and
found another entry of deleted tweets
with the favorite coffee shop Starbucks
which was another task and what looks
like lock in credentials so we locked
into this account I tweeted that I was
here
got the accounts email from the settings
and we solved the last part and now
comes the not so humble brag we were
faster than the actual teams I think the
reason for that might be that with a
phone you are so limited that you can
try out crazy stuff steganography
metadata and so forth is just out of
reach so we only tried was possible for
us and got lucky I'm sure the other
teams over complicated things because
they had laptops I think it's something
to keep in mind but it was really fun to
solve something like this just on a
phone because we solved it first the
organisers even gave us the flag for
participating even though we were not
officially part of packet Wars so that
was really awesome and we also got this
awesome shout out at the end of the
conference when they were announcing the
winners the the actual first people to
solve the first challenge were the
spectators so our players actually got
off to a kind of a rough start are those
two guys out here that's us
we were sitting somewhere here in the
back okay so let's hear it for those
guys because and they did a debrief much
better than I my tias could ever do it I
think you gave me the debrief and all
the proofs in about 45 seconds so I
think you have a future in this the
sport I really appreciate it
that was really fun so I can only
recommend the troopers conference in
Heidelberg it's a solid conference and
if you have a chance to go there you
should unfortunately its
professional conference which means
ticket prices are really high and not
something you generally buy privately
but the cool thing is they have limited
spots available for students you can
write a motivational letter and maybe
get a free ticket so that's really cool
and I encourage you to do that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
