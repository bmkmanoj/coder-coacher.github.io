white box challenge of the orage me3
qualifier in the first video we just had
a first reverse engineering look at the
binary and figured out how it works and
how this big switch case statement and
the jump table is implemented and then
in the second video we used that
knowledge to trace all the functions
inside to reverse-engineer single
sections of it I also told you that at
the same time people were talking in IRC
about this challenge and saying
something about AES and at first I
didn't believe it and also a friend was
telling me or hinting me I should look
into white box that because white box is
a thing and so towards the end of the
video we actually found proof that it's
actually a s or it's very likely to be a
s that is implemented in the binary as
well as learning about what white box
cryptography is and this is basically
where we left off so now in this video I
want to go over more of my notes and the
next steps I took after heard that white
box exists and that I assume it's a s
obviously one of the first things I did
was googling what white box actually is
and I showed you already the site in the
very first video but let's quickly recap
white box cryptography is for protecting
cryptographic keys and software
applications cryptography is
increasingly deployed in applications
that are executed on open devices such
as pcs and tablets and smartphones the
open nature of these systems makes the
software extremely vulnerable to attacks
since the attacker has the complete
control over the execution of the
platform and the software implementation
itself this means that an attacker can
easily analyze the binary code of the
application in the corresponding memory
pages during the execution the attacker
can intercept system calls tempo with
the binary and its execution and use any
kind of attack tools such as Ida Pro
debugger and emulators such an attack
context is denoted as white box attack
when the challenge that white box
cryptography aims to address is to
implement cryptographic algorithms in
software in such a way that
cryptographic assets basically the key
remains secure even when subject to
white box attacks so when I read this
for the first time it made kind of sense
ok so we have a a s and it's a symmetric
cipher and so it uses the same key for
encryption that it uses for decryption
so if you want to implement a s in a
software that is shipped to a client the
client can just reverse engineer the
binary and extract the key and so white
box cryptography kind of tries to
protect that tries to obfuscate that in
theory you could say that already like
crypting the binary or obfuscating the
binary is already a step in that
direction to hide or obscure the fact
that a s with this key is used but white
box cryptography goes a step further
that it actually designs or modifies the
algorithm the AES algorithm in a way
that it still performs a s but it
doesn't match the typical steps that we
see for example on Wikipedia and here's
also a figure that depicts the
conceptual high level overview of white
box cryptography so you have like a very
defined algorithm I'm not sure what
algorithms
this depicted here in this case but so
theoretically you always have as input
the ciphertext and the key and that
produces them in a well-defined
algorithm the plaintext but then you
kind of apply some random configuration
and you completely mess up the stuff and
you get something weird on the right and
the key is kind of embedded already in
these steps when I first heard about
this I thought okay I think I get it
that makes that make sense that's quite
interesting and so with this knowledge
and knowing that it's a s and that it's
obviously a s somehow obscured into the
binary I was starting to think about how
this could maybe be implemented and I
kind of refused to just read papers on
it there are white box AAS papers out
there that describe different techniques
how to implement something like this and
I was really lazy I didn't want to read
them and I felt like I was so deep into
this already with the reverse
engineering and I understood the binary
more and more that I felt like dude I'm
on a way to understand this actually
myself like rediscover what white box
crypto basically is without having to
read the work of other people that just
described how it works and I thought
this is a cool opportunity to like try
this out like you kind of know where
it's going but you don't really know the
way let's continue with reverse
engineering and thinking about this like
a scientist would do instead of just
reading the papers and that kind of also
was a problem why in the end didn't
succeed but more about this than in the
latest video so in this video I want to
show you more of my notes and basically
just go over the different stuff that I
wrote down here and tell you what I
thought about them the intention here is
just to show you what was going on in my
head and show you how I kind of try to
achieve this and understand this
obviously this didn't quite let me to
the solution and I kind of gave up on
this at some point but I still think for
some people might be interesting to see
what I was thinking and maybe if you are
actually very knowledgeable about AAS
and about white box cryptography and you
read those papers and you can maybe also
see where I struggled or what kind of
concepts I didn't come up with or didn't
think about when when looking at this
okay
so here are all my notes again but let's
focus on the first page
you remember this one here from the last
video this was kind of like my
breakthrough when I wrote down the input
and output of one specific function and
realized that it implements the shift
row step of AAS so I decided to write
down the steps in the AES algorithm and
I kind of wanted to understand each step
and maybe think about how they could be
obscured or hidden or how the key could
be incorporated into them I also
mentioned multiple times that there are
these add round key steps where the key
is XOR with whatever state data this is
so theoretically if you would find this
step in the binary then we could just
extract the key bytes and obviously this
was a first idea I tried I searched
through the disassembly for XOR
instructions and checked if they could
be the step but I didn't find any so
next is the sub byte step and when you
read what it does its implementing an
sbox
a substitution box it's so simple but
when I first heard about AES I don't
know a few years ago and every test box
that sounded so mysterious and I just
didn't understand it but it's the most
easiest thing you can think of it's
literally just a substitution it's just
a defined table of how you substitute
one byte with another byte and obviously
there are some theory behind how this s
box is implemented why specifically this
one is used which I also don't
understand but this is the table so if
you have the input by it to six you
would substitute that one replace that
write with f7 okay so this step can be
reversed
I wrote this also down here on the paper
I note it down that the S box is just
substituting bytes and if you would c39
you can just reverse it back the next
step is the shift rows and shift rows is
what we just had analyzed so this one
function that we've learned about at the
end of last video is just what house
shift roses implement and shift rows as
we know is implemented in this one
function so it's not opera skated or
hidden in there so we are kind of
looking for all the other functions then
mixcolumns this one is probably the most
mathematical step and probably also the
step I have the most problems with
because I
of math but my brain just doesn't work
that well with math so I can look at the
step and I can probably also implement
it and software the step but knowing how
you know like the sbox
okay it's easy to reverse but with these
more complex math operations I don't
have kind of an intuition for is this
reversible or how easy is it reversible
is it just a one-to-one match or is it
do you have to solve kind of an equation
system or whatever like this I have more
issues with mixed columns to be honest
but you know all can be googled these
are all questions that people have kind
of asked already and you find a lot of
resources about each a s step anyway so
you know it's all stuff you can read up
on and then we have another Idi round
key step which is basically the same
thing it also X ORS the key and then it
continues this for multiple rounds of
AES it's not that important and then
comes the last round which is kind of
just like part of the regular round as
well but that one only contains a sub
bytes a shift rows and the eighth round
key it doesn't have a mix columns
anymore what it's not mentioned
especially when you look at the AES
algorithm itself that there's also a key
schedule algorithm so when you look at
the high level description of the
algorithm there's a key expansion the
round keys the keys that are being XOR
to the current 16 bytes state of AES are
actually derived from the original key
and they are using the specific AES key
schedule so this is executed in multiple
rounds so for each round head round key
uses a new different key that is derived
from the original key and you can read
about how this key schedule is
implemented the interesting fact about
this probably for attack reasons which I
at some point learned about is that it's
reversible so if you know the state of
the last ed round key step for example
then you can reverse the key schedule as
well so if we would catch any of those X
ORS at any point in time then we can
just reverse to the key and and get the
original key next I was thinking
how could you hide or obscure these
steps so we have found chef Rose as a
functions but how are the other things
implemented and so I was thinking can
you actually combine certain function of
these in one single function for example
down here we have an ADD round key and
followed by a sub bytes or depending on
how the loop goes so add round key will
always come before a sub bytes and we
know the six or and we don't have a
flexible key anyway so we know each key
in the key schedule right because the
key is like encoded somehow already into
the algorithm itself so for example
these steps could be combined you know
the byte that is coming in and then you
can basically say okay if the byte that
comes in is 12 then we know the result
of what would happen if you XOR it with
the key and then substitute it so you
can implement this with a lookup table
instead of implementing the XOR directly
with an actual XOR instruction you can
make the lookup table right for the exo
itself but also for the combined thing
and this was a big breakthrough for me
the fact that you can use look-up tables
for this let's have a look at the binary
again about those look-up tables
remember this huge function that we saw
let's have a quick overview before we
dig into the assembly so we have a lot
of move instructions a couple of load
effective address instructions here you
just add some values in some shift left
but that's basically it that's all of it
so there's nothing complicated here it's
just moving it around okay it's just
annoying maybe to read so you can also
set a breakpoint here and step through
it and observe what kind of values are
loaded here and obviously that's what I
did so it's you see DB you've set a
breakpoint at this function and use an
input that we would recognize so we
enter the string 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and so
forth ok so we see our trace happening
and there we hit the breakpoint so the
first few lines just load some value
from some address into our CX and RDX
you can see that that value whatever we
load it will be added to the our ax that
we get from here so let's step until the
add so we can see our DX which was
loaded from the
initial value up here and then our ax
from the value here so these get added
together and when we look here now
RDX is an input pointing into our data
that we entered it might not be obvious
but it's in fact what I have written in
the top corner here so this is after the
shift rows step which means shift rows
was already executed but nothing else
happened on our input so this is still
our clear text input that we have
entered so what this tells you is that
at the base point of minus X 50 is the
current AES state which is our still our
input here and our DX in this case is
then all the values that are loaded here
are used as an offset into that state
and this offset is currently 0 so it
gets the first character and then after
that we get a value from baseball 10
minus 20 so we haven't seen that one yet
into our DX and shift left it by 4 and
then we add our CX to it which we loaded
earlier in the beginning here so let's
have a look at these values so our ax is
the character we entered 1 and we add to
it our DX but it's 0 in this case so
nothing changed here and then look at
this interesting move we use our ax so
the value of our character 3x3 1 we use
that as an offset into some data that is
a lookup table right we can examine this
address here as well so these are just
you know random looking data in fact
this is the data that we saw being set
up in the very first video where we
looked into all this data that is being
set up which we didn't know what it is
about so when I discovered this I
thought I obviously got it right so we
know now there is in fact a lookup table
and in the first round the first break
when we hit it still operates on our
clear text input data that we know and
it just like fetches some values from a
huge table so this was the first attack
idea that I had because like we just
discussed we could theoretically hide
some of these steps in a simple lookup
table so I thought if we extract the
value that is being looked up it is
either you know the result of the sbox
or it might be the result of the add
round key step or it might be a
combination of both and all three are
reversible let's make an example we have
here our string 1 as input you know it's
do it for 1 byte we have hex 3 1 let's
say let's say the iPod is 7 3 so if it
were 7 3 and we could check it here and
apparently of what would be a def which
doesn't match our input so it was not s
box probably what was happening then we
could assume it's s box plus at round
key oh it's only at round key if it were
at round key we could just X or but you
know if you do that and you step through
the program and do it for each byte just
wouldn't work right but this was my
first attack idea that I tried out so I
spent a lot of time on just extracting
this kind of values and tried if I can
reverse them that way and I really
thought I figured this out it's easy I
solved it it's just like one of these
reversible things so let's have another
look at my notes what I wrote down here
I just wrote down how the a Tron key
step works like an earlier set you can
combine certain steps and you can also
change the order of certain steps right
basically it doesn't matter if you do
sub bytes first and then shift rows or
if you do shift rows and then sub bytes
right you can just reverse this doesn't
matter and same thing with kind of the
other stuff at least I can design or
implement the algorithm in a way that I
basically mix up these things and then
you know make the lookup tables
accordingly so I was just like you know
playing with this idea so as you can see
I wrote this kind of down I drew this
with these 4 by 4 matrices and I kind of
wanted to look at one byte let's say
this is what the function implements
here what happens if I find this byte
where would that correspond to in the
original key right let's say if that is
3 9 a shift rows would just like move it
a little bit and the sbox
reversing the sbox is easy like I said 3
9 would correspond to 1 2 so and if
death is the result of the XOR between
the text and the key we can use 12 X or
30 and we
get out the key and so I was you know
just exploring how would signal bytes
change during AAS and you know what
parts can I reverse and so I figured
maybe these steps together could also be
kind of combined so I was also thinking
to do the shift rows before you do the
add round key step you obviously have to
just you know you can also just apply
show flows to the key itself you
basically do the same there and then you
know the correct by this again ex-ored
with the key so I was thinking about
just different ways how you can mix up
the algorithm and change orders and
stuff and this is how I spent a lot of
time I was just assuming okay the output
I see is the state here in order to
reverse now and get back to the key what
steps do I have to do okay didn't work
so let's assume the output was from this
step here what do I have to do to
reverse it or the output was from this
step here let's try to reverse it but it
didn't work I never got you know the key
this way but I also felt I was really
really close again I guess I was so deep
in it already I spent so much time on it
I was sure that it was just you know a
few steps away then I decided to spend a
little bit more time on the look-up
tables what we just learned is that
these moves are the lookup tables right
so basically what I did I was just going
through this huge function and
specifically looking at these lookups
what is the index that is used in the
lookup table in this case are ax and
what is the result what is being looked
up from right so I was just writing the
stone if this is our input text that we
want to encrypt this is basically what
you saw in in gdb after the shift row
step first you remember we use some
index to get you know one of the
characters in here and it was just zero
but if you would step through this you
would see that it's looping slowly up so
in the first one it was to zero just now
but if you go you know a next iteration
if you look how this is implemented you
would see this awesome with the next
column so we get the first value three
one you saw that but when you use now
the three one in the lookup table we get
a 32 byte value which is kind of odd
right we would expect if it's a simple
by lookup thing with the result
would also be one bite but you can't
imagine that it could also be just
masked you know it's kind of like odd
offsets and you always take like the
bite here or something that but then you
continue in that huge function and then
you reach the next look at where it
takes the next character from your
column which is six which then in hex is
three six and then you add hex one zero
zero to it you make it one three six and
then with a is obviously for one you get
two for one Dead is used in lookup table
and you get all these these for 32-bit
values that correspond to the input text
and that is the first part of the huge
function but that was not all of it so
when I was stepping through I realized
oh there's a lot more happening so then
you take the third to buy it result from
you know the first character and you end
it with just a nibble with F and you get
the last nibble here so you get the zero
here and then from the second character
you got the thing second 32-bit value
you also take an F and you get out three
because you know the last bite the last
nibble here is also three and then you
combine these two so you don't see it
really here with a zero but the zero is
in the front and the three is three is
in the back it's better visible here
with the other two characters a and F
where you also you know take F the last
nibble so four and one four and one and
you combine them together two for one so
you get these intermediate values and
basically you do this then again but
this time you shift the study to byte
value by four so you you know you kind
of cancel out the last nibble now the
seven is the last value here and so you
get seven and the D and combine it then
you get the E and D F and combine it
right so you get these intermediate
bytes then you use these for another
look up at this table with this address
here and you get another value so the
first so zero three produced
coincidentally also zero three so maybe
not coincident I don't know and then the
four one produced five and you notice
that these again are just one nibble and
here the results of these lookups are a
one and these are again combined
together three and five and a and one
and then you use these again for a
lookup and you get six and B and combine
these together and this is the final
result this will be the first byte and
this is basically what the huge function
is doing ensuing this lookups I was
trying for the longest time reversing
the result bytes here to the original
state because I assumed this is the
result of sub by its mix columns in that
round key and it just didn't work I just
couldn't find the solution I spend so
much time on it and I constantly assume
that must be the solution so I kind of
tried to brute-force this you know I
thought it's just a combination of kind
of these things so here is a lookup
table to perform the sbox of
substitution here's the inverse of it so
that will just reverse it and then we
have some values here to perform the
inverse of mix columns to inverse that
as well and then I also thought maybe
you know maybe there's some random XOR
in there some random blinding or so so I
defined a few functions I kind of used
the intermediate values that I extracted
and just you know try different
combinations of all of these things
let's try mix columns together with sbox
that's right inverse mix columns with
the sbox inverse you know and you know I
using all these different kind of
combinations that I thought I don't know
which is the right thing you know this
blows my brain I can't think can't
concentrate any more I spend so much
time on this it must be one of these
combination and obviously wasn't you
know I was not able to reverse this
state so so I was kind of getting
nowhere here and was not really able to
figure out the meaning of a lot of these
these values like I didn't understand
what these look-up tables actually
implement because I was so sure that I
you know could reverse the AES algorithm
based on this but it kind of didn't work
out so I thought let's look a little bit
more closely at the lookup table values
and see if we can somehow you know
understand the meaning of these things
so here's the basic the same thing again
just displayed as a graph
differently so the first character one
is used in a lookup table and you get
these 32-bit values and the character
six issues and you get these 32 byte
value and a and the fourth so these are
then this is the first lookup table
resolve those used and then you remember
that you take only these nibbles combine
them together and use this as a lookup
to look up another nibble and combine
two nibbles again in one bite and use it
as a lookup for this value and then the
end result is you get again two nibbles
that you combine to be six in this case
and then that is the result that you use
I was looking at this and try to figure
out what what does this mean like what
is the result of the first look up here
these bytes this 3/5 that is coming out
what is the meaning here like I
mentioned very early the holy grail
would be to find the 8th round key step
with the XOR so I was looking for is one
of these steps here an X or an XOR
result that could be our add round key
step right and so I was looking at these
values and try to XOR them is this maybe
the XOR result of these two values so
it's typing this in to brighten hex 0 3
X or 4 1 and the result is not 3 5 ok so
this was also kind of leading nowhere I
just couldn't really understand the
look-up tables but I wanted to mention
this because after the challenge when I
was chatting with somebody about these
implementation of the look-up tables
there was in fact an XOR happening that
I just didn't see it's a bit more hidden
I was looking at this so much and I did
not figure out that here is actually an
X or lookup happening maybe you take a
second and you just pause the video and
try to figure out where there is an XOR
happening 3 5 is in fact an XOR result
it just didn't happen as I was thinking
it would happen because the XOR is
happening between 0 4 &amp;amp; 3 1 so there was
in fact an XOR I was just too blind to
see it but that wouldn't really have
helped me right I assumed this could be
an XOR result and then I tried to
reverse
at round key and whatever and it didn't
work but I just found this interesting
that I was looking at and was staring at
this so much trying to find you know
meaning behind this and there was in
fact an XOR result now I spend so much
time on this and it just led nowhere I
wrote these brute-force scripts I tried
to you know understand how mixcolumns
works try to reverse certain steps and
it just didn't work and it fairly early
already dawned on me that it's not that
simple that they actually implement some
stuff to hide the actual result
calculations why I thought this is
actually related to RS a because this is
where I first encountered this and it as
a concept it kind of stuck with me and
it's kind of these interesting things
that are super logical but at least I
never thought of them myself and this is
the concept of blinding a calculation
blinding techniques also have
applications to prevent side-channel
attacks on encryption devices so the
first time I heard about this was in a
hardware a tech course at university
talking about RSA I don't want to go too
much into this now how RSA blinding
works but if you just look at the
equation here generally if you want to
encrypt something in RSA you would take
the plaintext and raise this to the
power e modulo n but in this case you
actually multiply the plaintext with a
random integer R before you do that and
at first it sounds like RSA would then
produce something completely ridiculous
right if you multiply the plaintext
first with another value it just
completely come become screwed up but
the trick is then later that you can
unblind it again that you can remove
this multiplication by r and reverse
this and suddenly you get their intended
value back how this works you know we
don't want to get into this but the idea
is that you can do something to a value
that only you know about then you
perform your actions in kind of an
untrusted environment that could leak
that an attacker could see and in the
end you unblind it again and you still
get the correct results and so in our
case we can imagine that sure our
plaintext goes in but then all the
operations are blinded was kind of some
kind of
secret that we don't really know about
and then just before the output is
happening they unblind it so all the
intermediate steps and values that we
have are useless to us without knowing
how the blinding was implemented and
this is also kind of where then gave up
I felt like the Beast was too big for me
I spent already so much time on this and
I would have to read the papers and I
was already like burned out of this
challenge and I was scared if I would
just now try to push myself and continue
I would just get so stressed and would
lose all motivation for the challenge so
I decided okay it's good now I spent a
lot of time on this I learned hell of a
lot during this one I never understood a
as to the level I'm understanding it now
and so I'm super happy with my personal
learning results even though I'm really
frustrated with this challenge now so I
decided because I heard that there
exists a simple tool that can perform an
attack on this which I don't have to
understand but the tool just somehow
works to get the result to get the flag
and you know and then basically that's
