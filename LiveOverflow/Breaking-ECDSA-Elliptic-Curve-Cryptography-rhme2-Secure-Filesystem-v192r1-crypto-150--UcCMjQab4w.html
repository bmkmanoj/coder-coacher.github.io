competition was a secure file system
which we exploited with a hash length
extension attack and then we also solve
this other cryptid challenge key server
which was about breaking RSA signatures
so let's continue the path and do the
last crypto challenge I wonder what we
will have to break this time
crypto 150 points secure file system
version 1.9 - our one death version
number is already suspicious but let's
read the description first after the
horrible debacle of the first thought
system we got together again invited our
friend mr. vodka and waterproof the
secure file system we can test it again
but this time it uses unbreakable
encryption the file system allows you to
request the content of one or more
available files by using the following
format which is basically the same like
in the previous file system challenge
token then a hash symbol followed by one
or multiple file names and we get a list
of example tokens and foundlings here's
how it looks like when you run the
challenge you get the list of files and
if you supply the correct token found
them you get the content back and
somehow we want to read passwd before I
tell you the solution
let me explain my thought process here
because I went into a complete wrong
direction at first and somebody on IRC
had to nudge me into the correct
direction I completely failed this
challenge so first I had a look at the
version number that seemed too specific
to not be a hint and it could have led
me to the correct solution right away
but I got distracted by the list of
examples because there we can
immediately notice that the first part
of it is always the same which I
interpreted to be some kind of block
cipher and I thought the first block
always encrypted the same secret key or
something similarly how the bad-hair
implementation repented a secret key in
the first level and the version number
for me became the bit length of the
cipher the text said it's a strong
encryption so I went to look for ciphers
with 192 bit options and mostly looked
into a EAS but all attempts of
manipulating blocks for example for
padding Oracle didn't work another lead
I had was a waterproof filesystem I
think it may be some kind of whirlpool
hash but it also didn't make much sense
then maybe it had to do with vodka
maybe there's a Russian cryptographer
named Gorbachev with some weird obscure
corruption but everything I try just
didn't seem to be the right path I kept
running in circles and really wanted to
give up then I got a slight hint to
focus more on the version number again
and when I did find hints to elliptic
curve cryptography when googling for the
version number before I ignored them
that was a mistake it turns out 192 r1
is a curve parameter for ECB it's a
elliptic curve digital signature
algorithm okay so I know this elliptic
curve stuff exists but I never really
looked into it as much as I should have
while RSA seems pretty straightforward
the stuff always seems a lot more
difficult to understand so I started to
read Wikipedia and there's even a
section called security where they say
that Sony didn't properly implement the
algorithm on their PlayStation 3 because
one of the variables K was static
instead of random and apparently it
means you can break the signature so
let's have a quick look at the algorithm
and math itself so the private key is an
integer randomly selected and the public
key is the result of some fancy elliptic
curve multiplication you hash the
message you want to sign like with RSA
and then you have to select a random K
and it must be securely random then you
calculate a point on the curve based on
that number then you do some more
calculations and you get R and s and the
signature is the pair of R and s so when
we look at our example tones we can
assume that those are the two different
values R and s and R is always the same
which are suspicious if you look what R
is then R is basically X and X is the x
coordinate of the point on the curve
after the lip to curve multiplication
with the secure random K this means for
every signature the multiplication has
the same result which means K was
probably the same boom that's it instead
of note it is crucial to select
different K for different signatures
otherwise the equation step 6
can be solved for the private
be given two signatures RS and RS prime
employing the same unknown K for
different known messages the attacker
can calculate some fancy stuff and
recover K and then you can solve this
equation for the private key D done I'm
not very good in math but I knew that
this is such a basic security issue that
I'm sure this came up in some CTF
competitions before and surely somebody
implemented this calculation Python
already that is generally a good hint
for CTF
so I googled specifically for CTF
jungles with ECB s a and sure enough I
find some example code I can just copy
that code but I also wanted to
understand what it does so let's do it
step-by-step let's start by getting
ECDSA python module because we might
reuse some functions and in the end I
use it to create a proper signature for
the filename we want let's copy two of
the example tokens and messages and
extract the values so we got R and s
from the first message and R and s from
the second message then I try to follow
the Wikipedia article so first we check
the two R and s if those two signatures
are vulnerable then I want to prepare
most of the values as I need them first
I hash the message we want to sign and
convert it to a number so we can do
calculations with it which is said 1 and
Z 2 then we need n n is the order of the
curve so we can get that value from the
module to find that I just look around
in the source code of the ECDSA module
next we got to recover K like it says
here on Wikipedia the first part is
simply z1 minus z2 so this is basically
just the hash of message 1 minus message
2 divided by the subtraction of the
signature and because you all got some
basic math education you know that
instead of division you can also
multiply the inverse like 6 divided by 3
is the same as 6 times 1/3 so we just
multiply the inverse of s 1 minus s 2
and we can reuse the inverse module
a function from the ECDSA module
everything happens here
always modulo the end okay now we got
the K so next we recover the private key
da which is super simple it's just a
signature times K minus the hash divided
by R and there we have it
K and the private key recovered now we
just have to figure out how to plug this
into Python ECDSA to sign a value for us
again I just look at the source code of
the module find the correct classes and
to test this I'm going to assign a
message which we know the signature and
print the original and the calculated
signature this looks perfect now let's
sign passwd so we can get the flag copy
the signature send it to the board and
we get the flag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
