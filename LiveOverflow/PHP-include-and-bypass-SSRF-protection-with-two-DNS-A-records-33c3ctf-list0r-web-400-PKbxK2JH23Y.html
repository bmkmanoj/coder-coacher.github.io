former point web cherish so it should be
really really hard though we got lucky
because as far as I know all web
challenges were broken in various ways
and had way easier solutions than
planned the description doesn't give us
a lot of information just that it's some
web app to manage lists
so let's have a look at it
generally for web testing it's a good
idea to use an HTTP proxy to analyze
requests using browser developer tools
also works but programs like fiddler for
windows or burp offer a lot of
convenience so I set up Firefox to use a
proxy and start burp now we see all
browser requests in there so here's the
landing page board in life create some
lists whoa okay cool
first you need an account to log in so
you register one you can check the board
history and see the HTTP requests like
the register post requests that send the
form data we can already see that
generally the page seems to not use
single PHP files but uses a get
parameter page to decide the
functionality so let's look in and we
can create some lists like with the
ho-ho-ho challenge before I didn't work
on this at this point so others from the
team started to analyze the
functionality play around with the forms
maybe tried some XSS or SQL injection
but one interesting functionality seems
to be the profile edit page because here
you can supply a URL to upload a picture
that smells like server side request
forgery
you can use a service like request bin
to see the HTTP requests issued by the
web application so we use the request
been tracking URL and enter it into the
Avatar you RL field and then we can see
the HTTP request but nothing special
here no flag sent along the request or
anything but we know that there might be
a server-side request forgery we can
also now use burp to explore that a
little bit more we can do a right-click
Center repeater and now we can modify
the raw HTTP request and resend it this
allows us to play with the request that
will trigger the server-side request
forgery you can for example drive you
can use the fire protocol to ligue local
files but that doesn't work you can try
to bypass the check for a host but
nothing really yields but we keep that
part in mind it's probably here for a
reason next up was to test the page
parameter maybe it uses the parameter to
include arbitrary files
we don't specify that dot php' at the
end so if it's a simple include it would
append dot php' to it and Inaba to
bypass that is not a thing anymore in
2017
Nullah by its only work in old PHP
versions so whatever we include must end
in dot PHP a common thing to check for
our PHP filter wrappers it's a snippet
you can keep around you can resource the
exact features on that yourself but what
we will use is a PHP filter to convert
something to base64 and what file is
converted as specified by the resource
parameter so if this works it should
open the index dot PHP file converted to
base64 and pass that to the include and
that works
see this big base 64 chunk we can decode
it and get the PHP code from index of
PHP and here you can see the vulnerable
include now we can start to dump more
code for example the function sub PHP
and header.php file and the functions
dot PHP file we find this get contents
function which takes a URL and is
probably the part that fetches the image
in the profile well somewhere exploring
the sources another guy realized that
the login is broken you can simply log
in as any user without a password we
thought that was part of the challenge
but turns out this was also a mistake
you shouldn't have been able to log in
as admin this way but this quickly
revealed a secret URL which is only
accessible from localhost and this is
where now the server site request
forgery comes into play if we can abuse
the image URL upload and request that
path we get the URL so let's review the
PHP code again we can see here several
URL checks first it decodes the URL and
checks for a host if you use the domain
it will query the DNS over for the IP
and verify that you don't try to access
stuff like localhost dand and then it
uses curl to perform the request for us
it was very suspicious to see the option
to enable all protocols except violence
SCP file would obviously allow to load
local files and SCP can also be used to
work with local or
remote files the list of apps core
protocol supported as long we didn't
have much experience with them but we
had a hunch that the trick lies in there
though well that turned out to be the
part of the intended solution we found
like many other teams a much easier one
and the issue lies in the last option
line the comment says no DNS rebinding
please the option should enable that a
certain domain resolves to a specific IP
remember that up here the domain was
resolved to an IP and then verified that
it's not localhost in a DNS rebinding
attack you would abuse a time of check
time of use race where this check would
resolve the domain to a valid IP and
quickly change the DNS record and when
cold and tries to open their URL further
down it now points to localhost and that
option is supposed to prevent that it
would force a domain to be resolved to
the original IP from earlier and ignore
any DNS server changes I joined the
challenge around this time here and help
testing extracted the part that requests
the image and put it in a simple test
script edit some additional debugging
output and so forth so that I can
quickly test stuff and we can play
around with it now for example when we
try to query local host PHP will parse
the URL and perform this test and
eventually stops but and notice that
when I try to query my website that the
DNS entry for my domain returns two
entries the DNS server advertises two
IPS for this domain and the PHP code
just uses the first entry this will come
in handy in a second but first another
idea we also played around with a
partial differential in curl and PHP for
example we found this year when we place
IP and port in front of the domain with
a question mark and add parse URL from
PHP we'll think that the IP is a user
name and port question mark in the
password because those are separated by
a colon in front of the domain with AD
and thus the DNS query will interpret
life overflow com to be the host name
but
curl on the other hand sees the question
mark and think that here the get
parameters will start and the host is of
then localhost one two seven zero zero
one and it really does querying on
localhost we bypassed it but the issue
is that we can specify any path we can
only get a request out for the top route
path so no luck forgetting the flag
though I'm pretty sure if you spend more
time on this you'll figure out a better
bypass anyway I trusted the challenge
honor that the DNS rebinding was
implemented properly even though I saw
the warning that I couldn't pass a
resolved option I'm such naive idiot
after an hour or so of playing with this
a friend reminded me again hey did you
see that DNS rebinding option doesn't
work the syntax is wrong and I was like
oh why did I ignore this for so
long and yeah it turned out to be
another unintended back which allows an
easier solution and here's where we get
back to the fact that it in s entry can
return to IPs I set up a domain DNS
rebinding to return to IPS eight eight
eight eight and localhost in the same
way how life overflow Isetta so when we
now use the domain and request the image
from that domain it might get the
localhost as a response and give you an
arrow but when you try it again it might
now get the valid IP first and ko will
use localhost and this will successfully
request that path and give us the flag
lessons learned for me don't ignore
warnings and look into the Gopher
protocol because that was apparently the
way to fake an HTTP request and query
the flag no idea how to get access to
the admin list entry with a secret path
though I have to read some write-ups I
hope you will do the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
