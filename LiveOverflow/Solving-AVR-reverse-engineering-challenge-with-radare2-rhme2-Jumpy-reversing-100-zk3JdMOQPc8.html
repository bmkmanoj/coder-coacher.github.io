challenge in the desert of reversing
called jumpy if you haven't seen the
last video you really should watch it
because we are about to read a lot of a
VR assembler and we have to understand
the AVR architecture a little bit
the description reads we really need
access to this lab protected with an
auto enol based access control system
our operatives obtain to flash them from
a non personalized engineering sample
but we are having trouble reverse
engineering it that's great so as we
know d/dx binaries we flash into the
board of personalized or rather
encrypted so you can't disassemble them
but this challenge gives us a jumpy that
bin file which presumably is a non
personalized version so not encrypted I
also wonder what the name jumpy could
mean will the program jump around a lot
to obfuscate what the password is or
does it mean we have to use a jumper on
some of the pins of the Arduino well we
will figure it out eventually so let's
load the challenge onto the board and
connect to it via screen we are
presented with an input prompt and when
we send some data it says better luck
next time next we have a first look at
the bin file with file we see that it's
not a standard executable file format
like else so it's probably basically a
raw dump of the memory we can also
quickly check with the strings command
if the correct input password is simply
embedded in it I had a little bit of
hope for only 100 points but it turns
out it's not in there the next steps I
will present look like a head
straightforward plan but in reality what
followed were hours over hours of
looking at stuff all over the place
trying to understand the spidery and
there was a lot of frustration it was
the first time ever I had to reverse
engineer AVR and especially such role of
the hardware stuff so let me give you a
short list what I set up and explored
and afterwards that tell you how I
automatically solved it first of us
looking into how I could debug this
because static analysis is always a bit
harder if you don't know what to look
for and I quickly found Tim ABR and
installed ed and try to run the binary
it took some time to understand how I
can run it ran into some issues with
setting the frequency and the
floating-point exception that I had to
track down but in the end I figured out
how to use the sim Duino example which
basically simulates an Arduino board so
that's perfect to use that I had to
convert the binary file to an Intel hex
format like the other winner would
expect and then I could actually execute
it it all
gdb server you can attach to with gdb
but it has to be a special AVR gdb build
included in the new AVR toolchain with
sim a VR you can also use Pico Chrome to
interact with the simulated you arterial
interface but there were counters of
issues more about that soon I also
checked out the binary with Ida
luckily my Ida license can just assemble
a VR but if you look at the addresses
they increment by one even though the op
codes are actually two bytes you see
that here the real address so this was
quite annoying to cross-reference with
the debugging in gdb because I like
binary image I also installed a plug-in
somebody wrote for AVR because it's not
supported by default and it also kind of
works at least it displays the addresses
so I can work with them but it's a very
basic plug-in it doesn't identify a lot
of functions also doesn't really
understand the interrupt table at the
beginning by the way this year is an
interrupt table it's easy to get because
it's just a big list of jumps to
somewhere else and we can read in the
data sheet which address is which
interrupt so for example when the board
is reset or turned on the execution will
start at zero but you can have other
interrupts triggered for example from a
timer very typical for an embedded
system anyhow while I used all these
tools during my exploration phase and
experimented with them in the end I use
radare I want to emphasize again before
I walk you through the solution I had a
lot of frustration with this it will
look kind of easy but I don't even know
how many hours and days I spent on
learning AVR and getting things like so
maybe are running so don't be
discouraged when you tackle a new
platform or cts change where you get
stuck and have no idea what to do I
didn't have any idea either but the
satisfaction in the end from finally
solving it after working so hard is
worth it so here's basically my line of
thinking after I started to understand
AVR disassembly and also generally the
hardware platform this challenge wants
you to input a password over serial and
last video we have learned how that
works on the lower level this means we
want to look for locations where this
special address c6 is written to or read
from because this is where finger
characters from the zero interface
we'll be handled we can open jumpy with
Rodari to tell it that it is a VR and
then analyze it with a a with P capital
D we can print this assembly for a
specific length so we can simply print
the disassembly of the whole binary and
use the tilt which is basically just
grabbed to fill the lines that do
something with c6 and we find here two
lines that load that address into
register R 24 let's have a look at these
two locations the first one is at hex ei
so we can print the disassembly of the
function this address belongs to with
PDF or we can also show a graph view
with BB at that location but I will
stick with the linear view for now we
can also enable a central description as
comments which are so helpful for
reading ABL for the first time so here
you can see that hex e6 is moved into
our 24 and that's it doesn't load from
that address it just loads the value
into that register here's another weird
AVR thing that took a bit until I
realized that the value in our 24 is
moved into register 30 so now that
register contains 3 6 and then whatever
value is in register 18 is moved or
stored into the memory location
referenced by zet we can check the
datasheet of the atmega again and read
up about general-purpose registers and
we learn that that is simply referring
to register 30 and register 31 combined
and 30 contains c6
so whatever is in register 18 will be
written into the UART buffer register
and sent out by a serial so this is the
location where one character is sent to
your computer those registers XYZ make
this so annoying to read until you can
memorize which registers they refer to
anyhow let's check out the other
location here we can basically see the
same c6 is loaded into wretches of 24
which is then loaded into a register of
30 which is then used in the load in
direct instruction to load the byte that
is contained in the Z row buffer so this
is where our input is read we can also
follow the cross-reference which calls
this function and find
here where if we look at the graph see
that it apparently checks if the
character is a carriage return or a
newline and if not we'll read the next
character cool so that function seems to
read the input line so the password
check can't be far away but the issue is
this function doesn't have any X rest so
no idea where this is coming from or
where execution will go after it returns
so now I choose to debug this with gdb
and say maybe our first eye starts to
maybe our or to be more precise a
similar we know example and use jumpy in
the converter text format
this will also spawn a gdb server so now
I can use the AVR gdb to connect to the
server and we can see that execution is
still waiting at the start we can now
set a breakpoint at to be a which is
just before loading the value from the
serial buffer
I can then use Pico come to simulate
zero input and type a capital a which
will trigger the breakpoint here slowly
stepping forward and I see the for one
which is our character a so that works
well not really
this is buggy as it turns out after
reading the first character it will
continue reading some rubbish in
infinite loop and I couldn't figure out
why if I would send a newline
immediately it would read that and
continue but it couldn't enter any more
data at this point thank you so much
were new from IRC that person created an
issue on sim AVR and explained it turns
out there's a bug where the emulator
doesn't reset the flags that indicate
new data arrived that it constantly
things that the serial buffer is full
and reads from it this patch sources so
modifying the sources of them AVR
recompiling it and now it works like a
charm now we can actually enter a longer
string so the breakpoint I have set here
is immediately after reading the next
character so we can see that I enter the
alphabet ABCDE F and so forth we can
continue until we read the carriage
return from pressing enter now we can
carefully sing-off that forward we go
past a check for a carriage return and
return from this function so where are
we returning
- turns out red Daria did not find this
function but that's not a problem we can
define a new one here when we look at
the graph view we can immediately see a
loop and when the loop is done it
compares with a XD I step through this
and it turns out it's basically counting
the amount of characters of our input
string so I simply need 13 characters
for our input if we look at what happens
if this compare succeeds or fails we see
that when it fails it will load a value
from SRAM performance or on it meaning
that it will definitely set a 1 there
and then write this value back in the
case of compare would have been okay it
would not do that
I didn't immediately catch it when I
first looked at this but afterwards it's
pretty clear that this will set an error
flag basically if you do something wrong
with your input it will set that flag
and you failed but even though our input
will clearly fail eventually we can step
further and see where the function will
return too
and it turns out what is the price it's
also not a function radar to identify
we can immediately see that there is
also compare that looks pretty much like
the one from before if the compare fails
we set the arrow flag and if we debug
this step by step we can see that this s
from location 1 3 5 &amp;amp; 1 3 6 loads the
letters H and I then adds the ASCII
value together and compares the result
with T 3 and this is our first big
breakthrough on how the password is
checked if you continue this path you
will find more and more functions like
this all of those take two characters
add them together and check the result
there are many same functions just with
different character offsets and when you
keep stepping you also find the second
kind of these which multiply the S key
values of two characters otherwise it's
the same it checks the result of the
multiplication so first step is to find
all these blocks which I did by printing
a linear disassembly from the whole
binary copy it into sublime and used an
ugly huge rags to find all the functions
that have this pattern of loading two
values into our 24 then a copy them into
a new file and start cleaning them up
until I have the important pieces
extracted basically we now know all the
rules these two characters have to have
this sum these two characters have to
have this sum these two characters
multiplied hence this result and so
forth a super easy and perfect tool to
solve this is using an SMT solver like
step three I won't go into much detail
as the video is already super long but
basically I just write a couple of
constraints that express exactly that
logic the variable values represent our
input character array and I say the sum
of character seven and character eight
has to be be three the multiplication of
character four and five has to be hex
one to 2f
I write it all down and let's set three
solve this puzzle for me and I get the
string that follows all these rules give
it to me wow I was so happy when that
popped up I connected to the board sent
the password
and I get the flag another 100 points
Dan does one other point Jones was
really hard for me I don't even want to
know how hard a 300 point challenges
