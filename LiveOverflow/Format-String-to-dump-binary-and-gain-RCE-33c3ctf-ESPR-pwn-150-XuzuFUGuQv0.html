live by the name of the collective that
organized the 33 c3 CTF and the name
offer in my opinion very creative
challenge it's an easy challenge but I
think its simplicity and theme just is
an amazing combination I don't know it's
something I can totally geek out about
but let's have a look at it and I hope
you understand what I mean ESP are short
for eat sleep bone repeat is a 150
points Ponyville instead of providing as
a binary we have to exploit we get a big
picture of a t-shirt and the server IP
and port to connect to so we are
basically blind we have to develop a
remote exploit without having the binary
I saw the assembly on the t-shirt but I
kind of entrust it to be that simple but
when we connect to the servers and
interact with it it quickly becomes
clear that that is what it does it waits
for input if you enter something it will
wait for a second and then print again
what you entered and that in a loop
exactly what the t-shirt showed the each
square cos gets to read input the sleep
block cause sleep for one second the
pone block cause printf which is a hint
that we can use that to exploit this
program and then we have a repeat block
that simply jumps back to eat isn't this
cool they realized that the team name
can be expressed in a simple exploitable
CTF challenge I have some stickers from
them here and you can see that they like
to play with those four squares and the
words asleep on repeat and now this it's
just awesome on so many levels
I mentioned that I distrusted the
t-shirt print at first but it was clear
that it's a form of string one ability
because I haven't looked at the assembly
yet I used percentage P to print a stack
value as a pointer which will quickly
reveal if it's a 32 or 64-bit binary and
as we can see the address of our typical
7f 64-bit addresses so we have a 64-bit
system if I had looked at the assembly I
would have noticed the our registers
like RSP which means 64-bit anyway if we
enter some input with known characters
like
ay-ay-ay in the news percentage p2
leaked values from the stick we can
quickly find the offset of the stick to
our input so the A's are the sixth value
on the stick this becomes important for
when we start to leak all right values
to an address replace on the stick if
you are new to format strain exploits go
check out my format string video in the
binary hacking course because I will not
explain this here now let's start
writing some code first we create a
socket and connect to the remote server
and create a function read until which
will read one byte from the socket until
it finds the message we expect the first
thing I want to build is a memory leak I
don't know yet where I want to write
what and I probably want to know the
Lipsy version as well to do all this I
need a read arbitrary memory primitive
which we can build with printf I will
create a function called dump that
function will construct the format
string that will read some memory but
first a bit of debugging the first
string starts with the address you want
to read from earlier in our test this
were the AAA then in pipes just to
easily recognize the leak values we can
use the format percentage $6 which means
it refers to the sixth value on the
stack then we can use P to print as a
pointer or s to interpret as a string I
keep it variable for debugging I also
add a unique string ERF espr
which will be printed and I can use it
to read until that string
quick test with some normal values if we
place them at the correct offset on the
stack and we are able to print them with
percentage P okay there works if you
would replace the percentage P with
percentage s then this address would be
interpreted as the location of a string
and we would get some raw binary string
return or in this case of this invalid
address it would cause a crash but what
address do we want to leak
my first hope was that the binary might
not use a SLR which means it will be
loaded at a default based address I
don't remember exactly which address but
simply opening another 64-bit binary we
can quickly figure that out but when we
try to dump memory from this address it
doesn't work and it dawned on me that
the address contains null bytes and
obviously printf will stop at a null
byte this means we have to move the
address at the back of the string
because gates will read a nobody and
place it on a stick just printf would
stop printing there but now the stack
offset would be Vera but depending on
the crap before but we can solve that by
always having a fixed length of the crap
before we can simply use al just to add
padding to a fixed size doing it this
way we can successfully leak memory from
this address a little bit of trial and
error to adjust the offsets and padding
length so we hit the address correctly
so seems correct now we can print the
address for 0 0 0 from the stack so now
we can change percentage P to percentage
s to interpret this value as an address
location of a string
and our league Prince elf this is
perfect because if you look at the first
bytes of a binary it starts with elf so
this means their league works the binary
is loaded at the default address now we
just need to figure out the next step of
the plan we somehow need to find the
global offset table because there we
have the address tulip C which we can
leak to calculate offsets to for example
system and also we need that location to
override an entry and we are a code
execution I actually didn't realize that
location is also fixed without a SLR so
I could have just used another binary
again and look up the address but what I
did was I wrote code that leaks the
whole binary
basically I created a loop and start at
the known address for zero something and
then and leak the bytes of that address
a pen - no bye - the leak because every
string ends with a null but if there
were no now but printf would have
printed more until it hits a null byte
and then I moved the address forward
based on the length of what I leaked and
all those raw binary values are then
written into a file dump the draw I also
added a debug output to see the leaked
bytes but when I run it I quickly
noticed that it read the elf header
twice which is wrong but looking closely
I noticed that the address contained a
hex a which is newline and that stops
gets gets replaces this with a null byte
and then the address becomes four zero
zero something again so I had a simple
check that if a new line is in the
address I attempt to leak I simply
ignore it which will write a null byte
at its place and move the address one
further this means that if there was an
actual important value I would not get
it
so the resulting binary might be
slightly corrupted but overall it should
hopefully give enough information had to
fix a small issue in the code because I
was overwriting the dumb file with every
leak instead of appending
but then it works with watch we can look
at the hex dump of the file every two
seconds and see it slowly growing cool
now let's lean back grab a club matter
and chill after a while I decided to
check if I can open the dump with a
disassembler and it worked so this is
start and the first argument here in
start is the main function so we can
define this to be code and here we have
our eat sleep upon repeat awesome so it
even recognize the symbols from the
global offset table so we know now the
addresses of those functions with a
little bit of code we can now leak those
addresses so fast forward skip then
basically we just have to convert the
raw byte string to a proper number and
add some debug output when we leak these
addresses multiple times we see that
they change which is normal in system
with a saw but the past by its tone this
is because binaries are usually loaded
fairly aligned which means
the base address will have a couple of
zeros at the end so these lower numbers
here are the offset inside of the
obscene this means if we had a lot of
Lipsey's like a Lipsy database we could
look for all Lipsey's where gets is this
particular offset and as finding the
Lipsy used here alternatively we could
also use this primitive to slowly dump
the system ab c-- luckily one member of
each sleep on repeat niklas B has such a
lousy database or to be more precise
some code that can do the searching for
us so we clone the repository and
execute get which will download a lot of
common Lipsey's and extract the symbols
and offsets on OS X you have to tweak it
a bit to get it to run you need the
binutils and also rename some tools but
then it works
then we can use fine to find the symbol
names and offsets which then identifies
the Lipsy that shares those values so
now we found Lipsy we can open that lip
see in a disassembler and find the real
offsets of those functions and with the
real offsets we can now calculate the
ellipse e-base address from the leaked
addresses and knowing the offset to
system we can calculate the address of
the system function now two things are
left first we have to think about which
g OT entry we want to all right with an
address of system in a second how do we
do that
our code is really small so there's not
much choice but printf is definitely the
best candidate because system expects a
string as an argument to execute and
there's only one function here that also
takes one string to do with something
that is printf so if printf were to be
replaced with system we would read an
input string the program would sleep for
one second then call system on that
string and repeat we would get a nice
shell so now we know what value we want
to write to what address but how do we
do that the g.od entry for printf
already contains a Lipsy address so a
lot of bytes are already correct we just
have to overwrite these lower ones here
with the correct offset just a note be
careful which leaked address you used to
calculate offsets because some functions
are weird and how implemented in some
with plays and I don't really know why
it happens but printf is an example bad
address you can see that Lipsy basic
calculate is wrong we expected some
zeros here so gets in this case is more
stable now we make our format string
exploit plan we want to all right printf
so we can start out by printing the
current printf g OT address and at the
end we print it again to verify we have
all written it in between we override
byte by byte with percentage n or to be
more precise with percentage HH n which
will only override one byte each byte
right will do two formats the first one
just prints of variable length value
which we can use to write the correct
value with percentage n remember that
percentage
and we'll write the number of characters
printed to an address so we want for
example a percentage text to print some
unimportant value but use the width
modifier to tell printf how much padding
we want using this number we can play
with how many characters should be
printed and thus what values should be
written with percentage Ahn at the end
we place our addresses where we want to
write the 1 by 2 so at print F G ot and
at offset plus 1 plus 2 and we will see
how much we need ok
so this is now a tedious part it
requires some trial and error but we
always print the current G ot entry at
the end as we can verify what we have
all written in this case the value to
write is actually dynamic depending on
the leaked Lipsy address which means we
have to use the calculated system
address and increase the length
accordingly again just try an arrow a
bit with adding and subtracting offsets
in the end I get the math right and I
write the correct value to the global
offset table and once we get the correct
value we can then add the telnet
interact snippet and then run the
exploit the exploit will leak now Lipsy
addresses create a foreman string
dynamically to override the GRT and
refer printf with the address of system
and then hand over input output to the
talent lip and now every time printf is
executed on the server it will actually
execute system so we can simply type
system commands and get back the result
and here's the flag first here's your
challenge I don't know but I want that
