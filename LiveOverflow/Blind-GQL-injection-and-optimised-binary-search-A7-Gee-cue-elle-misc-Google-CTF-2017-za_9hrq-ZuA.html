combines a database query injection with
optimizing the algorithm to perform the
attack
so also partially a programming or
computer science challenge when I first
read the title I mispronounced it as DQ
ala so a mod German pronunciation and I
totally didn't get what it tried to hint
at but more about it later let's get
started
a 7ki qlae we installed a fancy
automatic attack protection system to be
more secured against automated a text
from robots and hackers so it can be
fully a7 compliant and a hint with
Yamoto so the first thing I did was look
up a7 again because of the fully a7
compliant comment I immediately thought
it's probably that Oh West thing so what
is it again
it was top 10 a7 insufficient attack
protection oh that thing what a
item on the OS + if you want to read
about some info SEC drama search for a7
controversy and the challenge is
certainly a reference to that anyway I
took this as a hint that I should use
some automated attack tool which in
retrospect I think was wrong but
whatever the description has a few more
hints but we will get back to that in a
minute let's first check out the site
the challenge here links HTML file with
the following content so part of the
subdomain can be random it's obviously
to give every player a unique site we
will see that come up later on the site
itself we can find a simple login field
and when we inspect the HTML we see a
validation pattern that tells us the
username has to be admin and the
password has to follow a more complex
pattern it's basically a valid flag
pattern CDF curly braces then some
characters that start with quarters and
if you pay attention you can see that
the subdomain is basically that part
here and then followed by 64 characters
so it seems like if we find the correct
password for the admin user we have
found the flag like I said I thought the
a7 had meant to tell me to use some
tools so I used nikto which basically
does something like doorbuster and it
found an epimer file it turns out I
could have found that myself if I had
looked into the robots.txt
oh well that QA entry here throwing a
bit off but I ignored it mostly and this
is where the second hint comes into play
the llamó tilt
some editors such
MX or maybe them create files to track
your current progress in case you don't
save and it crashes also then it can be
recovered and some editors create a file
with the same name but appended tilt and
that's basically what happened here the
developer apparently opened the file in
an editor and it created the tilt file
and for some reason it didn't get
deleted the Yama file is really
interesting it's basically a web
application config file for Google App
Engine and it tells us here where the
app that handles the page lives I might
also Google a little bit to learn more
about App Engine to understand the
structure of this file so basically I'm
hunting now for the application sources
in the Google App Engine Docs
I find a hello world example using main
tie so I tried that and with the tilde
there as well I can leak the content so
now we got the sources the code doesn't
look too big but there are some dense
areas the first thing you might notice
is that there's something about quotas
and abuse detection system and when I
looked at the code there was a lot of
time calculations and I hope they didn't
have to understand that right now so I
continued here they look in post
requests that must be very important and
indeed I immediately noticed the query
language injection you can see this here
the colon one together with the
parameter here safe but this direct
Python string manipulation with
percentage s is unsafe we can inject
another single quote and break out of
the string and screw with the query so
is this an SQL injection well kinda not
really as you can see here in the
function name it's gql who will query
language at this point I still didn't
get that the title of the challenge was
supposed to hint for that gql but oh
well so what can we do with it
ideally we want to be able to log in so
what kind of features could we use in
the query language if you look up the
grammar of the query language it's
really short and there's not much you
can do so we are here in the where
condition and all we can do is append
more conditions with and there is not
even an or and we could sort or limit
the result but that's not
useful so no SQL Union select to inject
the password we can control to bypass
the authentication also the only output
we have is either wrong username or
wrong password so it's going to be a
blind injection the idea is if we make
the query return a password then the
password we supply with the wrong and if
we make the query return no password we
would get the wrong username arrow we
can play with this gql doesn't have
advanced string stuff like SQL for
example there is no where password like
a percentage where password like B
percentage to slowly brute-force the
first character but we can basically
simulate that with greater or lower than
so you can inject a compare if the
password is bigger than a and if that's
the case the query returns the password
and we get a wrong password arrow but if
the password was not bigger than a and
then the password might start with a or
another child that's lower than that
then the query would not return a
password and we get the wrong username
error so we can in fact slowly
brute-force the password so they start
writing some code to do that the
comparison works by ASCII values so the
order of charge is how they appear in
ASCII so lower case a is bigger than
capital a so it's writing the code but I
quickly ran into the abuse detection
system I will spend for 90 seconds
because I either triggered two arrows in
30 seconds or made more than 13 requests
per 30 seconds or it took me longer than
2,000 40 seconds o game because with
every request we get an arrow we can
only perform one request every 15
seconds and not only that we only have
two thousand two hundred forty seconds
time for that it's only 150 requests but
the flag is already at least 64 bytes
long we know part of the password just
not the main part this means we have
only like 2 requests per character we
will never brute-force a password with
those restrictions so I started to
review more of the code and long story
short I couldn't find a bypass for the
abuse detection system also the password
is dynamically generated but it's safe
it's H make with
secret key and the first part of the
hostname which means if you know the
secret key and I give you a valid flag
you can verify that it's valid
the first part generates a second part
so also no tricks possible there
basically I had two following options in
mind first bypass the detection system
second finds an issue in the dynamic
flag or password generation third a
better gql injection for try to optimize
the brute force and like I said first
one let know where second one was also
unlikely third one to the query syntax
is just too short which means the only
viable way is optimisation so an obvious
first improvement to the brute force
with greater and lower is to do a binary
search basically we have an Oracle that
tells us with the guess of the password
if the real password is greater or lower
which means we can lower the amount of
requests necessary my first
implementation did this per character
each character is 64 options and with a
binary search you can find the right
guess in about log n steps so about 4.1
steps necessary per character which
means we need roughly 262 steps in total
which doesn't work because we can only
do up to 150 requests in a time we have
so I was stuck there for a while a lot
of time went into fixing programming
backs and testing it because it's so
slow with one request every 15 seconds
it just took ages but when I did another
round of auditing the code and noticed
something so ever requests of which you
can only have to every 30 seconds are
only counted on exceptions and if you
look closely in the login code you see
that only a wrong password triggers an
exception from username is just a
regular request of which you can have 13
per 30 seconds that's the key we need to
optimize the binary search to favor
wrong username over wrong password so
how do we do that well in a binary
search you always select the center of
your search area this means there is a
50/50 chance that your item is either
greater or lower so how can we screw
that chance
well instead of picking the center we
pick something more towards one side for
example if we do a 75 to 25 split we
have a much higher probability that our
item is going to be lower than that new
index in our case we can have 13
requests in 30 seconds but only two of
those can be errors so we have to divide
by 13 roughly a 85 to 15 percent split
awesome
also I optimized the string generation
by working with numbers rather than a
character string so basically our string
you want to brute-force has an alphabet
of 64 characters so it's like a basic C
for number system which means we can
convert between base 10 and base 64
don't confuse it with base64 encoding
I'm really talking here about the
mathematical numeral system base 64
maybe you had to convert base 10 to
basic T in your base 3 in school that's
basically what I did so I created two
functions to convert a basic C phone
number to a base 10 number and vice
versa so now I can treat the binary
search as a search of a number the
highest value is basically lowercase
that is that is a set which is a huge
number and this is the code I came up
with I use the request module to perform
the gql injection request then I define
the alphabet for the flag in a skew
order here are my functions to convert
from base 64 to base 10 and vice versa
and a function to display a number line
to visualize the search and here are the
important search variables at the
beginning the highest number is
basically exactitude set and lowest is
obviously zero the current flag we will
check so the search index is initialized
with 85% from the top so that it's
screwed towards higher values and our
real password is probably lower and
those are lists to count the exceptions
so wrong passwords and regular requests
I make at the beginning of the search
group I have a look at the list that
remember all exceptions and requests and
remove the requests that are older than
30 seconds because they don't matter
anymore
but if we have had more than one
exceptions in the past
seconds or had more than 11 regular
requests we are going to sleep for a
second then we clean up the list again
and maybe sleep again until the
condition is not true anymore then we
are allowed to perform another request
so we convert the current search index
to the flag string and perform the
request some nice log output and then we
check the result if it was wrong
username then our guess was bigger than
the real password so we can set the
highest possible value to dead and move
the search index down a little bit but
always move it in the 85 to 15% ratio if
we get wrong password we get an
exception so we remember we had the
exception and we also know our password
was greater than our guests so we take
the upper part and move the search index
higher and that's it we just have to let
it run now doesn't it look beautiful
here you can see how the search index
the X always goes to the higher value
and how the search space is narrowed
down and there's a nice ratio now of
wrong username and wrong password
requests this takes now a while
basically 2240 seconds of 37 minutes but
we will still just barely make it in
time so I started many instances in
parallel and hope that at least one will
succeed and this is where I started to
become nervous because the end of the
CTF was approaching and I was not sure
if it will work I didn't have one
successful run yet will the flag I found
work or will it break will I do my
calculations right - I have a bugs and
about 10 minutes before the end two
processes approach the final guesses
there we go social space is apprendi now
zero we found our flag hopefully so I
tried to enter the flag super shaking
hands because I had to be fast with the
minutes left but it didn't work
wrong flag also I couldn't login with
the slick it was not correct
damn but a head a hunch what the problem
was I probably didn't quite get the
calculations correct so it was probably
one or two numbers off so I just
adjusted the last character of the flag
and after a few attempts I got the
right flag then there was close but
really happy at the end because just FYI
I spent probably like 12 hours on this
