really do those are questions we try to
answer in this video you may have
learned that when you are programming
and you need some more memory you use
the heat by allocating memory with Melek
and later you free it again if you don't
need it anymore
and somehow some magic is happening and
you don't really know how but you
magically get more memory before we talk
about Mela let's first talk about how
our process gets any memory in the first
place
this is done via mm or brrk those are
system calls which means we ask the
kernel directly em f's ask the kernel to
give us some new virtual address space
basically requesting a new memory
segment
besides mm desk also BRK which can be
used to change the size of an already
used memory segment this is our real
 magic in the NT process doesn't
care how this memory is implemented if
there's Ram where exactly on the RAM you
store it or if you have a swap file
because you don't have enough RAM the
kernel and hardware take care of this
and maps the memory into the process
this means that the process can
transparently access those memory
addresses and work with them and
transparent in this context means
doesn't have to know anything about it
you can execute he won with s trace and
you see all those calls to MF to
initially set up the process memory
regions and near the end it uses PRK to
set up the heap so why don't we just use
a map or BRK to get more memory for our
process and why do we always talk about
the heap with malloc and free well
malloc is just a very fancy and
convenient wrapper that handles the BRK
or a mapping for us and does much more
malloc we'll call MF or barricade to get
more memory if the heap doesn't exist or
too small but on top of that it will
also help us to organize and manage that
memory
also during CTF challenges and the
example we will have a look at shortly
use the heap so little that we don't see
any additional memory map regions so to
keep things simple we consider the heap
to be just a big chunk of fixed memory
mapped memory and we can do in this
memory whatever we want so when we refer
to the heap we actually mean this memory
region so what does it mean that malloc
will manage the heap let's explore this
abstractly first we want to allocate 8
bytes so we call malloc
with 8 this means we block 8 bytes on
the heap each call to malloc will return
the address of the heap where the area
got blocked and with this address we
know we can write our eight bytes tool
so we can now write the string a AAA BBB
B to that address and now let's allocate
two more times just to see what would
happen
malloc 8 and may log 8 this begs the
question how does malloc know which
areas are still free so there are many
different ways one could implement that
though most commonly used is an
implementation called DL melech because
it dude with the name due closely I
wrote it and that malloc algorithm will
store for each chunk a block size of the
junk right before it it will also keep
four bytes before that empty for how the
free is implemented but we will only
focus on not lab for now let's do the
metals again and let's think like a
computer so at the start when the first
malloc is called we obviously know the
beginning of the heap so we store the
size that we want to allocate there and
return the address where the junk part
that is usable by the programmer starts
but how does malloc know on the next
call to malloc where the next chunk can
be placed not that we overwrite our
previously allocated area well we
obviously have to kind of memorize where
our free region begins
so melih will simply do some math and
update the address that points to the
beginning of the heap by adding the size
of the junk we allocated to it and this
happens with every malloc so there's a
point of somewhere that will
always point to the free memory
cool and just for understanding purposes
given the return address of Melek what
can you do with that
well this pointer points to the star
where we can write data to so if we look
at the address just before that we can
read the size of the current chunk and
if we know the size we can add that size
to the address to get the next chunk on
the heap where we can do the same again
now let's have a look at the heap level
one child from protostome we will use
that example to look at how malloc works
in real life but first let's step
through the code line by line and try to
imagine how the heap will look like in
then next video we will actually do that
practically the objective here seems to
call winner
so we somehow have to read a record
execution to that function at the top
there is a struct defined called
internet which has two members a
priority integer and the second member
is a char pointer called name which
means names contains a pointer to a
string somewhere else structs are like
classes at least in terms of providing a
structure with multiple different member
attributes now main defines three
variables from the type struct internet
pointer but only two are used I guess I
left over from craziness level I
emphasize struct internet pointer
because those three internet objects are
not stored on the stack only the
addresses the pointer to those objects
are stored in I 1 I 2 and I 3 anyhow
then it starts allocating those objects
on the heap it first costs malloc with
enough space for the object I 1 size of
will return the number of bytes the
structure requires in this case that's 8
because the integer priority is 4 bytes
and the char pointer which is an address
is also 4 bytes because we are on a
32-bit machine and we know that mellowed
returns the address on the heap that we
can now use so I 1 points to the start
of 8 bytes in memory and now we want to
set priority to 1 which will write 1 to
the first for byte of the allocated area
then it allocates another 8 bytes and
the resulting address will be stored in
the show
our point on name which is at offset +4
of the eye one object as a programmer we
write I 1 and arrow name to access the
name attribute but implemented is it as
simple going to a certain offset of I 1
in this case I 1 plus 4 is the location
of the char pointer name so now I one
error name will contain an address which
points to the allocated heap area which
we just allocated those 8 bytes are
intended to store a list of characters a
string the name then the same is done
over again for I 2 we make space for the
struct I 2 we set its priority to 2 we
allocate another 8 by it for the name
string so we basically have now two
objects allocated on the heap that we
can work with next come to STR copies
and we know that string copy is always
super suspicious because there's no
length indication we can potentially
write more than we have space in this
case the internet name was allocated
with only 8 bytes so we could probably
write over those eight bytes and really
screw up stuff anyhow the string copy
will copy the first argument to the name
of the I 1 object I 1 points to the
start of the I one object and it offset
plus 4 which is the name is the address
of the free 8 bytes that were allocated
for the string so string copy will take
the address stored there and copy the
string from argument 1 at that location
and the same thing is happening for the
second argument with the I to object
after that we will printf and then quit
the program in the next video we will
have a look at the heat while we execute
this program to understand how the he
looks in real life and how we can work
with it in gdb and in the end solve this
challenge
oh by the way I lied I said the second
word would contain the size of the chunk
well does but also the lowest bit is
used to indicate that the previous chunk
is used not free that becomes more
important for the free algorithm that's
in our example those values would all be
hex 1 1 I just want to put a smallest
claimer here at the end I simply fight
the heap and malloc a lot for example I
only talked about one pointer pointing
at the free area in reality there's
obviously way more to this if we look
into the history of exploitation we are
currently looking at stuff from more
than 15 years ago like 2001 ish a lot of
this stuff hasn't changed and the
concepts are the same but a lot of stuff
is also different
today's malloc implementation is based
on DL Mellark but it's not really the
original dilma log anymore now it's
usually referred to as PT Melek and my
goal here is to teach you the
fundamentals even though it's not 100%
correct you should have now a rough idea
of what the heap is and what to look for
and you can transfer this knowledge to
any heap implementation
