in the reverse engineering category the
desert of reversing by the way whoever
did the drawings for the CTF I really
appreciate it it looks awesome
in this category we have to reverse
engineer the programs that run on this
Arduino board so before we check out the
next challenge let's try to learn more
about this platform
first of all we know that the
microcontroller used on this Arduino
board isn't atmega328p so we can Google
this name and find the official Admiral
website where you can download the
official datasheet photos chip ok so we
got here a microcontroller that is based
on the AVR enhanced risk architecture
that's our first piece of information
the chip can execute AVR code that is
very different from what we use on our
pcs or laptops those are usually in tool
based 32-bit or 64-bit machines and use
Intel assembly I can read until
disassembly okayish but I never read AVR
disassembly so I'm new to this like some
of you also risk means reduced
instruction set which is a simplified
assembler at first that sounds cool but
to be honest it's harder to read I think
it is for me coming from x86 which is
Sisk complex instruction set basically
the difference is that this is not a
real example but just to give you an
idea that this architecture might have
multiplied instruction that works
directly on memory addresses and all the
memory magic is done by the hardware but
on a RISC architecture you might might
first have to load the value from memory
then the other value then multiply them
and then write back the result so for
instructions vs. 1 you have to learn
less instructions on risk but once you
know them you will always have to read
more lines for the simple things in
reality both architectures have
absolutely their value and good reason
just for me coming from x86 and having
no experience it probably gonna be a bit
of a rough ride but before we look at a
VR assembler let's continue with getting
a broader overview of the device so on
embedded devices are generally very
low-level computers you want to interact
with Hardware obviously there is no
special instruction called turn led on
usually this is done with something
called memory mapped i/o it's pretty
much hardware magic from the perspective
of the programmer we have a big chunk of
memory we can use
you know from address 0 to like hex ffff
but not each memory address is the same
there are regions for example a certain
part of this abstract memory model could
indeed map to some memory some flesh
where you can read and write values tool
like we would expect but another address
might map to an actual output pin and
you could define that writing a 0 to
that address will output a 0 in writing
anything but a 0 would mean that the pin
will output a logical 1 or in reality
something like +5 volt so if we think of
our board what kind of inputs and
outputs we have we know that there are
multiple pins available and we know that
there is a serial UART interface that
allows us to send data via Rx and TX and
especially in our case where we interact
with this board by a serial we are very
interested in how that is done so we can
identify in the disassembly that we will
reverse engineer what code is
interacting with us what is reading
input so I was interested in looking at
the memory map of this microcontroller
okay so I search for memory map and then
I get confused this one here only shows
application in bootloader flash region
there is no memory mapped i/o how does
that work but I continue the search and
I find finally a memory map that shows
i/o stuff wait that's weird
this memory goes from address 0 to
address hex 3 of FF and this memory goes
from 0 to X 8 FF what then the
bootloader and the application code
would overlap with the i/o that doesn't
make any sense that stumped me for quite
a while I was not expecting that and
obviously didn't read the documentation
too carefully I hate myself for how long
that took me to figure out it turns out
AVR uses a Harvard architecture and if
you ever wondered why you had to learn
weird things like Howard vs. for Neyman
architecture in computer science classes
well here's a good example if I had
never had that in school I probably
would not know about this so in the
internal world
everything is just one big chunk of
memory program code lives in the same
memory as does the data thus we can do
crazy exploits where we overflow the
stacked data and jump into the stack and
execute code on Harvard this doesn't
work the data is separated from code so
you can never jump into data and execute
code there because that just doesn't
work that way anyway I wanted to look at
the memory stuff to figure out how the
serial connection might work so let's
look in the datasheet for that there's a
section called use art basically you art
that I briefly mentioned before it's an
for universal synchronous asynchronous
receiver transceiver apparently it is
highly flexible serial communication
device we are on the correct track so
here we have a block diagram that
apparently describes this thing let's
see if we can make some sense of it
here's the RX and TX output it is
something we kind of know about there's
also a clock which has something to do
with the baud rate also kind of makes
sense we can also see that Rx and TX use
a shift register which means the code
doesn't have to actually speak the
serial data format bit by bit but can
simply load the shift register with the
help of the clock it will slowly get
shifted out as zero output and same with
reading it slowly fills up the shift
register and we can then read the whole
result and there is an interesting note
saying refer to the pin configurations
nt IO ports description for use or pin
placement we look that up in a second
there is a lot more information here but
let's scroll a bit further down to see
the receiving examples if you read that
and we completely don't understand it we
might have to go back and read a bit
more
that's just how researching and learning
new stuff works so here we have an
example written in AVR assembler and
equivalent C code the following code
examples show a simple user receive
function based on polling of the
received complete our XC flag and for
the assembly code the received data will
be stored in our 16 after the code
completes so it reads from a memory
location called UCS our Z
or a with the in instruction and then
use a skip if bit is set and checks if
the rxc bit of flag is set in that
previous value if it's not set it will
execute the chump afterwards to loop
back up but if it was complete it would
read from a memory location called u d
r0 into register R 16 which means it
received a bite from the secure
communication we can also check the
sending side and that basically works
the same it also uses u d r0 location
just this time to send data with the out
instruction so what is u d r0 when we
search for it we find this huge table
which is a register summary and
apparently u dr 0 is that offset hex c6u
dr 0 sense for us are io data register
the description says that the use our
transmit data buffer register and
receive data buffer register share the
same io address referred to as you dr 0
the transmit data buffer register will
be destination for data written to the u
dr register location reading the u dr 0
register location will return the
contents of the received data buffer
register and the data memory map from
before shows that external io registers
are between hex 6 0 &amp;amp; FF NT u dr 0
register is at offset c 6 so it's called
a register but it's also just an address
in memory a very low address c 6 this
means if we find a read or write to that
address we have well serial data is
handled at this point I won't go into
further detail but I think this video is
a great introduction how you can
approach a new unknown field I condensed
in this video hours of research and I
read small snippets here and there that
will help me getting a better and better
understanding of this architecture
besides the official datasheet are also
googled a lot and read forum post the
other inner platform has big community
so you find a lot of discussion that
help you understand some weird AVR
things but one of the most helpful other
resources I found our slides from an AVR
workshop with rod r2 which was extreme
namely helpful for example when I
started debugging and reversing the
first a bi binary I was confused about
real stuff in Ida when I read the slides
and learned that yeah
there are addressing issues with ABR and
Ida really annoying and there are more
small things like that so thank you a
lot
turkey and Duberman for sharing your
knowledge with us you saved me from
hours of frustration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
