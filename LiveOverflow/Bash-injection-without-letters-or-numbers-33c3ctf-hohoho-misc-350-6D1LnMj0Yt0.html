CTF with fairly high points it's listed
in the misc
category which means it's not quite
clear what the objective is the text
reads Santa Claus had a massive
multi-day lag and is still stuck at
sorting out Christmas trees and presents
keep in mind that the 33 c3 CTF happened
during the 33 c3 conference between
Christmas and New Year's help him with
the trees at and then we get a server
and port to connect to
if he doesn't reward you with the
satisfactory present you might have to
bash him a bit
notice how the bash is written in italic
that is a hint for what this is all
about bash the gnu bourne-again shell
and there is a rate limit so you won't
accidentally dodge the service this was
an amazing team effort for us like with
all challenges during CTF we didn't do
them all alone but especially this one
spent across the whole team everybody
making a bit of progress
so I didn't do the first part of the
challenge
I joined towards the end but let me
quickly recap what the solutions were
for those first parts so when you
connect to the service you are greeted
with a Merry Christmas and a menu you
can help Santa continue helping him
visit the North Pole or quit so when you
decide to help Santa you get these two
trees which are actually a special
version of the towers of Hanoi and also
you get a unique ID that tracks your
progress it can use that idea with the
continue option to continue where you
left off that's a great help you have to
sort these layers to their respective
place and the rules of Hanoi applies
that you can't place a bigger layer on
top of a smaller layer you specify the
moves with pairs of numbers like 1 3
which moves the red small-plate from 3 1
to the MT 3 3 and then you basically
just have to solve this you can quickly
find coding examples online about this
Hanoi version and that's what my friends
did they basically wrote some code to
solve the towers of Hanoi and produce a
file with those moves that are necessary
after you solved it you get another menu
where you can simply answer some
questions but they kind of got stuck
there you can note down the unique ID
you used to solve it or to be more
precise only up to the last move and
then you can very quickly get to this
menu again to figure out the next stage
as far as I know at this point another
person started working on it as well I
think by just trial and error and after
quite some more time spent on this he
noticed a Bosch evil error and only one
particular branch of the question/answer
tree BAM
there we have it there's a bash shell
injection our input is passed to an eval
in a bash script so from here on it
should be simple right
well this is where the real challenge
started my friend wrote a little script
to comfortably test the bash injection
so you could simply run the script and
quickly test the payload with that he
slowly figured out by more trial and
error and systematic testing you are not
allowed to use any letters or numbers
except you must use one n or I for the
option select
and all other special characters are
allowed that's very very restrictive how
the heck can we get basically now a full
command injection working if we can't
use letters to launch any program I
think I joined here my friend at like
11:00 p.m. or something and we sit down
playing around with the spaz injection
obviously there are a couple of
different creative ways to solve this
but they are all are kind of based on
the same concept and so before I show
you how we did it let's establish some
bare shell basics i've prepared here a
folder with a couple of test files now
have you ever wondered what happens when
you do something like LS star you might
have thought that LS implements that but
in fact your shell expands this when you
press tab it will expand for you right
there and not just when you execute it
so you can do stuff like metro expand to
all file names that start with an A now
think what would happen if you just
enter star unknown command AAA
well that's logical star is expanded to
all files in this folder and the first
file was AAA so it thought that is the
program to execute like a cat or LS and
the other filenames are the parameters
and this shell expansion is a very
powerful and convenient for us for
example we know that cat is in slash bin
slash cat we can try to match this with
special characters besides star which
stands for as many characters as you
want
question mark only represents one
character so for example slash question
mark question mark question mark slash
question mark question mark question
mark will expand to all three character
files that are in a folder with three
characters and in just heaven so that
the first one matched is cat that's very
lucky because this means we can execute
cat and all other found names that match
this are passed as an argument to cut so
it will print all these binaries and
obviously we can also follow the cat
primitive with more shell expansions
like star so the stars would expand to
all files here
the beginning would expect to cut in a
lot of crap but that doesn't matter in
the end these files here will be printed
and so you can use that now to slowly
explore the whole system by trying to
match important files this is how we got
the source code for this challenge this
is also how we found the flag file in
slash flag
the issue is we cannot read it otherwise
we were done already
apparently our current user doesn't have
the correct permissions but with this
way we also found a binary that seems to
read the flag for us we just have to
execute it and it's also easy we can
just use shale expansion to execute it
but it also wants a password the
password is as plain text in the binary
when we can see it through cat but we
have no way to enter these characters
right how can we supply this password
now well let me just show you the
solution and walk you through I know it
looks ridiculous but once you dissect it
it's simple but it took us like seven
hours to figure this out this was not an
easy process for us who went to bed at
like 9 a.m. in the morning after pulling
an all-nighter but we knew we were close
we just needed more time to figure out
the details first of all there are three
sections there are two function
definitions a and these are special
German characters but they are not
standard s key so they are not filtered
and the third section is actually
executing the gate flag program I
mentioned earlier that program gets a
parameter the password so all these
lines just slowly construct the password
how it's doing this you will understand
in a second so let's have a look at the
first function the first function err is
actually just printf printf is a program
located in user bin printf and we got
lucky that it gets matched by these
question marks and the single n which
has to be included for print F as a
parameter to printf we use dollar at
variables and pairs start with a dollar
and dollar at is a special variable in
bash which represents all
all parameters passed to this function
so the function air we'll just call
printf with all the parameters we give
to it nothing special just a ripple so
we can use printf more often as function
air printf is cool because we can use
escape sequences to get special
characters in particular we can use
octal escape sequences like backslash 1
0 1 which is 65 and decimal or hex for 1
so it gets converted into a capital A
maybe you already get what we are
working towards now we have a function
air that can evaluate escape sequences
let's print any string we like and it
only requires numbers so we got around
the restriction of letters so if we find
a way now how we get numbers we can
construct escape sequences and then
print a string so let's have a look at
the second function Earth who uses now
air which is printf to print another
special batch variable to all our hash
that is like argh C in C programming it
represents the amount of parameters
passed to this function so calling ooh
with 3 parameters will print a 3 and
calling a with 1 parameter will print a
1 now we have a primitive to construct
any number we want and this is what
happens in this last section there's one
air at the start which will print a
string and evaluate all escape sequences
and then we have a long list of
constructed escape sequences for back
slashes are necessary but whatever they
result in one single backslash at the
end because like you have to escape the
escape for the escape backslash whatever
so backslash and then we call with one
parameter o with four parameters and
with seven parameters so backslash 147
which is 103 in decimal or hex 67 and
that's the ASCII character small G and
then we repeat this for every character
we want to create so once you evaluate
all the earth
have a string left with all the escape
sequences then you do an a a printf to
evaluate them and all that is left over
is the password for the gate flag binary
no S key letters or numbers needed but
we can construct any character sequence
we want so when you inject it we get
this beautiful ASCII Christmas present
and at first I panicked because I
couldn't see the flag and I thought what
the my heart skipped a beat feeling
devastated at 8 a.m. in the morning but
it was there after all I submitted it
and at that point all these 11 teams had
solved it we were really really proud it
was a great example of a challenge where
the whole team worked together and I
would have never got it by myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
