the RH M III CTF and that is the white
box challenge that's the other challenge
that I have solved so for this challenge
I want to go a little bit of a different
route because in the end I am not
satisfied with how I solved it I used
the tool that I didn't really understand
and I still spend many many hours on
this challenge and explored it in in
great depth but it didn't help me really
with the solution I had several attack
ideas but in the end they all didn't
work out and so instead of giving you
like a sequential write-up of what you
can do to solve this challenge or show
you the tool that I've used I try to
revisit what I thought at different
stages when I approached this challenge
there's a chance that you have already
heard about what it is about or you even
solved it yourself with this tool but
would like to dig a little bit deeper
into it before we head into I think I
will just tell you basically what the
solution was and then with keeping that
in mind we then explore the steps I've
taken and you can also then think about
where were my mistakes why did I go down
a route that kind of didn't lead me to
the solution or how far did I get with
the knowledge or where I just don't know
enough yet
so I figure that's a lot more
interesting so the title is white box
what it actually implements this binary
is AAS encryption in a s encryption
looks a little bit intimidating when you
see the algorithm for the first time
there a lot of steps involved that seem
arbitrary or weird but you know you
don't really have to understand it in
full you kind of just break it down into
two steps and then you can understand
the single steps of AES even if you
don't really understand their purpose
but in the end this binary implemented
AES encryption and so somehow this
algorithm must be present in this binary
it would somehow have to implement each
of these steps so for example let's see
what the add round key step is and we
can for example go to Wikipedia and just
then look up the step for add round key
and so it tells us here that add round
key is the step where the sub key is
combined with the state for each round a
sub key is derived from the main key
using a key schedule and each sub key is
the same size as a state so if that
sounds may be very weird at first but if
you look on the picture is pretty easy
so you have your block size of for
example 16 bytes for the AES and then
you have also a round key and you just
explore them together and that those are
your resulting 16 bytes and it's just
your ordered in a nice photo for matrix
but these are just your 16 bytes so this
means there's for example a very
prominent XOR step in a s where you have
u plaintext and where you have your
first key that's the first key you enter
and it's X
and that becomes then this the next 16
state bytes for the next steps in the
algorithm so next one would be sub bytes
and then you can look at sub bytes and
what it does and it's basically just a
substitution it's kind of like not a
Caesar cipher the other one a
visionnaire where you just replace one
character with another one based on a
table and that's what the sbox basically
just is so this can also be easily
reversed if I know the result and I know
the sbox I can say ah that was produced
by the spite so all these operations
have to be somehow implemented in there
and like I said the first Idi round key
would just XOR the key and the question
of the challenge was can you extract the
key so it would be super easy to just
find the part in a program where this
round key is ex-ored and we just read
out the bytes that were ex-ored and then
we would have it solved but that's the
idea behind white box cryptography the
challenge that white box cryptography
aims to address is to implement a
cryptographic algorithm in software in
such a way that cryptographic assets
remain secure even when subject to white
box attacks so even if we have the
binary and can basically do a white box
approach can just like a look and to
read the code with the assembler code of
it we still shouldn't be able to get the
key that's the idea behind white box
cryptography it's obviously very
challenging and there are obviously a
lot of attacks and it's quite
interesting the idea is basically that
you take an algorithm that takes a key
and a ciphertext and has these very
defined steps and you kind of just
encode the key already fixed into the
steps and it becomes in a kind of a
weird thing where the key is just
already in there I think intuitively
that makes totally sense and when I
first read it then I thought oh that's
pretty clever
but obviously the there was in a detail
how is this done and can you infer back
to the key that was encoded in in these
kind of steps and basically that's the
whole idea behind the attack here and
obviously there are a lot of protection
mechanisms how you can hide or obscure
the key and basically the challenge
already implemented certain mitigations
because that is an active field of
research and there are tools available
that people have written their thesis is
about
that you can just fly to such a program
in it you basically use similar
techniques that you would use on
hardware crypto attacks to get the key
out on now software so that's actually
pretty cool but so the solution was
about figuring out that this is a es
that this is a white box cryptography
that that's a thing and that you somehow
have to figure out the key that is
somehow encoded in the workflow so now
that you know what kind of the goal of
this is let's rewind and go back to the
beginning how I started and approach
this challenge because I did not know
that white box is a thing obviously one
of the first steps that I did was just
checking out the binary itself and so
you can see it's a 64-bit Linux binary
it's stripped so there are no symbols
unlike with the other exploitation
challenge when you execute it you have
two methods to invoke the crypto
algorithm you can either pass sixteen
bytes the plain text that you want to
encrypt as a parameter or you can use
standard input by for example here
piping into the binary the the sixteen
bytes so then I just like typed in a
very first test was all the sixteen
bytes and changed the last byte into a B
and check is there any obvious
correlation for example that's the last
by changed also change the last byte of
the output but that wasn't the case so I
assumed okay this is a little bit more
involved than just for example a simple
XOR or something like that so next step
was obviously opening up this in a
disassembler so here this time I'm using
hoppers or for reverse engineering so
this is a stripped binary and we have
not really talked about this before but
how do you find the main function when
there are no symbols involved and main
is not named the entry point is where
the binary really starts but that is
before main this is basically where
Lipsy is kind of setting up everything
for you before it starts main you can
see here that the entry point cause then
Lipsy start main in that function has
three parameters and hopper already
automatically decodes these so you can
see that this is Finney this is in it
and this is main these are three
function pointers to stuff that run at
certain times but the big main function
that you usually define in writing see
is this argument so that's always pretty
easy to find so let's have a look the
first time when I scroll to your I
immediately thought wait this is a bit
odd because you see here too how Hopper
colors this yellow and this is white
it's a little bit weird because it
usually colors everything nice and
defines everything to be a nice
procedure but it's kind of failing here
that's why it's becoming white and the
reason for this is because there doesn't
seem to be a return if you look here
there's like here a jump our ax
an unconditional jump so it will always
jump here to somewhere else and it's
based on a register so it dynamically
decides where it will go in the hopper
has obviously some difficulties to
figuring out where that would jump to
usually you would expect that at the end
of main is a return so what's going on
here we have some kind of function here
and then we have our ax here so let's
maybe peek first into the function what
this is okay so this caused a lot of
other functions and we follow this then
you find this very weird thing moving
numbers into another place a lot of
numbers into a different place so what
does the next function do also moves
numbers just different numbers into a
place and another function also very big
large numbers into into a weird place we
don't know yet what these functions do
but I mean it's clear that somehow data
is set up and at first I was thinking or
does it decrypted own code so is it just
like loading some data into memory and
then it will run some decryption on it
and that's how the algorithm is hidden
but that would be kind of weird because
the data does seem to follow a certain
pattern at least the first one here you
see it's just one two three four five
six seven eight and so forth the other
ones seem a bit more random but it's not
really code if you try to decode it so
there's just a lot of data being set up
and that's quite interesting okay so
this just seems to be a set up routine
whatever its setting up I don't know
let's have a look at this jump array X
because that's super suspicious that
happens immediately after the set up so
we can see here that are a X where we'll
jump to it is referenced based on an
address that is calculated so how is
this
calculated here's some kind of variable
bar 4d that is loaded into our ax so
that's a local variable then we shift
this left by three so what does this
mean if we had like the number of four
we would shift it left by 3 so 1 2 3 it
becomes 32 and you can see here how the
bits are shifting its do another example
let's do 3 and then 1 2 3 it's 24 let's
do another one 5 5 and shifted left by 3
is 40 so if you notice that is always
just multiplication by 840 divided
divided by 8 is 5 and d24 from earlier
divided by 8 is the 3 so this is just
multiplying it by 8 which kind of makes
sense if this is probably an array of
addresses and this is the index into
that array so if you want to get the
third item in this array so that would
be the index 2 you would do 2 times 8
and then you add it to there and then
you get to the position in the array so
this means all this data here are
functions that are possibly being called
depending on whatever value is in that
local variable so we can define all of
this as 8 by it values we can check them
out and we see oh yeah these two look
indeed like valid functions that the
stÃ©phanie valid code here if you pay
attention for example here it looks like
it would jump in the middle and it
should be wrong but it is not because
just before it is a jump so that will
always jump away so this is the end of
whatever is here before this means this
here is a perfectly fine function in
itself you can see here it also ends in
a jump when you pay attention all of
these ones and in basically the same
jump so we can define we can say this is
one function that we have and it ends in
this jump and this one is also probably
another function and ends in the same
jump and this is probably also another
function and ends in the same jump so
what is up with this let's see where
this jump goes to okay so it goes here
and there's immediately and not a jump
into main and then we see where main
goes to it leads here look at this this
is just before the jump our ax
again and while 40 is the index that is
used for the jump table so this is index
jump table so let's go back where we
just came from and see what what happens
before we jump you see here again the
hex 40 now hapa just because of this
weird calling convention that is not
typical haba doesn't realize that all
these things are the same one but you
always see them the same patterns you
have are AP minus hex 40 and then the
jump into main basically again you can
see it's moving six in here and it's
moving here a in here so this is
preparing where it will continue to so a
six arrives here it's definitely not
above hex one one so it's fine so it's
going into array X so we have six here
now we perform a shift left so it's six
times eight and then we add the address
to here and basically this means one two
three four five six so it should call
this function here in this function here
then ends in the same way it moves four
in here and so one two or three four so
it would call probably this function and
this one is interesting see this here's
a compare some value is compared to F
and in this one case it loads the index
of the jump table with two but in the
other case it will load with one so here
we have an if case a branch that either
this the function 1 or the function two
is executed and basically now we
understand the flow of the program and
that's basic one of the first things
that I figured out before I wrap up this
video I thought it would be really cool
to compare the disassembly between
binary ninja and hopper and as you can
see binary ninja also drops us at the
entry point called start and it also
recognizes finis in it and main but it
does not only comment that those are the
possible parameters but it uses this
detection also to automatically rename
the main function for us so even though
there's no symbols included it does name
this function main but much more
interesting is how binary ninja deals
with the jump table because as you can
see here there are a lot of branches
away from the jump
our ax so binary
has the capability to recognize those
jump tables like this and also what's
really cool is that when you rename the
variable that is holding the index for
the jump table it does not only have
this name in the main function but it
also applies to all the other function
binary ninja recognizes that this is a
kind of global variable used for the
index of the jump table and so in all of
the little functions you can see here
how a is moved into the index of the
jump table or six is moved into the
index of the jump table so binary ninja
performs here really really well
