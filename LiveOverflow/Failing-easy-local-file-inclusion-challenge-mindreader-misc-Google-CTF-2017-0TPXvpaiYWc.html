other challenge and was considered easy
and still I failed to solve it in the
end I had solved two medium and one
heart chance so what was my issue with
mind reader well let me tell you about
how I approach this challenge and what
went wrong
mind clear can you read my mind I was
wondering what that could mean reading
your mind I thought maybe it could be
related to reading a process of memory
well Jones is running at mind-reader
that web to get professional comic and
when we visit the site we find a very
easy formed with the Texan if you write
something it passes a get variable F
with your input but returns a not found
error well that already smells bad so a
natural first thing to do is to try
local file inclusion ensure etc' passwd
works so what do we do now where can we
find the flag usually when I work with a
web challenge I use a web proxy that
burb my Firefox has already the proxy
server configured so I just have to
start verb and then can visit the site
disable the request interception visit
the page and look for the request in the
HTTP history and there it is when you
highlight it you see the request and
response details of the HTTP request
down here then I handover this request
to the repeater which is a neat feature
of burb where you can repeat those
requests so it becomes really easy to
change the f get parameter and see the
result on the right so now I won't know
what I could be looking for I remember a
few interesting files on Linux but
obviously I don't know everything and
one of the first things I noticed was
the server nginx in the response which
made me start to Google for the default
config and log locations because I was
hoping to learn something about the web
app running there so for example VAR log
nginx error log or et Cie nginx nginx
cons but nothing worked at some point I
opened up a terminal and connected to a
Linux VM I had running somewhere to find
interesting files especially because I
want to check the proper file system
there's a lot of information about your
own process there so I try to access a
few things like proc self environ which
would print the environment variables of
your current process but it didn't work
here is the first mistake I made and
wonder if you notice it I will come back
to it
in a second I then went on and looked
for other interesting files maybe
there's something in /dev I started
continuing trying out different
interesting deaths of files and there
was this ft folder file descriptors and
it's actually assembling to proc self ft
so it's pointing at your own file
descriptors you can see that ft 0
returns ok and ft 1 and ft 2 just keep
hanging but no error and there seem to
be even more open file descriptors not
only the standard esterday in SD
alternate to the arrow that's
interesting but it didn't give me
anything anyway this was my second
mistake
do you notice my mistake here I didn't
so I thought this is going nowhere so I
started to work on another challenge and
procrastinated checking Twitter and then
there was an unread message this guy had
some problem with Joe and asked me about
it
had a short chat about the CTF and
because he saw I didn't solve my Twitter
yet he told me I could easily do it well
yeah I assume because it's needed
challenge that I should be able to do it
but so far I'm stuck and then the worst
thing happened he sent me a spoiler for
the challenge
please don't do this if I don't solve a
challenge I don't mind and I will seek
out write-ups after the event but in the
moment you deprive me of a valuable
learning experience because even when
I'm stuck with the challenge I started
researching and the bits of information
I read and pick up left and right makes
me more knowledgeable in general and
next CTF I will be better I try to stay
away from mind reader after that but it
was bugging me and for my own curiosity
and because I was failing with another
challenge I just had a look at what the
hint is I just can't ignore this it's in
my head and the code reveals that the
flag is in the environment variables
which I already had a hunch for as the
possible place but now I know the goal
and it also shows me why proc didn't
work there's a filter and it hit me in
the face I realized the two major
mistakes I made and how I could have
solved it on my own this right here has
turned into a valuable lesson for me ok
let's have a look at my first mistake
when I try to access something in Prague
and get the error it's actually a
different error than when I try to
access some random other file I did not
notice that the second mistake I made
was when I checked def FD because I knew
it was similar to proc cell 50 from my
example Linux system and while I did
wonder for a second why that works I
filed it away as some small oddity if I
had made notes of the weirdness that I
see with accessing Prague and that
apparently the sim link works
I could have combined the two things and
figured it out myself and it didn't I
was sloppy I didn't take proper notes
and most importantly I didn't pay
attention to the details oftentimes when
it comes to hunting for bugs it's the
small oddities you must not ignore a
hacker who can focus on details will
discover great vulnerabilities so when I
saw that proc was filtered and returned
another error and then I had to access
process environment variables I
immediately knew what to do when try to
use the sim link to proc self environ
through def FD one directory app
environment and get the flag soft well
not really
I got a spoiler I'm not sure if I had
solved it without maybe maybe not it was
certainly not hard but I make mistakes
and while it was a good lesson for
myself I hope it will also show you that
if you allow me this arrogance that even
I can fail easy challenges sometimes
knowledge and experience is missing but
sometimes the issue is just not paying
attention to all the information you
have been given
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
