hardware reversing project I have this
air conditioner which uses the remote
and we want to understand how it works
so in this mini series I want to reverse
engineer the communication between the
remote and the AC unit it's not advanced
or new in any way it was done countless
of times already
but if you have never done any
electronic stuff I think this is an
awesome example to get started I have
not done this before either I just know
theoretically how it should work
so I want to take you along how I
approach this project first we try to
understand the behavior of the remote
and AC unit because from that we can
already infer a lot of information and
after that we will use some electronics
and build a poor-man's logic analyzer
with an Arduino I have here this remote
with a display showing the set
temperature and other settings such as
cooling or fan motors and some other
stuff the first question is how does the
click information on the remote travel
to the AC in this there any
communication back from the AC because
we can see the temperature on the remote
screen this is easy to test we can
simply walk into another room far away
from the AC change a few settings and
then walk back to the main unit and look
at the display and we can see that the
settings on the menu hasn't changed but
the remote says something else and when
we click now another button on the
remote the AC unit immediately jumps to
that value this already tells us so much
on how the protocol works not every
single press is transmitted alone so
when I press temperature up it doesn't
send an up command it actually transmit
the whole state of the settings this
means there is some kind of packet that
is transmitted that contains all values
to verify this assumption we can also
change the settings on a unit and see if
the remote changes which it doesn't and
as soon as we press something on the
remote it jumps back to that value so
this reveals so much about the protocol
already it's one-way from the remote to
the AC unit and it seems to be a bigger
packet containing all the settings
information so how does your remote
transmit this information well when we
look at the remote we can see at the
front what looks like any normal LED and
you probably know that that is an
infrared LED just a quick refresher
about the electromagnetic spectrum
not that I claim to know any physics in
any meaningful way but we should have
some idea about it so visible light is a
tiny area of the electromagnetic
radiation our cells just happen to
respond to those wavelengths and our
eyes are dark for all others
that's bad for a few things so for
example we cannot see dangerous gamma or
x-rays but also good because we can use
the non visible AM spectrum to transmit
data so your Wi-Fi Bluetooth mobile
radio is all just different kinds of
electromagnetic radiation it just
happens to be a different wavelengths
our eyes can pick up an infrared is also
defined as a certain wavelength which is
just barely out of our capabilities to
see though there are some animals that
can see infrared light also most of our
photo sensors in our cameras react to
the wavelength of infrared light we can
also point the remote at our phone
camera to see that light I can barely
see it well a lot of times camera I use
an IR filter because humans can't see
infrared thus capturing infrared could
falsify the colors and stuff I'm using
an iPhone here and I know that the
front-facing camera doesn't have an IR
filter so we can see it better with that
one and also if we go into a darker room
we can really see it easily so to
properly analyze this because it just
quickly flashes we need something that
captures this the 24 or maybe 60 frames
a second of a camera are way too slow to
capture the fast flickering so we will
build a small circle to analyze this we
need a sensor that reacts to infrared
light but not other light the unlight
sensor so called photo resistors which
increase or decrease resists
depending on the amount of light though
this one is calibrated for regular
visible light so it's no good used to us
but I have here this IR receiver which
works more like a transistor it has
three pins two pins are basically the
power supply +5 volt and ground and the
third pin is either high or low
depending on if it captures a
significant amount of IR light or not I
put this here on a so called breadboard
there is a convenient rapid prototyping
platform so for example the long red and
blue lines on the sides are all
connected in a row which are use for the
power supply so I can connect the IR
receivers power supply with those lines
and the holes in the middle are also
connected in columns but divided in the
middle so I can plug in the IR here and
it will get the power there's also this
great hobby electronics platform which
you probably know called Arduino which
makes it super easy to use by everybody
I use an Arduino compatible board from
st. smart because it came in this cheap
electronics tutorial learning box but
you should definitely check out all
those are doing or learning packs and
resources they are awesome those 50 60
dollars are worth more than buying a
game you learn so much anyhow this board
has some pins and they are labeled and
we can see here of five fold and GND
which stands for ground pin so we can
use that to supply the breadboard with
power it can use one of the digital
input and output pins to connect to the
third leg of the IR receiver if you have
never done this yourself it might look
already a bit complicated but it's
really really easy you just have to do
it once yourself
here's also the schematics of how the
setup looks like we have the IR receiver
it's connected to ground here and to VCC
which refers to the power supply and the
third pin is connected to the digital
pin of the Arduino or st. smart lay on
our board our winners have the super
easy programming IDE where you can
program and see and simply upload the
compiled program to the board and it
just works so we want to write some code
that reads the output of the IRAC or so
we can analyze it we can take an auto
Ino example that would read the state of
a button and just modify to read the
state of the IR receiver so there are
two main functions the setup function
which initializes the serial
communication that's a protocol so the
computer can communicate with the board
and send text and out of scope right now
but we look at 0 at some other time and
we initiate the pin number 8 as an input
pin then the loop function here is like
an endless while loop this is what will
be executed constantly in a loop and
here we want to read the state of input
pin 8 and sent this input via serial to
our computer then we can compile it we
have to make sure the board is properly
recognized with the software and then we
can push it onto the board now it's
running there we can open the serial
console and see the output
so currently it's sending only once so
the i/o I all receiver outputs always
high 5 volt which is a digital one and
now we point the remote edit and when we
press it we can see some zeros rushing
by that's cool but a bit hard to analyze
so let's modify the code to use a so
called trigger we can start with a state
0 where we constantly read the input and
once it drops to zero for the first time
we switch to state 1 where we now send
the input including the micro seconds so
we have some timing information as well
to the computer
now we push it to the board wait until
it's booted and now we see no input
being sent to the computer but if we
point now the remote that the ir
receiver and press the button we get the
first zero and now the data is rushing
in that's better
now we can simply copy this output into
a text file to analyze we can now
collect multiple samples for example the
packet to select Fahrenheit or Celsius
or turning it on and off then I use
jupyter notebooks to work with stuff
like this
it's basically Python just with an
awesome interface to do explorative
scripts
first start by including some important
modules so we can plot data and then we
read one of the log data files with
numpy and specify that the data is comma
separated this will give us a big numpy
area and we can then extract the
microseconds and the single bits
next we can use pipeline to plot this
data in steps looks a bit awkward so
let's play around a little bit with the
limits of the y and x axis as well as
the figure size of the plot and maybe
also cut the data points at some length
because we only are interested in the
data at the front we might want to add
some points so we can see exactly where
our data points are we can now also wrap
this into a function so we can simply
call load with a file name and get this
nice digital logic plot awesome look at
this this is great this is a great poor
man's logic analyzer and we can compare
for example Celsius to Fahrenheit packet
and the on and off packet but how do we
read this they clearly look similar so
this is not some random wiggling this is
some kind of real pattern this is the
infrared LED flickering on and off in a
specific way but how the LED flickers is
defined in the protocol and somehow we
have to understand how the protocol
works so what a tech you can do without
knowing the protocol is compare multiple
packets of the same command like
multiple turning on packets and then you
could see that this always the same so
there's no crypto or timestamp or
whatever involved so replay attack is
easily possible without knowing what the
bits mean we can just resend the pattern
to perform this action
another thing to work out the protocol
is to compare similar packets like
Celsius and Fahrenheit and we notice
that some spikes are very close together
and some spikes are far apart and we can
try to see if this pattern is different
for both of them because Fahrenheit and
Celsius can be represented by one bit
zero zero or one we can in fear from
that what a bit zero or one might look
like in this pattern maybe you can pause
this video here and try to extract the
single bits from those packets but
there's a big problem here each single
dot is a point where you read the state
of the receiver and they are so little
compared to amount of spikes
thus maybe we missed some spikes or some
spikes appear wider or thinner even
though they were the same in proper
terms we have a way to low sampling rate
for the frequency of the input signal so
this arduino and laptop setup is a great
start but it's not very precise it is
enough to work out the protocol but next
video I want to show you how you can do
this a little bit more advanced and we
will start reversing the packets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
