participated in the local CTF where 1
third place because it was a CTF for
individuals the difficulty was not high
so I was able to solve many challenges
alone
I didn't record all challenges but let's
have a look at some of them I start with
the easy challenge which I really didn't
like the description says that we have
to identify unusual traffic in this
packet capture and contem the flag will
be the sha-256 hash of that number so
let's download and open that capture
while doing that I try to think what
could unusual packet mean that is not
really clear it highly depends on the
context of this network let's say I have
a capture traffic from a phone it could
be weird to see SSH traffic but when I
have a capture from a computer that
would be normal
unusual packets may be corrupted ones or
our packets out of order the hint also
says that those packets were sent by the
source so try to figure out what the
heck they mean I started with some
filters for what I think is the source
IP and start looking for packets that
are not typical packets on port 80 4 3 4
3 5 3 4 DNS at this point I give up on
the challenge and move on to something
else I wasted so much time not knowing
what to look for this is very
frustrating because the challenge
description is just not clear to me it
feels more like guessing rather than
showing knowledge or skill I feel like
the challenge should have required more
information a story what exactly we are
expected to find in there anyhow I will
later get the flag but on another way
but first let's move on to another
challenge I don't like these forensic
channels a lot so I was very happy to
see a reversing challenge reverse beer
apparently also pretty easy find the key
but the flag is not in a standard format
first criticism here can please tell me
what format the flag will have because
if you don't provide a flag format I
might have to start guessing and that
can be frustrating but let's see
so I download the file and check the
file format looks like a 32-bit Linux
binary that sounds great so continue and
open the binary in binary and jaw and in
parallel I try to run the binary on a
Linux system so here I have a 64-bit
Linux machine on digitalocean
but I can't execute the binary I was a
bit puzzled by that but then I
remembered I didn't install the 32-bit
libraries while they
installing I have a first look at the
assembler code so when I follow Maine I
immediately noticed a function call to P
trace and afterwards a jump not equal so
that is a simple anti debugging check
that can be simply bypassed by always
jumping to the code that continues you
can save the binary and continue to work
with that one on the Linux machine in
case you want to debug it but let's
continue here next we notice a call
string two unsigned long which will
convert a string to a number
afterwards we see these suspiciously
similar blocks in a row that looks very
interesting but first I want to run the
program and see what it does okay so we
have to provide a number as parameter I
didn't immediately go for the
interesting blocks because I felt I
didn't understand the binary yet and
wanted to get a better overview before
chasing something down so for example
this F function which seems to print
something and there are also these huge
ASCII art pictures that have a symbol
name but in a different language so I
translated those now I understand better
what I try to get to I don't want this
bad ASCII output
I want this good output so now I look at
the blocks in a row and see the compares
which probably eject the number we enter
each block takes the input number its
extracts a byte from it with masking and
shifting and then comparing it so the
first block doesn't shift so that's the
lowest byte the third block shifts by 8
bit so one byte and users test exe X
which means it's checking if the second
byte is zero then comes the second block
which verifies the third buy to be 6b
and the last block checks the last byte
with b1 ok now we have the correct
number which we can use as a key and it
works we have a different output and it
tells us that the key we found is the
flag by the way it's all Brooklyn's
fault because the CTF was organized by a
third party but stupid sexual jokes like
that drive some women out of the field
not cool ok so despite the flag format
not been cleared first the challenge was
telling you exactly what the flag is
though in my opinion this information
that the input key is the flag could
have been already disclosed in the
script
and would have been completely
unambiguous next up virtual lock-picking
for 350 I have no idea why this
challenge is worth 350 points and what
exactly it is supposed to teach you or
what kind of skill is required but
here's how I did it so I follow the
provide link and find this weird game
website looks like a small flash game or
something where you have to lockpick I
immediately noticed the draft egg and
the crate and see inside button which
sounds like this website is actually for
developing games and you can look into
the code so I look inside and get
presented these logical code blocks you
can drag and drop these blocks and
create a program that way so I'm just
clicking around and try to see if
something looks like logic that hides
the flag or whatever and eventually I
find this weird lonely blocked with a
basic c4 string at this moment it was
clear that I got the solution behind it
is a URL to an image which contains the
flag very easy didn't require any
hacking skills worth more than reversing
a Linux binary oh and before I forget it
here is how I solved the first challenge
I just wrote a simple Python script that
brute forces the flag I use a for loop
to count up the number of packets hash a
number with shower 256 and sent the
request through the CTF page and
eventually my script stopped because it
found the correct flag so I was gaming
the game still no idea what the unusual
packets are but as a hacker you
sometimes have to think around the
corner
