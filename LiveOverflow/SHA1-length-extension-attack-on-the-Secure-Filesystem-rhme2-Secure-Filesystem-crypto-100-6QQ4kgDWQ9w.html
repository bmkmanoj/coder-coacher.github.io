have set up everything we flashed a
challenge secured file system onto the
board and figured out how to interact
with it over serial connection we also
learned about using PI serial to speak
with the embedded device we are a Python
script this means we are ready to solve
some challenges
so when you connect the board with this
challenge loaded on it you can see the
following output on the serial console
it shows a list of files and our goal is
probably to read the passwd file but
let's first read the challenge
description secure filesystem we don't
remember why but we wanted a filesystem
on an AVR of 32 8p this is a
microcontroller on the other inner board
after the system was completed we
discovered that it lacked basic security
a couple of years later we came up with
what we think is a revolutionary way to
do file system permissions it is now
your task to fill in our shoes and test
its security the file system allows you
to request the contents of one or more
available files by using the following
format a token followed by a hash symbol
and then at least one file name followed
by multiple optional file names colon
separated and there are multiple example
requests to read different files for
example this one here would return the
content of cat dot txt and finances dot
CSV we already successfully did that in
the previous video so while I'm pretty
certain what the solution will be let's
have a look at the other examples and
approach it with an open mind because
maybe it's not what I think it is the
first thing we should notice is that the
tokens look pretty random especially
when you compare different tokens that
all request cat dot txt but in
combination with other files it will
completely change this means it's
unlikely that data is encoded in there
or that it follows a predictable pattern
that we could analyze statistically it's
very likely that it is a hash like a
password hash easy to compute and verify
but really hard to reverse from the
length I suspected to be a sha-1 hash I
didn't record this but at this moment we
could check if the filename or the
combination of the multiple file names
are simply hashed and that becomes a
token but it turns out it's not and at
this point I want to try out what I
suspected to be the solution because if
you see a token that presumably protects
or authenticate some data it might be
some kind of Mac message authentication
code a Mac or how it's here called the
taupe
can be used to prevent somebody else
from changing data and we don't know how
to generate a valid totem to request the
passwd file but a message authentication
code can be implemented in a weak way
and then you can mess with it and that
actually introduced this weakness in a
previous CTF video so let me play that
clip
now a very weak MEC implementation would
simply do the following it would take
the secret key and append the message it
wants to authenticate and then creates
an md5 hash of the whole string next
time it will receive a message and the
smack it can then take the secret key
again append the message calculate the
hash and compare it to the Mac if that's
the same the message is trusted this way
only somebody who knows the secret key
can calculate a correct hash well here
comes a mind-blowing part md5 is
vulnerable to a length extension attack
what does it mean and the five length
extension attack basically means that we
can add more characters to a string and
update the hash so that it stays valid
in this case we have an unknown secret
key with some characters we control
afterwards and we know the hash of one
valid message you would think you need
the secret key to calculate the new hash
but you can simply take the already
computed hash and develop message we
know and then extend it and update the
hash obviously it's not as simple there
are a few pitfalls if you would
completely implement it yourself like
petting and you would have to understand
how md5 is computed but we will now just
use a tool to do it for us the tool is
called hash pump in that video it was
about an md5 hash but sha-1 hash has the
same issue if we assume that the
embedded device has a secret key which
is prepended truly requested filenames
and then a hash is calculated around it
we should be able to attack this with a
length extension attack so let's start
to write our text rib and use hash pump
we import PI serial setup the serial
connection with the USB e0 device then
we can attempt to read from it right one
of the example tokens which would allow
us to read the cat txt and then read
again to get the content but when we run
it it doesn't work we read nothing I
assume that we read data too fast and
the board is just too slow with sending
so I write a little helper function
called read until which always reads
data from the serial connection until
the read data contains the string we
expect so now we
can read until the prompt appears when
we now test it it will take a second
until the board sends or something but
we are eventually able to read the
content then I install hash pump in the
Python module hash pump I hash Pompey
this allows easy access to the hash pump
utility from a Python script one problem
with this is that a hash length
extension attack has to know how long
the secret key is and we don't know that
but we can simply write a for loop that
just tries out all different lengths and
then we simply call the hash function we
give it the hedge we have the data we
know the data we want to append in this
case we want to append the passwd file
with colons also we don't know what is
in pepper so we get that file as well at
last we need the key left hash pump will
returned the updated hash and the new
message which contains the padding and
so forth we can also print the tested
key length with the data so we can later
see how long the secret key was then we
sent the new calculated updated token
with the hash symbol and D colon
separated file requests via serial to
the board then we should read until the
next prompt after each attempt so we
know the board is ready to get our next
request now we let it run and watch
ah there it looked like there was
something let's scroll back up yeah and
there it is the flag let's submit the
flag and collect our first 100 points
