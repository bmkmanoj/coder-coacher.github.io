this is one of those objects in modern
math that a lot of you might have heard
of but which can be really difficult to
understand
don't worry I'll explain that animation
that you just saw in a few minutes a lot
of people know about this function
because there's a 1 million dollar prize
out for anyone who can figure out when
it equals 0 an open problem known as the
Riemann hypothesis some of you may have
heard of it in the context of the
divergence some 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4
on and on up to infinity you see there's
a sense in which the sum equals negative
1/12 which seems nonsensical if not
obviously wrong but a common way to
define what this equation is actually
saying uses the Riemann zeta function
but as any casual mathan Thuy's iasts
who started to read into this knows its
definition references this one idea
called analytic continuation which has
to do with complex valued functions and
this idea can be frustratingly opaque
and unintuitive so what I'd like to do
here is just show you all what this zeta
function actually looks like and to
explain what this idea of analytic
continuation is in a visual and more
intuitive way I'm assuming that you know
about complex numbers and that you're
comfortable working with them and I'm
tempted to say that you should know
calculus since analytic continuation is
all about derivatives but for the way
I'm planning to present things I think
you might actually be fine without that
so to jump right into it let's just
define what this zeta function is for a
given input where we commonly use the
variable s the function is 1 over 1 to
the S which is always 1 plus 1 over 2 to
the S plus 1 over 3 to the S plus 1 over
4 to the S on and on and on summing up
over all natural numbers so for example
let's say you plug in a value like s
equals 2 you'd get 1 plus 1 over 4 plus
1 over 9 plus 1/16 and as you keep
adding more and more reciprocals of
squares this just so happens to approach
PI squared over 6 which is around 1.645
there's a very beautiful reason for why
pi shows up here
and I might do a video on it at a later
date but that's just the tip of the
iceberg for why this function is
beautiful you could do the same thing
for other inputs s like 3 or 4 and
sometimes you get other interesting
values and so far everything feels
pretty reasonable you're adding up
smaller and smaller amounts and these
sums approach some number great no
craziness here yet if you were to read
about it you might see some people say
that Zeta of negative 1 equals negative
112 but looking at this infinite sum
that doesn't make any sense
when you raise each term to the negative
1 flipping each fraction you get 1 plus
2 Plus 3 plus 4 on a non over all
natural numbers and obviously that
doesn't approach anything certainly not
negative 112 right and as any mercenary
looking into the Riemann hypothesis
knows this function is said to have
trivial zeros at negative even numbers
so for example that would mean that Zeta
of negative 2 equals 0 but when you plug
in negative 2 it gives you 1 plus 4 plus
9 plus 16 on and on which again
obviously doesn't approach anything much
less 0 right well we'll get 2 negative
values in a few minutes but for right
now let's just say the only thing that
seems reasonable this function only
makes sense when s is greater than 1
which is when this sum converges so far
it's simply not defined for other values
now with that said bernhard riemann was
somewhat of a father to complex analysis
which is the study of functions that
have complex numbers as inputs and
outputs so rather than just thinking
about how this sum takes a number s on
the real number line to another number
on the real number line his main focus
was on understanding what happens when
you plug in a complex value for s so for
example maybe instead of plugging in 2
you would plug in 2 plus i now if you've
never seen the idea of raising a number
to the power of a complex value it can
feel kind of strange at first because it
no longer has anything to do with
repeated multiplication but
mathematicians found that there is a
very nice and very natural way to extend
the definition of exponents beyond their
familiar territory of real numbers and
into the realm of complex values it's
not super crucial to understand complex
exponents for where I'm going with this
video but I think it'll still be nice if
we just summarize the gist of it here
the basic idea is that when you write
something like 1/2 to the power of a
complex number you split it up as 1/2 to
the real part times 1/2 to the pure
imaginary part we're good on 1/2 to the
real part there's no issues there but
what about raising something to a pure
imaginary number well the result is
going to be some complex number on the
unit circle in the complex plane as you
let that pure imaginary input walk up
and down the imaginary line the
resulting output walks around that unit
circle for a base like 1/2 the output
walks around the unit circle somewhat
slowly but for a base that's farther
away from 1 like 1/9 then as you let
this input walk up and down the
imaginary axis the corresponding output
is going to walk around the unit circle
more quickly if you've never seen this
and you're wondering why on earth this
happens I've left a few links to good
resources in the description for here
I'm just going to move forward with the
what without the why the main takeaway
is that when you raise something like
1/2 to the power of 2 plus I which is
1/2 squared times 1/2 to the I that 1/2
to the I part is going to be on the unit
circle meaning it has an absolute value
of 1 so when you multiply it it doesn't
change the size of the number it just
takes that 1/4 and rotates it somewhat
so if you were to plug in two plus I to
the zeta function one way to think about
what it does is to start off with all of
the terms raised to the power of two
which you can think of as piecing
together lines whose lengths are the
reciprocals of squares of numbers which
like I said before converges to PI
squared over 6 then when you change that
input from 2 up to 2 plus I each of
these lines gets rotated by some amount
but importantly the lengths of those
lines won't change so the sum still
converges it just does so in a spiral to
some specific point on the complex plane
here let me show what it looks like when
I vary the input s represented with this
yellow dot on the complex plane where
this spiral sum is always going to be
showing the converging value for Zeta of
s
you
what this means is that Zeta of s
defined as this infinite sum is a
perfectly reasonable complex function as
long as the real part of the input is
greater than 1 meaning the input s sits
somewhere on this right half of the
complex plane again this is because it's
the real part of s that determines the
size of each number while the imaginary
part just dictates some rotation so now
what I want to do is visualize this
function it takes in inputs on the right
half of the complex plane and spits out
outputs somewhere else in the complex
plane a super nice way to understand
complex functions is to visualize them
as transformations meaning you look at
every possible input to the function and
just let it move over to the
corresponding output for example let's
take a moment and try to visualize
something a little bit easier than the
zeta function say F of s is equal to s
squared when you plug in s equals 2 you
get 4 so we'll end up moving that point
at 2 over 2 the point at 4 when you plug
in negative 1 you get 1 so the point
over here at negative 1 is going to end
up moving over to the point at 1 when
you plug in I by definition its square
is negative 1 so it's going to move over
here to negative 1
now I'm going to add on a more colorful
grid and this is just because things are
about to start moving and it's kind of
nice to have something to distinguish
grid lines during that movement from
here
I'll tell the computer to move every
single point on this grid over to its
corresponding output under the function
f of s equals s squared here's what it
looks like
that can be a lot to take in so I'll go
ahead and play it again and this time
focus on one of the marked points and
notice how it moves over to the point
corresponding to its square it can be a
little complicated to see all of the
points moving all at once but the reward
is that this gives us a very rich
picture for what the complex function is
actually doing and it all happens in
just two dimensions so back to the zeta
function we have this infinite sum which
is a function of some complex number s
and we feel good and happy about
plugging in values of s whose real part
is greater than 1 and getting some
meaningful output via the converging
spiral song so to visualize this
function I'm going to take the portion
of the grid sitting on the right side of
the complex plane here where the real
part of numbers is greater than 1 and
I'm going to tell the computer to move
each point of this grid to the
appropriate output it actually helps if
I add a few more grid lines around the
number one since that region gets
stretched out by quite a bit all right
so first of all let's all just
appreciate how beautiful that is I mean
damn that doesn't make you want to learn
more about complex functions you have no
heart but also this transformed grid is
just begging to be extended a little bit
for example
let's highlight these lines here which
represent all of the complex numbers
with imaginary part I or negative I
after the transformation these lines
make such lovely arcs before they just
abruptly stop don't you want to just you
know continue those arcs in fact you can
imagine how some altered version of the
function with a definition that extends
into this left half of the plane might
be able to complete this picture with
something that's quite pretty well this
is exactly what mathematicians working
with complex functions do they continue
the function beyond the original domain
where it was defined now as soon as we
branch over into inputs where the real
part is less than 1 this infinite sum
that we originally use
to define the function doesn't make
sense anymore you'll get nonsense like
adding one plus two plus three plus four
on and on up to infinity but just
looking at this transformed version of
the right half of the plane where the
sum does make sense
it's just begging us to extend the set
of points that we're considering as
inputs even if that means defining the
extended function in some way that
doesn't necessarily use that sum of
course that leaves us with the question
how would you define that function on
the rest of the plane you might think
that you could extend it any number of
ways maybe you define an extension that
makes it so the point at say S equals
negative 1 moves over to negative 1/12
but maybe you squiggle on some extension
that makes it land on any other value I
mean as soon as you open yourself up to
the idea of defining the function
differently for values outside that
domain of convergence that is not based
on this infinite sum the world is your
oyster
and you can have any number of
extensions right well not exactly I mean
yes you can give any child a marker and
have them extend these lines any which
way but if you add on the restriction
that this new extended function has to
have a derivative everywhere it walks us
into one and only one possible extension
I know I know I said that you wouldn't
need to know about derivatives for this
video and even if you do know calculus
maybe you have yet to learn how to
interpret derivatives for complex
functions but luckily for us there is a
very nice geometric intuition that you
can keep in mind for when I say a phrase
like has a derivative everywhere here to
show you what I mean let's look back at
that f of s equals s squared example
again we think of this function as a
transformation moving every point s of
the complex plane over to the point s
squared for those of you who know
calculus you know that you can take the
derivative of this function at any given
input but there's an interesting
property of that transformation that
turns out to be related and almost
equivalent to that fact
if you look at any two lines in the
input space that intersect at some angle
and consider what they turn into after
the transformation they will still
intersect each other at that same angle
the lines might get curved and that's
okay but the important part is that the
angle at which they intersect remains
unchanged and this is true for any pair
of lines that you choose so when I say a
function has a derivative everywhere I
want you to think about this angle
preserving property that anytime two
lines intersect the angle between them
remains unchanged after the
transformation at a glance this is
easiest to appreciate by noticing how
all of the curves that the gridlines
turn into still intersect each other at
right angles complex functions that have
a derivative everywhere are called
analytic so you can think of this term
analytic as meaning angle preserving
admittedly I'm lying to you a little
here but only a little bit a slight
caveat for those of you who want the
full details is that at inputs where the
derivative of a function is zero instead
of angle being preserved
they get multiplied by some integer but
those points are by far the minority and
for almost all inputs to an analytic
function angles are preserved so if when
I say analytic you think angle
preserving I think that's a fine
intuition to have
now if you think about it for a moment
and this is a point that I really want
you to appreciate this is a very
restrictive property the angle between
any pair of intersecting lines has to
remain unchanged and yet pretty much any
function out there that has a name turns
out to be analytic the field of complex
analysis which Riemann helped to
establish in its modern form is almost
entirely about leveraging the properties
of analytic functions to understand
results in patterns and other fields of
math and science the zeta function
defined by this infinite sum on the
right half of the plane is an analytic
function notice how all of these curves
that the gridlines turn into still
intersect each other at right angles so
the surprising fact about complex
functions is that if you want to extend
an analytic function beyond the domain
where it was originally defined for
example extending this zeta function
into the left half of the plane then if
you require that the new extended
function still be analytic that is that
it still preserves angles everywhere it
forces you into only one possible
extension if one exists at all it's kind
of like an infinite continuous jigsaw
puzzle where this requirement of
preserving angles walks you into one and
only one choice for how to extend it
this process of extending an analytic
function in the only way possible that
still analytic is called as you may have
guessed analytic continuation so that's
how the full Riemann zeta function is
defined for values of s on the right
half of the plane where the real part is
greater than one just plug them into
this sum and see where it converges and
that convergence might look like some
kind of spiral since raising each of
these terms to a complex power has the
effect of rotating each one then for the
rest of the plane we know that there
exists one and only one way to extend
this definition so that the function
will still be analytic that is so that
it still preserves angles at every
single point so we just say that by
definition the zeta function on the left
half of the plane
is whatever that extension happens to be
and that's a valid definition because
there's only one possible analytic
continuation notice that's a very
implicit definition
it just says use the solution of this
jigsaw puzzle which through more
abstract derivation we know must exist
but it doesn't specify exactly how to
solve it
mathematicians have a pretty good grasp
on what this extension looks like but
some important parts of it remain a
mystery
a million-dollar mystery in fact let's
actually take a moment and talk about
the Riemann hypothesis the
million-dollar problem the places where
this function equals zero turn out to be
quite important that is which points get
mapped onto the origin after the
transformation one thing we know about
this extension is that the negative even
numbers get mapped to zero these are
commonly called the trivial zeros the
naming here stems from a long-standing
tradition of mathematicians to call
things trivial when they understand it
quite well even when it's a fact that is
not at all obvious from the outset we
also know that the rest of the points
that get mapped to zero sits somewhere
in this vertical strip called the
critical strip and the specific
placement of those non-trivial zeros
encodes a surprising information about
prime numbers it's actually pretty
interesting why this function carries so
much information about primes and I
definitely think I'll make a video about
that later on but right now things are
long enough so I'll leave it unexplained
riemann hypothesized that all of these
non-trivial zeros sit right in the
middle of the script on the line of
numbers s whose real part is 1/2 this is
called the critical line if that's true
it gives us a remarkably tight grasp on
the pattern of prime numbers as well as
many other patterns in math that stem
from this now so far when I've shown
what the zeta function looks like I've
only shown what it does to the portion
of the grid on the screen and that kind
of under cells its complexity so if I
were to highlight this critical line and
apply the transformation it might not
seem to cross the origin at all however
here's what the transformed version of
more
more of that line looks like notice how
it's passing through the number zero
many many times if you can prove that
all of the non-trivial zeros sit
somewhere on this line the clay math
Institute gives you 1 million dollars
and you'd also be proving hundreds if
not thousands of modern math results
that have already been shown contingent
on this hypothesis being true
another thing we know about this
extended function is that it Maps the
point negative 1 over 2 negative 1 12
and if you plug this into the original
sum it looks like we're saying 1 plus 2
Plus 3 plus 4 on and on up to infinity
equals negative 1 12 now it might seem
disingenuous to still call this a sum
since the definition of the zeta
function on the left half of the plane
is not defined directly from this sum
instead it comes from analytically
continuing the sum beyond the domain
where it converges that is solving the
jigsaw puzzle that began on the right
half of the plane that said you have to
admit that the uniqueness of this
analytic continuation the fact that the
jigsaw puzzle has only one solution is
very suggestive of some intrinsic
connection between these extended values
and the original sum for the last
animation and this is actually pretty
cool I'm going to show you guys what the
derivative of the zeta function looks
like but before that it matters to me to
let you guys know who's making these
videos possible first and foremost
there's the viewers like you
supporting directly on patreon and this
particular video was also supported in

he says about chess and Tai Chi
translates pretty meaningfully to
learning math as well especially what he
says about starting with the endgame you
