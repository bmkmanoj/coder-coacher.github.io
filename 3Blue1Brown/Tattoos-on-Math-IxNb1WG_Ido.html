out-of-the-ordinary video for you today
a friend of mine cam recently got a math
tattoo it's not something I'd recommend
but he told his team at work that if
they reached a certain stretch goal it's
something that he'd do and well the
incentive worked Cam's initials are CSC
which happens to be the shorthand for
the cosecant function in trigonometry so
what he decided to do is make his tattoo
a certain geometric representation of
what that function means it's kind of
like a wordless signature written in
pure math it got me thinking though
about why on earth we teach students
about the trigonometric functions
cosecant secant and cotangent and it
occurred to me that there's something
kind of poetic about this particular
tattoo just as tattoos are artificially
painted on but become permanent as if
they were a core part of the recipients
flesh the fact that the cosecant is a
named function is kind of an artificial
construct on math trigonometry could
just as well have existed intact without
the cosecant ever being named but
because it was it has this strange and
artificial permanence in our conventions
and to some extent in our education
system in other words the cosecant is
not just a tattoo on cams chest it's a
tattoo on math itself something which
seemed reasonable and even worthy of
immortality at its inception but which
doesn't necessarily hold up as time goes
on here let me actually show you all a
picture of the tattoo that he chose
because not a lot of people know the
geometric representation of the cosecant
whenever you have an angle typically
represented with the Greek letter theta
it's common in trigonometry to relate it
to a corresponding point on the unit
circle the circle with a radius one
centered at the origin in the xy-plane
most trigonometry students learn that
the distance between this point here on
the circle and the x-axis is the sine of
the angle and the distance between that
point and the y-axis is the cosine of
the angle and these links give a really
wonderful understanding for what cosine
and sine are all about people might
learn that the tangent of an angle is
sine divided by cosine and that the
cotangent is the other way around cosine
divided by sine but relatively few learn
that there's also a nice geometric
interpretation for each of those
quantities if you draw a line tangent to
the circle at this point the distance
from that point to the x axis along that
tangent is well the tangent of the angle
and the distance along that line to the
point where it hits the y-axis well
that's the cotangent of the angle again
this gives a really intuitive feel for
what those quantities mean you kind of
imagine tweaking that theta and seeing
when cotangent gets smaller when tangent
gets larger and it's a good gut check
for any students working with them
likewise secant which is defined as one
divided by the cosine and cosecant which
is defined as one divided by the sine of
theta each have their own places on this
diagram if you look at that point where
this tangent line crosses the x axis the
distance from that point to the origin
is the secant of the angle that is one
divided by the cosine likewise the
distance between where this tangent line
crosses the y axis and the origin is the
cosecant of the angle that is one
divided by the sine if you're wondering
why on earth that's true notice that we
have two similar right triangles here
one small one inside the circle and this
larger triangle whose hypotenuse is
resting on the y-axis
I'll leave it to you to check that that
interior angle up at the tip there is
theta the angle that we originally
started with over inside the circle now
for each one of those triangles I want
you to think about the ratio of the
length of the side opposite theta to the
length of the hypotenuse for the small
triangle the length of the opposite side
is sine of theta and the hypotenuse is
that radius the one that we define to
have length one
so the ratio is just sine of theta
divided by one now when we look at the
larger triangle the side opposite theta
is that radial line of length 1 and the
hypotenuse is now this length on the
y-axis the one that I'm claiming is the
cosecant if you take the reciprocal of
each side here you see that this matches
up with the fact that the cosecant of
theta is 1 divided by sine kind of cool
right it's also kind of nice that sine
tangent and secant all correspond to
lengths of lines that somehow go to the
x-axis and then the corresponding cosine
cotangent and cosecant are all then
lengths of lines going to the
corresponding spots on the y-axis and on
a diagram like this it might be pleasing
that all six of these are separately
named functions but in any practical use
of trigonometry you can get by just
using sine cosine and tangent in fact if
you really wanted you could define all
six of these in terms of sine alone but
the sort of things the cosine and
tangent correspond to come up frequently
enough that it's more convenient to give
them their own names but cosecant secant
and cotangent never really come up in
problem solving in a way that's not just
as convenient to write in terms of sine
cosine and tangent at that point it's
really just adding more words for
students to learn with not that much
added utility and if anything if you
only introduced secant as 1 over cosign
and cosecant as 1 over sine the mismatch
of this Co prefix is probably just an
added point of confusion in a class
that's prone enough to confusion for
many of its students
the reason that all six of these
functions have separate names by the way
is that before computers and calculators
if you were doing trigonometry maybe cuz
you're a sailor or an astronomer or some
kind of engineer you would find the
values for these functions using large
charts that just recorded known
input-output pairs and when you can't
easily plug in something like 1 divided
by the sine of 30 degrees into a
calculator it might actually make sense
to have a dedicated column to this value
with a dedicated name and if you have a
diagram like this one in mind when
you're taking measurements with sine
tangent and secant having nicely
mirrored meanings to cosine cotangent
and cosecant calling this cosecant
instead of 1 divided by sine might
actually make some sense and it might
actually make it easier to remember what
it means geometrically but times have
changed and most use cases for trig just
don't involve charts of values and
diagrams like this hence the cosecant
and it's brothers are tattoos on math
ideas whose permanence in our
conventions is our own doing not the
result of nature itself and in general I
actually think this is a good lesson for
any student learning a new piece of math
at whatever level you just got to take a
moment and ask yourself whether what
you're learning is core to the flesh of
math itself and to nature itself or if
what you're looking at is actually just
inked on to the subject and could just
as easily have been inked on in some
completely other way before you go I've
got a book recommendation for you meant
primarily for those of you who don't
already listen to audiobooks you see
this video was supported by audible.com
which as many of you know provides audio
books and other audio materials and if
you go to audibletrial.com/preneurcast
this is actually what I listen to right
after the art of learning which is what
I recommend it to you guys at the end of
the last video on the zeta-function
since the author of the art of learning
was actually a big fan of zen and the
art of motorcycle maintenance actually I
ended up listening to it twice since
it's just that kind of book it's very
unusual in a way that feels neither like
fiction nor
fiction it's really philosophical and
very thought-provoking but at the same
time it's a powerful lesson in empathy
and storytelling and what's more the
version that you can hear on audible.com
is beautifully read again if you go to
audibletrial.com/preneurcast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
