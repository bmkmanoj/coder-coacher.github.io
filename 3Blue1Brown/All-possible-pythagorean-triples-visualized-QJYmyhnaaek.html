Pythagorean theorem that the sum of the
squares of the two shorter sides on a
right triangle always equals the square
of its hypotenuse I'm guessing that you
came to be pretty familiar with a few
examples like the 3 4 5 triangle or the
5 12 13 triangle and I think it's easy
to take for granted that these even
exist examples were the sum of two
perfect squares happens to be a perfect
square but keep in mind for comparison
if you were to change that exponent to
any whole number bigger than two you go
from having many integer solutions to no
solutions whatsoever
this is fair Moz famous Last Theorem now
there's a special name for any triplet
of whole numbers ABC where a squared
plus B squared equals C squared it's
called a Pythagorean triple and what
we're going to do here is find every
single possible example and moreover
we'll do so in a way where you can
visualize how all of these triples fit
together this is an old question pretty
much as old as they come in math there
are some Babylonian clay tablets from
1800 BC more than a millennium before
Pythagoras himself that just lists these
triples and by the way while we're
talking about the Pythagorean theorem it
would be a shame not to share my
favorite proof for anyone who hasn't
already seen this you start off by
drawing a square on each side of the
triangle and if you take that C Square
and add four copies of the original
triangle around it you can get a big
square whose side lengths are a plus B
but you can also arrange the a square in
the B Square together with four copies
of the original triangle to get a big
square whose side lengths are a plus B
what this means is that the negative
space in each of these diagrams the area
of that big square minus 4 times the
area of the triangle is from one
perspective clearly a squared plus B
squared but from another perspective
it's C squared
anyway back to the question of finding
whole number solutions start by
reframing the question slightly among
all of the points on the plane with
integer coordinates that is all of these
lattice points where gridlines cross
which ones are a whole number distance
away from the origin
for example the point 3 4 is a distance
5 away from the origin and the point 12
5 is a distance 13 away from the origin
the question of finding Pythagorean
triples is completely equivalent to
finding lattice points which are a whole
number distance away from the origin of
course for most points like 2 1 the
distance from the origin is not a whole
number but it is at least the square
root of a whole number in this case 2
squared plus 1 squared is 5 so that
distance that hypotenuse there is the
square root of 5 now taking what might
seem like a strange step but one which
will justify itself in just a moment
think of this as the complex plane so
that every one of these points like 2 1
here is actually an individual complex
number in this case 2 plus I what this
gives is a surprisingly simple way to
modify it to get a new point whose
distance away from the origin is
guaranteed to be a whole number just
square it algebraically when you square
a complex number expanding out this
product and matching up all of the like
terms because everything here just
involves multiplying and adding integers
each component of the result is
guaranteed to be an integer in this case
you get 3 plus 4i but you can also think
of complex multiplication more
geometrically you take this line drawn
from the origin to the number and
consider the angle it makes with the
horizontal axis as well as its length
which in this case is the square root of
5 the effect of multiplying anything by
this complex number is to rotate it by
that angle and to stretch out by a
factor equal to that length so when you
multiply the number by itself the effect
is to double that angle and importantly
to square its length
since the length started off as the
square root of some whole number this
resulting length is guaranteed to be a
whole number in this case five here
let's try it with another example start
off with some complex number that has
integer coordinates like 3 plus 2i in
this case the distance between this
number in the origin is the square root
of 3 squared plus 2 squared which is the
square root of 13 now multiply this
complex number by itself the real part
comes out to 3 squared plus 2i squared
which is 9 minus 4 and the imaginary
part is 3 times 2 plus 2 times 3 so the
result is 5 plus 12i and the magnitude
of this new number is 13 the square of
the magnitude of their starting number 3
plus 2i so simply squaring our randomly
chosen lattice point gives us the 5 12
13 triangle there's something kind of
magical about actually watching this
work it almost feels like cheating you
can start with any randomly chosen
lattice point like 4 plus I and just by
taking it square
you generate a Pythagorean triple in
this case 4 plus I squared is 15 plus 8i
which has a distance 17 away from the
origin if you play around with this
which I encourage you to do you'll find
that some of the results are kind of
boring if both the coordinates of your
starting point are the same or if one of
them is 0 then the triple at the end is
going to include a 0 for example 2 plus
2i squared gives 8 I and even though
technically this is indeed a lattice
point a whole number distance away from
the origin the triple that it
corresponds to is 0 squared plus 8
squared equals 8 squared which isn't
exactly something to write home about
but for the most part this method of
squaring complex numbers is a
surprisingly simple way to generate
non-trivial Pythagorean triples and you
can even generalize it to get a nice
formula if you write the coordinates of
your initial point as U and V then when
you work out u plus VI squared the real
part is u squared minus V squared and
the imaginary part
is two times UV the resulting distance
from the origin is going to be u squared
plus V squared it's kind of fun to work
out this expression algebraically and
see that it does indeed check out and
it's also fun to plug in some random
integers for U and V and get out a
Pythagorean triple essentially we've
created a machine where you give it any
pair of integers and it gives you back
some Pythagorean triple a really nice
way to visualize this which will be
familiar to any of you who watch the
zeta-function video is to watch every
point of Z on the plane move over to the
point Z squared so for example the point
3 plus 2i is going to move over to 5
plus 12i the point I is going to rotate
90 degrees to its square negative 1 the
point negative 1 is going to move over
to 1 and so on now when you do this to
every single point on the plane
including the gridlines which I'll make
more colorful so they're easier to
follow here's what it looks like so the
grid lines all get turned into these
parabolic arcs and every point where
these arcs intersect is a place way
lattice point landed so it corresponds
to some Pythagorean triple that is if
you draw a triangle whose hypotenuse is
the line between any one of these points
and the origin and whose legs are
parallel to the axes all three side
lengths of that triangle will be whole
numbers what I love about this is that
usually when you view Pythagorean
triples just on their own they seem
completely random and unconnected and
you'd be tempted to say there's no
pattern but here we have a lot of them
sitting together really organized just
sitting on the intersections of these
nicely spaced curves
now you might ask if this accounts for
every possible Pythagorean triple sadly
it does not for example you will never
get the point six plus a tie using this
method
even though 6 8 10 is a perfectly valid
Pythagorean triple there are simply no
integers U and V where u plus VI squared
is 6 plus 8i likewise you will never hit
9 plus 12i but these don't really feel
like anything new
do they since you can get each one of
them by scaling up the familiar triple 3
4 5 which is accounted for in our method
in fact for reasons that I'll explain
shortly every possible Pythagorean
triple that we miss is just some
multiple of a different triple that we
hit to give another example we missed
the point 4 plus 3i there are no
integers U and V so that u plus VI
squared is 4 plus 3i in fact you'll
never hit any points whose imaginary
component is odd however we do hit 8
plus 6i that's 3 plus I squared so even
though we miss 4 plus 3i it's just 1
half times the point that we do hit and
by the way you'll never have to scale
down by anything smaller than 1/2 a nice
way to think about these multiples that
we miss is to take each point that we
get using this squaring method and draw
a line from the origin through that
point out to infinity marking all of the
lattice points that this line hits will
account for any multiples of these
points that we might have missed
doing this for all possible points
you'll account for every possible
Pythagorean triple every right triangle
that you ever have seen or ever will see
that has whole number side lengths is
accounted for somewhere in this diagram
to see why will now shift to a different
view of the Pythagorean triple problem
one that involves finding points on a
unit circle that have rational
coordinates if you take the expression a
squared plus B squared equals C squared
and divide out by that C squared what
you get is a over C squared plus B over
C squared equals one this gives us some
point on the unit circle x squared plus
y squared equals one whose coordinates
are each rational numbers this is what
we call a rational point of the unit
circle and going the other way around if
you find some rational point on the unit
circle when you multiply out by a common
denominator for each of those
coordinates what you'll land on is a
point that has integer coordinates and
whose distance from the origin is also
an integer with that in mind consider
our diagram where we squared every
possible lattice point and then drew
these radial lines through each one to
account for any multiples that we might
have missed if you project all of these
points onto the unit circle each one
moving along its corresponding radial
line what you'll end up with is a whole
bunch of rational points on that circle
and keep in mind by the way I'm drawing
only finitely many of these dots and
lines but if I drew all infinitely many
lines corresponding to every possible
squared lattice point it would actually
fill every single pixel of the screen
now if our method was incomplete if we
were missing a Pythagorean triple out
there somewhere it would mean that
there's some rational point on this
circle that we never hit once we project
everything on to the circle and let me
show you why that cannot happen take any
one of those rational points and draw a
line between it and the point at
negative one
when you compute the rise over run slope
of this line the rise between the two
points is rational and the run is also
rational
so the slope itself is just going to be
some rational number so if we can show
that our method of squaring complex
numbers it counts for every possible
rational slope here it's going to
guarantee that we hit every possible
rational point of the unit circle right
well let's think through our method we
start off with some point u plus VI that
has integer coordinates and this number
makes some angle off of the horizontal
which I'm going to call theta squaring
this number the resulting angle off the
horizontal is 2 times theta and of
course when you project that onto the
unit circle it's along the same radial
line so the corresponding rational point
of the unit circle also has that same
angle 2 times theta and here I'll bring
in a nice little bit of circle geometry
which is that anytime you have an angle
between two points on the circumference
of a circle and it's Center that turns
out to be exactly 2 times the angle made
by those same points and any other point
on the circle circumference provided
that that other point isn't between the
original two points what this means for
our situation is that the line between
negative 1 and the rational point on the
circle must make an angle theta with the
horizontal in other words that line has
the same slope as the line between the
origin and our initial complex number u
plus VI but look at the rise over run
slope of the line defined by a choice of
integers U and V the slope is V divided
by U and of course we can choose V and U
to be whatever integers we want and
therefore we do indeed account for every
possible rational slope so there you go
the radial lines from our method
determined by all possible choices of U
and V must pass through every rational
point on this circle and that means our
method must hit every possible
Pythagorean triple
if you haven't already watched the video
about pie hiding and prime regularities
the topics there are highly related to
the ones here it also involves some
pretty surprising things that happen
when you reframe a problem about lattice
points in terms of complex numbers so
I'd say that that video pairs
particularly well with this one both
this video and that were supported in
part by remix who's looking to recruit
software engineers particularly those
with some background in math which could
potentially mean from among some of you
remix makes a planning platform for
public transit this means offering a
product to cities that helps them find
the most efficient and cost-effective
ways to serve the communities and
demographics that they want what they
provide is already leaps and bounds
ahead of how many cities go about this
problem but they're always pushing to
make things better which opens the doors
to some seriously interesting
optimization problems for those of you
in a position to be applying to a place
like this you'd get to work with an
incredibly capable team tackling
problems that lie nicely in that
intersection of stuff that matters and
stuff that's interesting there are links
