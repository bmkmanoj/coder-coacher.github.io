the experience of your heart rate
increasing and excitement while you are
imagining an infinitely large lake with
lighthouses around it well if you feel
anything like I do about math that is
gonna change by the end of this video
take 1 plus 1/4 plus 1/9 plus 1/16 and
so on where you're adding the inverses
of the next square number what does this
sum approach as you keep adding on more
and more terms now this is a challenge
that remained unsolved for ninety years
after it was initially posed until
finally it was Euler who found the
answer super surprisingly to be pi
squared divided by 6 I mean isn't that
crazy what is pi doing here and why is
it squared we don't usually see it
squared in honor of Euler whose hometown
was Basel this infinite sum is often
referred to as the Basel problem but the
proof that I'd like to show you is very
different from the one that we had I've
said in a previous video that whenever
you see PI show up there will be some
connection to circles and there are
those who like to say that pi is not
fundamentally about circles and
insisting on connecting equations like
these ones with a geometric or intuition
stems from a stubborn insistence on only
understanding pi in the context where we
first discovered it and that's all well
and good but whatever your own
perspective holds as fundamental fact is
pi is very much tied to circles so if
you see a show up there will be a path
somewhere in the massive interconnected
web of mathematics leading you back to
circles in geometry the question is just
how long and convoluted that path might
be and in the case of the basil problem
it's a lot shorter than you might first
think and it all starts with light
here's the basic idea
imagine standing at the origin of a
positive number line and putting a
little lighthouse on all of the positive
integers 1 2 3 4 and so on that first
lighthouse has some apparent brightness
from your point of view some amount of
energy that your eye is receiving from
the light per unit time
and let's just call that a brightness of
one for reasons I'll explain shortly the
apparent brightness of the second
lighthouse is 1/4 as much as the first
and the apparent brightness of the third
is 1/9 as much as the first and then
1/16 and so on and you can probably see
why this is useful for the basal problem
it gives us a physical representation of
what's being asked
since the brightness received from the
whole infinite line of lighthouses is
going to be 1 plus 1/4 plus 1/9 plus the
16 and so on so the result that we are
aiming to show is that this total
brightness is equal to pi squared
divided by 6 times the brightness of
that first lighthouse an efforts that
might seem useless I mean we're just
reacting the same original question but
the progress comes from a new question
that this framing raises are there ways
that we can rearrange these lighthouses
that don't change the total brightness
for the observer and if so can you show
this to be equivalent to a setup that
somehow easier to compute to start let's
be clear about what we mean when we
reference apparent brightness to an
observer imagine a little screen which
maybe represents the retina of your eye
or a digital camera sensor or something
like that you could ask what proportion
of the Rays coming out of the source hit
that screen or phrase differently what
is the angle between the ray hitting the
bottom of that screen and the ray
hitting the top or rather since we
should be thinking of these lights as
being in three dimensions it might be
more accurate to ask what is the angle
the light covers in both directions
perpendicular to the source in spherical
geometry you sometimes talk about the
solid angle of a shape which is the
proportion of a sphere it covers as
viewed from a given point you see the
first of two places this story we're
thinking of screens is going to be
useful is in understanding the inverse
square law which is a distinctly
three-dimensional phenomenon think of
all of the rays of light hitting a
screen one unit away from the source as
you double the distance those rays will
now cover an area with twice the width
and twice the height so it would take 4
copies of that original screen to
received the same raise at that distance
and so each individual one receives
one-fourth as much late this is the
sense in which I mean a light would
appear 1/4 is bright two times the
distance away likewise when you're three
times farther away you would need nine
copies of that original screen to
receive the same rays so each individual
screen only receives 1/9 as much light
and this pattern continues because the
area hit by a light increases by the
square of the distance the brightness of
that light decreases by the inverse
square of that distance and as I'm sure
many of you know this inverse square law
is not at all special to light it pops
up whenever you have some kind of
quantity that spreads out evenly from a
point source whether that's sound or
heat or radio signal things like that
and remember it's because of this
inverse square law that an infinite
array of evenly spaced lighthouses
physically implements the basel problem
but again what we need if we're gonna
make any progress here is to understand
how we can manipulate setups with light
sources like this without changing the
total brightness for the observer and
the key building block is an especially
nice way to transform a single
lighthouse into to think of an observer
at the origin of the XY plane and a
single lighthouse sitting out somewhere
on that plane now draw a line from that
lighthouse to the observer and then
another line perpendicular to that one
at the lighthouse now place two
lighthouses where this new line
intersects the coordinate axes which
I'll go ahead and call lighthouse a over
here on the left and lighthouse B on the
upper side it turns out and you'll see
why this is true in just a minute
the brightness that the observer
experiences from that first lighthouse
is equal to the combined brightness
experienced from lighthouses a and B
together and I should say by the way
that the standing assumption throughout
this video is that all lighthouses are
equivalent they're using the same light
bulb emanating the same power all of
that so in other words assigning
variables to things here if we call the
distance from the observer to lighthouse
a little a and the distance from the
observer to lighthouse B
little B and the distance to the first
lighthouse H we have the relation 1 over
a squared plus 1 over B squared equals 1
over H squared this is the much less
well known inverse Pythagorean theorem
which some of you may recognize from
mythologies most recent and also most
excellent video on the many cousins of
the Pythagorean theorem pretty cool
relation don't you think and if you're a
mathematician at heart you might be
asking right now how you prove it and
there are some straightforward ways
where you express the triangles area in
two separate ways and apply the usual
Pythagorean theorem but there is another
quite pretty method that I'd like to
briefly outline here that Falls much
more nicely into our storyline because
again it uses intuitions of light and
screens imagine scaling down the whole
right triangle into a tinier version and
think of this miniature hypotenuse as a
screen receiving light from the first
lighthouse
if you reshape that screen to be the
combination of the two legs of the
miniature triangle like this well it
still receives the same amount of light
right I mean the rays of light hitting
one of those two legs are precisely the
same as the Rays that hit the hypotenuse
then the key is that the amount of light
from the first lighthouse that hits this
left side the limited angle of rays that
end up hitting that screen is exactly
the same as the amount of light over
here coming from lighthouse a which hits
that side it'll be the same angle of
rays and symmetrically the amount of
light from the first house hitting the
bottom portion of our screen is the same
as the amount of light hitting that
portion from lighthouse B why you might
ask well it's a matter of similar
triangles
this animation already gives you a
strong hint for how it works and we've
also left a link in the description to a
simple geogebra applet for those of you
who want to think this through in a
slightly more interactive environment
and in playing with that one important
fact here that you'll be able to see is
that these similar triangles only apply
in the limiting case for a very tiny
screen
all right buckle up now cuz here's where
things get good we've got this inverse
Pythagorean theorem right and that's
going to let us transform a single
lighthouse into two others without
changing the brightness experienced by
the observer with that in hand and no
small amount of cleverness we can use
this to build up the infinite array that
we need picture yourself at the edge of
a circular lake directly opposite a
lighthouse we're going to want it to be
the case that the distance between you
and the lighthouse along the border of
the lake is one so we'll say the lake
has a circumference of two now the
apparent brightness is 1 divided by the
diameter squared and in this case the
diameter is that circumference 2 divided
by pi so the apparent brightness works
out to be pi squared divided by 4 now
for our first transformation draw a new
circle twice as big so circumference 4
and draw a tangent line to the top of
the small circle then replace the
original lighthouse with two new ones
where this tangent line intersects the
larger circle an important fact from
geometry that we'll be using over and
over here is that if you take the
diameter of a circle and form a triangle
with any point on the circle the angle
at that new point will always be 90
degrees the significance of that in our
diagram here is that it means the
inverse Pythagorean theorem applies and
the brightness from those two new
lighthouses equals the brightness from
the first one namely pi squared divided
by 4 as the next step draw a new circle
twice as big as the last with a
circumference 8 now for each lighthouse
take a line from that lighthouse through
the top of the smaller circle which is
the center of the larger circle and
consider the two points where that
intersects with the larger circle again
since this line is a diameter of that
large circle then the lines from those
two new points to the observer are going
to form a right angle likewise by
looking at this right triangle here
whose hypotenuse is the diameter of the
smaller circle you can see that the line
from the observer to
original lighthouse is at a right angle
with a new long line that we drew good
news right because that means we can
apply the inverse Pythagorean theorem
and that means that the apparent
brightness from the original lighthouse
is the same as the combined brightness
from the two newer ones and of course
you can do that same thing over on the
other side drawing a line through the
top of the smaller circle and getting
two new lighthouses on the larger circle
and even nicer these four lighthouses
are all going to be evenly spaced around
the lake why well the lines from those
lighthouses to the center are at
90-degree angles with each other so
since things are symmetric left to right
that means that the distances along the
circumference are one two two two and
one all right you might see where this
is going but I want to walk through this
for just one more step you draw a circle
twice as big so circumference of 16 now
and for each lighthouse you draw a line
from that lighthouse through the top of
the smaller circle which is the center
of the bigger circle and then create two
new lighthouses where that line
intersects with the larger circle just
as before because the long line is a
diameter of the big circle those two new
lighthouses make a right angle with the
observer right and just as before the
line from the observer to the original
lighthouse is perpendicular to the long
line and those are the two facts that
justify us in using the inverse
Pythagorean theorem but what might not
be as clear is that when you do this for
all of the lighthouses to get eight new
ones on the big lake those eight new
lighthouses are going to be evenly
spaced this is the final bit of geometry
poofiness before the final thrust to see
this remember that if you draw lines
from two adjacent lighthouses on the
small lake to the center they make a
90-degree angle if instead you draw
lines to a point anywhere on the
circumference of the circle
that's not between them the very useful
inscribed angle theorem from geometry
tells us that this will be exactly half
of the angle that they make with the
center
this case 45 degrees but when we
position that new point at the top of
the lake these are the two lines which
define the position of the new
lighthouses on the larger lake what that
means then is that when you draw lines
from those eight new lighthouses into
the center they divide the circle evenly
into 45-degree angle pieces and that
means the eight lighthouses are evenly
spaced around the circumference with a
distance of two between each one of them
and now just imagine this thing playing
on at every step
doubling the size of each circle and
transforming each lighthouse into two
new ones along a line drawn through the
center of the larger circle at every
step the apparent brightness to the
observer remains the same PI squared
over four and at every step the
lighthouses remain evenly spaced with a
distance to between each one of them on
the circumference and in the limit what
we're getting here is a flat horizontal
line with an infinite number of
lighthouses evenly spaced in both
directions and because the apparent
brightness was pi squared over four the
entire way that will also be true in
this limiting case and this gives us a
pretty awesome infinite series the sum
of the inverse squares 1 over N squared
where n covers all of the odd integers 1
3 5 and so on but also negative 1
negative 3 negative 5 off in the
leftward direction adding all of those
up is going to give us PI squared over 4
that's amazing and it's the core of what
I want to show you and just take a step
back and think about how unreal this
seems the sum of simple fractions that
at first sight have nothing to do with
geometry nothing to do with circles at
all apparently gives us this result
that's related to PI except now you can
actually see what it has to do with
geometry the number line is kind of like
a limit of ever growing circles and as
you sum across that number line making
sure to sum all the way to infinity on
either side it's sort of like you're
adding up along the boundary of an
infinitely large circle and a very loose
but very fun way of speaking
but wait you might say this is not the
some that you promised us at the start
of the video and well you're right we do
have a little bit of thinking left first
things first let's just restrict this um
to only being the positive odd numbers
which gets us PI squared divided by 8
now the only difference between this and
the sum that we're looking for that goes
over all the positive integers odd and
even is that it's missing the sum of the
reciprocals of even numbers what I'm
coloring in red up here now you can
think of that missing series as a scaled
copy of the total series that we want
where each lighthouse moves to being
twice as far away from the origin one
gets shifted to 2 2 gets shifted to 4 3
gets shifted to 6 and so on and because
that involves doubling the distance for
every lighthouse it means that the
apparent brightness would be decreased
by a factor of 4 and that's also
relatively straightforward algebra going
from the sum over all the integers to
the sum over the even integers involves
multiplying by 1/4 and what that means
is that going from all the integers to
the odd ones would be multiplying by 3/4
since the evens plus the odds have to
give us the whole thing so if we just
flip that around that means going from
the sum over the odd numbers to the sum
over all positive integers requires
multiplying by 4/3 so taking that PI
squared over 8 multiplying by 4/3 but a
boom bada bing we've got ourselves a
solution to the Basel problem
stick around I've got a little preview
animation for the next project at the
end here now this video that you just
watched was primarily written and
animated by one of the new three blue
one brown team members Ben hum bricked
an edition made possible thanks to you
guys through patreon you'll meet him
along with the other new addition when
the next video is published but in the
meantime you can read a little bit about
my thoughts on introducing more
contributors over at the patreon page
let me close by sharing a set of
principles about effective learning
there are eight that I have pulled up
here but I just want to highlight two of
them effective learning is active not
passive watching a video is not enough
and it must allow for failure as hard as
we work over here to distill a beautiful
solution like this one to the basil
problem right down to its core there is
a risk of hiding the fact that finding a
solution like that requires hitting many
many dead ends and these principles come
from brilliant org today's sponsor and
let me just share with you a comment
from a recent video brilliant org is
amazing even if you don't pay for it you
still get to solve problems every week I
recommend it for the people who might be
put off by the constant advertising here
I couldn't agree more
they're just a legitimately great place
to learn through active problem-solving
and I really do believe they live up to
these principles I mean just look at the
messaging here when you get a question
wrong it's okay getting stumped as part
of learning
how's that for growth mindset now if you
want to supplement videos like these
with more active learning like bears go
