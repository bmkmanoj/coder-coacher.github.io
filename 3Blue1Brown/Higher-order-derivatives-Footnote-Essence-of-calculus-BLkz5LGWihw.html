I make frequent reference to
higher-order derivatives and if you're
already comfortable with second
derivatives third derivatives and so on
great feel free to just skip ahead to
the main event now you won't hurt my
feelings but somehow I've managed not to
bring up higher-order derivatives at all
so far in this series so for the sake of
completeness I thought I'd give you this
little footnote just to go over them
very quickly I'll focus mainly on the
second derivative showing what it looks
like in the context of graphs and motion
and leave you to think about the
analogies for higher orders given some
function f of X the derivative can be
interpreted as the slope of this graph
above some point right a steep slope
means a high value for the derivative
downward slope means a negative
derivative so the second derivative
whose notation I'll explain in just a
moment is the derivative of the
derivative meaning it tells you how that
slope is changing the way to see that at
a glance is to think about how the graph
of f of X curves at points where it
curves upwards like this the slope is
increasing and that means the second
derivative is positive
at points where it's curving downwards
the slope is decreasing so the second
derivative is negative
for example a graph like this one has a
very positive second derivative at the
point four since the slope is rapidly
increasing around that point whereas a
graph like this one still has a positive
second derivative at the same point but
it's smaller I mean the slope only
increases slowly at points where there's
not really any curvature the second
derivative is just zero
as far as notation goes you could try
writing it like this indicating some
small change to the derivative function
divided by some small change to X where
as always the use of this letter D
suggests that what you really want to
consider is what this ratio approaches
as DX both the X's in this case approach
zero
that's pretty awkward and clunky so the
standard is to abbreviate this as d
squared F divided by DX squared and even
though it's not terribly important for
getting an intuition for the second
derivative I think it might be worth
showing you how you can read this
notation to start off think of some
input to your function and then take two
small steps to the right each one with
the size of DX I'm choosing rather big
steps here so that we'll be able to see
what's going on but in principle keep in
the back of your mind that DX should be
rather tiny the first step causes some
change to the function which I'll call
DF 1 and the second step causes some
similar but possibly slightly different
change which I'll call DF 2 the
difference between these changes the
change in how the function changes is
what we'll call d DF you should think of
this as really small typically
proportional to the size of DX squared
so if for example you substitute it in
0.01 for DX you would expect this d DF
to be about proportional to 0.0001 and
the second derivative is the size of
this change to the change divided by the
size of DX squared or more precisely
it's whatever that ratio approaches as
DX approaches zero even though it's not
like this letter D is a variable being
multiplied by F for the sake of more
compact notation you'd write it as d
squared F divided by DX squared and you
don't typically bother with any
parentheses on the bottom
maybe the most visceral understanding of
the second derivative is that it
represents acceleration given some
movement along a line suppose you have
some function that records the distance
traveled versus time maybe its graph
looks something like this
steadily increasing over time then it's
derivative tells you velocity at each
point in time right for example the
graph might look like this bump
increasing up to some maximum and then
decreasing back to zero so the second
derivative tells you the rate of change
for the velocity which is the
acceleration at each point in time in
this example the second derivative is
positive for the first half of the
journey which indicates speeding up
that's the sensation of being pushed
back into your car seat or rather having
the car seat push you forward a negative
second derivative indicates slowing down
negative acceleration
the third derivative and this is not a
joke is called jerk so if the jerk is
not zero it means that the strength of
the acceleration itself is changing one
of the most useful things about
higher-order derivatives is how they
help us in approximating functions which
is exactly the topic of the next chapter
on Taylor series so I'll see you there
