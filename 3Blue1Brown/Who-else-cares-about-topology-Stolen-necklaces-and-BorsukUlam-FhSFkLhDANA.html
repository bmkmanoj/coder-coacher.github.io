things that seem completely unrelated
turn out to have a key connection in
math especially there's a certain tingly
sensation that I get whenever one of
those connections starts to fall into
place that is what I have in store for
you today it takes a little time to set
up I have to introduce this fair
division puzzle in discrete math it's
called the stolen necklace problem and
we also have to set up a certain
topological fact about spheres that
we'll use to solve it called the Borsig
Coulomb theorem but trust me seeing how
these two seemingly disconnected pieces
of math come together is well worth the
set up and more fun I coordinated this
video with mythology who just put out a
video solving a very similar fair
division problem but with a completely
different tactic so after this video if
you're eager to learn more head on over
to his channel if somehow you don't
already know about mythology his stuff
is some of the best math on YouTube
definitely poke around the rest of the
channel and subscribe if you like his
stuff as much as I do so here's the
puzzle that we're going to solve the
stolen necklace problem you and your
friends steal the necklace full of a
whole bunch of very valuable jewels
maybe it's got some sapphires emeralds
diamonds and rubies and let's say
they're all arranged on the necklace in
some totally random order
moreover let's say that there happen to
be an even number of each type of jewel
right here I have eight sapphires ten
emeralds four diamonds
and six rubies you and your friend want
to split the booty evenly with each of
you getting half of each jewel type four
sapphires five emeralds two diamonds and
three rubies each and of course you
could just cut all of the jewels off the
necklace and divvy them up evenly but
that's boring
there's not really a puzzle there
instead the challenge is to make as few
cuts to the necklace as possible so that
you can divvy up the resulting segments
between you and your co-conspirator and
still have each of you in depth with
half of each tool type for example I
just did it using four cuts if I give
these top three strands to you and these
bottom two strands to your
co-conspirator
is how each of you ends up with four
sapphires each of you has five emeralds
two diamonds and three rubies the claim
the thing that I want to prove in this
video is that if you have n different
types of jewels it's always possible to
find a fair division using only n cuts
or fewer so with four jewel types like
this example you should always be able
to find a way to make four cuts and
divvy up the five resulting pieces so
that each thief has the same number of
each jewel type if there were five jul 2
2014 and trying to allocate some
collection of things in a balanced way
these are the kinds of optimization
issues that actually come about a fair
amount in practical applications for the
computer system folk out there I'm sure
you can imagine how this could relate to
some kind of efficient memory allocation
problem also if you're curious to
actually see it in action I've left a
link in the video description to a
certain electrical engineering paper
that uses this very problem independent
from its usefulness though it certainly
makes for a good puzzle can you always
find a fair division using only as many
cuts as there are types of jewels
so that's the puzzle remember it and now
we're going to take a seemingly
unrelated sidestep to the total opposite
side of the mathematical universe
topology imagine taking a sphere in
three-dimensional space and squishing it
somehow on to the 2d plane stretching
and morphing it however you want as you
do so the only constraint is that you do
this continuously which you can think of
as meaning just never cut the sphere or
tear it in any way during the mapping
now as you do this continuously
squishing that sphere onto the plane
many different pairs of points on the
sphere are going to land on top of each
other once it hits the plane and that's
not really a big deal the special fact
that we're going to use known as the
Borsig Coulomb theorem is that you will
always be able to find a pair of points
that started off on exact opposite sides
of the sphere but which land on each
other during the mapping points on the
exact opposite side of a sphere are
called Antipodes or antipodal points for
example let's say you're thinking of the
sphere as Earth and the mapping you
choose is to just project every point
directly onto the plane of the Equator
well in that case the North and the
South Pole which are antipodal each land
on the same point and in this example
that's the only antipodal pair that
lands on the same point and the other
antipodal pair will end up somehow
offset from each other but let's say you
tweak this function a bit maybe sheering
it during the projection well in that
case the North and South Pole probably
don't land on each other anymore but
when the topology gods close a door they
open a window because the borsa Coulomb
theorem guarantees that no matter what
there must be some other antipodal pair
that now land on top of each other the
classic example to illustrate this idea
which any math educator introducing the
Borsig Coulomb theorem is required by
law to present is that there must exist
some pair of points on the opposite side
of the earth where the temperature and
the barometric pressure are both
precisely the same
think about it for a moment associating
each point on the earth with a pair of
numbers temperature and pressure is the
same as mapping the surface of the earth
into a 2d coordinate plane where the
first coordinate represents temperature
then the second one represents pressure
also each of those values varies
continuously as you wander around the
earth so this association is a
continuous mapping from the surface of a
sphere onto the plane some non tiring
way to squish that surface into two
dimensions
so what the Borsig Ullom theorem
guarantees is that no matter what the
weather patterns on earth or any other
planet for that matter some pair of
antipodal points somewhere must land on
top of each other which means they map
to the same temperature pressure
coordinates now I imagine if you're
watching this video you're probably a
mathematician at heart and you want to
see why this is true not just that it's
true
Vsauce actually talked about the Borsig
ghulam theorem in a great video that he
recently did about fixed points and he
gave a really beautiful line of
reasoning to explain it intuitively
which I'm just going to shamelessly
co-opted for my own use here given some
function from the sphere onto the plane
imagine walking around the equator the
corresponding outputs on the plane are
going to form some kind of closed loop
and let's say that your sister is on the
exact opposite side of the globe and as
you walk around
she continues keeping herself perfectly
and typically opposite from you since
the two of you eventually swap places at
some point along the way the
x-coordinate of your corresponding
outputs have to line up the first time
this happens I want you to mark where
you are on the sphere as well as where
your antipodal sister is then if you
tilt the equator slightly and walk along
a slightly different great circle the
corresponding loop in the output space
is going to alter a bit but by the same
line of reasoning there has to be some
point on your walk where you and your
antipodal sister land on outputs with
the same x-coordinate lining up
vertically mark those two points on the
sphere as well
if you repeat this continuously turning
that equator 180 degrees around the full
circle your marked points are going to
make up some new closed loop around the
sphere here's what that might look like
in the output space keeping track of all
of the points where you and your
antipodal sister first line up
vertically every point on this new loop
is one word you and your antipodal
sister by definition end up with the
same x-coordinate so if the two of you
are walking around this new loop you
always line up vertically but what's
more since the two of you are eventually
going to swap places there must be some
point along the way where you also have
the same y-coordinate aligning
horizontally that gives a point where
you and your antipodal sister must land
on the same output pretty cool right to
help set the stage for how the heck this
applies to the necklace problem
I want to write what this means a little
more symbolically points in 3d space are
represented with three coordinates right
I mean in some sense that's what 3d
space is to a mathematician at least all
possible Triplets of numbers now the
simplest sphere to describe with
coordinates is a standard unit sphere
centered at the origin the set of all
points a distance one from that origin
meaning all Triplets of numbers with the
special property that the sum of their
squares equals one so the geometric idea
of a sphere is related to the algebraic
idea of some set of positive numbers
that add up to 1 remember that if you
have one of these Triplets the point on
the opposite side of the sphere the
corresponding antipodal point is
whatever you get by flipping the sign of
each coordinate right so let's just
write out what the Borsig Ullom theorem
is saying symbolically this is going to
help for where we're going for any
function that takes in points on the
sphere Triplets of numbers who squares
sum to 1 and spits out some point in 2d
space some pair of coordinates like
temperature and pressure as long as that
function is continuous there will be
some input so that flipping all the
signs doesn't change the output
and with that on the table let's turn
back to the stolen necklace problem part
of the reason that these two things feel
so unrelated is that the necklace
problem is discrete but the Borsig
ghulam theorem applies to a continuous
situation so our first step is to
translate the stolen necklace problem
into a continuous version for right now
let's limit ourselves to the case where
there are only two jul 2015 10 emeralds
on the necklace just as a reminder this
means that the goal is to cut the
necklace in two different spots and
divvy up those three segments so that
each thief has half of the sapphires and
half of the emeralds now just have the
top and bottom here each have 4
sapphires and each have 5 emeralds think
of this necklace as a line with length 1
with the jewels sitting evenly spaced on
it now divide up that line into 18
evenly sized segments one for each dual
type and rather than thinking of each
tool as a discrete indivisible entity on
the segment remove the jewel itself and
instead just paint that segment the
color of the jewel so in this case
painting the whole necklace
appropriately 8/18 of the line are going
to be painted sapphire while 10
eighteenth's of the line are going to be
painted emerald the continuous version
of this puzzle is to now ask whether we
can find two cuts anywhere on this line
not necessarily on these 118th interval
marks that let us divide up the pieces
so that each thief has an equal length
of each color in this case that means
each thief should come up with a total
length of 4/18 of sapphire colored
segments and five eighteenth's of
emerald colored segments and important
but somewhat subtle point is that if you
can solve this continuous variant of the
puzzle you can also solve the original
discrete version to see why let's say
that you do find a fair division but
whose cuts don't necessarily fall
cleanly between jewels maybe it cuts
part of the way through an emerald
egman well because this is a fair
division the length of emerald in both
the top and the bottom group has to add
up to exactly five emerald segments a
whole number multiple of the segment
length so even if the division does cut
partially into an emerald segment on the
left it would have to also cut partially
into an emerald segment on the right
here so that the total length can add up
to a whole number multiple of the
segment length what that means is that
we can adjust each cut without affecting
the division so that they ultimately do
line up on these 118th marks now in this
continuous case where you can cut the
line wherever the heck you want think
about all of the choices that go into
cutting the necklace and allocating its
pieces first you choose two different
places to cut the interval but another
way to think of that is to choose three
positive numbers that add up to one for
example maybe you choose one sixth
one-third and one-half that would
correspond with these two cuts here
anytime that you find three positive
numbers that add to one it gives you a
way to cut the necklace and vice versa
then after you cut it you have to make a
binary choice for each one of those
three pieces for whether it goes to
theif 1 or if it goes to thief
2
now compare that to if I asked you to
choose some arbitrary point on the 3d
sphere some point with coordinates X Y Z
so that x squared plus y squared plus Z
squared equals 1 well you might start
off by choosing 3 positive numbers that
add up to 1 maybe you want x squared to
the one-sixth Y squared to be one-third
and Z squared to be 1/2 then you have to
make a binary choice for each one
choosing whether to take the positive
square root or the negative square root
so in a way that's completely parallel
to choosing a necklace Division choosing
a point on the sphere involves first
finding three positive numbers that add
up to 1 and then making a binary choice
for what to do with each one of them
that right there is a key observation
for the whole video it gives a
correspondence between points on the
sphere and necklace divisions for any
point X Y Z that sits on the sphere
because x squared plus y squared plus Z
squared equals 1 you can cut the
necklace so that the first piece has a
length of x squared the second has a
length of Y squared and the third has a
length of Z squared then to choose how
to allocate these pieces if X is
positive give it to teeth one otherwise
give it to thieve two if Y is positive
give that second piece to theif 1
otherwise give it to thief 2 and then
similarly to allocate the third piece if
Z is positive give it to thief 1
otherwise give it to thief 2 and you can
go the other way around this is a
one-to-one correspondence
anyway to divide up the necklace and
divvy up the pieces would give you a
unique point on the sphere it's as if
the sphere is the perfect way to
encapsulate the idea of all possible
necklace divisions using a geometric
object and with that Association we are
tantalisingly close take a moment and
think about the meaning of antipodal
points under this Association if the
point XYZ on the sphere corresponds to
some necklace allocation what is the
point negative x negative Y negative Z
correspond to
well the squares of all of these
coordinates are the same so it would
correspond to making the same cuts on
the necklace the difference is that each
piece switches which theif it belongs to
so jumping to an antipodal point on the
opposite side of the sphere corresponds
to exchanging all the pieces between the
two thieves now remember what it is that
we're actually looking for we want the
total length of each jewel type
belonging to theif 1 to equal that for
thief 2 in other words in a fair
division performing this antipodal swap
doesn't change the amount of each jewel
belonging to each thief your brain
should be burning with the thought of
war so Coulomb at this point
specifically the way you might move
forward is to construct a certain
function a function that takes in a
given necklace allocation and spits out
two numbers the total length of sapphire
belonging to thief 1 and the total
length of emerald belonging to thief 1
what we want to show is that there must
exist a way to divide the necklace with
only two cuts and divvy up the pieces so
that those two numbers are the same as
what they would have been for thief 2 or
said a little differently we're swapping
all of the pieces won't change those two
numbers for thief 1 because of this back
and forth between necklace allocations
and points on the sphere and because
pairs of numbers correspond to points on
the XY plane this is in effect a mapping
from the sphere onto the plane so what
the Borsig alam theorem guarantees is
that some antipodal pair of points on
the sphere land on each other in the
plane and what that means is there is
some necklace division and allocation so
that swapping the pieces between the two
thieves won't change the amount of each
jewel that each one has that's a fair
division that my friends is what
beautiful math feels like and if you're
anything like me you're just basking in
the glow of what a clever proof that is
and it might be easy to forget that we
actually want to solve the more general
stolen necklace problem one that has
more than just 2 jul
as an example one dimension up borsa
Coulomb also applies to mapping hyper
spheres in 4d space into 3d space what I
mean by a hyper sphere the way to think
about it is all possible lists of four
coordinates where the sum of their
squares equals one those are all of the
points in for T space a distance 1 from
the origin the Borsig Coulomb theorem
says that if you try to map that set all
of those special quadruplets into
three-dimensional space continuously
associating each one with some triplet
of numbers there must be some antipodal
collision an input x1 x2 x3 x4 we're
flipping all of the signs wouldn't
change the output I'm going to leave it
to you to pause and ponder and think
about how that would apply to the three
jewel case and about what the general
statement of the Borsig Ullom theorem
might be and how it can apply to the
general necklace problem
needless to say actually trying to
visualize a 40 sphere mapping into 3d
space is rather difficult nevertheless
for the final animation I'm going to try
to show you what that might look like
but before that I actually have multiple
announcements for you guys today
well I guess the first one's not really
an announcement I just want to say thank
you to the people making these videos
possible on patreon as always but number
two I just partnered with dftba to open
a three blue one brown store so if you
go check it out you can get a pause and
ponder t-shirt as well as three
different fractal curve posters and if
things go well maybe we're going to add
some more shirts some more posters and
potentially some little plushie pie
creatures number three don't forget that
mythology just put out a video on a very
different approach to a very similar
fair division problem so after the 40s
fear thing definitely go give him a look
if you don't already know about his
channel check out the rest of it and
finally this particular video is
sponsored by the great courses plus I
imagine that many of you watching this
channel especially those of you who
found it through the linear algebra
series are in to binge learning on the
internet and the great courses plus has
hundreds of lecture series where you can
do just that one that actually think you
guys would like a lot is the
inexplicable universe unsolved mysteries
by Neil deGrasse Tyson
I don't think I need to tell you what a
great speaker Neil deGrasse Tyson is and
the series itself does not disappoint by
going to the URL on the screen or more
easily by just following the link in the
description you can get a one-month free
trial to see what I'm talking about
alright so here's that final animation
it's a little confusing so for analogy
on the upper left here I'm rotating a
sphere in three dimensions and
projecting it into 2d but I'm only
showing the lines of latitude on that
sphere and not shading it or anything
like that so similarly in the center I'm
rotating a four-dimensional hyper sphere
in 4d space but projecting it into 3d
space but all I'm showing is the spheres
of latitude so to speak keep in mind you
don't actually need to be able to
visualize a 40 sphere mapping into three
dimensions to be able to understand the
voice of ghulam theorem much less how it
applies to the stolen necklace problem
this is just for fun but it is pretty to
try don't you think
