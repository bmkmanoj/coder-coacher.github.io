build to this video a certain animated
approach to thinking about a super
important idea from math the Fourier
transform for anyone unfamiliar with
what that is my number-one goal here is
just for the video to be an introduction
to that topic but even for those of you
who are already familiar with it I still
think that there's something fun and
enriching about seeing what all of its
components actually look like the
central example to start is going to be
the classic one decomposing frequencies
from sound but after that I also really
want to show a glimpse of how this idea
extends well beyond sound and frequency
into many seemingly disparate areas of
math and even physics really it is crazy
just how ubiquitous this idea is let's
dive in this sound right here is a pure
a 440 beats per second meaning if you
were to measure the air pressure right
next to your headphones or your speaker
as a function of time it would also
light up and down around its usual
equilibrium in this wave making 440
oscillations each second a lower pitch
note like a D has the same structure
just fewer beats per second and when
both of them are played at once what do
you think the resulting pressure versus
time graph looks like
well at any point in time this pressure
difference is going to be the sum of
what it would be for each of those notes
individually which let's face it this
kind of a complicated thing to think
about at some points the peaks match up
with each other resulting in a really
high pressure at other points they tend
to cancel out and all in all what you
get is a wave each pressure versus time
graph that is not a pure sine wave it's
something more complicated and as you
add in other notes the wave gets more
and more complicated but right now all
it is is a combination of for pure
frequencies so it seems needlessly
complicated given the low amount of
information put into it a microphone
recording any sound just picks up on the
air pressure at many different points in
time it only sees the final sum so our
central question is going to be how you
contain
a signal like this and decompose it into
the pure frequencies that make it up
pretty interesting right adding up those
signals really mixes them all together
so pulling them back apart feels akin to
unmixing multiple paint colors that have
all been stirred up together the general
strategy is going to be to build for
ourselves a mathematical machine that
treats signals with a given frequency
differently from how it treats other
signals to start consider simply taking
a pure signal say with a lowly 3 beats
per second so that we can plot it easily
and let's limit ourselves to looking at
a finite portion of this graph in this
case the portion between zero seconds
and 4.5 seconds the key idea is going to
be to take this graph and sort of wrap
it up around a circle concretely here's
what I mean by that imagine a little
rotating vector where at each point in
time its length is equal to the height
of our graph for that time so high
points of the graphic correspond to a
greater distance from the origin and low
points end up closer to the origin and
right now I'm drawing it in such a way
that moving forward 2 seconds in time
corresponds to a single rotation around
the circle our little vector drawing
this wound up graph is rotating at half
a cycle per second so this is important
there are two different frequencies at
play here
there's the frequency of our signal
which goes up and down three times per
second and then separately there's the
frequency with which we're wrapping the
graph around the circle which at the
moment is half of a rotation per second
but we can adjust that second frequency
however we want maybe we want to wrap it
around faster or maybe we go and wrap it
around slower and that choice of winding
frequency determines what the wound-up
graph looks like some of the diagrams
that come out of this can be pretty
complicated although they are very
pretty but it's important to keep in
mind that all that's happening here is
that we're wrapping the signal around a
circle the vertical lines that I'm
drawing up top by the way are just a way
to keep track of the distance on the
original graph that corresponds to a
full rotation around the circle so lines
spaced out by 1.5 seconds would mean it
takes 1.5 seconds to make one full
revolution and at this point we might
have some sort of vague sense that
something special will happen when the
winding frequency matches the frequency
of our signal three beats per second all
of the high points on the graph happen
on the right side of the circle and all
of the low points happen on the left but
how precisely can we take advantage of
that in our attempt to build a frequency
unmixing machine well imagine this graph
is having some kind of mass to it like a
metal wire this little dot is going to
represent the center of mass of that
wire as we change the frequency and the
graph winds up differently that center
of mass kind of wobbles around a bit and
for most of the winding frequencies the
peaks and the valleys are all spaced out
around the circle in such a way that the
center of mass stays pretty close to the
origin but when the winding frequency is
the same as the frequency of our signal
in this case three cycles per second all
of the peaks are on the right and all of
the valleys are on the left so the
center of mass is unusually far to the
right here to capture this let's draw
some kind of plot that keeps track of
where that center of mass is for each
winding frequency of course the center
of mass is a two dimensional thing it
requires two coordinates to fully keep
track of but for the moment let's only
keep track of the x coordinate so for a
frequency of zero when everything is
bunched up on the right this x
coordinate is relatively high and then
as you increase that winding frequency
and the graph balances out around the
circle the x coordinate of that center
of mass goes closer to zero and it just
kind of wobbles around a bit
but then at three beats per second
there's a spike as everything lines up
to the right
this right here is the central construct
so let's sum up what we have so far we
have that original intensity versus time
graph and then we have the wound up
version of that in some two-dimensional
plane and then as a third thing we have
a plot for how the winding frequency
influences the center of mass of that
graph and by the way let's look back at
those really low frequencies near zero
this big spike around zero in our new
frequency plot just corresponds to the
fact that the whole cosine wave is
shifted up if I had chosen a signal that
oscillates around a zero dipping into
negative values then as we play around
with various winding frequencies this
plot of the winding frequency versus
center of mass would only have a spike
at the value of three but negative
values are a little bit weird and messy
to think about especially for a first
example so let's just continue thinking
in terms of the shifted up graph I just
want you to understand that that spike
around zero only corresponds to the
shift our main focus as far as frequency
decomposition is concerned is that bump
at 3 this whole plot is what I'll call
the almost Fourier transform of the
original signal there's a couple small
distinctions between this and the actual
Fourier transform which I'll get to in a
couple minutes but already you might be
able to see how this machine lets us
pick out the frequency of a signal just
to play around with it a little bit more
take a different pure signal let's say
with a lower frequency of 2 beats per
second and do the same thing Y ended
around a circle imagine different
potential winding frequencies and as you
do that keep track of where the center
of mass of that graph is and then plot
the x coordinate of that center of mass
as you adjust the winding frequency just
like before
we get a spike when the winding
frequency is the same as the signal
frequency which in this case is when it
equals 2 cycles per second
but the real key point the thing that
makes this machine so delightful is how
it enables us to take a signal
consisting of multiple frequencies and
pick out what they are imagine taking
the two signals we just looked at the
wave with three beats per second and the
wave with two beats per second and add
them up like I said earlier why you get
is no longer a nice pure cosine wave
it's something a little more complicated
but imagine throwing this into our
winding frequency machine it is
certainly the case that as you wrap this
thing around it looks a lot more
complicated you have this chaos and
chaos and chaos and chaos and then what
things seem to line up really nicely at
two cycles per second that as you
continue on it's more chaos and more
chaos more chaos chaos chaos chaos what
things nicely aligned again at three
cycles per second and like I said before
the wound up graph can look kind of busy
and complicated but all it is is the
relatively simple idea of wrapping the
graph around a circle it's just a more
complicated graph and a pretty quick
winding frequency now what's going on
here with the two different spikes is
that if you were to take two signals in
then apply this almost Fourier transform
to each of them individually and then
add up the results what you get is the
same as if you first added up the
signals and then applied this almost
Fourier transform and the attentive
viewers among you might want to pause
and ponder and convince yourself that
what I just said is actually true it's a
pretty good test to verify for yourself
that it's clear what exactly is being
measured inside this winding machine now
this property makes things really useful
to us because the transform of a pure
frequency is close to zero everywhere
except for a spike around that frequency
so when you add together two pure
frequencies the transform graph just has
these little Peaks above the frequencies
that went into it
so this little mathematical machine does
exactly what we wanted it pulls out the
original frequencies from their jumbled
up sums on mixing the mixed bucket of
paint
and before continuing into the full math
that describes this operation let's just
get a quick glimpse of one context where
this thing is useful sound editing let's
say that you have some recording and
it's got an annoying high pitch that you
would like to filter out well at first
your signal is coming in as a function
of various intensities over time
different voltages given to your speaker
from one millisecond to the next but we
want to think of this in terms of
frequencies so when you take the Fourier
transform of that signal the annoying
high-pitched is going to show up just as
a spike at some high frequency filtering
that up by just smashing this bike down
what you'd be looking at is the Fourier
transform of a sound that's just like
you're recording only without that high
frequency luckily there's a notion of an
inverse Fourier transform that tells you
which signal would have produced this as
its Fourier transform I'll be talking
about that inverse much more fully in
the next video but long story short
applying the Fourier transform to the
Fourier transform gives you back
something close to the original function
mmm kind of this is a little bit of a
lie but it's in the direction of truth
and most of the reason that it's a lie
is that I still have yet to tell you
what the actual Fourier transform is
since it's a little more complex than
this x-coordinate of the center of mass
idea first off bringing back this
wound-up graph and looking at its center
of mass the x-coordinate is really only
half the story right I mean this thing
is in two dimensions it's got a
y-coordinate as well and as is typical
in math whenever you're dealing with
something two-dimensional it's elegant
to think of it as the complex plane
where this center of mass is going to be
a complex number that has both a real
and an imaginary part
and the reason for talking in terms of
complex numbers rather than just saying
it has two coordinates is the complex
numbers lend themselves to really nice
descriptions of things that have to do
with winding and rotation for example
Euler's formula famously tells us that
if you take e to some number times I
you're going to land on the point that
you get if you were to walk that number
of units around a circle with radius one
counterclockwise starting on the right
so imagine you wanted to describe
rotating at a rate of one cycle per
second one thing that you could do is
take the expression e to the 2 pi times
I times T where T is the amount of time
that has passed since for a circle with
radius 1 2 pi describes the full length
of its circumference and this is a
little bit dizzying to look at so maybe
you want to describe a different
frequency something lower and more
reasonable and for that you would just
multiply that time T in the exponent by
the frequency F for example if F was
1/10 then this vector makes one full
turn every 10 seconds since the time T
has to increase all the way to 10 before
the full exponent looks like 2 pi I I
have another video giving some intuition
on why this is the behavior of e to the
X for imaginary inputs if you're curious
but for right now we're just going to
take it as a given now why am I telling
you this you might ask well it gives us
a really nice way to write down the idea
of winding up the graph into a single
tight little formula first off the
convention in the context of Fourier
transforms is to think about rotating in
the clockwise direction so let's go
ahead and throw a negative sign up into
that exponent now take some function
describing a signal intensity versus
time like this pure cosine wave we had
before and call it G of T if you
multiply this exponential expression
times G of T it means that the rotating
complex number is getting scaled up and
down according to the value of this
function so you can think of this little
rotating vector with its changing length
as drawing the wound-up graph
so think about it this is awesome this
really small expression is a super
elegant way to encapsulate the whole
idea of winding a graph around a circle
with a variable frequency F and remember
the thing we want to do with this
wound-up graph is to track its center of
mass so think about what formula is
going to capture that well to
approximate it at least you might sample
a whole bunch of times from the original
signal see where those points end up on
the wound-up graph and then just take an
average that is add them all together as
complex numbers and then divide by the
number of points that you've sampled
this will become more accurate if you
sample more points which are closer
together and in the limit rather than
looking at the sum of a whole bunch of
points divided by the number of points
you take an integral of this function
divided by the size of the time interval
that we're looking at now the idea of
integrating a complex valued function
might seem weird and to anyone who's
shaky with calculus maybe even
intimidating but the underlying meaning
here really doesn't require any calculus
knowledge the whole expression is just
the center of mass of the wound-up graph
so great step by step we have built up
this kind of complicated but let's face
it surprisingly small expression for the
whole winding machine idea that I talked
about and now there is only one final
distinction to point out between this
and the actual honest-to-goodness
Fourier transform namely just don't
divide out by the time interval the
Fourier transform is just the integral
part of this what that means is that
instead of looking at the center of mass
you would scale it up by some amount if
the portion of the original graph you
are using spanned three seconds you
would multiply the center of mass by
three
if it was spanning six seconds you would
multiply the center of mass by six
physically this has the effect that when
a certain frequency persists for a long
time then the magnitude of the Fourier
transform at that frequency is scaled up
more and more for example what we're
looking at right here is how when you
have a pure frequency of two beats per
second and you wind it around the graph
at two cycles per second the center of
mass stays in the same spot right it's
just tracing out the same shape but the
longer that signal persists the larger
the value of the Fourier transform at
that frequency for other frequencies
though even if you just increase it by a
bit this is canceled out by the fact
that for longer time intervals you're
giving the wound-up graph more of a
chance to balance itself around the
circle that is a lot of different moving
parts so let's step back and summarize
what we have so far the Fourier
transform of an intensity versus time
function like G of T is a new function
which doesn't have time as an input but
instead takes in a frequency what I've
been calling the winding frequency in
terms of notation by the way the common
convention is to call this new function
G hat with a little circumflex on top of
it now the output of this function is a
complex number some point in the 2d
plane that corresponds to the strength
of a given frequency in the original
signal the plot that I've been graphing
for the Fourier transform is just the
real component of that output the x
coordinate but you could also graph the
imaginary component separately if you
wanted a fuller description and all of
this is encapsulated inside that formula
that we built up and out of context you
can imagine how seeing this formula
would seem sort of daunting but if you
understand how Exponential's correspond
to rotation how multiplying that by the
function G of T means drawing a wound up
version of the graph and how an integral
of a complex valued function can be
interpreted in terms of a center of mass
idea you can see how this whole thing
carries with it a very rich intuitive
meaning
and by the way one quick small note
before we can call this wrapped up even
though in practice with things like
sound editing you'll be integrating over
a finite time interval the theory of
Fourier transforms is often phrased
where the bounds of this integral are
negative infinity and infinity
concretely what that means is that you
consider this expression for all
possible finite time intervals and you
just ask what is its limit as that time
interval grows to infinity and man oh
man there is so much more to say so much
I don't want to call it done here this
transform extends the corners of map
well beyond the idea of extracting
frequencies from signal so the next
video I put out is going to go through a
couple of these and that's really where
things start getting interesting
so stay subscribed for when that comes
out or an alternate option is to just
binge on a couple three blue on Brown
videos so that the YouTube recommender
is more inclined to show you new things
that come out really the choice is yours
and to close things off I have something
pretty fun a mathematical puzzler from
this video sponsor Jane Street who's
looking to recruit more technical talent
so let's say that you have a closed
bounded convex set C sitting in 3d space
and then let B be the boundary of that
space the surface of your complex blob
now imagine taking every possible pair
of points on that surface and adding
them up doing a vector sum let's name
this set of all possible sums d your
task is to prove that D is also a convex
set
so Jane Street is a quantitative trading
firm and if you're the kind of person
who enjoys math and solving puzzles like
this the team there really values
intellectual curiosity so they might be
interested in hiring you and they're
looking both for full-time employees and
interns for my part I can say the couple
of people I've interacted with there
just seem to love math and sharing math
and when they're hiring they look less
at a background in finance than they do
it how you think how you learn and how
you solve problems
hence the sponsorship of a three blue
one brown video if you want the answer
to that puzzler or to learn more about
what they do or to apply for open
