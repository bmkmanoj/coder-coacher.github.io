and continue on and on adding the next
power of 2 up to infinity this might
seem crazy but there's a sense in which
this infinite sum equals negative 1 if
you like me this feels stranger
obviously false when you first see it
but I promise you by the end of this
video you and I will make it make sense
to do this we need to back up and you
and I will walk through what it might
feel like to discover convergent
infinite sums those ones that at least
seem to make sense to define what they
really mean then to discover this crazy
equation and stumble upon new forms of
math where it makes sense imagine that
you are an early mathematician in the
process of discovering that 1/2 plus 1/4
plus 1/8 plus 1/16 on on and on up to
infinity whatever that means
equals 1 and imagine that you needed to
define what it means to add infinitely
many things for your friends to take you
seriously what would that feel like
frankly I have no idea and I imagine
that more than anything it feels like
being wrong or stuck most of the time
but I'll give my best guess at one way
that the successful parts of it might go
one day you're pondering the nature of
distances between objects and how no
matter how close two things are it seems
that they can always be brought a little
bit closer together without touching
fond of math as you are you want to
capture this paradoxical feeling with
numbers so you imagine placing the two
objects on the number line the first at
zero the second at 1 then you March the
first object towards the second such
that with each step the distance between
them is cut in half
you keep track of the numbers this
object touches during its March writing
down 1/2 1/2 plus 1/4 1/2 plus 1/4 plus
1/8 and so on that is each number is
naturally written as a slightly longer
sum with one more power of 2 in it as
such you're tempted to say that if these
numbers approach anything we should be
able to write this thing down as a sum
that contains the reciprocal of every
power of 2 on the other hand we can see
geometrically that these numbers
approach 1 so what you want to say is
that 1 and some kind of infinite sum are
the same thing if your education was too
formal you write the statement off as
ridiculous clearly you can't add
infinitely many things no human computer
or physical thing ever could perform
such a task if however you approach math
with a healthy irreverence you'll stand
brave in the face of ridiculousness and
try to make sense out of this nonsense
that you wrote down since it kind of
feels like Nature gave it to you so how
exactly do you dear mathematician go
about defining infinite sums well
practiced in that that you are you know
that finding the right definitions is
less about generating new thoughts than
it is about dissecting old thoughts so
you go back to how you came across this
fuzzy discovery at no point did you
actually perform infinitely many
operations you had a list of numbers a
list that could keep going forever if
you had the time and each number came
from a perfectly reasonable finite sum
you noticed that the numbers in this
list approach 1 but what do you mean by
approach it's not just that the distance
between each number and one smaller
because for that matter the distance
between each number and to also get
smaller after thinking about it you
realize what makes one special is that
your numbers can get arbitrarily close
to 1 which is to say no matter how small
your desired distance 1/100 1 1 million
or 1 over the largest number you could
write down if you go down your list long
enough the numbers will eventually fall
within that tiny tiny distance of 1
retrospectively this might seem like the
clear way to solidify what you mean by
approach but as a first time endeavour
is actually incredibly clever now you
pull out your PIN and scribble down the
definition for what it means for an
infinite sum to equal some number say X
it means that when you generate a list
of numbers by cutting off your sound at
finite points the numbers in this list
approach X in the sense that no matter
how small the distance you choose at
some point down the list all the numbers
start falling within that distance of X
in doing this you just invented some
math but it never felt like you were
pulling things out of thin air you were
just trying to justify what it was that
the universe gave you in the first place
you might wonder if you can find other
more general truths about these infinite
sums that you just invented to do so you
look for where you made any arbitrary
decisions for instance when you were
shrinking the distance between your
objects cutting the interval into pieces
of size 1/2 1/4 et cetera you could have
chosen a proportion other than 1/2 you
could have instead cut your interval
into pieces of size 9/10 and 1/10 and
then cut that rightmost piece into the
same proportions giving you smaller
pieces of size 9 one hundredths and
1/100 then cut that tiny piece of size
1/100 similarly continuing on and on
you'd see that 9 tenths plus 9 one
hundredths plus 9 one thousandths on and
on up to infinity equals 1 a fact more
popularly written as point 9 repeating
equals 1/2 all of your friends who
insist that this doesn't equal 1 and it
just approaches it you can now just
smile because you know that with
infinite sums to approach and to equal
mean the same thing to be general about
it let's say that you cut your interval
into pieces of size P and 1 minus P
where P represents any number between 0
&amp;amp; 1 cutting the piece of size P in
similar proportions we now get pieces of
size P times 1 minus P and P squared
continuing in this fashion always
cutting up the rightmost piece into
those same proportions you'll find that
one minus P plus P times one minus P
plus P squared times one minus p on and
on always adding P to the next power
times 1 minus P equals 1 dividing both
sides by 1 minus P we get this nice
formula in this formula the universe has
offered a weird form of nonsense even
though the way that you discovered it
only makes sense for values of P between
0 &amp;amp; 1 the right hand side still makes
sense when you replace P with any other
number except maybe for 1 for instance
plugging in negative 1 the equation
reads 1 minus 1 plus 1 minus 1 on and on
forever alternating between the two
equals 1/2 which feels both pretty silly
and kind of like the only thing that it
could be plugging into the equation
reads one plus two plus four plus eight
on and on to infinity equals negative 1
something which doesn't even seem
reasonable on the one hand rigor would
dictate that you ignore these since the
definition of infinite sums doesn't
apply in these cases the list of numbers
that you generate by cutting off the sum
at finite points doesn't approach
anything
but you're a mathematician not a robot
so you don't let the fact that something
is nonsensical stop you I will leave
this some for another day so that we can
jump directly into this monster first to
clean things up notice what you get when
you cut off the sum at finite points 1 3
7 15 31 they're all one less than a
power of 2 in general when you add up
the first n powers of 2 you get 2 to the
n plus 1 minus 1 which this animation
hopefully makes clear
you decide to humor the universe and
pretend that these numbers all one less
than a power of two actually do approach
negative one it will prove to be cleaner
if we add one to everything and say that
the powers of two approaches zero is
there any way that this can make sense
in effect what you're trying to do is
make this formula more general by saying
that it applies to all numbers not just
those between zero and one again to make
things more general you look for any
place where you made an arbitrary choice
here that place turns out to be very
sneaky so sneaky in fact that it took
mathematicians until the twentieth
century to find it it's the way that we
define distance between two rational
numbers
that is to say organizing them on a line
might not be the only reasonable way to
organize them the notion of distance is
essentially a function that takes in two
numbers and outputs a number indicating
how far apart they are
you could come up with a completely
random notion of distance where two is
seven away from three and one-half is
4/5 away from a hundred and all sorts of
things but if you want to actually use a
new distance function the way that you
use the familiar distance function it
should share some of the same properties
for example the distance between two
numbers shouldn't change if you shift
them both by the same amount so zero and
four should be the same distance away as
one and five or two and six even if that
same distance is something other than
four as we're used to keeping things
general the distance between two numbers
shouldn't change if you add the same
amount to both of them let's call this
property shift invariance there are
other properties that you want your
notion of distance to have as well like
the triangle inequality but before we
start worrying about those let's start
imagining what notion of distance could
possibly make powers of two approach
zero and which is shift invariant at
first you might toil for a while to find
a frame of mind where this doesn't feel
like uh turn-on sense but with enough
time and a bit of luck you might think
to organize your numbers into rooms sub
rooms sub sub rooms and so on you think
of zero as being in the same room as all
of the powers of two greater than one as
being in the same sub room as all powers
of two greater than t2 as being in the
same sub sub room as powers of two
greater than 4 and so on with infinitely
many smaller and smaller rooms it's
pretty hard to draw infinitely many
things so I'm only going to draw four
room sizes but keep in the back of your
mind that this process should be able to
go on forever if we think of every
number is lying in a hierarchy of rooms
not just zero shift invariants will tell
us where all of the numbers must fall
for instance one should be as far away
from three as two is from zero likewise
the distance between zero and four
should be the same as that between one
and five 2 &amp;amp; 6 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 7
continuing like this you'll see which
rooms sub rooms sub sub rooms and so on
successive numbers must fall into
you can also deduce where negative
numbers must fall for example negative
one has to be in the same room as one in
the same sub room as three the same sub
sub room as seven and so on
always in smaller and smaller rooms with
numbers one less than a power of two
because zero is in smaller and smaller
rooms with the powers of two so how do
you turn this general idea of closeness
based on rooms and sub rooms into an
actual distance function
you can't take this drawing too
literally since it makes one look very
close to 14 and zero very far from 13
even though shift and variance should
imply that they're the same distance
away again in the actual process of
discovery
you might toil away scribbling through
many sheets of paper but if you have the
idea that the only thing which should
matter in determining the distance
between two objects is the size of the
smallest room they share you might come
up with the following any numbers lying
in different large yellow rooms are
distance one from each other those which
are in the same large room but not in
the same orange sub room are a distance
one-half from each other
those that are in the same orange sub
room but not in the same sub sub room
our distance 1/4 from each other and you
continue like this using the reciprocals
of larger and larger powers of 2 to
indicate closeness we won't do it in
this video
but see if you can reason about which
rooms other rational numbers like 1/3
and 1/2 should fall into and see if you
can prove why this notion of distance
satisfies many of the nice properties we
expect from a distance function like the
triangle inequality here I'll just say
that this notion of distance is a
perfectly legitimate one we call it the
two attic metric and it falls into a
general family of distance functions for
the P attic metrics where P stands for
any prime number these metrics give rise
to a completely new type of number
neither real nor complex and have become
a central notion in modern number theory
using the two attic metric the fact the
sum of all powers of two equals negative
1 actually makes sense because the
numbers 1 3 7 15 31 and so on genuinely
approach negative 1 this parable does
not actually portray the historical
trajectory of discoveries but
nevertheless I still think it's a good
illustration of a recurring pattern in
the discovery of math first nature hands
you something that's ill-defined or even
nonsensical then you define new concepts
that make this fuzzy discovery make
sense and these new concepts tend to
yield genuinely useful math and broaden
your mind about traditional notions so
an answer to the age-old question of
whether math is invention or discovery
my personal belief is the discovery of
non rigorous truths is what leads us to
the construction of rigorous terms that
are useful opening the door for more
fuzzy discoveries continuing the cycle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
