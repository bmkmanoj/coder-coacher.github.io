right well he and I just made a video on
a certain quantum mechanical topic bells
inequalities it's a really mind warping
topic that not enough people know about
and even though it's a quantum thing
it's based on some surprisingly simple
math and you should definitely check it
out for this video we have in mind those
viewers who actually want to learn some
quantum mechanics more deeply and
obviously it's a huge topic
nowhere near the scope of a single video
but the question we asked was what topic
could we present that's not meant to be
some eye-catching piece of quantum
weirdness but which actually lays down
some useful foundations for anyone who
you know wants to learn this field what
topic would set the right intuitions for
someone before they dove into say the
Fineman lectures well a natural place to
start where quantum mechanics itself
started is light specifically if you
want to learn quantum you have to have
an understanding of waves and how
they're described mathematically and
what we'd like to build to here is the
relationship between the energy in a
purely classical wave and the
probabilities that govern quantum
behavior in fact will actually spend
most of the time talking through the pre
quantum understanding of light since
that sets up a lot of the relevant wave
mechanics the thing is a lot of ideas
from quantum mechanics like describing
states as super positions with various
amplitudes and phases come up in the
context of classical waves in a way that
doesn't involve any of the quantum
weirdness people might be familiar with
this also helps to appreciate what's
actually different in quantum mechanics
namely certain restrictions on how much
energy these waves can have how they
behave when measured and quantum
entanglement though we won't cover
entanglement in this video so we'll
start with the late 1800s understanding
of light as waves in the electromagnetic
field here let's break that down a bit
the electric field is a vector field and
that means every point in space has some
arrow attached to it indicating the
direction and strength of the field now
the physical meaning of those arrows is
that if you have some charged particle
in space there's going to be a force on
that particle in the direction of the
arrow and it's proportional to the
length of the arrow and the specific
charge of the particle likewise the
magnetic field
it's another vector field where now the
physical meaning of each air
is that when a charged particle is
moving through that space there's going
to be a force perpendicular to both its
direction of motion and to the direction
of the magnetic field and the strength
of that force is proportional to the
charge of the particle its velocity and
the length of the magnetic field arrow
for example a wire with a current of
moving charges next to a magnet is
either pushed or pulled by that magnetic
field a kind of culmination of the 19th
century physics understanding of how
these two fields work our Maxwell's
equations which among other things
describe how each of these fields can
cause a change to the other specifically
what Maxwell's equations tell us is that
when the electric field arrows seem to
be forming a loop around some region the
magnetic field will be increasing inside
that region perpendicular to the plane
of the loop and symmetrically such a
loop in the magnetic field corresponds
to a change in the electric field within
it perpendicular to the plane of the
loop now the specifics for how exactly
these equations work is really beautiful
and worth a full video on its own but
all you need to know for now is that one
natural consequence of this mutual
interplay and how changes to one field
cause changes to the other in its
neighboring regions is that you get
these propagating waves where the
electric field and magnetic fields are
oscillating perpendicular to each other
and perpendicular to the direction of
propagation when you hear the term
electromagnetic radiation which refers
to things like radio waves and visible
light this is what is talking about
propagating waves in both the electric
and magnetic fields of course it's now
almost mainstreamed to know of light as
electromagnetic radiation but it's neat
to think about just how surprising this
was in Maxwell's time that these fields
that have to do with forces on charged
particles and magnets not only have
something to do with light but that what
light is is a propagating wave as these
two fields dance with each other causing
this mutual oscillation of increasing
and decreasing field strength with this
as a visual let's take a moment to lay
down the math used to describe waves
it'll still be purely classical but
ideas that are core to quantum mechanics
like superposition amplitudes phases all
of these come up in this context and I
would argue with a clearer motivation
for what they are
we mean take this wave and think of it
as directed straight out of the screen
towards your face and let's go ahead and
ignore the magnetic field right now just
looking at how the electric field
oscillates and also we're only going to
focus on one of these vectors
oscillating in the plane of the screen
which we'll think of as the XY plane if
it oscillates horizontally like this we
say that the light is horizontally
polarized so the Y component of this
electric field is zero at all times and
we might write the X component as
something like cosine of two pi times F
T where F represents some frequency and
T is time so if F was one for example
that means it takes exactly one second
for this cosine function to go through a
full cycle for a lower frequency that
would mean it takes more time for the
cosine to go through its full cycle as
the value T increases the inside of this
cosine function increases more slowly
also we're going to include another term
in here V called the phase shift which
tells us where this vector is in its
cycle at time T equals zero you'll see
why that matters in just a moment now by
default cosine only oscillates between
negative 1 and 1 so let's put another
term in front a that gives us the
amplitude of this wave one more thing
just to make things look a little more
like they often do in quantum mechanics
instead of writing it as a column vector
like this I'm going to separate it out
into two different components using
these symbols called cats this cat here
indicates a unit vector in the
horizontal direction and this cat over
here represents a unit vector in the
vertical direction
if the light is vertically polarized
meaning the electric field is wiggling
purely in the up-and-down direction its
equation might look like this where the
horizontal component is now zero and the
vertical component is a cosine with some
frequency amplitude and a phase shift
now if you have two distinct waves two
ways of wiggling through space over time
that solve Maxwell's equations then
adding both of these together gives
another valid wave at least in a vacuum
that is at each point in time add these
two vectors tip-to-tail to get a new
vector doing this at all points in space
and all points in time gives a new valid
solution to Maxwell's equations at least
this is all true in a vacuum this is
because Maxwell's equations in a vacuum
are what's called linear equations
they're essentially a combination of
derivatives acting on the electric and
magnetic fields to give 0 so if one
field f1 satisfies this equation and
another field f2 satisfies it then their
sum f1 plus f2 also satisfies it since
derivatives are linear so the sum of two
or more solutions to Maxwell's equations
is also a solution to Maxwell's
equations this new wave is called a
superposition of the first two and here
superposition essentially just means sum
or in some context weighted sum since if
you include some kind of amplitude and
phase shift in each of these components
it can still be called a superposition
of the two original vectors now right
now the resulting superposition is a
wave wiggling in the diagonal direction
but if the horizontal and vertical
components were out of phase with each
other which might happen if you increase
the phase shift in one of them there
some might instead trace out some sort
of ellipse and in the case where the
phases are exactly 90 degrees out of
sync with each other and the amplitudes
are both equal this is what we call
circularly polarized light this by the
way is why it's important to keep track
not just of the amplitude in each
direction but also of the phase it
affects the way that two waves add
together
that's also an important idea that
carries over to quantum and underlies
some of the things that look confusing
at first and here's another important
idea we're describing waves by adding
together the horizontal and vertical
components but we could also choose to
describe everything with respect to
different directions I mean you could
describe waves as some superposition of
the diagonal and the anti diagonal
directions in that case vertically
polarized light would actually be a
superposition of these two diagonal
wiggling directions at least when both
are in phase with each other and they
have the same magnitude now the choice
of which directions you write things in
terms of is called a basis and which
basis is nicest to work with well that
typically depends on what you're
actually doing with the light for
example if you have a polarizing filter
like that from a set of polarized
sunglasses the way these work is by
absorbing the energy from
electromagnetic oscillations in some
particular direction a vertically
oriented polarizer for example would
absorb all of the energy from these
waves along the horizontal directions at
least classically that's how you might
think about it so if you're analyzing
light and it's passing through a filter
like this it's nice to describe it with
respect to the horizontal and vertical
directions that way what you can say is
that whatever light passes through the
filter is just the vertical component of
the original wave but if you had a
filter oriented say diagonally well then
it would be convenient to describe
things as a superposition of that
diagonal direction and it's
perpendicular anti diagonal direction
these ideas will carry over almost
word-for-word
to the quantum case quantum states much
like this wiggling direction of our wave
are described as a superposition of
multiple base States where you have many
choices for what base States to use and
just like with classical waves the
components of such a superposition will
have both an amplitude and a phase of
some kind and by the way for those of
you who do read more into quantum
mechanics you'll find that these
components are actually given using a
single complex number rather than a
cosine expression like this one one way
to think of this is that complex numbers
are just a very convenient and natural
mathematical way to encode an amplitude
and a phase with a single value that can
make things a little confusing because
it's hard to visualize a pair of complex
numbers which is what would describe a
superposition of two base States but you
can think about the use of complex
numbers throughout quantum mechanics as
a result of its underlying wavy nature
and its need to encapsulate the
amplitude and the phase for each
direction okay just one quick point
before getting into the quantum look at
one of these waves and focus just on the
electric field portion like we were
before classically we think about the
energy of a wave like this as being
proportional to the square of its
amplitude and I want you to notice how
well this lines up with the Pythagorean
theorem if you were to describe this
wave as a superposition of a horizontal
component with amplitude a X and a
vertical component with amplitude a Y
then its energy density is proportional
to ax squared plus ay Y squared and you
can think of this in two different ways
either it's because you're adding up the
energies of each component in the
superposition or it's just that you're
figuring out the new amplitude using the
Pythagorean theorem and taking the
square isn't that nice in the classical
understanding of light you should be
able to dial this energy up and down
continuously however you want by
changing the amplitude of the wave but
what physicists started to notice in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries was
that this energy actually seems to come
in discrete amounts specifically the
energy of one of these electromagnetic
waves always seems to come as an integer
multiple of a specific constant times
the frequency of that wave we now call
this constant Planck's constant commonly
denoting it with the letter H
physically what this means is that
whenever this wave trades its energy
with something else like an electron the
amount of energy it trades off is always
an integer multiple of H times its
frequency importantly this means there
is some minimal non zero energy level
for waves of a given frequency HF if you
have an electromagnetic wave with this
frequency and energy you cannot make it
smaller without eliminating it entirely
that feels weird when the conception of
a wave is a nice continuously
oscillating vector field but that's not
how the universe works as late 19th and
early 20th century experiments started
to expose in fact I've done a video
about this called the origin of quantum
mechanics however it's worth noting that
this phenomenon is actually common in
waves when they're constrained in
certain ways like in pipes or instrument
strings and it's called harmonics what's
weird is that electromagnetic waves do
this in free space even when they're not
constrained and what do we call an
offshore magnetic wave with this minimal
possible energy a photon but like I said
the math used to describe classical
electromagnetic waves carries over to
describing a photon it might have say a
45 degree diagonal polarization which
can be described as a superposition of a
purely horizontal state and a purely
vertical state where each one of these
components has some amplitude and phase
and with a different choice and basis
that same state might be described as a
superposition of two other directions
all of this is stuff that you would see
if you started reading more into quantum
mechanics but this superposition has a
different interpretation than before and
it has to let's say you were thinking of
this diagonally polarized photon kind of
classically and he said it has an
amplitude of 1 unit for some appropriate
unit system well that would make the
hypothetical amplitudes of its
horizontal and vertical components each
the square root of 1/2 and like Henry
said the energy of a photon is this
special constant H times its frequency
and because in a classical setting
energy is proportional to the square of
the amplitude of this wave it's tempting
to think of 1/2 of the energy as being
in the horizontal component and half of
it as being in the vertical component
but waves of this frequency cannot have
half the energy of a photon I mean the
whole novelty of quantum here is the
energy comes in these discrete
indivisible chunks so these components
with an imagined amplitude of 1 over the
square root of 2 could not exist in
isolation and you might wonder what
exactly they mean well
let's get experimental about it if you
were to take a vertically oriented
polarizing filter and shoot this
diagonally polarized photon right at it
what do you think would happen
classically the way you'd interpret the
superposition is that the half of its
energy in the horizontal direction would
be absorbed but because energy comes in
these discrete photon packets it either
has to pass through with all of its
energy or get absorbed entirely and if
you actually did this experiment about
half the time the photon goes through
entirely and about half the time it gets
absorbed entirely and it appears to be
random whether a given photon passes
through or not if it does pass through
forcing it to make a decision like this
actually changes it so that it's
polarization is oriented along the
filters direction this is analogous to
the classic Schrodinger's cat setup you
have something that's in a superposition
of two states but once you make a
measurement of that superposition
forcing it to interact with an observer
in a way where each of those two States
would behave differently from the
perspective of that observer this
superposition collapses to be entirely
in one state or entirely in another dead
or alive horizontal or vertical one
pretty neat way to see this in action
which Henry and I talked about in the
other video is to take several polarized
sunglasses or some other form of
polarizing filters and start by holding
two of them between you and some light
source if you rotate them to be 90
degrees off from each other the light
source is blacked out completely or at
least with perfect filters it would be
because all of the photons passing
through that first one are polarized
vertically so they actually have a zero
percent chance of passing a filter
oriented horizontally but if you insert
a third filter oriented at a 45 degree
angle between the two it actually lets
more light through and what's going on
here is that 50% of the photons passing
that vertical filter will also pass
through the diagonal filter
and once they do they're going to be
changed to have a purely diagonal
polarization and then once they're in
that state they have a 50/50 chance of
passing through the filter oriented at
90 degrees so even though 0% of the
photons passing through the first would
pass through that last if nothing was in
between by introducing another filter
25% of them now passed through all three
now that's something that you could not
explain unless that middle filter forces
the photons to change their States and
that experiment by the way it becomes
all the weirder when you dig into the
specific probabilities for angles
between 0 and 45 degrees and that's
actually what we talked about in the
other video for example one specific
value we focus on there is the
probability that a photon whose
polarization is twenty two point five
degrees off the direction of a filter is
going to end up passing through that
filter again it's helpful to think of
this wave is having an amplitude of 1
and then you think of the horizontal
component as having amplitude sine of
22.5 degrees which is around 0.38 and
the vertical component would have an
amplitude cosine of 22.5 degrees which
is around 0.92 classically you might
think of its horizontal component as
having energy proportional to 0.38
squared which is around 0.15 likewise
you might think of the vertical
component as having an energy
proportional to 0.92 squared which comes
out to be around 0.85 and like we said
before classically this would mean if
you pass it through a vertical filter 15
percent of its energy is absorbed in the
horizontal direction but because the
energy of light comes in these discrete
quanta that cannot be subdivided instead
what you observe is that 85 percent of
the time the photon passes through
entirely and 15 percent of the time it
gets completely blocked
now I want to emphasize that the wave
equations don't change the photon is
still described as a superposition of
two oscillating components each with
some phase and amplitude and these are
often encoded using a single complex
number the difference is that
classically the squares of the
amplitudes of each component tells you
the amount of that waves energy in each
direction but with quantized light at
this minimal nonzero energy level the
squares of those amplitudes tell you the
probabilities that a given photon is
going to be found to have all of its
energy in one direction or not also
these components could still have some
kind of phase difference just like with
classical waves photons can be
circularly polarized and there exists
polarizing filters that only let through
photons that are polarized circularly
say in the clockwise direction or rather
they let through all photons
probabilistically where the
probabilities are determined by
describing each one of those photons as
a superposition of the clockwise and
counterclockwise States and then the
square of the amplitude of the clockwise
component gives you the desired
probability photons are of course just
one quantum phenomenon one where we
initially understood it as a wave thanks
to Maxwell's equations and then as
individual particles or quanta hence the
name quantum mechanics but as many of
you well know there's a flipside to this
where are many things that were
understood to come in discrete little
packets like electrons were discovered
to be governed by similar wavy quantum
mechanics in cases way more general than
this one photon polarization example
quantum mechanical States are described
as some superposition of multiple base
States and the superposition depends on
what basis you choose each component in
this superposition is given with an
amplitude and a phase often encoded as a
single complex number and the need for
this phase arises from the wave nature
of these objects as with the photon
example the choice of how to measure
these objects can determine a set of
base States where the probability of
measuring a particle to be in one of
these base States is proportional to the
squares of the amplitudes of these
numbers it's funny to think though that
if the wavy nature of electrons and
other particles was discovered first we
might instead refer to the whole subject
as harmonic mechanics or some
like that since the weirdness there is
not that waves come in discrete units
but that particles are governed by wave
equations this video was supported in
part by brilliant and as viewers of this
channel know what I like about brilliant
is that there a great compliment to
passively watching educational videos
all of you here want to learn more math
or physics or the math that prepares you
for physics and the only way to actually
learn this stuff is to actively grapple
with puzzles and problem solving
brilliant offers many really well
curated sequences of problems that help
you to master all sorts of technical
subjects you all like physics clearly so
I think that you would enjoy their
courses on classical mechanics and
gravitational physics and honestly group
Theory would give you a really good
foundation but there are many other
great courses too especially in math if
you go to brilliant org slash 3 b-1b
that one lets them know that you came
from here and also the first 200 people
that go to that link are going to get
20% off the annual brilliant premium
subscription that's the subscription
I've been using and it's actually really
fun to have a bank of these puzzles and
problems but of course for those of you
who want some more passive viewing don't
forget that Henry and I just put out a
video on bells inequalities over on
minute physics if for some reason you
haven't been following minute physics
these days and I don't know why you
wouldn't have been the videos there have
been really top-notch so definitely take
