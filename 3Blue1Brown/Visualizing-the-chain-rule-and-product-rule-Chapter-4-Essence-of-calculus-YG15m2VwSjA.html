derivatives of simple functions and the
goal was to have a clear picture or
intuition to hold in your mind that
actually explains where these formulas
come from but of course most of the
functions you deal with in modeling the
world involve somehow mixing or
combining or tweaking these simple
functions in some other way so our
natural next step is to understand how
you take derivatives of more complicated
combinations and again I don't want
these to be something to memorize I want
you to have a clear picture in mind for
where each one comes from now this
really boils down into three basic ways
to combine functions you can add them
together you can multiply them and you
can throw one inside the other known as
composing them sure you could say
subtracting them but really that's just
multiplying the second by negative one
and adding them together and likewise
dividing functions doesn't really add
anything because that's the same as
plugging one inside the function 1 over
X and then multiplying the two together
so really most functions you come across
just involve layering together these 3
different types of combinations though
there's not really a bound on how
monstrous things can become but as long
as you know how derivatives play with
just those 3 combination types you'll
always be able to just take it step by
step and peel through the layers for any
kind of monstrous expression
so the question is if you know the
derivative of two functions what is the
derivative of their sum of their product
and of the function composition between
them
the sum rule is easiest if somewhat
tongue-twisting to say out loud the
derivative of a sum of two functions is
the sum of their derivatives but it's
worth warming up with this example by
really thinking through what it means to
take a derivative of a sum of two
functions since the derivative patterns
for products and for function
composition won't be so straightforward
and they're going to require this kind
of deeper thinking for example let's
think about this function f of X equals
sine of X plus x squared it's a function
where for every input you add together
the values of sine of X and x squared at
that point
for example let's say at X equals 0.5
the height of the sine graph is given by
this vertical bar and the height of the
x squared parabola is given by this
slightly smaller vertical bar and their
sum is the length to get by just
stacking them together
now for the derivative you want to ask
what happens as you nudge that input
slightly maybe increasing it up to 0.5
plus DX the difference in the value of F
between those two places is what we call
DF and when you picture it like this I
think you'll agree that the total change
in the height is whatever the change to
the sine graph is what we might call d
sine of X plus whatever the change to x
squared is d x squared
now we know that the derivative of sine
is cosine and remember what that means
it means that this little change D sine
of X is about cosine of x times DX it's
proportional to the size of our initial
nudge DX and the proportionality
constant equals cosine of whatever input
we happen to start at likewise because
the derivative of x squared is 2x the
change in the height of the x squared
graph is going to be about two times x
times whatever DX was
so rearranging D F divided by DX the
ratio of the tiny change to this sum
function to the tiny change in X that
caused it is indeed cosine of X plus 2 X
the sum of the derivatives of its parts
but like I said things are a bit
different for products and let's think
through why and let's think through why
in terms of tiny nudges again in this
case I don't think graphs are our best
bet for visualizing things pretty
commonly in math at a lot of levels of
math really if you're dealing with a
product of two things it helps to
understand it as some kind of area in
this case maybe you try to configure
some mental setup of a box where the
side lengths are sine of X and x squared
but what would that mean well since
these are functions you might think of
those sides is adjustable dependent on
the value of x which maybe you think of
as this number that you can just freely
adjust up and down so getting a feel for
what this means focus on that top side
there who changes as the function sine
of X as you change this value of X up
from zero it increases up to a length of
one as sine of X moves up towards its
peak and after that it starts to
decrease
as sine of X comes down from one and in
the same way that height there is always
changing as x squared so f of X defined
as the product of these two functions is
going to be the area of this box and for
the derivative let's think about how a
tiny change to X by DX influences that
area what is that resulting change in
area DF
well the nudge DX cause that width to
change by some small D sine of X and it
caused that height to change by some D X
squared
and this gives us three little snippets
of new area a thin rectangle on the
bottom whose area is its width sine of X
times its thin height DX squared
and there's this thin rectangle on the
right whose area is its height x squared
times its thin little width D sine of X
and there's also this little bit in the
corner but we can ignore that its area
is ultimately going to be proportional
to DX squared
and as we've seen before that becomes
negligible as DX goes to zero
I mean this whole setup is very similar
to what I showed last video with the
x-squared diagram and just like then
keep in mind that I'm using somewhat
beefy changes here to draw things just
so that we can actually see them but in
principle DX is something very very
small and that means that DX squared and
D sine of X are also very very small so
applying what we know about the
derivative of sine and of x squared that
tiny change DX squared is going to be
about 2x times DX
and that tiny change D sine of X well
that's going to be about cosine of x
times DX as usual we divide out by that
DX to see that the ratio we want DF
divided by DX is sine of X times the
derivative of x squared plus x squared
times the derivative of sine
and nothing we've done here is specific
to sign or to x-squared this same line
of reasoning would work for any two
functions G and H and sometimes people
like to remember this pattern with a
certain mnemonic that you kind of sing
in your head left D right right D left
in this example where we have sine of x
times x squared left D right means you
take that left function sine of x times
the derivative of the right in this case
2x then you add on right D left that
right function x squared times the
derivative of the left one cosine of X
now out of context presented as a rule
to remember
I think this would feel pretty strange
don't you but when you actually think of
this adjustable box you can see what
each of those terms represents lefty
right is the area of that little bottom
rectangle
and right D left is the area of that
rectangle on the side
by the way I should mention that if you
multiply by a constant say 2 times sine
of X things end up a lot simpler the
derivative is just the same as the
constant multiplied by the derivative of
the function in this case two times
cosine of X I'll leave it to you to
pause and ponder and just kind of verify
that that makes sense
aside from addition and multiplication
the other common way to combine
functions and believe me this one comes
up all the time is to shove one inside
the other function composition for
example maybe we take the function x
squared and we just shove it on inside
sine of X to get this new function sine
of x squared what do you think the
derivative of that new function is to
think this one through I'm going to
choose yet another way to visualize
things just to emphasize that in
creative math we've got lots of options
I'll put up three different number lines
the top one is going to hold the value
of X the second one is going to hold the
value of x squared and that third line
is going to hold the value of sine of x
squared that is the function x squared
gets you from line one to line two and
the function sine gets you from line two
to line three
as I shift around this value of X maybe
moving it up to the value three that
second value stays pegged to whatever x
squared is in this case moving up to
nine and that bottom value being sine of
x squared is going to go to whatever
sine of nine happens to be
so for the derivative let's again start
by just nudging that x value by some
little DX and I always think that it's
helpful to think of X's starting at some
actual concrete number maybe one point
five in this case the resulting nudge to
that second value the change in x
squared caused by such a DX is DX
squared and we could expand this like we
have before as two x times DX which for
our specific input would be two times
1.5 times DX but it actually helps to
keep things written as DX squared at
least for now and in fact I'm going to
go one step further I'm going to give a
new name to this x squared maybe H so
that instead of writing DX squared for
this nudge we write D H and this makes
it easier to think about that third
value which is now pegged at sine of H
it's change is d sine of H the tiny
change caused by the nudged eh and by
the way the fact that it's moving to the
left while the D H bump is going to the
right that just means that this change D
sine of H is going to be some kind of
negative number and once again we can
use our knowledge of the derivative of
the sine this D sine of H is going to be
about cosine of H times D H that's what
it means for the derivative of sine to
be cosine and unfolding things we can
just replace that H with x squared again
so we know that that bottom nudge is
going to have a size of cosine of x
squared times d x squared and in fact
let's unfold things even further that
intermediate najdi x squared is going to
be about two x times DX and it's always
a good habit to remind yourself of what
an expression like this actually means
in this case where we started at x
equals one point five up top this whole
expression is telling us that the size
of the nudge on that third line is going
to be about cosine of one point five
squared times two times one point five
times whatever the size of DX was it's
proportional to the size of DX and this
derivative is giving us that
proportionality
notice what we came out with here we
have the derivative of the outside
function and it's still taking in the
unaltered inside function and then we're
multiplying it by the derivative of that
inside function
again there is nothing special about
sine of X or x squared if you have any
two functions G of X and H of X the
derivative of their composition G of H
of X is going to be the derivative of G
evaluated on H multiplied by the
derivative of H this pattern right here
is what we usually call the chain rule
notice for the derivative of G and
writing it as DG D H instead of DG DX on
the symbolic level this is a reminder
that the thing you plug in to that
derivative is still going to be that
intermediary function H but more than
that it's an important reflection of
what this derivative of the outer
function actually represents remember in
our three line setup when we took the
derivative of the sign on that bottom we
expanded the size of that nudge D sine
as cosine of H times D H this was
because we didn't immediately know how
the size of that bottom nudge depended
on X that's kind of the whole thing we
were trying to figure out but we could
take the derivative with respect to that
intermediate variable H that is figure
out how to express the size of that
nudge on the third line as some multiple
of D H the size of the nudge on the
second line and it was only after that
that we unfolded further by figuring out
what D H was
so in this chain rule expression we're
saying look at the ratio between a tiny
change in G the final output to a tiny
change in H that caused it H being the
value that we plug in to G then multiply
that by the tiny change in H divided by
the tiny change in X that caused it so
notice those D H's cancel out and they
give us a ratio between the change in
that final output and the change to the
input that through a certain chain of
events brought it about and that
cancellation of D H is not just a
notational trick that is a genuine
reflection of what's going on with the
tiny nudges that underpin everything we
do with derivatives
so those are the three basic tools to
have in your belt to handle derivatives
of functions that combine a lot of
smaller things you've got the Sun rule
the product rule and the chain rule and
I'll be honest with you there is a big
difference between knowing what the
chain rule is and what the product rule
is and actually being fluent with
applying them in even the most hairy of
situations watching videos any videos
about the mechanics of calculus is never
going to substitute for practicing those
mechanics yourself and building up the
muscles to do these computations
yourself I really wish that I could
offer to do that for you but I'm afraid
the ball is in your court my friend to
seek out the practice what I can offer
and what I hope I have offered is to
show you where these rules actually come
from to show that they're not just
something to be memorized and hammered
away but their natural patterns things
that you two could have discovered just
by patiently thinking through what a
derivative actually means thank you to
everyone who supported this series and
once more I'd like to say a special
thanks to brilliant org for those of you
who want to go flex those
problem-solving muscles brilliant offers
a platform aimed at training you to
think like a mathematician with just
these sorts of problems I don't know
about you but I've always found it all
too easy to fall into the habit of just
reading math or watching lectures
without taking the time to do some real
problem-solving in between even though
that's always the part where I learn the
most brilliant is a great place to get
that practice and if you visit brilliant
org slash 3 b-1b or more simply follow
the link on the screen and in the video
description it lets them know you came
from this channel their calculus
material is a really nice complement to
this series but some of my other
favorites are their probability and
complex algebra sequences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
