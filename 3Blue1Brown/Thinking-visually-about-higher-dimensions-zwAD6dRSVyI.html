seduces us with the beauty of reasoning
geometrically in two and three
dimensions where there's this really
nice back-and-forth between pairs or
triplets of numbers and spatial stuff
that our visual cortex is good at
processing for example if you think
about a circle with radius one centered
at the origin you are in effect
conceptualizing every possible pair of
numbers x and y that satisfy a certain
numerical property that x squared plus y
squared is 1 and the usefulness here is
that a lot of facts that look opaque in
a purely analytics become quite clear
geometrically and vice-versa
honestly this channel has been the
direct beneficiary of this back and
forth since it offers such a rich
library of that special category of
cleverness that involves connecting two
seemingly disparate ideas and I don't
just mean the general back and forth
between pairs or triplets of numbers and
spatial reasoning I mean this specific
one between sums of squares and circles
and spheres it's at the heart of the
video I made showing how pi is connected
to number theory in primes and the one
showing how to visualize all possible
Pythagorean triples it also underlies
the video on the Borsig Coulomb theorem
being used to solve what was basically a
counting puzzle by using topological
facts about spheres there is no doubt
that the ability to frame analytic facts
geometrically is very useful for math
but it's all a tease because when you
start asking questions about quadruplets
or quintuplets or 100 tuples of numbers
it's frustrating the constraints on our
physical space seem to have constrained
our intuitions about geometry and we
lose this back and forth I mean it is
completely reasonable to imagine that
there are problems out there that would
have clever and illuminating solutions
if only we knew how to conceptualize say
lists of 10 numbers as individual points
in some space for mathematicians or
computer scientists or physicists
problems that are framed in terms of
lists of numbers lists of more than
three numbers are a regular part of the
job and the standard approach
to actually doing math in higher
dimensions is to use two and three
dimensions for analogy but to
fundamentally reason about things just
analytically somewhat analogous to a
pilot relying primarily on instruments
and not sight while flying through the
clouds now what I want to offer here is
a hybrid between the purely geometric
and the purely analytic view z-- a
method for making the analytic reasoning
a little more visual in a way that
generalizes to arbitrarily high
dimensions and to drive home the value
of a tactic like this I want to share
with you a very famous example where
analogies with two and three dimensions
cannot help because of something
extremely counterintuitive that only
happens in higher dimensions the hope
though is that what I show you here
helps to make that phenomenon more
intuitive the focus throughout will be
on higher dimensional spheres for
example when we talk about a four
dimensional sphere say with radius one
centered at the origin what that
actually is is the set of all
quadruplets of numbers X Y Z W where the
sum of the squares of these numbers is
one what I have pictured here now is
multiple three-dimensional slices of a
4d sphere projected back into three
dimensions but it's confusing and even
if you do wrap your head around it it
just pushes the question back to how you
would think about a five or a six or a
seven dimensional sphere and more
importantly squinting your eyes to
understand a projection like this it's
not very reflective of what doing math
with a 4d sphere actually entails
instead the basic idea here will be to
get very literal about it and to think
about four separate numbers I like to
picture for vertical number lines with
sliders to represent each number each
configuration of these sliders is a
point in 40 space a quadruplet of
numbers and what it means to be on a 4d
Unisphere centered at the origin is that
the sum of the squares of these four
values is 1
our goal is to understand which
movements of these sliders correspond to
movements on the sphere to do that it
helps if we knock things down to two
dimensions where we can actually see the
circle so ask yourself what's a nice way
to think about this relation that x
squared plus y squared is 1 well I like
to think of the value of x squared as
the real estate belonging to X and
likewise the value of y squared is the
real estate belonging to Y and that they
have a total of one unit of real estate
to share between them so moving around
on the circle corresponds to a constant
exchange of real estate between the two
variables part of the reason I choose
this term is that it lets us make a very
useful analogy that real estate is cheap
near zero and more expensive away from
zero to see this consider starting off
in a position where x equals one and y
is zero meaning x has all of the real
estate to itself which in our usual
geometric picture means we're on the
right most point of the circle if you
move X down just a bit to 0.9 the value
of x squared changes to zero point eight
one so it has in effect given up zero
point one nine units of real estate but
for y squared to increase by that same
amount Y has to move an entire zero
point four four units away from zero
more than four times the amount that X
moved in other words exchanged a little
to give up expensive real estate so that
Y could move a lot and gain the same
value of cheap real estate in terms of
the usual circle drawing this
corresponds to the steep slope near the
right side a small nudge in X allows for
a very big change to Y moving forward
let's add some tick marks to these lines
to indicate what 0.05 units of real
estate looks like at each point that is
how much would X have to change so that
the value of x squared changes by 0.05
as you walk around the circle the
trade-off in value between x squared + y
squared gives this piston looking dance
motion where the sliders are moving more
slowly away from 0
because real estate is more expensive in
those regions there were just more tick
marks to cover per unit distance also a
nice side effect of the term real estate
is that it aligns naturally with the
fact that it comes in units of distance
squared so the square root of the total
real estate among all coordinates gives
us the distance from the origin for a
unit sphere in three dimensions the set
of all Triplets XY Z where the sum of
their squares is 1 all we have to do is
add a third slider for Z but these three
sliders still only have the one unit of
real estate to share between them to get
a feel for this imagine holding X in
place at 0.5 where it occupies 0.25
units of real estate what this means is
that y and z can move around in the same
Piston dense motion we saw before as
they trade off the remaining 0.75 units
of real estate in terms of our typical
way of visualizing a sphere this
corresponds to slicing the sphere along
the plane where X is 0.5 and looking at
the circle formed by all of the choices
for y&amp;amp;z on that sphere as you increase
the value of X the amount of real estate
left over for y&amp;amp;z is smaller and this
more constrained piston dance is what it
feels like for the circular slice to be
smaller eventually once X reaches the
value 1 there's no real estate left over
so you reach this singularity point
where y and z are both forced to be 0
the feeling here is a bit like being a
bug on the surface of the sphere you are
unable to see the whole sphere all at
once instead you're just sitting on a
single point and you have some sense for
what local movements are allowed
in four dimensions and higher we lose
the crutch of the global view that a
spatial visual offers but the
fundamental rules of this real estate
exchange remain the same if you fix one
slider in place and watch the other
three trade off this is basically what
it means to take a slice of the 4d
sphere to get a small 3d sphere in much
the same way that fixing one of the
sliders for the three dimensional case
give us a circular slice when the
remaining two were free to vary now
watching these sliders move about and
thinking about the real estate exchange
is pretty fun but it runs the risk of
being aimless unless we have an actual
high dimensional puzzle to sink our
teeth into so let's set aside the
sliders for just a moment and bring in a
very classic example of something that
seems reasonable and even dull in two
and three dimensions but which is
totally out of whack in higher
dimensions to start take a 2x2 box
centered at the origin its corners
around the vertices 1 1 1 negative 1
negative 1 1 and negative 1 negative 1
draw four circles each with radius one
centered at these four vertices so each
one is tangent to two of its neighbors
now I want you to think of the circle
centered at the origin which is just
large enough to be touching those corner
circles tangent to each one of them what
we want to do for this setup and for its
analogies in higher dimensions is find
the radius of that inner circle here in
two dimensions we can use the
Pythagorean theorem to see that the
distance from the origin to the corner
of the box is the square root of two
which is around 1.4 1/4 then you can
subtract off this portion here the
radius of the corner circle which by
definition is 1 and that means the
radius of the inner circle is square
root of 2 minus 1 or about 0.4 1/4 no
surprises here that seems pretty
reasonable now do something analogous in
three dimensions draw a 2 by 2 by 2 cube
whose corners have vertices 1 1 1 1 1
negative 1 on
and then we're gonna take eight
different spheres each of which has a
radius one and center them on these
vertices so that each one is tangent to
three of its neighbors now again think
about the sphere centered at the origin
which is just large enough to be barely
touching those eight corner spheres as
before we can start by thinking about
the distance from the origin to the
corner of the box say the corner at 1 1
1 by the way I guess I still haven't yet
explicitly said that the way distances
work in higher dimensions is always to
add up the squares of the components in
each direction and take the square root
if you've never seen why this follows
from the Pythagorean theorem just in the
2-dimensional case it's actually a
really fun puzzle to think about and
I've left the relevant image up on the
screen for any of you who want to pause
and ponder on it anyway in our case the
distance between the origin and the
corner 1 1 1 is the square root of 1
squared plus 1 squared plus 1 squared or
square root of 3 which is about 1.7 3 so
the radius of that inner sphere is going
to be this quantity minus the radius of
a corner sphere which by definition is 1
and again 0.73 seems like a reasonable
radius for that inner sphere but what
happens to that inner radius as you
increase dimensions
obviously the reason I bring this up is
that something surprising will happen
and some of you might see where this is
going but actually don't want it to feel
like a surprise as fun as it is to wow
people with counterintuitive facts in
math the goal here is genuine
understanding not shock for higher
dimensions will be using sliders to get
a gut feel for what's going on but since
it's kind of a different way of viewing
things it helps to get a running start
by looking back at how to analyze the
two and three-dimensional cases in the
context of sliders first things first
how do you think about a circle centered
at a corner like one negative one well
previously for a circle centered at the
origin the amount of real estate
belonging to both x and y was dependent
on their distance from the number 0
and it's the same basic idea here as you
move around the center it's just that
the real estate might be dependent on
the distance between each coordinate and
some other number so for this circle
centered at 1 negative 1 the amount of
real estate belonging to X is the square
of its distance from 1 likewise the real
estate belonging to Y is the square of
its distance from negative 1 other than
that the looking feel with this piston
dance trade-off is completely the same
for simplicity we'll only focus on one
of these circles the one centered at 1 1
now ask yourself what does it mean to
find a circle centered at the origin
large enough to be tangent to this guy
when we're thinking just in terms of
sliders well notice how this point of
tangency happens when the x and y
coordinates are both the same or frays
differently at the point of this corner
circle closest to the origin the real
estate is shared evenly between x and y
this will be important for later so
let's really dig in and think about why
it's true
imagine perturbing that point slightly
maybe moving X a little closer to 0
which means Y would have to move a
little away from 0 the change in X would
have to be a little smaller than the
change in Y since the real estate it
gains by moving farther away from 1 is
more expensive than the real estate that
Y loses by getting closer to 1 but from
the perspective of the origin point 0 0
that trade-off is reversed the resulting
change to x squared is smaller than the
resulting change to y squared since when
real estate is measured with respect to
0 0 that move of Y towards 1 is the more
expensive one what this means is that
any slight perturbation away from this
point where real estate is shared evenly
results in an increasing distance from
the origin the reason we care is that
this point is tangent to the inner
circle so we can also think about it as
being a point of the inner circle and
this will be very useful for higher
dimensions it gives us a reference point
to understanding the radius of that
inner circle specifically you can ask
how much real estate is shared between x
and y at this point when real estate
measurements are done with respect to
the origin 0 0 for example down here in
two dimensions both x and y dip below
0.5 in this configuration so the total
value x squared plus y squared is going
to be less than 0.5 squared plus 0.5
squared comparing to this halfway point
is really going to come in handy for
wrapping our mind around what happens in
higher dimensions taking things one step
at a time let's bump it up to three
dimensions consider the corner sphere
with radius 1 centered at 1 1 1 the
point on that sphere that's closest to
the origin corresponds to the
configuration of sliders where x y and z
are all reaching down toward 0 and equal
to each other again they all have to go
a little beyond that halfway point
because the position zero point 5 only
accounts for 0.5 squared or 0.25 units
of real estate so with all three
coordinates getting 1/3 of a unit of
real estate they need to be farther out
and again since this is a point where
the corner sphere is tangent to the
inner sphere it's also a point of the
inner sphere so with reference to the
origin 0 0 0 think about the amount of
real estate shared between XY and z in
this position corresponding to the
tangent point it's definitely less than
0.75 since all three of these are
smaller than 0.5 so each one has less
than 0.25 units of real estate and again
we sit back and feel comfortable with
this result right the inner sphere is
smaller than the corner spheres but
things get interesting when we move up
into four dimensions our 2 by 2 by 2 by
2 box is gonna have 16 vertices at 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 negative 1 and so on with all
possible binary combinations of 1 and
negative 1
what this means is that there are 16
units fears centered at these corners
each one tangent to four of its
neighbors as before we'll just be
focusing on one of them the one centered
at one one one one the point of the
sphere closest to the origin corresponds
to the configuration of sliders where
all four coordinates reach exactly
halfway between one and zero and that's
because when one of the coordinates is
zero point five units away from one it
has zero point two five units of real
estate with respect to the point one we
do the same trick as before thinking of
this now as a point of the inner sphere
and measuring things with respect to the
origin
but you can already see what's cool
about four dimensions as you switch to
thinking of real estate with respect to
zero zero zero zero it's still the case
that each of these four coordinates has
zero point two five units of real estate
making for a total of one shared between
the four coordinates in other words that
inner sphere is precisely the same size
as the corner spheres this matches with
what you see numerically by the way
where you can compute the distance
between the origin and the corner one
one one one is the square root of four
and then when you subtract off the
radius of one of the corners fears what
you get is one but there's something
much more satisfying about seeing in
rather than just computing it in
particular here's a cool aspect of the
fact that that inner sphere has radius
one move things around so that all of
the real estate goes to the coordinate X
and you'll end up at the point one zero
zero zero this point is actually
touching the two by two by two by two
box and when you're stuck thinking in
the two or three dimensional cases this
fact that the inner sphere has radius
one the same size as the corner spheres
and that it touches the box well it just
seems too big but it's important to
realize this is fundamentally a four
dimensional phenomenon and you just
can't cram it down into smaller
dimensions
but things get weirder let's knock it up
to five dimensions in this case we have
quite a few corners here's 32 in total
but again for simplicity we'll only be
thinking about the one syndra dead one
one one one one think about the point of
the sphere closest to the origin where
all five coordinates are equally
splitting the one unit of shared
real-estate this time each coordinate is
a little higher than 0.5 if they reach
down to 0.5 each one would have point to
5 units of real estate giving a total of
1.25 which is too much but the tables
are turned when you view this as a point
on the inner sphere because with respect
to the origin this configuration has
much more than one unit of real estate
not only is every coordinate more than
point five units away from zero but the
larger number of dimensions means that
there's more total real estate when you
add it all up specifically you can
compute that the radius of that inner
sphere is about 1.2 for the intuitive
feel for what that means is that the
sliders can roam over more territory
than what just a single unit of real
estate would allow one fun way to see
what this means is to adjust everything
so that all of the real estate goes to
just one coordinate because this
coordinate can reach beyond one what you
are seeing is that this five dimensional
inner sphere actually pokes outside the
box but to really get a feel for how
strange things become as a last example
I want to jump up into ten dimensions
remember all this means is that points
have ten coordinates for a sphere with
radius one a single unit of real estate
must be shared among all ten of those
coordinates as always the point of this
corner sphere closest to the origin is
the one where all ten coordinates split
the real estate evenly and here you can
really see just how far away this feels
from the origin or it frays differently
that inner sphere is allowed to have a
very large amount of real estate in fact
you can compute that the radius of the
inner sphere is about two point one six
and viewed from this perspective where
you have tenfold the mentions to share
that real estate doesn't it actually
feel somewhat reasonable that the inner
sphere should have a radius more than
twice as big as all those corner spheres
to get a sense for just how big this
inner sphere is look back in two
dimensions and imagine a four by four
box bounding all four circles from the
outside or go to three dimensions and
imagine a four by four by four box
bounding all of those corner spheres
from the outside way up here in ten
dimensions that quote-unquote inner
sphere is actually large enough to poke
outside of that outer bounding box since
it has a diameter bigger than four
I know that seems crazy but you have to
realize that the face of the box is
always two units away from the origin no
matter how high the dimension is and
fundamentally it's because it only
involves moving along a single axis but
the point 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 which
determines the inner spheres radius is
actually really far away from the center
all the way up here in 10 dimensions and
it's because all 10 of those dimensions
add a full unit of real estate for that
point and of course as you keep upping
the dimensions that inner sphere just
keeps growing without bound not only is
it poking outside of these boxes but the
proportion of the inner sphere lying
inside the box decreases exponentially
towards zero as the dimension keeps
increasing so taking a step back one of
the things I like about using this
slider method for teaching is that when
I shared it with a few friends the way
they started to talk about higher
dimensions became a little less
metaphysical and started to sound more
like how you would hear a mathematician
talk about the topic rather than
skeptically asking whether or not 10
dimensional space is a real thing
recognizing that it's exactly as real as
numbers are people would actually probe
at what other properties high
dimensional spheres have and what other
shapes feel like in terms of sliders
this box situation is just one in a
number of things that feel very crazy
about higher dimensional spheres and
it's really fun to think about these
others in the context of sliders and
real estate
it's obviously limited I mean you're a
bug on the surface of these objects only
getting a feel for one point at a time
and for the rules of movement also
geometry can be quite nice when its
coordinate free and this is the opposite
of that but it does give a foothold into
thinking about high dimensional shapes a
little more concretely
now you could say that viewing things
with sliders is no different from
thinking about things purely
analytically
I mean it's honestly a little more than
representing each coordinate literally
it's kind of the most obvious thing you
might do but this small move makes it
much more possible to play with the
thought of a high dimensional point and
even little things like thinking about
the squares of coordinates as real
estate can shed light on some seemingly
strange aspects of high dimensions like
just how far away the corner of a box is
from its center if anything the fact
that it's such a direct representation
of a purely analytic is exactly what
makes it such a faithful reflection of
what genuinely doing math and higher
dimensions entails we're still flying in
the clouds trusting the instruments of
analytic reasoning but this is a
redesign of those instruments one which
better takes advantage of the fact that
such a large portion of our brains goes
towards image processing I mean just
because you can't visualize something
doesn't mean you can't still think about
it visually before you go I've got a
couple announcements for you guys
including a QA follow-up that I owe you
first off I want to tell you about
brilliant org who helped to support this
video this is just such a good example
of strong alignment between sponsor and
content creator a lot of people ask me
for advice on where and how to learn
more math and more than anything I
cannot emphasize enough how important it
is to prioritize active problem-solving
with things like lectures and readings
serving as a supplement to that main
goal and there's an irony in me saying
that since the videos I create are a
form of passive education but my real
hope with these is that they inspire
people to go and actively play with math
brilliant org is one of the best places
on the internet to do that I'm a member
of their subscription service and I
think anyone watching this video would
enjoy their course on the joy of problem
solving or aptly enough outside of the
box geometry also their complex algebra
course is really good but there's just
many many good things to choose from
both in and out of math the user
experience is one of going through a
very thoughtfully curated list of
puzzles and questions and honestly it's
just really fun
if you follow the link brilliant org
slash three b-1b that lets them know
that you came from here also I'm
starting a podcast it's with two very
smart guys each named Ben where we talk
about education and various other things
some of you may remember that last video
I elicited Q&amp;amp;A questions and the first
episode includes my responses to many of
them for the version of it up on YouTube
I actually had some fun and made the
background video just a point wandering
aimlessly around on a 10 dimensional
sphere for an hour and it's weirdly
captivating to watch so if you want to
learn stuff go check out brilliant if
you want more passive consumption check
out the podcast and as always if you
want to help out the channel consider
