line straight through the space which
was encircled is divided into two to
these points out a third one which gives
us two more chords the space through
which these lines run has been figured
into four continue with the fourth point
and three more lines drawn straight now
the count of disjoint region sums in all
to eight a fifth point and it's four
lines support this pattern gleaned
counting sections one Divine's that
there are now 16 this pattern here of
doubling does seem a sturdy one but one
more step is troubling as the 6th gives
31 wait what 1 2 4 8 16 31 what's going
on here why does the pattern start off
as powers of 2 only to fall short by one
at the sixth iteration that seems
arbitrary why not 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 1 2 4
8 15 if you keep going the number of
sections deviates even further from
powers of 2 except when it hits 256 but
this just begs the question of what the
pattern really is and why it flirts with
powers of 2 in my next few videos I'll
explain what's happening which will
include one of my all-time favorite
proofs but interesting problems deserve
to be shared pondered and discussed
before their secrets are hastily
revealed so while I work on animating my
explanation I encourage you to think of
your own to be clear the question is
this if you take some set of points on a
circle and connect every pair of them
with a line how many pieces do these
lines cut the circle into doesn't matter
where these points are and why does the
answer coincide with powers of 2 for
fewer than 6 points
