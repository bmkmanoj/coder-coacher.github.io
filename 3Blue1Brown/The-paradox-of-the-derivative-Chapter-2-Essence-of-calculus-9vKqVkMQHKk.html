derivative is the thing is though
there's some subtlety to this topic and
a lot of potential for paradoxes if
you're not careful so kind of a
secondary goal is that you have an
appreciation for what those paradoxes
are and how to avoid them
you see it's common for people to say
that the derivative measures an
instantaneous rate of change but when
you think about it that freeze is
actually an oxymoron change is something
that happens between separate points and
time and when you blind yourself to all
but just a single instant there's not
really any room for change you'll see
what I mean more as we get into it but
when you appreciate that a phrase like
instantaneous rate of change is actually
nonsense I think it makes you appreciate
just how clever the fathers of calculus
were in capturing the idea that that
phrase is meant to evoke but with a
perfectly sensible piece of math the
derivative as our central example I want
you to imagine a car that starts at some
point a speeds up and then slows down to
a stop at some point be a hundred meters
away and let's say it all happens over
the course of ten seconds
that's the set up to have in mind as we
lay out what the derivative is we could
graph this motion letting the vertical
axis represent the distance traveled and
the horizontal axis represent time
so at each time tea represented with a
point somewhere on this horizontal axis
the height of the graph tells us how far
the car has traveled in total after that
amount of time it's pretty common to
name a distance function like this s of
T I would use the letter D for distance
but that guy already has another
full-time job in calculus initially this
curve is quite shallow since the car is
slow to start
during that for a second the distance
that it travels doesn't really change
that much then for the next few seconds
as the car speeds up the distance
traveled in a given second gets larger
which corresponds to a steeper slope in
this graph and then towards the end when
it slows down that curve shallows out
again
and if we were to plot the cars velocity
in meters per second as a function of
time it might look like this bump at
early times the velocity is very small
up to the middle of the journey the car
builds up to some maximum velocity
covering a relatively large distance
each second then it slows back down
towards the speed of zero
and these two curves here are definitely
related to each other right if you
change the specific distance versus time
function you're going to have some
different velocity versus time function
and what we want to understand is the
specifics of that relationship exactly
how does velocity depend on a distance
versus time function
and to do that it's worth taking a
moment to think critically about what
exactly velocity means here intuitively
we all might know what velocity at a
given moment means it's just whatever
the cars speedometer shows in that
moment
and intuitively it might make sense that
the cars velocity should be higher at
times when this distance function is
steeper when the cart reverses more
distance per unit time but the funny
thing is velocity at a single moment
makes no sense if I show you a picture
of a car just a snapshot in an instant
and I ask you how fast it's going
you'd have no way of telling me what
you'd need are two separate points in
time to compare that way you can compute
whatever the change in distance across
those times is divided by the change in
time right I mean that's what velocity
is it's the distance traveled per unit
time so how is it that we're looking at
a function for velocity that only takes
in a single value of T a single snapshot
in time it's weird isn't it we want to
associate individual points in time with
a velocity but actually computing
velocity requires comparing two separate
points in times
if that feels strange and paradoxical
good you're grappling with the same
conflicts that the father's our calculus
did and if you want a deep understanding
for rates of change not just for a
moving car but for all sorts of things
in science you're going to need to
resolve this apparent paradox
first I think it's best to talk about
the real world and then we'll go into a
purely mathematical one let's think
about what the cars speedometer is
probably doing at some point say three
seconds into the journey the speedometer
might measure how far the car goes in a
very small amount of time maybe the
distance traveled between three seconds
and 3.01 seconds then it could compute
the speed in meters per second as that
tiny distance traversed in meters
divided by that tiny time 0.01 seconds
that is a physical car just sidesteps
the paradox and doesn't actually compute
speed at a single point in time it
computes speed during a very small
amount of time so let's call that
difference in time DT which you might
think of in this case as 0.01 seconds
and let's call that resulting difference
in distance D s so the velocity at some
point in time is DS divided by DT the
tiny change in distance over the tiny
change in time graphically you can
imagine zooming in on some point of this
distance versus time graph above T
equals 3 that DT is a small step to the
right since time is on the horizontal
axis and that D s is the resulting
change in the height of the graph since
the vertical axis represents the
distance traveled so DS divided by DT is
something you can think of as the rise
over run slope between two very close
points on this graph of course there's
nothing special about the value T equals
3 we could apply this to any other point
in time so we consider this expression
DS over DT to be a function of T
something where I can give you a time T
and you can give me back the value of
this ratio at that time the velocity as
a function of time so for example when I
had the computer draw this bump curve
here the one representing the velocity
function here's what I had the computer
actually do first I chose a small value
for DT I think in this case it was 0.01
then I have the computer look at a whole
bunch of times T between 0 and 10 and
compute the distance function S at T
plus DT and then subtract off the value
of that function at T
in other words that's the difference in
the distance traveled between the given
time T and the time 0.01 seconds after
that then you can just divide that
difference by the change in time DT and
that gives you velocity in meters per
second around each point in time
so with a formula like this you could
give the computer any curve representing
any distance function s of T and it
could figure out the curve representing
velocity so that would be a good time to
pause reflect make sure that this idea
of relating distance to velocity by
looking at tiny changes make sense
because what we're going to do is tackle
the paradox of the derivatives head-on
this idea of des over dt a tiny change
in the value of the function s divided
by the tiny change in the input that
caused it that's almost what a
derivative is and even though a car's
speedometer will actually look at a
concrete change in time like 0.01
seconds and even though the drawing
program here is looking at an actual
concrete change in time in pure math the
derivative is not this ratio dsdt for a
specific choice of DT instead it's
whatever that ratio approaches as your
choice for DT approaches zero
luckily there is a really nice visual
understanding for what it means to ask
what this ratio approaches remember for
any specific choice of DT this ratio D s
DT is the slope of a line passing
through two separate points on the graph
right well as DT approaches 0 and as
those two points approach each other the
slope of the line approaches the slope
of a line that's tangent to the graph at
whatever point T were looking at so the
true honest-to-goodness pure math
derivative is not the rise over run
slope between two nearby points on the
graph it's equal to the slope of a line
tangent to the graph at a single point
now notice what I'm not saying I'm not
saying that the derivative is whatever
happens when DT is infinitely small
whatever that would mean nor am i saying
that you plug in zero for DT this DT is
always a finitely small nonzero value
it's just that it approaches zero is all
I think that's really clever
even though change in an instant makes
no sense this idea of letting DT
approach zero is a really sneaky
backdoor way to talk reasonably about
the rate of change at a single point in
time isn't that neat it's kind of
flirting with the paradox of change in
an instant without ever needing to
actually touch it and it comes with such
a nice visual intuition too as the slope
of a tangent line to a single point on
the graph and because change in an
instant still makes no sense I think is
healthiest for you to think of this
slope not as some instantaneous rate of
change but instead as the best constant
approximation for a rate of change
around a point by the way it's worth
saying a couple words on notation here
throughout this video I've been using DT
to refer to a tiny change in T with some
actual size and D s to refer to the
resulting change in s which again has an
actual size and this is because that's
how I want you to think about them but
the convention in calculus is that
whenever you're using the letter D like
this you're kind of announcing your
intention that eventually you're going
to see what happens as DT approaches
zero
for example the honest-to-goodness pure
math derivative is written as DS divided
by DT even though it's technically not a
fraction per se but whatever that
fraction approaches for smaller and
smaller nudges in T
I think a specific example should help
here you might think that asking about
what this ratio approaches for smaller
and smaller values would make it much
more difficult to compute but weirdly it
kind of makes things easier
let's say that you have a given distance
versus time function that happens to be
exactly T cubed so after one second
the car has traveled one cubed equals
one meters after two seconds its
traveled two cubed or eight meters and
so on now what I'm about to do might
seem somewhat complicated but once the
dust settles it really is simpler and
more importantly it's the kind of thing
that you only ever have to do once in
calculus let's say you wanted to compute
the velocity DS divided by DT at some
specific time like T equals two and for
right now let's think of DT is having an
actual size some concrete nudge will let
it go to zero in just a bit the tiny
change in distance between two seconds
and two plus DT seconds well that's s of
two plus DT minus s of two and we divide
that by DT since our function is T cubed
that numerator looks like two plus DT
cubed minus two cubed and this this is
something we can work out algebraically
again bear with me there's a reason that
I'm showing you the details here when
you expand that top what you get is two
cubed plus three times two squared DT
plus three times two times DT squared
plus DT cubed and all of that is minus 2
cubed now there's a lot of terms and I
want you to remember that it looks like
a mess but it does simplify those two
cubed terms they cancel out and then
everything remaining here has a DT in it
and since there's a DT on the bottom
there many of those cancel out as well
what this means is that the ratio DS
divided by DT has boiled down into 3
times 2 squared plus well two different
terms that each have a DT in them so if
we ask what happens as DT approaches
zero representing the idea of looking at
a smaller and smaller change in time we
can just completely ignore those other
terms
by eliminating the need to think about a
specific DT we've actually eliminated a
lot of the complication in the full
expression so what we're left with is
this nice clean three times two squared
you can think of that as meaning that
the slope of a line tangent to the point
at T equals two of this graph is exactly
3 times 2 squared or 12 and of course
there's nothing special about the time T
equals 2 we could more generally say
that the derivative of T cubed as a
function of T is 3 times T squared
now take a step back because that's
beautiful the derivative is this crazy
complicated idea we've got tiny changes
in distance over tiny changes in time
but instead of looking at any specific
one of those we're talking about what
that thing approaches I mean that's a
lot to think about and yet what we've
come out with is such a simple
expression three times T squared and in
practice you wouldn't go through all
this algebra each time knowing that the
derivative of T cubed is 3t squared is
one of those things that all calculus
students learn how to do immediately
without having to read arrive at each
time and in the next video I'm going to
show you a nice way to think about this
and a couple other derivative formulas
in really nice geometric ways but the
point I want to make by showing you all
of the algebraic guts here is that when
you consider the tiny change in distance
caused by a tiny change in time for some
specific value of DT you'd have kind of
a mess but when you consider what that
ratio approaches as DT approaches zero
it lets you ignore much of that mess and
it really does simplify the problem that
right there is kind of the heart of why
calculus becomes useful another reason
to show you a concrete derivative like
this is that it sets the stage for an
example of the kind of paradoxes that
come about if you believe too much in
the illusion of instantaneous rate of
change so think about the actual car
traveling according to this t-cubed
distance function and consider its
motion at the moment T equals zero right
at the start now ask yourself whether or
not the car is moving at that time
on the one hand we can compute its speed
at that point using the derivative 3t
squared which for time T equals zero
works out to be zero visually this means
that the tangent line to the graph at
that point is perfectly flat so the car
is quote unquote instantaneous velocity
is zero and that suggests that obviously
it's not moving but on the other hand if
it doesn't start moving at time zero
when does it start moving really pause
and ponder that for a moment is the car
moving at time T equals zero
you see the paradox the issue is that
the question makes no sense it
references the idea of change in a
moment but that doesn't actually exist
that's just not what the derivative
measures what it means for the
derivative of a distance function to be
zero is that the best constant
approximation for the cars velocity
around that point is zero meters per
second for example if you look at an
actual change in time say between time
zero and 0.1 seconds the car does move
it moves 0.001 meters that's very small
and importantly it's very small compared
to the change in time giving an average
speed of only 0.01 meters per second and
remember what it means for the
derivative of this motion to be zero is
that for smaller and smaller nudges in
time this ratio of meters per second
approaches zero but that's not to say
that the car is static approximating its
movement with a constant velocity of
zero is after all just an approximation
so whenever you hear people refer to the
derivative as an instantaneous rate of
change a phrase which is intrinsically
oxymoronic I want you to think of that
as a conceptual shorthand for the best
constant approximation for rate of
change
in the next couple videos I'll be
talking more about the derivative what
it looks like in different contexts how
do you actually compute it why is it
useful things like that focusing on
visual intuition as always as I
mentioned last video this channel is
largely supported by the community
through patreon where you can get early
access to future essence of series like
this as I work on them but one other
supporter of this series who I'm
incredibly proud to feature is the art
of problem solving interestingly enough
I was actually first introduced to the
art of problem solving by my high school
calculus teacher it was the kind of
relationship where I'd frequently stick
around a bit after school just to chat
about math and he was thoughtful and
encouraging and he once gave me a book
and this book really had an influence on
me back then
it showed a certain beauty in math that
you don't really see in school and the
name of that book was the art of problem
solving fast forward to today where the
art of problem solving website offers
many many phenomenal resources for
curious students looking to get into
math most notably their fall courses
this ranges from their newest very
inspiring offering to get young students
engaged with genuine problem solving
called beast Academy up to a higher
level offerings that cover the kind of
topics that all math curious students
should engage with like combinatorics
but which just aren't really emphasized
in common school curricula but simply
they're one of the best math education
companies I know
then I'm proud to have them support the
series you can see what they have to
offer by following the link on the
screen also copied in the video
