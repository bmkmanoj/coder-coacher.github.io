beautiful blend of simplicity and
complexity often including these
infinitely repeating patterns
programmers in particular tend to be
especially fond of them because it takes
a shockingly small amount of code to
produce images that are way more
intricate than any human hand ever could
hope to draw but a lot of people don't
actually know the definition of a
fractal at least not the one that benoit
mandelbrot the father effect all
geometry had in mind a common
misconception is that fractals are
shapes that are perfectly self-similar
for example this snowflake looking shape
right here called the von Koch snowflake
consists of three different segments and
each one of these is perfectly self
similar in that when you zoom in on it
you get a perfectly identical copy of
the original likewise the famous
sierpinski triangle consists of three
smaller identical copies of itself and
don't get me wrong
self similar shapes are definitely
beautiful and they're a good toy model
for what fractals really are but
Mandelbrot had a much broader conception
in mind one motivated not by beauty but
more by a pragmatic desire to model
nature in a way that actually captures
roughness in some ways fractal geometry
is a rebellion against calculus whose
central assumption is that things tend
to look smooth if you zoom in far enough
but Mandelbrot saw this as overly
idealized or at least
needlessly idealized resulting in models
that neglect the finer details of the
thing that they're actually modeling
which can matter what he observed is
that self similar shapes give a basis
for modeling the regularity in some
forms of roughness but the popular
perception that fractals only include
perfectly self-similar shapes is another
over idealization one that ironically
goes against the pragmatic spirit of
fractal geometries origins the real
definition of fractals has to do with
this idea of fractal dimension the main
topic of this video you see there is a
sense a certain way to define the word
dimension in which the sierpinski
triangle is approximately one point five
eight five dimensional that the von Koch
curve is approximately one point two six
two-dimensional the coastline of Britain
turns out to be around one point to one
dimensional and in general
it's possible to have shapes whose
dimension is any positive real number
not just whole numbers I think when I
first heard someone reference fractional
dimension like this I just thought it
was nonsense right I mean mathematicians
are clearly just making stuff up
dimension is something that usually only
makes sense for natural numbers right a
line is one dimensional a plane that's
two-dimensional the space that we live
in that's three-dimensional and so on
and in fact any linear algebra student
who just learned the formal definition
of dimension in that context would agree
it only makes sense for counting numbers
and of course the idea of fractal
dimension is just made up I mean this is
math everything's made up but the
question is whether or not it turns out
to be a useful construct for modeling
the world and I think you'll agree once
you learn how fractal dimension is
defined it's something that you start
seeing almost everywhere that you look
it actually helps to start the
discussion here by only looking at
perfectly self-similar shapes in fact
I'm going to start with four shapes the
first three of which aren't even
fractals a line a square a cube and as
your Pinsky triangle all of these shapes
are self-similar
a line can be broken up into two smaller
lines each of which is a perfect copy of
the original just scale down by a half a
square can be broken down into four
smaller squares each of which is a
perfect copy of the original just scale
down by 1/2 likewise a cube can be
broken down into eight smaller cubes
again each one is a scaled down version
by 1/2 and the core characteristic of
the sierpinski triangle is that it's
made of three smaller copies of itself
and the length of the side of one of
those smaller copies is one-half the
side length of the original triangle now
it's fun to compare how we measure these
things we'd say that the smaller line is
one half the length of the original line
the smaller square is one quarter the
area of the original square the smaller
cube is one eighth the volume of the
original cube and that smaller
sierpinski triangle well we'll talk
about how to measure that in just a
moment what I want is a word that
generalizes the idea of length area and
volume but that I can apply to all of
those shapes and
and typically in math the word that
you'd use for this is measure but I
think it might be more intuitive to talk
about mass as an imagine that each of
these shapes is made out of metal a thin
wire a flat sheet a solid cube and some
kind of sierpinski mesh fractal
dimension has everything to do with
understanding how the mass of these
shapes changes as you scale them the
benefit of starting the discussion with
self-similar shapes is that it gives us
a nice clear-cut way to compare masses
when you scale down that line by 1/2 the
mass is also scaled down by 1/2 which
you can viscerally see because it takes
two copies of that smaller one to form
the whole when you scale down a square
by 1/2 its massive scale down by 1/4
where again you can see this by piecing
together 4 of the smaller copies to get
the original likewise when you scale
down that cube by 1/2 the mass is scaled
down by 1/8 or 1/2 cubed because it
takes 8 copies of that smaller cube to
rebuild the original and when you scale
down the sierpinski triangle by a factor
of 1/2 wouldn't you agree that it makes
sense to say that it's mass goes down by
a factor of 1/3 I mean it takes exactly
3 of those smaller ones to form the
original but notice that for the line
the square and the cube the factor by
which the mass changed is this nice
clean integer power of 1/2 in fact that
exponent is the dimension of each shape
and what's more you could say that what
it means for a shape to be for example
two-dimensional what puts the 2 in
two-dimensional is that when you scale
it by some factor its mass is scaled by
that factor raised to the second power
and maybe what it means for a shape to
be 3-dimensional is that when you scale
it by some factor the mass is scaled by
the third power of that factor
so if this is our conception of
dimension
what should the dimensionality of a
sierpinski triangle be you'd want to say
that when you scale it down by a factor
of 1/2 its mass goes down by 1/2 ^ well
whatever its dimension is and because
it's self-similar we know that we want
its mass to go down by a factor of 1/3
so what's the number D such that raising
1/2 to the power of D gives you 1/3 well
that's the same as asking 2 to the what
equals 3 the quintessential type of
question that logarithms are meant to
answer and when you go and plug in log
base 2 of 3 to a calculator what you'll
find is that it's about one point five
eight five so in this way the sierpinski
triangle is not one dimensional even
though you could define a curve that
passes through all its points and nor is
it two-dimensional even though it lives
in the plane instead it's one point five
eight five dimensional and if you want
to describe its mass neither length nor
area seemed like the fitting notions if
you tried its length would turn out to
be infinite and its area would turn out
to be zero instead what you want is
whatever the 1.58 5 dimensional analog
of length is here let's look at another
self similar fractal the von Koch curve
this one is composed of four smaller
identical copies of itself each of which
is a copy of the original scaled down by
1/3 so the scaling factor is 1/3 and the
mass has gone down by a factor of 1/4 so
that means the dimension should be some
number D so that when we raise 1/3 to
the power of D it gives us 1/4 well
that's the same as saying 3 to the what
equals 4 so you can go and plug into a
calculator log base 3 of 4 and that
comes out to be around 1 point 2 6 2 so
in a sense the von Koch curve is a one
point two six two-dimensional shape
here's another fun one this is kind of
the right angled version of the Koch
curve it's built up of eight scaled-down
copies of itself where the scaling
factor here is 1/4 so if you want to
know its dimension it should be some
number D such that 1/4 to the power of D
equals 1/8 the factor by which the mass
just decreased and in this case the
value we want is log base 4 of 8 and
that's exactly 3 halves so evidently
this fractal is precisely 1.5
dimensional
does that kind of make sense it's weird
but it's all just about scaling and
comparing masses while you scale and
what I've described so far everything up
to this point is what you might call
self similarity dimension it does a good
job making the idea of fractional
dimension seem at least somewhat
reasonable but there's a problem it's
not really a general notion I mean when
we were reasoning about how a masses
shape should change it relied on the
self similarity of the shapes that you
could build them up from smaller copies
of themselves but that seems
unnecessarily restrictive after all most
two-dimensional shapes are not at all
self similar consider the disk the
interior of a circle we know that's
two-dimensional and you can say that
this is because when you scale it up by
a factor of 2 its mass proportional to
the area gets scaled by the square of
that factor in this case 4 but it's not
like there's some way to piece together
4 copies of that smaller circle to
rebuild the original so how do we know
that that bigger disk is exactly 4 times
the mass of the original answering that
requires a way to make this idea of mass
a little more mathematically rigorous
since we're not dealing with physical
objects made of matter are we we're
dealing with purely geometric ones
living in an abstract space and there's
a couple ways to think about this but
here's a common one cover the plane with
a grid and highlight all of the grid
squares that are touching the disk and
now count how many there are in the back
of our minds we already know that a disk
is two-dimensional and the number of
grid squares that it touches should be
proportional to its area a clever way to
verify this empirically is to scale up
that disk by some factor like 2 and
count how many grid squares touch this
new scaled up version what you should
find is that that number has increased
approximately in proportion to the
square of our scaling factor which in
this case means about four times as many
boxes well admittedly what's on the
screen here might not look that
convincing but it's just because the
grid is really coarse if instead you
took a much finer grid one that more
tightly captures the intent we're going
for here by measuring the size of the
circle that relationship of quadrupling
the number of boxes touched when you
scale the disk by a factor of two should
shine through more clearly
I'll admit though that when I was
animating this I was surprised by just
how slowly this value converges to four
here's one way to think about this if
you were to plot the scaling factor
compared to the number of boxes that the
scaled disc touches your data should
very closely fit a perfect parabola
since the number of boxes touched is
roughly proportional to the square of
the scaling factor for larger and larger
scaling values which is actually
equivalent to just looking at a finer
grid that data is going to more
perfectly fit that parabola now getting
back to fractals let's play this game
with this your Pinsky triangle counting
how many boxes are touching points in
that shape how would you imagine that
number compares to scaling up the
triangle by a factor of two and Counting
the new number of boxes touched
well the proportion of boxes touched by
the big one two the number of boxes
touched by the small one should be about
three after all that bigger version is
just built up of three copies of the
smaller version
you could also think about this as 2
raised to the dimension of the fractal
which we just saw is about one point
five eight five and so if you were to go
and plot the scaling factor in this case
against the number of boxes touched by
the sierpinski triangle the data would
closely fit a curve with the shape of y
equals x to the power one point five
eight five just multiplied by some
proportionality constant but importantly
the whole reason that I'm talking about
this is that we can play the same game
with non self similar shapes that still
have some kind of roughness and the
classic example here is the coastline of
Britain
if you plop that coastline into the
plane and count how many boxes are
touching it and then scale it by some
amount and count how many boxes are
touching that new scaled version what
you'd find is that the number of boxes
touching the coastline increases
approximately in proportion to the
scaling factor raised to the power of
one point two one here it's kind of fun
to think about how you would actually
compute that number empirically as an
imagine I give you some shape and you're
a savvy programmer how would you find
this number so what I'm saying here is
that if you scale this shape by some
factor which I'll call s the number of
boxes touching that shape should equal
some constant multiplied by that scaling
factor raised to whatever the dimension
is the value that we're looking for now
if you have some data plot that closely
fits a curve that looks like the input
raised to some power it can be hard to
see exactly what that power should be so
a common trick is to take the logarithm
of both sides that way the dimension is
going to drop down from the exponent and
we'll have a nice clean linear
relationship what this suggests is that
if you were to plot the log of the
scaling factor against the log of the
number of boxes touching the coastline
the relationship should look like a line
and that line should have a slope equal
to the dimension so what that means is
that if you try it out a whole bunch of
scaling factors count the number of
boxes touching the coast in each instant
and then plotted the points on the log
log plot you could then do some kind of
linear regression
to find the best fit line to your data
set and when you look at the slope of
that line that tells you the empirical
measurement for the dimension of what
you're examining I just think that makes
this idea of fractal dimension so much
more real and visceral compared to
abstract artificially perfect shapes and
once you're comfortable thinking about
dimension like this you my friend have
become ready to hear the definition of a
fractal essentially fractals or shapes
whose dimension is not an integer but
instead some fractional amount what's
cool about that is that it's a
quantitative way to say that they're
shapes that are rough and that they stay
rough even as you zoom in technically
there's a slightly more accurate
definition and I've included it in the
video description but this idea here of
a non integer dimension almost entirely
captures the idea of roughness that
we're going for there is one nuance
though that I haven't brought up yet but
it's worth pointing out which is that
this dimension at least as I've
described it so far using the box
counting method can sometimes change
based on how far zoomed in you are for
example here's a shape sitting in three
dimensions which at a distance looks
like a line in 3d by the way when you do
a box counting you have a 3d grid full
of little cubes instead of little
squares but it works the same way at
this scale where the shapes thickness is
smaller than the size of the boxes it
looks one-dimensional meaning the number
of boxes it touches is proportional to
its length but when you scale it up it
starts behaving a lot more like a tube
touching the boxes on the surface of
that tube and so it'll look
two-dimensional with the number of boxes
touched being proportional to the square
of the scaling factor but it's not
really a tube it's made of these rapidly
winding little curves so once you scale
it up even more to the point where the
boxes can pick up on the details of
those curves
it looks one-dimensional again with the
number of boxes touched scaling directly
in proportion to the scaling constant
so actually assigning a number to a
shape for its dimension can be tricky
and it leaves room for differing
definitions and differing conventions in
a pure math setting there are indeed
numerous definitions for dimension but
all of them focus on what the limit of
this dimension is at closer and closer
zoom levels you can think of that in
terms of the plot as the limit of this
slope as you move farther and farther to
the right so for a purely geometric
shape to be a genuine fractal it has to
continue looking rough even as you zoom
in infinitely far but in a more applied
setting like looking at the coastline of
Britain it doesn't really make sense to
talk about the limit as you zoom in more
and more I mean at some point you just
be hitting atoms instead what you do is
you look at a sufficiently wide range of
scales from very zoomed out up to very
zoomed in and compute the dimension at
each one and in this more applied
setting a shape is typically considered
to be a fractal only when the measured
dimension stays approximately constant
even across multiple different scales
for example the coastline of Britain
doesn't just look one point to one
dimensional at a distance even if you
zoom in by a factor of a thousand the
level of roughness is still around one
point to one that right there is the
sense in which many shapes from nature
actually are self-similar albeit not
perfect self similarity perfectly self
similar shapes do play an important role
in fractal geometry what they give us
are simple to describe low information
examples of this phenomenon of roughness
roughness that persists at many
different scales and at arbitrarily
close scales and that's important it
gives us the primitive tools for
modeling these fractal phenomena but I
think it's also important not to view
them as the prototypical example of
fractals since fractals in general
actually have a lot more character to
them
I really do think that this is one of
those ideas where once you learn it it
makes you start looking at the world
completely differently what this number
is what this fractional dimension gives
us is a quantitative way to describe
roughness for example the coastline of
Norway is about 1.5 2-dimensional which
is a numerical way to communicate the
fact that it's way more jaggedy than
Britain's coastline the surface of a
calm ocean might have a fractal
dimension only barely above 2 while a
stormy one might have a dimension closer
to 2.3 in fact fractal dimension doesn't
just arise frequently in nature it seems
to be the core differentiator between
objects that arise naturally and those
that are just man-made
for the final animation here I have a
certain whimsical pie creature fractal I
want to show you but first I want to
thank the supporters of this channel for
most are those of you contributing on
patreon supporters are getting early
access to essence of calculus videos as
they make them and it's been really nice
having a collection of thoughtful early
viewers to provide feedback this
particular video was also supported in
part by a firm there this financial tech
company where I actually used to work
and these days they're growing a ton
they're always looking to hire talented
software engineers and data scientists
and I know that a lot of you out there
watching a video about fractal dimension
just for fun are that technical talent
like I said in a former life before I
went more into math I was actually on
there data science team and I can tell
you the people there are incredible I
mean I've worked with smart teams before
but a firm has an unusual concentration
of brilliant minds and technology I
think it's one of those things where
smart minds tend to attract other smart
minds in this positive feedback loop you
know what I mean they're tackling
consumer credit in a pretty novel way
that no one else seems to be doing and
they can always benefit from a few more
skilled people that help them just do
what they're doing if you're interested
in applying I've included a link that's
on the screen and in the description to
their careers page and this is kind of a
special link in that if you apply by
first going through that page it will
let both me and a firm know that you
heard about them through this video it's
basically just a way to track the
efficacy of outreach like this so even
if you don't apply immediately and
instead come back a few days later they
would help out for clean data sake if
you still went through the page so you
should definitely check them out and
