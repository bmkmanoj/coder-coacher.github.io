video an unsolved problem a very elegant
solution to a weaker version of the
problem and a little bit about what
topology is and why people care but
Before we jump into it it's worth saying
a few words on why I'm excited to share
the solution when I was a kid since I
loved math and sought out various
Matthieu things I would occasionally
find myself in some talk or a seminar
where people wanted to get the youth
excited about things that mathematicians
care about a very common go-to topic to
excite our imaginations was topology we
might be shown something like a mobius
strip maybe building it out of
construction paper by twisting a
rectangle and gluing its ends look we'd
be told as we were asked to draw a line
along the surface it's a surface with
just one side or we might be told the
topologists View coffee mugs and donuts
as the same thing since each has just
one hole but these kinds of demos always
left a lurking question how is this math
how does any of this actually help to
solve problems it wasn't until I saw the
problem that I'm about to show you with
its elegant and surprising solution that
I started to understand why
mathematicians actually care about some
of these shapes and the properties they
have so there's this unsolved problem
called the inscribed square problem if
you have a closed loop
meaning you squiggle some line through
space in a potentially crazy way and you
end up back where you started the
question is whether or not you'll always
be able to find four points on this loop
that make up a square if your closed
loop was a circle for example it's quite
easy to find an inscribed square
infinitely many in fact
if your loop was instead an ellipse it's
still pretty easy to find an inscribed
square the question is whether or not
every possible closed loop no matter how
crazy has at least one inscribed square
pretty interesting right I mean just the
fact that this is unsolved is
interesting that the current tools of
math can neither confirm nor deny that
there's some loop with no inscribed
square in it now if we weaken the
question a bit and ask about inscribed
rectangles instead of inscribed squares
it's still pretty hard but there is a
beautiful video worthy solution that
might actually be my favorite piece of
math the idea is to shift the focus away
from individual points on the loop and
instead on two pairs of points will use
the following fact about rectangles
let's label the vertices of some
rectangle a b c d then the pair of
points a c has a few things in common
with a pair of points b d the distance
between a and C equals the distance
between B and D and the midpoint of a
and C is the same as the midpoint of B
and D in fact anytime you have two
separate pairs of points in space AC and
BD if you can guarantee that they share
a midpoint and that the distance between
AC equals the distance between B and D
it's enough to guarantee that those four
points make up a rectangle so what we're
going to do is try to prove that for any
closed loop it's always possible to find
two distinct pairs of points on that
loop that share a midpoint and which are
the same distance apart take a moment to
make sure that's clear we're finding two
distinct pairs of points that share a
common midpoint and which are the same
distance apart
the way we'll go about this is to define
a function that takes in pairs of points
on the loop and outputs a single point
in 3d space which kind of encodes the
midpoint and distance information it
will be sort of like a graph
consider the closed loop to be sitting
on the XY plane in 3d space for a given
pair of points label their midpoint M
which will be some point on the XY plane
and label the distance between them D
plot the point which is exactly D units
above that midpoint M in the Z direction
as you do this for many possible pairs
of points you'll effectively be drawing
through 3d space and if you do it for
all possible pairs of points on the loop
you'll draw out some kind of surface
above the plane now look at the surface
and notice how it seems to hug the loop
itself this is actually going to be
important later so let's think about why
it happens
as the pair of points on the loop gets
closer and closer the plotted point gets
lower since its height is by definition
equal to the distance between the points
also the midpoint gets closer and closer
to the loop as the points approach each
other once the pair of points coincides
meaning the input of our function looks
like xxxx for some point X on the loop
the plotted point of the surface will be
exactly on the loop at the point X ok so
remember that another important fact is
that this function is continuous and all
that really means is that if you
slightly adjust a given pair of points
then the corresponding output in 3d
space is only slightly adjusted as well
there's never a sudden discontinuous
jump our goal then is the show that this
function has a collision the two
distinct pairs of points each map to the
same spot in 3d space because the only
way for that to happen is if they share
a common midpoint and if their distance
D apart from each other is the same
so in some sense finding an inscribed
rectangle comes down to showing that
this surface has to intersect itself
you
to move forward from here we need to
build up a relationship with the idea of
pairs of points on a loop
think about how we represent pairs of
real numbers using a two-dimensional
coordinate plane
analogous to this we're going to seek
out a certain 2d surface which naturally
represents all pairs of points on the
loop understanding the properties of
this surface will help to show why the
graph that we just defined has to
intersect itself
now when I say pair of points there are
two things that I could be talking about
the first is ordered pairs of points
which would mean a pair like a B would
be considered distinct from the pair B a
that is there's some notion of which
point is the first one the second idea
is unordered points where a B and B a
would be considered the same thing where
all that really matters is what the
points are and there's no meaning to
which one is first ultimately we want to
understand unordered pairs of points but
to get there we need to take a path of
thought through ordered pairs
we'll start out by straightening out the
loop cutting it at some point and
deforming it into an interval for the
sake of having some labels let's say
that this is the interval on the number
line from 0 to 1 by following where each
point ends up every point on the loop
corresponds with a unique number on this
interval
except for the point where the cut
happened which corresponds
simultaneously to both endpoints of the
interval meaning the number 0 and 1 now
the benefit of straightening out this
loop like this is that we can start
thinking about pairs of points the same
way we think about pairs of numbers
make a y-axis using a second interval
then associate each pair of values on
the interval with a single point in this
1x1 square that they span out every
individual point of this square
naturally corresponds to a pair of
points on the loop since its x and y
coordinates are each numbers between 0
and 1 which are in turn associated to
some unique point on the loop remember
we're trying to find a surface that
naturally represents the set of all
pairs of points on the loop and this
square is the first step to doing that
the problem is that there's some
ambiguity when it comes to the edges of
the square remember the end points 0 &amp;amp; 1
on the interval really correspond to the
same point of the loop as if to say that
those endpoints need to be glued
together if we're going to faithfully
map back to the loop so all of the
points on the left edge of the square
like 0 0 point 1 0 0 point 2 on and on
and on really represent the same pair of
points on the loop as the corresponding
coordinates on the right edge of the
square one zero point one one zero point
two on and on and on so for this square
to represent the pairs of points on the
loop in a unique way
we need to glue this left edge to the
right edge
I'll mark each edge with some arrows to
remember how the edges need to be lined
up likewise the bottom edge needs to be
glued to the top edge since
y-coordinates of 0 &amp;amp; 1 really represent
the same second point in a given pair of
points on the loop
if you bend the square to perform the
gluing first rolling it into a cylinder
to glue the left and right edges then
gluing the ends of that cylinder which
represent the top and bottom edges we
get a Taurus better known as the surface
of a donut every individual point on
this torus corresponds to a unique pair
of points on the loop and likewise every
pair of points on the loop corresponds
to some unique point on this torus the
torus is two pair of points on the loop
what the XY plane is two pairs of points
on the real number line
the key property of this association is
that it's continuous both ways
meaning if you nudge any point on the
torus by just a tiny amount it
corresponds to only a very slight nudge
to the pair of points on the loop and
vice-versa
so if the Taurus is the natural shape
for ordered pairs of points on the loop
what's the natural shape for unordered
pairs after all the whole reason we're
doing this is to show the two distinct
pairs of points on the loop share a
midpoint and are the same distance apart
but if we consider a pair a B to be
distinct from BA then that would
trivially give us two separate pairs
which have the same midpoint and
distance apart that's like saying you
can always find a rectangle so long as
you consider any pair of points to be a
rectangle not helpful so let's think
about this
let's think about how to represent
unordered pairs of points looking back
at our unit square we need to say that
the coordinates 0.2 0.3 represent the
same pair as 0.3 0.2 or that 0.5 0.7
really represents the same thing as 0.7
0.5
and in general any coordinates XY has to
represent the same thing as YX
once again we capture this idea by
gluing points together when they're
supposed to represent the same pair
which in this case requires folding the
square over diagonally
now notice this diagonal line the crease
of the fold it represents all pairs of
points that look like X X meaning the
pairs which are really just a single
point written twice right now it's
marked with a red line and you should
remember it you will become important to
know where all of these pairs like X X
live but we still have some arrows to
glue together here
we need to glue that bottom edge to the
right edge and the orientation with
which we do this is going to be
important points towards the left of the
bottom edge have to be glued to points
towards the bottom of the right edge and
points towards the right of the bottom
edge have to be glued to points towards
the top of the right edge it's weird to
think about right go ahead pause and
ponder this for a moment
the trick which is kind of clever is to
make a diagonal cut which we need to
remember to glue back in just a moment
after that we can glue the bottom and
the right like so but notice the
orientation of the arrows here to glue
back what we just cut we don't simply
connect the edges of this rectangle to
get a cylinder we have to make a twist
doing this in 3d space the shape we get
is a mobius strip isn't that awesome
evidently the surface which represents
all pairs of unordered points on the
loop is the mobius strip and notice the
edge of the strip shown here in red
represents the pairs of points that look
like X X those which are really just a
single point listed twice
the mobius strip is to unordered pairs
of points on the loop what the XY plane
is two pairs of real numbers that
totally blew my mind when I first saw it
now with this fact that there is a
continuous one-to-one association
between unordered pairs of points on the
loop and individual points on this
mobius strip we can solve the inscribed
rectangle problem remember we had to
find this special kind of graph in 3d
space where the loop was sitting in the
XY plane for each pair of points you
consider their midpoint M which lives on
the XY plane and their distance D apart
and you plot a point which is exactly D
units above M
because of the continuous one-to-one
association between pairs of points on
the loop and the mobius strip this gives
us a natural map from the mobius strip
onto this surface in 3d space for every
point on the mobius strip
consider the pair of points on the loop
that it represents then plug that pair
of points into the special function
and here's the key point
when pairs of points on the loop are
extremely close together the output of
the function is right above the loop
itself and in the extreme case of pairs
of points like X X the output of the
function is exactly on the loop
since points on this red edge of the
Mobius strip correspond to pairs like X
X when the Mobius strip is mapped on to
this surface it must be done in such a
way that the edge of the strip gets
mapped right on to that loop in the XY
plane
but if you stand back and think about it
for a moment considering the strange
shape of the Mobius strip there is no
way to glue its edge to something
two-dimensional without forcing the
strip to intersect itself since points
of the Mobius strip represent pairs of
points on the loop if the strip
intersect itself during this mapping it
means that there are at least two
distinct pairs of points that correspond
to the same output on this surface which
means they share a midpoint and are the
same distance apart which in turn means
that they form a rectangle and that's
the proof or at least if you're willing
to trust me in saying that you can't
glue the edge of a mobius strip to a
plane without forcing it to intersect
itself then that's the proof this fact
is intuitively clear looking at the
Mobius strip but in order to make it
rigorous you basically need to start
developing the field of topology in fact
for any of you who have a topology class
in your future going through the
exercise of trying to justify this is a
good way to gain an appreciation for why
topologists choose to make certain
definitions and I want you to take note
of something here
the reason for talking about the torus
and the Mobius strip was not because we
were playing around with construction
paper or because we were daydreaming
about deforming a coffee mug they came
up as a natural way to understand pairs
of points on a loop and that's something
that we needed to solve a concrete
problem all right I have one final
animation for you all but first I'd like
to tell you a little about what's making
this and future videos possible first I
want to say a huge thanks to everybody
who's supporting on patreon I launched
this only last week and have been
absolutely blown away by people's
enthusiasm for helping make more of
these videos right now I'm working on an
essence of calculus series and those
supporting on patreon are getting early
access to those videos before I publish
the full set in a few months
I also want to thank hover.com for
supporting this video I'm sure a lot of
you watching have some idea for a
website that you want to start you know
that idea that's always been in the back
of your mind but you just haven't gotten
to it yet maybe it's that cool
interactive explanation or a store or
just a blog where you want to share the
cool things that you learn anyway point
is when you want to register a good
domain name hover is the place to do
that that doesn't suck they're just
straight to the point
you get your domain name or your email
address without having to opt out of a
whole bunch of things they also don't
make you pay for things that should
obviously be included with your domain I
don't know if you guys know this but
when you register a domain name your
email address phone number home address
all that stuff is published online in a
way that marketers or spammers or
hackers or anyone can find in what's
called a Whois database and unlike most
other domain providers hover includes
free Whois privacy with all their
supported domains and that keeps your
information confidential if you go there
now and use the promo code topology you
can get 10% off your first purchase that
also lets them know that you came from
me which encourages them to support more
videos like this one so I can keep
making them
and with that here's the final animation
I promised it shows how that beautiful
surface that we defined earlier changes
why all the loop changes
