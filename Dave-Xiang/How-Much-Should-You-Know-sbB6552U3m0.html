doing really really well
as usual hope everyone had a great week
making a screencast video this week just
wrote down a bunch of thoughts I had I'm
just gonna with everyone
hopeless useful I guess I tried to make
the thoughts as organized as possible
but don't read the text just follow my
voice
and I'll walk you through this kind of
thought train I had so the audience for
this video it's kind of anyone that's
ever felt overwhelmed with how much
stuff you have to know so this is aka
everyone at some point in time I think
everyone has been overwhelmed with the
stuff that you should know so this video
is for us anyway so I guess have you
been watching my videos for some while I
always kind of like preach or else say
like you have to learn foundation you
should learn computer science you should
learn how computers work to be like a
really effective programmer and I guess
there's a reason why I always say those
things and I repeat those things so kind
of the core of this video is where those
thoughts originated from
alright so pretty much I made the title
of this video how much should you know
and there's a lot right if you think
about the world of computers there's
just so much to know so how much should
you know is kind of a crazy question and
we'll try to put that into perspective
in this video all right so just follow
my voice and we'll get through this
document it's not gonna be so crazy so
first let's just consider like the
spectrum of things okay in the world of
computers there are a lot of layers and
a big kind of stack I call it a stack
it's just a big pile of stuff and I
guess you can consider it going from
very low level it's a very high level
but it's just a big stack and a stack
with many many layers so just check out
this spectrum right here real quick you
can kind of
this is like this is the spectrum or the
stack on the most general layer that you
can imagine right at the very bottom
it's like electricity science like
electricity electrons flowing through
metal that's probably as low as it gets
and as high as it gets is code right the
stuff if you're a software engineer or
software developer this is code that you
write and this is probably at the very
top of the stack so and in between
there's a ton of stuff right and
what is going on in between here it's
pretty crazy to fathom so let's keep
going so how much do you really have to
understand in that whole spectrum of
things so I had this professor at CMU
this intro level professor I forgot his
name
I forgot this professor's name but he
always said the same thing he said
something along the lines of this you
don't have to know the details about
each layer but you should be able to
talk about each one on a basic level so
one more time because I really like this
saying you don't have to know the
details about each layer but you should
be able to talk about each one on a
basic level so this is kind of where I
got a lot of influence from I wish I
remember this person's name I read I
forgot his name he was a crazy professor
he would do those things where it kind
of sucked at the time but he would just
call on you randomly to like answer
questions so if you weren't paying
attention he had just embarrass you and
he didn't give if he didn't give an F he
just embarrass all these students call
them out just randomly and if you
couldn't answer you'd kind of look like
a fool so pretty well this professor was
just a major influence on the way I
think personally and why I preach
foundation stuff all the time because
that's what he preached he always like
this professor taught a lot of intro
level courses in the ECE program at CMU
I had him for three intro courses so I
had the same professor for three
different introductory level courses and
he always talked about this
same thing like foundation foundation
foundation and then I think that's kind
of why I preach that's up to you because
this guy likes subconsciously incept
inception in my mind so I had him for
intro to signals and systems I hadn't
for intro of computer engineering I had
him for analog circuits and there's
probably a lot more classes but I forget
because this guy taught so many things
but if you're not familiar with
electrical Computer Engineering these
three are vastly like vastly different
topics and one guy taught them all on a
really basic level like maybe he
probably couldn't teach analog circus on
like a PhD level but every single
introductory level course he was
qualified to teach was just pretty crazy
like at the time I just thought this guy
like you know everything how does this
one guy know so much stuff so let's just
go back to this spectrum okay so like at
the very bottom electrons flowing
through metal or electricity all the way
up to code so so one thing I thought
would be pretty cool just for the sake
of this video to put things in
perspective this weekend break down this
kind of stack a little bit layer by
layer once you break down one layer
there will be another layer to break
down and another and another another so
you can get as granular as you want with
this stuff but let's just take baby
steps first and do it together
alright so let's just break down this
first so easy
let's call hard where it's at the bottom
and software is at the top all right two
layers in this stack one is hardware one
is software hopefully that's pretty
clear to understand right so so that's
that's a little too simplistic right so
let's just break down Hardware a little
bit like what are different levels in
the hardware stack of things in the
whole world of computing so I just broke
down them into like three levels there's
so many more levels than this but this
is just that a
really really high-level all right so
one you could have like a circuit
designer like an integrator chip
designer this person is kind of like
maybe designing like really kind of
low-level circuits like adding numbers
multiplying numbers they could be
designing like an ALU different parts
like very highly specialized individual
circuits that maybe are super fine-tuned
for performance there's like a designer
for that all right and then if you go
one step above that person they'll be
maybe a processor designer so a
processor designer would take all the
different components that a circuit
designer might have designed and like
they might just take all those different
components and put it all together in a
processor all right and then let's go
one level above like a processor
designer you might have like a system
system-on-chip
architect so if you guys are familiar
with a system on ship this is pretty
much like a fancy term but what a pretty
mean in what it means is that people
have taken like multiple processors
which do very different things and I'll
put it on the same chip so a good
example this is an iPhone right there's
a processor for your applications
there's a processor for motion to detect
like how you're walking there's like a
graphics processor there's like a modem
processor so you can make phone calls
and someone takes all those different
processors there's so many different
processors this architect will take all
those different ones and put it all
together in something cool so like
that's just breaking down hardware into
three basic levels and it's already
pretty crazy right so and they can keep
getting broken down into further and
further levels so that's a little taste
of like a hardware stack so let's just
talk about software a little bit very
general again but we're just going to
talk about software very generally so
the lowest level of software you can
think of may be firmware or embedded
software and this is software that
interacts with like actual hardware this
is software that's super close to the
hardware on top of that you can have
like op
reading system system level software
these are people designing Linux
operating systems you know like how
virtual memory works like system level
engineering and on the very top of that
even above that layer we have
application level software which is
where most people are this is what the
games you know people writing Angry
Birds Twitter Facebook application level
software is where most people are at
alright and this is the most popular
software that people work on these days
is that at this level so I just want to
talk about one example of that so one
example application level software is
web application so web application is
pretty much anything that uses the
Internet okay pretty easy I'm just
bucketing this thing as anything on the
Internet
this is what I currently work on this is
what most people watching this video are
probably looking to study I bet if
anyone's like an aspiring bit programmer
the most common thing to learn is web
application development like so and this
is also what 99% of Tech's tech that
startups use so this is really really
popular and I'm sure you guys know how
popular this is so something that I just
want to reiterate is that making web
apps making mobile apps like all this
internet technology it's just a small
small subsection of application software
that just used to the Internet so it's
just a small piece of application
software if this is like a huge software
spectrum the stuff that most of us work
on it's like a little little little
little piece of application level
development alright so just to put that
into perspective and this is kind of why
I think the term full stack developer is
kind of and I don't like this
term at all because when I think of the
word full stack I really think of the
full stack of computing like hardware
like processor design up to software
system level programming like all that
stuff that's the real stack of computing
but the way people
we'll use full sec now is kind of a
little because people use the
word full stack and it's the way it's
used in modern lingo is always in the
context of web programming when you call
someone a full stack developer it's
always implied that's in there it's in
the context of web applications so just
for example if you went up to like a
lick Linux systems programmer like if
you went up to like a Linux systems
programmer like if you went up to Linus
Torvalds and you asked him or her if
they were full stack they would probably
smack you in the face because they would
be so offended so just to reiterate the
full stack and the web context it really
just means two things all right it's
it's really easy people tend to like
really put this word like they put too
much emphasis on this title and it's I
don't really like it but that's just me
so it's just broken down into two things
like it means you can write some
front-end code and front-end code is
code that runs on a web browser like
Chrome that's what front-end Chrome
that's what front-end code is like
client-side code that usually runs on a
web browser on a mobile phone you know
stuff like that and the flip side or the
sister part of that code is server-side
code and that's code that usually runs
alongside a web server on a computer
somewhere so when people say full stack
it just means someone that can write
code that goes into these two places
right and what it really means is that
whoops sorry it means that you have full
command of web applications a full stack
programmer should have full stack
software engineer has full command of
web applications but in the end web
programming itself is just a small small
fraction of application programming it's
like so small and the word full stack is
kind of misleading and kind of
in my opinion so that's enough ranting I
think I'm gonna like make myself angry
if I keep going so
anyways alright so this coming to a
conclusion with some of these random
thoughts I had so what's the conclusion
for all this we have to end this video
somehow and the one major point that I
think is a good takeaway is that you're
never going to learn all parts of the
stacking detail it's just so much stuff
you'll never learn every single part in
super detail but the more you understand
the big picture items at each level the
more powerful you'll become if you know
the basics of how Hardware works you're
gonna be that much better off if you
know the basics of you know system level
programming as well as application level
programming you're gonna be that much
better off so don't get discouraged like
the more you learn the more you realize
you just don't know more stuff right
it's a never-ending process like the
more you learn you just start realizing
the more you don't know and like the
learning horizon just keeps getting
farther and farther away so that's what
makes it hard that what's makes all this
stuff interesting and hopefully that's
why it keeps people excited all right so
that's some random with
everyone hopefully this video turns out
ok and I was smooth and some of this
unedited that's it for this video hope
everyone has a great week and kills it
alright take care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
