have been asking me about my computer
setup what are like the different
programs I'm using what do I think about
max and stuff so I thought while I'm at
it I could make just a quick video to go
over the setup of my computer and what
I'm actually using whatever I stay here
I don't want this to sound opinionated
or not everyone setup is going to be
different this is just the setup that I
use at the time it's not worse it's not
better or than anyone elses and you'll
definitely have a setup that works for
you alright so let's just go through
mine real quick so I use a MacBook Pro I
think everyone knows what these
physically look like when I was in high
school in middle school I used to use
PCs windows a lot because they used to
be huge on games I played a lot of games
so I would game and kind of develop on
PCs in college and work I use Linux a
lot so we use a lot of different
distributions in college we used to bun
too and then I worked I used sense in
fedora so different styles of Linux and
we had like a lot of boxes just with
fedora installed that we use that work
but now for personal stuff and for
development stuff I use a Mac so you
know that's just currently what I use
and I like it
it works doesn't crash too much but
overall it's pretty good so inside this
Mac there's nothing really interesting
going on the only thing that I can kind
of mention is that I keep all my code in
this workspace directory so I just try
to keep all my repositories anything
related to code and development in a
single repository or a single directory
sorry which is separate from my other
stuff so I just have this specific
directory purely for coding projects now
that I mentioned it's not even that
interesting but it's just kind of how I
organize some of this stuff so yeah
that's that a lot of people have also
asked me like what do I have on my dock
and what do I have installed and I
didn't realize people would be
interested in that but I can just
quickly run through every single program
on the stock and on my computer so
that's
finder finder simple terminals a
terminal we have it open sublime text is
my code IDE that I'm currently using I
think it's pretty good it has a lot of
plugins and it's really helpful it does
cost money to get a license version of
this but you know pay developers for
their work it's all good
Xcode is if you want to develop on the
iOS platform you need Xcode this is an
apple thing you have to use this thing
to develop iOS applications posta Co is
a interface for Postgres the database
I might have shown this off at one time
for the another but this is just an
interface into various databases that
you might have on your system alright
IntelliJ is IDE particularly cater
towards Java I haven't used that in a
while excope this was a scoping tool
back when I doesn't mean open I haven't
used this in a while but this would help
in UI or front-end work to measure
pixels chromis chromis affari Safari
this is sketch which is a design and
prototyping tool notes reminders Apple
stuff slack is messaging FaceTime
messages Spotify calculator system
preferences I always like to keep the
Activity Monitor open I'm sure many of
you guys do as well always keep this
open to see you know who's using a lot
of memory who is using a lot of CPU
let's see Activity Monitor preview
maximum I've always used vim for stuff
mou MOU is like a convenient little tool
that you can kind of for markup so if
you want to open open a markup in
whatever way you can just actually type
the mark-up on the left and just see it
render on the right I don't know if this
is the best way to do it I've been using
this thing for a while just to make sure
whatever you're typing in a readme file
looks alright so QuickTime Player
TextEdit this is all really basic stuff
coming over here one password just a
password management tool for anyone that
like keeps track of many different
passwords all the time this is just a
password managing tool there's another
one called - Lane I just happen to use
one password screen hero is a screen
here screen sharing application you can
use with your friends actually this
company was acquired by slack so I'm
pretty sure slack in the future is gonna
re release this as one of their own
products but I don't know if you can get
screen hero anymore this is a macro
application for some custom macros that
I have like keyboard shortcuts this is a
window management tool better snap this
is flux flux just changes the color of
my monitor when it gets really late so
so I guess they say your monitor
shouldn't be too bright when it's late
at night because it just messes with
your eyeballs so flux just makes my
monitor like launch Wi-Fi Bluetooth
sound to solve basic stuff
let's check this said I don't know if
there's anything here that's worth
mentioning
let me just sift through it gaming yeah
not sure this is how fun literally just
running through random stuff on my
computer to see if it's a Wireshark is
good for any developers out there I'm
sure if you want to watch any network
traffic you can use Wireshark just take
a look at that this is a really old
program but you know if you want to see
any network traffic of any kind this is
probably the standard of what you might
use then these are particularly worth
mentioning yeah
all right well super random video I
don't even know if this was helpful I
just wanted to like kind of you have a
quick overview of random things on my
computer because I know a few people
have asked so doesn't hurt to just make
a quick video on it if I'm using
anything that is unfamiliar to you or
you just curious more about the setup
that I have feel free to ask but again
everyone's setup is gonna be very
different and your setup is not going to
be the same as another person's setup it
doesn't even make sense to get too
opinionated on what setup is better
because in the end it's so personal so
it really doesn't matter but yeah this
is just mine and that's it alright guys
so catch you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
