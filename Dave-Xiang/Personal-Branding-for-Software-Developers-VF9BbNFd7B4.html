doing really really well enjoying the
weekend video for today I want to talk
about something called personal branding
it sounds a little cliche a little
fluffy but it's really really important
not just for developers but for everyone
so what exactly is personal branding but
the idea is really simple it's just what
you think about when you think of
someone and you have this for everyone
all your peers all your role models all
your mentors everyone you encounter me
so when you think about me or my name
you have this automatic thought in your
brain when you think of Elon Musk you
have a thought maybe think of Bill Gates
you have a thought if you think of your
classmates you have a thought too and
vice versa everyone on the outside has a
perception of you which is really really
important and what this video is about
so your personal brand is what people
think of when they think of you you have
this for everyone around you and
everyone around you has that for you
before we get into it I want to address
one other point you've probably heard
this piece of advice very often for me
or other people but that's not worrying
about what other people think of you you
may think that's going at odds with this
whole concept of personal branding but
not worrying what other people think of
you doesn't give you a free passage
do whatever you want be an asshole be a
jerk just complain the whole cause of
the personal branding is that you don't
have to worry about what other people
think of you but to develop a good
personal brand you still have to put
your best foot forward and present
yourself and the best way that you
possibly can and then let other people
make their own judgments so those two
little pieces of advice you don't
necessarily go at odds with each other
they're just different so this video
it's about personal branding and how you
can develop and present yourself in the
best way first thing I want to talk
about is writing and this is not writing
code writing code is table stakes this
is every other type of writing this is
ready emails writing direct messages to
your peers writing design documents for
new software but all your writing
heavily reflects your personal brand
because clear writing reflects clarity
of thought right
you read something that's confusing you
don't quite get it reflects very bad on
the writer it reflects that the writer
doesn't really know what he or she is
talking about or can't really
communicate what he or she is talking
about well but when you read something
very clear with a clear expectation a
clear action you know that the writer is
thinking clearly and that contributes
very well to a personal brand let's just
take a couple examples when you're
writing an email be very very sure to
set the expectation clearly this is a
simple memo I don't need any response or
this is a discussion email I'm expecting
a response furthermore when you write
the email all the details count pay
attention to the formatting if you have
a very very important call to action you
can make it bold if you're trying to
list out an options use a numerated ABCD
list everything down to the spelling to
the formatting to how concise it is it
all contributes to how clear your email
is and how clear your email is is how
you're perceived as a developer right so
always pay a lot of attention to every
form of writing in a professional
setting it's almost if not more
important than the code you write
another good part of your personal brand
to develop is that you should be known
to be open to receiving feedback and
criticism when people think of you they
shouldn't think of a very stubborn
person who doesn't take any criticism
well you have to be able to take
criticism very well and improve and take
some action upon it and it's very easy
to be like I'm a humble person I'm I
have a lot of humility you know I'm not
I'm not stubborn at all but you really
have to showcase that in your work so a
couple of examples are if you have a
code review open I've seen a lot of
people who just put up a code review and
they really don't want to change what
they've done even if they received a lot
of feedback everyone's like oh this part
kind of needs to be fixed up this part
doesn't work so well some people just
don't like changing what they've already
done one really easy way is if somebody
gives you a good honest useful piece of
feedback on your code review just go
ahead and make those changes and show
that you can just
some criticism and act on it third third
point I want to make about personal
branding that's really good to develop
is that you have to be known as somebody
that respects your interaction with
everyone so you all know those people
those people you talk with that work
where you talk with them and things are
just going way over their head you can
kind of tell they don't care what you're
talking about and you don't want to be
that person you want to be that person
that just doesn't care so every single
interaction you have with everyone you
work with you have to respect that
person what they're trying to tell you
and respect their time alright so that
point sounded a little fluffy right what
does it mean to value your interactions
with everyone well let me give a
concrete example to showcase how you can
develop this part of your personal brand
but given a week you're just an average
developer given one week you might have
five different things going on fix a bug
work on a project pair program with
somebody you have five or six concurrent
things going on at the same time and
it's a lot of different processes that
you have to manage in your brain but one
other one important thing that I like to
do is like I like to bookmark all my
conversations and remember where each
one of them left off you had a
conversation with Bob last week where
did it leave off or you were working
with Alice on this new project what was
the last thing to do after you guys last
programmed on that but every single
concurrent conversation you have you
should just bookmark that conversation
and remember how it left off and how it
has to progress because I can't tell you
there's so many people that I've talked
with when working on projects I'm
working on different things and there's
a lot of stuff going on a lot of people
just forget they're like hey Joe do you
remember how we left off last week about
that work and Joe's gonna be like I just
I forgot about that you know that
slipped my mind can you just remind me
what we're working on again that happens
a lot and that shouldn't be you every
single you interaction you have there
could be five of them ten of them 20
different things going on at the same
time bookmark each one of those and
remember how it left off because the
personal brand that that gives off is
that every single person you work with
every single person that you have a
conversation with they know that you
value their
because you always remember it last
point fourth point I want to make about
personal branding is that you do not
want to be the complainer you always
know about the complainer but it's very
easy especially for programmers to do
the complainer it's like man our
software stings why are we using these
libraries I hate Java or JavaScript is
the worst thing they're just complaining
just complaining they're complaining
about the language they're complaining
about the company they're complaining
about the new projects they're working
on but you might think it's okay to do
this you might think oh it's over lunch
we can just complain or it's just water
cooler talk it's really not professional
but I would highly highly recommend that
you be very careful and minimize your
complaining just like do it at home do
that with your family don't even bring
it to the workplace I've seen so many
developers over different jobs that they
just complain a lot at lunch or they
just complain a lot they they chat a lot
and it actually reflects very poorly on
them even if you think just a little bit
of complaining about JavaScript at lunch
is harmless you actually don't know how
that affects everyone around you just
complaining to a group of table gives
that group an impression of you as a
complainer and that kind of have a
ripple effect to the company so overall
this is a really easy thing your
personal brand shouldn't be the
complainer you should avoid that brand
and I just want to mention this because
I've seen so many developers love
complaining just complaining about
everything right so that's not a good
vibe to give off you don't want to be
the complainer you just want to you know
propose solutions be a good person to
work with and not just be pain in the
ass so it's the last fourth point
don't be the complainer alright guys
that wraps up the video so let's just
recap real quick my top four points
about maintaining and developing a good
personal brand and putting your best
foot forward so first one written
anything written outside your code
remember
clarity of writing as clarity of thought
so second second is be open to receiving
some feedback and taking action on it be
a little bit humble don't just create a
PR and never change anything third part
is gonna be valuing your interactions
with everyone and remember you can do
this by just bookmarking and remember
your conversations with everyone you
work with and finally the fourth is
don't be the complainer so that's it for
personal branding you might not think
this is important but actually it's
really really important because even
inside you might think everyone can
think they're a genius developer you
might think you're amazing to work with
you're a really good programmer but
everybody has a personal brand just
first the first thing you can do is just
take a sampling of everyone you work
with all your colleagues you already
have your own perception of all your
colleagues think about what they've done
to develop your perception of them and
then once you've done that just take
inventory of everything you do and kind
of think about what is my personal brand
when other people think of me that work
with me what do they think about and you
want to actually develop that in the
best way forward if you think you're
really smart but other people think
you're an idiot it's not great last
thing I want to mention before I sign up
for this video is that I haven't been
making too many videos recently because
I've been little busy and I'm trying to
work still work on this book this
software developer life book and I'm
finally I have a final manuscript for it
I'm just editing it trying to get some
feedback with my friends but I think
once I finished that book is gonna have
about 40 chapters it's all all my top
content in one place because YouTube's a
little tricky like I have videos here
videos there but it's all scattered and
unless you just sit and peruse all these
software videos it's tough to get one
place with all my top content so stay
tuned for this book I'll give more
updates on it but I have the final
manuscript almost ready I got a I'm
gonna self publish it because I'm not an
author but once I publish it it's gonna
be on Amazon you can probably order a
copy and it's going to be all my content
finally just in one place and I think
it's gonna be much much more convenient
and these videos so stay tuned for the
book and hopefully they'll be released
in the next 10 years so anyways hope you
enjoyed the video please give me a life
please give me a thumbs up share the
video ask me any questions and I'll see
everybody next time alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
