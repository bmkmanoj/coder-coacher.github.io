is doing really well answering two
questions today picking your major for
any student that's going to school and
also taking your programming language
I realized that it's really hard to keep
anyone's attention for over five ten
minutes when I look at the analytics or
some of the long videos the drop-off
rate after like two or three minutes
it's crazy not many people watch a
10-plus minute video so when I get this
done in five minutes and I'll see what I
can do all right let's get started first
question I want to answer is ticking
your major audience for this is anyone
in school any one's a student anyone
looking to switch their major anyone
who's looking to pick what they studied
one thing that I want to make three
points the first point is that picking
your major doesn't lock you in into
anything but you should pick something
that's close to what you eventually want
to do so let's just give an example if
you're really really sure that you want
to get into software engineering after
school I would take computer science if
you're completely sure you want to do
software engineering computer science is
the best bet to pick to get a job but if
you pick another major you can still
become a software developer it just
comes a little more harder with higher
degrees of separation and what do I mean
by that but for me for example I did
Computer Engineering which is one degree
of separation house but I still managed
to just find my way if the software I
have one friend who is a mechanical
engineer that's two degrees of
separation now and he did a lot of
programming on the side and eventually
he's a software developer now even
though he did all mechanical and I also
know someone that was a liberal arts a
liberal arts major and now she's does
programming so
no matter how many n degrees of
separation you are out from the peers
technical ideal major you can fulfill
move into programming it just get really
really hard if you're really further out
so if you do liberal arts it's going to
be harder for you to get into
programming but if you know you want to
do software just do computer science
second thing that's really easy to do
for anyone that's thinking what they're
going to study it's just go online and
look at schools websites and study their
curriculum so a lot of the times when
you just see one-off websites or one-up
classes or one language it's hard to get
a big picture what you should do is go
to a school's website and they post
their curriculums online so go to one
school's website and look how their
computer engineering curriculum the
whole four-year curriculum is different
than the computer science curriculum and
study the classes for you spawn and then
first school you can do that for
multiple schools if you look at it if
you look at it from a curriculum
perspective you get the whole picture
rather than like individual class or
individual language like picture in with
the whole picture you can make a better
decision all right third and last points
about picking your major the final thing
you should do before you know diving in
and making that final decision is take
one step ahead into your future and find
your ideal entry-level job don't look 10
years ahead but just look where would
you want to work after you graduate for
example maybe if Intel maybe Nvidia
maybe if Apple Microsoft whatever go to
those websites go to their job posting
boards and filter for all the new grads
positions and read the descriptions of
all those entry-level positions so for
example if very to software you can look
at Google or Facebook's web page if
you're at the hardware you go to
Qualcomm or Intel's web page would just
look at their job listings and read them
and just read the job listing new
entry-level grad positions they will be
there they will have descriptions and
it's just going to lay out what they're
expecting and based on what they expect
you know what you got to do right
so should gears a bit and talk about the
second question of how to choose the
programming language clear that three
points to make about this first point is
ask yourself are you learning
programming just to learn programming
are you trying to use an application of
programming okay that's the first
question you're going to ask yourself
are you just learning programming if
you're doing that if you're just
learning programming you can pick any
language it doesn't matter because you
just have to learn about operators
variables for loops while loops all that
stuff if you're looking to use an
application of programming then you have
to be a little bit selected so if you
want to do game development maybe to
learn C sharp if you want to do
enterprise software you better learn
Java if you want to do web program
you've got to learn some JavaScript but
don't try to mix these two alright if
you're just learning programming just to
learn how to make a for loop then you
just can pick any language is really
business matter and if you're learning
to program with a specific application
then you got to do research and choose
your language specifically second point
about this choose something that you're
not used to because you've already
learned one language kick something
that's radically different a really
common thing to do when learning
programming language is to learn about a
statically typed language and then a
dynamically typed language so you can
learn about C++ and Python or Java and
gravy but if you're very used to a
dynamic programming language pick a
statically typed one and it's going to
be really different in a very different
feel so first take a language that
you're not used to if you've already
done step one and once you pick a
language that you're not used to a
radically different language get really
good at both of those once you get
really good at both of those let's say
you learn C++ and Python then you start
learning about object-oriented
fundamentals
principles once you get good at that I
would dabble a little bit in functional
programming concepts so once you do that
you'll have a couple really different
languages under your belt and then
you'll have two very practical paradigm
under your belt I don't want to talk
about functional programming too much
because that's my weak point I better at
object-oriented stuff but once you get
those two two languages two paradigms
you'll be in really good shape
so third and final points about this
when you're just kicking in language but
don't optimize for the latest and
greatest because it's always really sexy
a lot of people have asked Oh sigh learn
common that new google programming
language for android try learn swift the
apple language but it's always very
tempting to gravitate towards the latest
and greatest but I promise you I've said
this many times but I promise you that
the foundation you build is going to
outlast a lot of the completos and
greatest stuff so strong foundation is
going to leave a long-term game because
the latest and greatest language every
few years there might be a new
programming language for you to learn
you could this year you could be
learning Swift like three years from now
there could be a brand new thing you
have to learn that's always changing but
well what will never change is the
foundational stuff so if that's the case
if you're asking yourself should I take
this latest and greatest programming
language first as yourself do I know the
more basic programming languages that
have been around for a long time
learn those first because they're not
going anywhere and once you get a good
basis of that then you can go on and
learn Swift or whatever like super alien
programming language is going to come
out in five years but foundation is
always the long-term game and you want
to play the long-term game all right
don't get too drawn to the new sexy
stuff all right guys I'm just going to
wrap up the video there those are just
some of my thoughts on those two big
questions choosing your major and
choosing your programming language
hopefully it was helpful one other thing
I want to leave everyone on is that I
don't do any marketing for this at all
like I don't have like any knowledge or
any effort even and I should do that
more but I have no effort in marketing
but the very least I thought I could do
is if you thought this video was helpful
I'm just going to ask you to share it
you know maybe post it somewhere and
just maybe like slightly get the word
out and I'm just going to rely on your
good state rather than me trying to do
things because I really don't like self
promoting too much yes maybe I'll help
promote more in the future but right now
this is feel right so if you like this
please leave in comment like the video
and if you're really nice please share
the video and out greatly appreciate it
now I can show you guys the view I've
been looking at sorry there I wish the
bench was facing the other way but I've
been looking at this awesome view while
I've been talking to myself
here check it out
the Brooklyn Bridge
alright that's it for today guys see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
