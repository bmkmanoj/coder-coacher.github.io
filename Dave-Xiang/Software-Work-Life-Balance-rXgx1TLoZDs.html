really well got a few questions in my
inbox regarding work-life balance and I
just wanted to share some thoughts about
that spend this video talking about it
what do I think about it it's a very
cliche phrase everyone talks about it
what is work-life balance whatever that
means so this video spending it outside
again because I like talking outside now
it's a little more interesting and yeah
let's talk about it so I wanted to talk
about three things in this video let's
just list three of them first the first
one is just evaluating your time second
one is going to be measuring your mental
energy and third one is gonna be all the
stuff you do outside work the first
thing and all this is just gonna be
evaluating your time all right the
easiest way to do this that everyone can
do very easily is you just count the
hours right you work 20 hours a week
it's different than if you work 40 hours
a week if someone says they work 60
obviously it's different right this is
really easy you can just count the hours
the second way to evaluate your time is
a little more nuanced and this is kind
of evaluating how demanding each of your
hours is gonna be and before we get into
this I just want to say that first over
all our jobs are pretty easy as software
developers we have we don't have a labor
intensive jobs so we can to prepare
ourselves the people that actually have
to exert physical labor to do their jobs
and we can't even relate to that and we
have to appreciate that so compared to
all that our jobs are pretty easy we sit
at a desk
let me type on a keyboard go to a few
meetings drink coffee it's not it's not
that hard so there's gonna be two ways
where you can measure how demanding your
hours are gonna be right no two hours
are created the same
one person's hour could be much harder
or much easier than your hours so
there's a good way and there's a bad way
of measuring like how demanding those
hours are the bad way is it's more
demanding because of crappy reasons like
there's politics at work you don't get
along with your boss you don't get along
with your co-workers you don't even like
the work the work is crappy those are
bad ways to make the hours more
demanding so that's the bad way but on
the flip side of that the good way of
making your hours more intense or more
demanding is that the work is actually
challenging if you're building something
really crazy it's really hard you're
like
be hard about it you know exerting all
this force to solve a problem then your
hours are more intense but it's a good
intense so those are two easy ways to
kind of measure the demand of your hours
all right
obviously worst case scenario is that if
you have if it's more demanding for all
those bad reasons like the politics the
crappiness that's the worst case if it's
demanding due to the good stuff like
challenges then that's a good kind of
demanding but at the end of the day it
still makes the hours more intense more
demanding and it's not exactly
sustainable forever and I have a
personal story about that I can talk
about it later but first point I just
want to close it up here is that every
single hour is different and you just
got to evaluate your time all right 40
versus 40 hours has two very different
connotations depending what those hours
are like all right we're on point number
two point number two this video is to
consider the mental energy expenditure
and this is just my personal fancy way
of saying how often you think about work
outside work so this is like if you go
to the gym you're hanging out with your
friends you're doing all your other
hobbies if you're actually thinking
about your work while you're doing all
your other stuff that could be a sign of
imbalance right because it's invading
your mental energy outside the real
hours because in point number one we
were just evaluating our hours on the
job right you can evaluate your hours on
the job pretty easily you count the
hours you evaluate the intensity but now
you have to also consider all the mental
energy you spend outside work and a good
test for this I found is like ask
yourself or ask a friend is like
everything we do many times
conversations are started with what's
your job like right and you can really
respond with three different ways if I
ask you hey how's your job going what's
your job like you there don't want to
talk about it which means you don't
think about it outside work or you
complain a ton about it which means
you have a lot of negative energy or you
love talking about it which means you're
thinking about it a lot right I ask you
or you ask yourself how's the work going
either don't care you can pet you care
very negatively or you love talking
about it I think this is a really
important point because this is probably
the number-one point where people talk
about the work/life balance
imbalances right the moment you start
thinking about it a lot outside your raw
hour
of work is kind of when it becomes
imbalance we don't want to talk about
work at all that could be a bad sign but
if you're overly negative about it or
you love talking about it way too much
that just means it's invading your bank
of mental energy outside the hours and
you got to be careful about that alright
so that was point number two check make
sure your mental energy expenditure just
how often you think about it is always
in check last point I want to make in
this video third third and last point I
want to make is all the stuff you do
outside work alright I don't think
anyone even if they pretend to nobody
can spend 100% of their time and energy
at work everyone needs at least
something else it could just be eating
your family chilling gaming playing dota
whatever it is like everyone needs
something else you can call it different
things you don't even have to call it a
hobby just has to be something else you
could just it could just be chilling if
you really want it to be so we all have
something else on the side like family
whatever it is so personally I like
dancing a lot and one good way I usually
measure like my work-life balance or and
the intensity of the work is I don't
measure how intense the work actually is
but I measure how I lose focus with my
other hobbies like if I'm not having
like a good dance practice where I'm
thinking about work while I'm at
practice or if I can't have time if I
don't have time to do the other stuffs
I'm used to doing like dancing then I
know my balance is a little bit off so
it's kind of like an inverse way to do
your work-life balance
measurement if you're having a tough
time measuring the actual work intensity
try to think about is this taking away
from the other stuff I like to do so
this idea is going to work both ways
right if you find yourself where you
don't have the time doing the things you
like to do your balance is probably off
right if work is getting in the way of
you playing dota too much your work-life
balance is off but also the other way we
have to talk about the other side is
that if you're having too much time if
you're chilling too much you're gaming
too much it probably means you're not
pushing yourself at work hard enough
right if you're doing all other stuff if
you're spending 100% of the time on
hobbies and you're just neglecting any
type of professional progression then
you're probably not pushing that hard
enough right if I spend like the whole
day dancing I wouldn't be happy either
I like having both of them
all right guys wrapping up the video
here remember we talked about three
things in this video the first thing was
just evaluating your hours right you
count them that's easy but also you
gotta measure their intensity whether
that's good intense or bad intense the
second thing we talked about is making
sure your mental energies and check make
sure that's in check if you're thinking
about work a ton outside work it's
usually a bad sign because even all the
mental energy mental energy is really
important and if you're using that just
thinking about work negatively or to
possibly all the time that could be bad
and finally you can check your work-life
balance by checking how it affects the
other things you enjoy doing right if
you like going biking a ton and you find
yourself that you're not biking as much
as you used to be then something might
be off alright so those three points my
thoughts about work-life balance very
cliche phrase but trying to make a
simple oh yeah I almost forgot I have
slightly of a personal story to share
with everyone that kind of relates to
all this stuff but recently I went
through a Java switch from a start-up to
a medium-sized company and I can talk
about the actual switch in another video
that's a longer story but pretty much at
the startup I was having a lot of
demanding hours but there were very good
hours like I was working on something
really challenging spending a lot of
time building something from scratch but
that was kind of what my life was like
at the startup right pretty intense
hours I would say their intensity level
was medium to medium-high and also I was
spending a lot of mental energy thinking
about it outside work so even though the
hours were very positive
like I think hours well spent well spent
learning producing value it was still
kind of invading my time a little bit
because I was thinking about a way too
much outside work it was like affecting
my dancing affecting my fitness all this
other stuff so I think it's good and bad
right I think progressed a lot
technically during those times with the
intense hours but at the same time it
took away a little bit from you know the
things I like to do with the
medium-sized company the it's really
clear right I like have higher mental
capacity I think because I leave all
that stuff when I come home from
because I don't think about it too much
like ours are still good I'm doing a lot
of challenging things at my new job and
everything but still how much I think
about it outside the job is a very
minimum like once I come home from work
I'm doing other stuff and it's awesome
and I've noticed the big difference -
because wanting to go to dance practice
like when I go hang out I'm much more
focused on that stuff before when I
would go to the gym I just kind of be
lingering having lingering thoughts
about work and I was getting unfocused
so that's like the major difference
between that startup job and the
medium-sized company I just joined
alright guys gonna wrap up the video
here sorry about all the helicopters I
got to pick a different spot next time
but this is a nice spot but I'm sorry
about all the helicopter noises that
came I had to redo a bunch of these
takes because the helicopters were too
loud but so next time and hope you guys
enjoyed the video please like it
subscribe post me email me you know post
a comment I'll respond all right take
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
