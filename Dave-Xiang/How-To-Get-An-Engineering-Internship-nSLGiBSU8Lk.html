cover another really subjective question
that I've been asked recently regarding
internships and how to get them this is
really a difficult question to address
because there's really no clear-cut way
to give you a straight up answer of how
to get an internship but in this video
I'm just going to try to give bits and
pieces of advice and hopefully they're
helpful all right so let's just just get
started the first thing this should
almost be a no-brainer for getting
internship but just use your direct
network first start with your family
start with your friends start with your
relatives I'm sure you know someone that
could help you and just start with the
closest relationships first my very
first internship was at a chemistry lab
that my dad hooked up for me and it was
just his friend's lab and it was pretty
much a place that was unrelated like
completely unrelated to programming
whatsoever but it was the best thing I
could get what did I really do at this
internship well it's not programming
related per se but I kind of tried to
make it be they had a couple Linux
computers over there running Santa west
so I remember that was a summer where I
learned how to use them I really learned
how to get around a Linux machine and I
tried to just kind of you know make the
most out of some unrelated work
experience after it was done I just put
Linux under my resume stuck the company
name next to it and you know it was kind
of helpful so my first point is always
just use your direct relationships first
because this is the easiest in you have
with anyone and not only for internships
but your direct network is probably and
will always be the most easiest way to
find some opportunities second point is
if you're enrolled in school and you're
lucky enough to be a part of some
academic program you're definitely going
to have resources and I would just
recommend you use them all right even
though the Career Fair suck just go to
them and practice at the very least you
can practice talking with people and
selling yourself go to the Career Center
go to the career portal look at some job
postings talk to one of those counselors
just use all the resources as best you
can the one thing that we always have to
remember that if you're in school you
have zero credibility I'm sorry but when
you're in school you have almost zero
credibility and all your credibility
luckily comes from the school because
they're an establishment and while
you're in school you need to piggyback
off their credibility to just get it in
with the recruiters okay my third point
is if you're not enrolled in any school
maybe you're in a separate industry and
you want to get into software and a good
place to start is probably an internship
how do you even get started with this
you don't have a school backing you up
for credibility and this is especially
hard because if you're not enrolled in a
school or you're a part of a Coll
separate industry not even related to
software you have to build your whole
credibility from scratch this is really
hard but what you really have to do in
this situation is really do your own
learning work outside projects and kind
of publish them so they can serve as a
portfolio for you when you apply to some
of these internships the reason this is
extra important if you're not in school
is that doing side projects the game
that credibility is really the only
leverage you have at this point if you
want to get your foot in the door so
it's something you just have to you know
put some time in all the outreach you
have to do from scratch you don't have a
academic portal or Career Center to help
you you have to personally do all the
digging to reach out and try to talk
with people go to and decom go to angel
list just do your own outreach check out
LinkedIn everything has to be on your
own in terms of this outreach
okay the next point that I feel like we
should all talk about is how to target
companies who do you talk with and how
do you really go about picking the best
battles for you first and foremost just
putting it out there that the
internships at the big corporate
companies like Google Facebook Microsoft
Apple those are the most competitive to
get if you're not in school it's going
to be insanely hard to even
get a chance to talk with those
companies especially for an internship
and even if you're in a school it's also
insanely hard and competitive just to
get one of those positions this does
look the best on paper though so it
doesn't hurt trying my recommendation
personal recommendation for targeting is
to really look for mid stage startup
companies and when I say mid stage
startups that's probably between 50 to a
couple hundred people do not target any
startup that has less than 50 people
because they really don't have time
money or energy to accommodate for an
internship so you have to have this
sweet spot of I think around 50 to 200
people or 300 people
the thing about companies at this size
is that they're really trying to grow
really fast and one way they can grow is
by nurturing an intern or having an
internship program because that's also a
really good way to hire good engineers
mid-sized startup companies they still
don't have enough resources to find you
as an intern you still have to dig and
search for them so to find these
companies just make sure to do your own
outreach one thing that I did that was
kind of helpful for this style of
company is go to invest their websites
and check out all their portfolio
companies and then there's also a good
site called CrunchBase that gives you
the funding and historical details of
almost every single startup so you can
get a feel for how big they are and what
stage of the game they're in and again
ignore the startups that are really
small probably less than 50 people
because they honestly cannot give you
any time so it's not even worth it for
you my last point in this whole talk is
what to do once you get there and you
have this internship my number one point
for any prospective interns or maybe
you're going into one soon you're
thinking about it is that the most
important thing to do is just be as
proactive as possible the honest truth
about any internship program even if
it's quite structured is that no one
really gives a that you're there to
get the most out of it you really have
to be the proactive one
ask for more work to learn as much as
you can because your mentor or whoever
is really looking after you they're not
spending a lot of their mental bandwidth
on an intern so these things are usually
three to six months it's a really short
amount of time and everyone's
expectation of you the expectation of
the intern is that you're not really
going to do anything quite productive so
you're already fighting this uphill
battle and it's really up to you to try
to you know be as proactive as you can
and really prove them wrong be like oh I
can actually do a lot here I'm a pretty
good intern all right guys that's the
end of the video just little bits and
pieces of advice I think I'm not a
master at how to get these internships
but hopefully some of this was helpful
for you if you have any questions just
write me a comment please like the video

have a great week and I'll see you
everyone next time all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
