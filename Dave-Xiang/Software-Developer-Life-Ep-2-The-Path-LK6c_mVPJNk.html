software developer episode 2 and we're
going to talk about the engineers path
at a big company alright let's do it
I want to just talk about the potential
career path or ladder that you might
take at one of these big companies
obviously this path is different from
company to company but more or less it's
all the same if you're considering
working at a big company and your new
grad hope this video can help and give
you a little insight about what you
might expect for the years to come
everyone just starts off as an engineer
some kind of engineer on some kind of
team in this big company you're very
small you code away you gain more skills
you fix bugs you give presentations and
eventually you become a little more
senior every company has very different
levels of this you know engineer one
engineer two etc etc etc as you grow you
also start to manage some people and
mentor some people and look after you
know small to mid-size teams every
engineer inevitably is gonna do a little
bit of management but the major point I
want to make is that eventually you get
to this crossroads this crossroads is
pretty much asking you do you like
managing people more beany like
engineering or do you like engineering
more than you like dealing with people
this is all personal preference but once
you get to this crossroads it's pretty
much gonna determine the rest of your
career ladder if you choose the
management route you become titles like
director and stuff and then you start to
manage larger and larger teams of people
more people are reporting and funneling
to you on the other hand if you choose
the engineering route you get titles
like principal engineer Grand Master
wizard and you're just a crazy engineer
remember this is all personal preference
and there's no really good or bad it's
just pretty much what you want to get
out of your job different people value
different things at my old company I I
knew a lot of older guys who they still
coded on their day to day basis but they
just didn't like dealing with people
some people just get tired of grinding
on code all days so they like to just
start managing a little more and taking
a step back the last point I want to
make regarding this topic is this whole
concept of a glass ceiling within these
large companies the time usually matters
but the point I want to make here is
that given that you have some kind of
baseline set of skills you're okay given
a certain amount of time you will reach
to a certain level after you reach this
glass ceiling level then you have to
really consider skills and value a lot
more companies can't really promote
everyone to the top just because they
stayed there the longest so you'll
notice that when you join these big
companies a lot of people are kind of
just floating at this level I'm not
trying to make any crazy conclusions
about this glass ceiling I'm not trying
to like talk smack about everyone I'm
just describing what it's like and if
you work at a big company you'll
probably encounter it alright guys so
that's just the main point I wanted to
make today about software developer life
it's just that as an engineer you have
to be prepared to just meet that
crossroads at some point in time you
don't have to answer the question right
now maybe in the back of your head you
know if you want to be a coder or you
want to be a manager but eventually as
time goes on you'll have to make that
decision alright guys hopefully this is
helpful these are all small insights I
got you know I have a lot of friends
that work at a lot of different big
companies and this stuff is more or less
the same everywhere alright so I'll see
you guys next time for episode 3 haven't
decided what that's gonna be yet but
please leave me a comment drop me a like
and take care alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
