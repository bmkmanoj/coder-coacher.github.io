a little different today I just wanted
to get out of the house just a little
bit of a change in scenery I'm going to
walk around the city sorry about the
audio I'm okay the audio is going to be
very good but we're going to walk around
show a little bit of New York we're
going to go at Battery Park West Side
Highway can actually talk about
something real so it's not just some
random ass vlog but this is going to be
a little more interesting alright so it
should be a little fun I'm also
congested I live downtown and to get to
the West Side Highway we have to walk
through Tribeca which is this backdrop
that you're seeing right now that's a
triangle below Canal so we're walking
through it it's pretty close and we're
going to get to the water soon which is
the Hudson River to plant it to go to
the water find a place to sit down and
then answer one question that I want to
answer so almost there
alright guys we're here lower set up
here Westside Highway
applause the point on the backdrop is
city and this other backdrop here is
going to be New Jersey be careful this
is New Jersey back
it's pretty crazy a lot of stuff going
on to even play beach volleyball here
it's like 50 degrees and some people
don't have their shirts on see that so
in another video I mean I think was my
Carnegie Mellon video but I made this
very clear distinction between students
that could be choosers versus students
that couldn't be choosers and the
cruisers were the ones I could pick
wherever they work they were really
smart they could work at Google Facebook
whatever but a lot of people are asking
what separates them from the rest of us
and it's really simple and it's also
kind of dangerous to think about this
kind of stuff too much but I want to
address it so like what made those
really smart students so smart versus
the rest of us first what you just have
to do is just completely get rid of the
special people out of your mind because
they're not the norm so you cannot
compare yourself with Steve Jobs or Elon
Musk or Bill Gates there will be some
people that are straight-up gifted
different prodigies and it's not really
fair to compare yourself with them they
can influence and inspire you can aspire
to be like them but
it's not a fair comparison so there's
like it's just a distribution you've got
to kind of kill the edges and kind of
considered that the average parts so
that's the first thing I want to say
just like if you're comparing yourself
too much to the real geniuses the real
gifted people it's not it's not a fair
comparison so what I think this used to
bother me a lot in school is qualit me a
lot just being around other peers that
were just apparently much smarter than
me or getting the job that I want to get
so it bothered me a lot he'll bother you
about it while there's everyone like if
you see other people at your similar age
or your similar level doing better than
you you will ask yourself why are they
there and I can't be at that level but
actually everyone's find and everyone's
like mentality and just great I guess
when everyone develops at a different
rate and at the same age you'll be your
mind will be developed either behind or
ahead of someone else so I know for a
fact that I've developed my mind a
little bit you know in the past 3 years
for example and it's at a nother level
than what it was in college right but
it's very likely that someone else when
they were 18 or 19 had already developed
their mindset way beyond their years way
beyond a lot of their peers and that's
just
some people are just developed their
thinking their mindset quicker than
other people I think you see this a lot
we hear those crazy stories of kids
skipping their grades and be way ahead
of their classmates so think of like the
ten year old that goes to college you
know that's already not a very good
scenario but why it is like 11 or 10
year old sometimes need to go to college
but for whatever reason they've
developed their mind maybe their parents
have done it are but they are just not
on the same level as their classmates
anymore and that's why they said sorry
that's why they sent like a ten year old
to call it just because that 10 year old
has developed their mind already to the
level call the students even to interact
with people that he or she's around that
happened the about level because it's
too unfair for them or just weird for
them to drive all the people their age
so this is really similar to what
happens in college because in college
there's a wide range of levels you could
have a really developed line or very not
so developed line so I could definitely
tell you in my first week at college
there were some people that are taking
an advanced programming classes like
their freshman year or like take classes
I was taking my junior year they were
already talking about them and our
freshman dorms and to me they just
seemed straight-up smart but it wasn't
that there was straight-up smart it's
just that it developed a little faster
and I bit and I would eventually get to
that point but it's just a matter of
timing and not everyone is on the same
timeline you know
so I'm not sure where I'm really good
with this I didn't write a script for
this video I'm just winging it also I
just decided to go outside through
different but one gate that dangerous
thing I wanted to talk about is that you
should never compare yourself directly
with your peers because it's also not
really fair because since you're on
different timelines your brains will be
developed in different ways so it's
never too fair even for yourself to just
do peer to peer progress comparison it's
not fair the only thing that you can
measure well is if you're individually
improving your own mindset and your own
like mental development and if that hard
always moving up that's the best you can
do that's fact Nick you're you're
messing up but as long as that's moving
forward you will eventually catch up to
all those other peers that you thought
were so much smarter than you back in
the day like when I was a freshman the
people taking such and such classes were
insanely smart and then when I took
those classes and I started to just
understand those stuff and like oh I I
get it now I guess those people just
understood that you know two years ago
but now it's two years later and I'm at
that level so it's all just really
relative and if you're blessed with
maybe maybe your college suited and
you're thinking so beyond your peers and
you know companies are like begging you
to work for them then good for you you
just you're just added accelerated track
but you know for anyone out there that's
spending too much time comparing
themselves with other people it's just a
different timeline so you're not going
to be on the same timeline as everyone
else it's just your time line and you
have to keep pushing it forward so I
would overall just not worry too much
about this in terms of comparing
yourself with other people all you have
to do is just keep progression forward
and upgrade your
just upgrade your mind those it but
never compare and I know the root cause
of questions like this when people ask
what makes those people would be able to
work at Google versus us or what makes
those students so smart the root cause
of that is always a comparison it's just
not the right way to start off with it
right I said this before but everything
comes from interim of internalization
just as yourself you know what do you
need to do work because you know them
right all right I've talked too much
this is really obstructed I don't even
know how the audio is going to be and I
don't even know if this video is going
to provide any value but I can't hold
this camera too much longer just going
to walk around a little bit more maybe
show you guys a little more scenery in
the middle Battery Park right now kind
of creatively bust a lot of cool stuff
here I don't want to make this like a
Phoenix pill about answering the
questions but if I see something cool
I'll take some footage and try to
include all right our guys will show you
some New Jersey New Jersey skyline then
the Statue of Liberty is really small
and then we'll wrap up
new jersey from some Manhattan sighs
it's pretty cool goody here this
everyone is a Statue of Liberty which is
insanely small let me zoom that's the
best I could do even from here it's
really small so you guys are missing so
much but you know while we're here kind
of cool to see all right guys that's it
for today hope you enjoyed the different
scenery and maybe I'll make more of
these videos but tough to talk in public
and it's really weird so you guys next
time all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
