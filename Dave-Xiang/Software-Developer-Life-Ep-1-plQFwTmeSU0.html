2016 I got a few questions asking about
what a typical day is like for a
software engineer and I really can't do
this question just this in just one
video I'm going to start a series about
this stuff and just talk about all the
things I've encountered and learned
through my very short career we can
cover everything from your day-to-day
engineering life to building
relationships and problems you might
encounter if you have any specific
questions just ask me in the comments
and I'll answer them
alright first I just want to give a
quick rundown of my background I'm not
really a veteran but I have been doing
this for a little bit I graduated in
2009 and my very first job was at
Qualcomm in San Diego and I was working
in their mobile chipset department
I wrote really really low-level code
device drivers firmware for about two
years right around two years I was
getting a little tired of Si and device
drivers so I switched departments to
Qualcomm's research and development we
worked on much higher level software
this is where I learned a lot of my C++
and we were working on really abstract
kind of R&amp;amp;D ideas during Rd my team was
working on a cool way to simulate neural
networks and potentially make a chip
that can simulate neural networks very
efficiently
it was like this cool intersection of
engineering and hardcore science ok
after two years of that in R&amp;amp;D I started
slowly getting interested in startups a
little bit you know it's kind of like a
itch on the back of your head that you
have to scratch ok so after about four
years at Qualcomm I decided to just pack
up my stuff and move over to New York
City where I started out my first
startup I learned a lot of new stuff at
the startup it was definitely a lot of
new technologies that I hadn't really
used a qualcomm new languages etc except
about a year and a half in I realized
that wasn't as passionate anymore about
what we were building so I decided to
actually move on to a different company
so only about four months ago just last
August 2015 I joined a recycling
start-up where my old college roommate
was working that we're trying to be like
the next generation of recycling and
garbage in the US it's a really old
industry and they haven't really seen
the light of day in terms of technology
so that that's my whole professional
history up to right now hopefully I
sound credible enough so let's just
start with the advice now first thing I
want to go over is a couple demographics
because this video is definitely for a
target audience it might not be for you
this video is for software engineering
for a new grad or junior developer at a
large corporation and when I say large I
mean on the order of thousands of people
like Amazon Microsoft Google those kind
of companies if you fall into this
category then this video is for you and
again with everything I say this is just
my opinion of what I've been through so
please please don't take any of this as
fat today we're just going to cover two
points to kick off the series and let's
get started with the first one all right
the first thing that you have to be
prepared for is to do some shitty tasks
on the outside the company might be very
glamorous you can see all the cool
beanbags on the Google website but for a
new grad just joining the work is not
glamorous it is not glamorous my one
piece of advice for this is just to
mentally prepare yourselves to be able
to do a little bit of crappy work
because there's really no way around it
for every 10 tasks you might receive at
these large corporations especially when
you're in new grad there's only going to
be one out of ten which is a kind of a
cool task to do but the majority of them
are going to be really really
the company could decorate them up and
make them sound really important and
make you and your work be like yeah this
is good we really need you to do this
but in actuality they're going to be
giving you some crappy work to start off
with so there's a purpose to this whole
thing the point of giving you a crappy
assignment that maybe no one else really
wants to do is to vet you as an engineer
and see how well you can solve an easy
problem if you do a lot of the crappy
tasks well you'll quickly move on to
much cooler tasks but if you don't do a
very good job you might be stuck doing
some shitty work my first project at
Qualcomm when I was a new grad was to
get a bunch of this code compiling using
a ton of make files and nobody cared
about it's something that no one else
wanted to do so obviously they give it
to new grad if you're an engineer you
probably know what make files are
they're not the prettiest thing and
pretty much I toiled away at that for
like my first month or so anyways point
number one is just be prepared to take
on some crappy work okay so the second
point I want to make is how to ask
questions well once you're in a
corporate life people are very very busy
and I can almost guarantee you that not
many people will have time to kind of
baby see you around you're probably
going to have a mentor assigned for you
which is awesome but don't expect that
mentor to be really having some
one-on-one time with you every day at a
big company you're definitely going to
have a lot of resources when I say it
resources is everything from your
co-workers to the tools that the company
has developed to all the documentation
that they've written it's your
responsibility to use your resources
well at a large company and one way of
doing this is asking good questions do
not I repeat do not ask the same
question.what it's a really bad look for
an engineer you have to form a really
good question ask it somebody will give
you a good answer and it's your
responsibility to take that and learn
from it you don't want to be the guy or
girl that keeps I am in people saying oh
how do you do this
and then one week later it's the same
exact question it's really bad does this
question make sense is there no other
way I can figure it out
what other dependencies does this
question happen just take a step back
and really understand what you don't
know and try to fill in as many holes as
you can
don't ask another engineer for their
help without doing your homework it
definitely shows and as a new grad at
this huge company it's really not a good
look alright alright guys that's the end
of the video for today with the two
major points mentally prepare yourself
to get some crappy work and also make
sure you ask your questions well to
utilize your resources alright I hope
this is helpful this is just the first
video in this series and I really want
to I guess talk about a lot of the
things you might encounter as a software
engineer if you have any specific
questions just ask me in the comments
and I'll answer it in the next video
please give me a like or a thumbs up and
I will see you guys next time alright
have a good week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
