had a great week sorry in advance the
title of this video is a little bit
bullshit but I'm using it as clickbait
so you can click this video but anyways
this is one of the questions I've been
asked a lot in emails and messages it's
still really common and I just had some
thoughts about it so I wanted to address
it but the question is kind of like what
programming languages do I learn or what
programming languages do I learn in 2016
so this video this week is gonna be non
technical video just gonna share some of
my thoughts regarding this question and
hope you enjoy it
alright let's do it first I was just
trying to think about the root cause or
maybe like the source of the issue
behind asking a question like this and I
think there's like an underlying fear
about not learning the right language
right now this is definitely a very
natural feeling you don't want to kind
of waste your time or learn irrelevant
things and you definitely want to take
the fastest route to get to some level
so no one has the right answer this
question right I don't have the right
answer your teacher doesn't have the
right answer Bill Gates
well maybe Bill Gates has the right
answer but this question is so
subjective that you shouldn't even waste
your brainpower thinking about a
question like this all right so in this
video I just want to give my advice and
I'm breaking it up into two categories
I'm giving kind of two categories of the
device around this topic and as with
anything this is a non-technical video
so it's all my opinion don't take
anything I say as fact and I'm just
gonna present these two possibilities
for you all right so I just wanted to
give two pieces of the device in this
video one is going to be what's most
practical and the second one is going to
be what I believe in if you're a
complete beginner or you're just very
new into software or engineering you do
need some kind of structure to help your
learning don't expect you to just figure
everything out on your own you do need
some kind of structure so structure
comes in a lot of different ways it
could be
a full four six year program at a school
it could be researching the right online
classes to take or it could be signing
up for a coding boot camp if you have
some extra cash so the most practical
piece of advice which I think is
practical but I might not believe in is
to join a coding boot camp if you have
the cash or the resources to get you in
there and if you have the money for it
you will be accepted joining those boot
camps it's actually it's not an
application by merit like going to a
college is it's just if you have the
money you're gonna be able to join those
boot camps right those those things are
just companies and they're out to make a
buck so don't feel like oh no am I good
enough to apply to that boot camp no if
you just have enough money or cash you
can join that's why it's very practical
so once you go to a coding boot camp
they're gonna teach you software
revolving around web programming and for
good reason you'll learn the basics of
web frameworks maybe you'll do Django
and Python maybe you'll do Ruby and Ruby
on Rails you'll probably learn some
JavaScript but every single coding
bootcamp at least the most popular ones
they all focus on web programming
because that is the most high in demand
right now it's the skill most companies
need for big companies small companies
everyone needs some kind of internet or
web presence and that's why web
programming is so high in demand right
now and every single coding bootcamp is
gonna teach you technologies revolving
around that so this is why this is the
most practical approach because once you
get into one of these camps they tell
you what you need to learn and they pick
the most practical skills that the most
employers need so they essentially all
they're doing is getting you productive
to be on the job all the boot camps are
really up to date they they teach you
the latest and greatest technologies I
have a friend who knows someone that I
think it was a psychology major in
college he joined a coding boot camp for
like six months and now he's a developer
at uber it was crazy right so this is
actually the most practical advice I can
give if you have the resources to do
this just join one of those
boot camps and they're gonna just tell
you or spoon-feed you exactly what you
need to learn and you won't even have to
ask yourself what language is is good
because they will just tell you what
languages are good so that was the most
practical portion of my advice if you
have the time and resources do one of
those camps I think it's the fastest and
easiest way to kind of get your foot
into the door for engineering now my
second kind of category advice is kind
of what I believe in and it's not
related to boot camps I think the the
real way and the most consistent proven
and kind of true way to go about this is
to apply to the best engineering program
that you can find and try to get in this
is assuming financially it's going to be
feasible for you if you have to save up
some money to take up some loans your
personal responsibilities are set you
know everybody's in a different stage in
life and you might have different things
besides school going on so if all those
external factors are kind of cool I
would still say the best thing for you
to do is get into an accredited program
to learn engineering I think that people
are a little scared of this or maybe
they're a little wary of doing something
like this because it actually could
potentially take a long time a lot of
those programs are four or five six year
programs and that sounds like a long
time to people if you haven't started
yet so that's why it's a little scary I
made another video a while ago about how
to learn programming or how to become a
programmer there was a screencast video
but pretty much all I did there was just
regurgitate and copy a standard
curriculum found at a four-year program
so I didn't do anything crazy those
ideas aren't my own all I did was take
what you typically go through at one of
these four-year programs and I just put
it on a screencast so it's no rocket
science here but these methods they've
been proven for a long time and they
just straight up they work so if you
guys have some spare time just please
check out some of these other screencast
videos I made about learning programming
languages or how to become a programmer
but the too long don't read part of this
whole section is that
if you can do it the real way is to get
into a real program okay so got
sidetracked a little bit let's just
rewind and go back to the video title a
little bit what programming languages
should I learn if you're a complete
beginner this is the wrong question you
should be asking yourself we've already
talked about this but if you're a
complete beginner you know what to do
now alright if you're intermediate level
or you already have programming
experience the only advice I could say
is that just go with what interests you
all right so if you already have some
programming knowledge and you are
worried about which languages you should
learn just pick some languages and
frameworks that do cool things or you
think they do cool things and that's
gonna be a very natural way to branch
out and learn some other stuff no
language or no framework is better than
another language or framework and they
don't really have these time limits I'm
not sure where everyone's getting these
time limits from when people ask what
language is best to use in 2016 it's the
same set of languages that are good for
2015 it's the same languages that were
good to learn in 2005 alright so there's
no time limits on what you should learn
and what's relevant they don't go in and
out every single year si was actually
invented in the 1970s and it's still
probably taught in a lot of schools and
a lot of different curriculums it's a
practical for a job absolutely not
learning si is not really practical for
a job but is learning C really good for
you as an engineer yes very good
alright guys that's kind of summing up
the video nothing really technical just
a couple of thoughts I had revolving
this topic and I know I've just been
asked from many different people the
same exact question so I just wanted to
talk about it
another thing that I wanted to bring up
is kind of the purpose of my channel a
few people have asked me why I don't do
like a curriculum on how to learn Java
or a step-by-step how to code type of
thing in my videos and I do not plan to
do anything like that any time soon if I
were to do something like that maybe in
the future I would not pick YouTube as a
platform to do that because YouTube is
not designed for curriculums all right I
don't think anyone should be learning a
step-by-step full curriculum via YouTube
videos I
there are a lot of other platforms that
are much better and optimized for that
so my videos may seem a little scattered
sometimes sometimes they're tech videos
sometimes they're non-technical videos I
go from topic to topic but I'm actually
doing all of that on purpose so my main
purpose of all this content of all these
videos that I want to make is that I
just want them to be supplementary
videos to help you kind of get a little
inside look into this industry I guess
from both the tech and non tech
perspective so I know I don't talk about
really big topics like big chunky topics
that classes would normally talk about
but I want my content to kind of be like
that that info that's kind of in between
those big chunks that like complementary
info they don't get very often but it's
still really useful if you're expecting
a full like semester work of Java
lessons you're not gonna find that on my
channel but there's a ton of other
resources for stuff like that which give
you a real step-by-step lesson plans
lectures all that stuff and there's a
lot of resources for that all right guys
that's enough for today I think very
non-technical video but I just had a lot
of these thoughts floating around in my
head regarding those inbound questions
and messages I've received I just wanted
to share those thoughts with you next
week we'll probably do a technical video
again because this one was really like
me ranting almost but please if you
liked the video please hit like if you
have any questions regarding anything
just hit me up in the comments please
subscribe if you haven't and thanks
again for your time all right take care
