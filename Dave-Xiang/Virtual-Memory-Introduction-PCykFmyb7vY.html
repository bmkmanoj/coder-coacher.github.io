been well today we're gonna talk about
one of the most complicated but awesome
subjects and all of computing and that's
virtual memory so virtual memory is a
crazy topic and we can't really get into
its real guts in one video but what I
want to do and what we should all do is
really appreciate it it's always working
under the hood for you and the whole
point of this video is to give it some
much-needed love alright let's do it
so all of us have a ton of digital
devices we have phones computers tablets
and each one of these things is running
a lot of programs all the time remember
these programs are called processes and
just for a reminder if you watch this
old video of mine how code works it's a
good refresher of what a process is okay
so the big question that we should ask
ourselves is how do these hundreds of
programs that are running on my phone
not bump into each other at random
points in time
remember your computer is a system and
it has limited resources so maybe it has
a kinks of RAM that has 1 processor and
2 terabytes of hard disk space how do
all these programs share these resources
and not just bump into each other while
they're running if you're working on a
brand new mobile game that you want to
release where you can like beat
alligators you don't have to worry about
what other programs are running on the
phone while your game is running do you
think the creator of flappy bird had to
care about how his code worked alongside
Facebook application code I'm sure you
already know the answer to this question
but it's a big fat no as programmers
when we're developing our applications
we really don't care about what else is
running on the system right we just
write our own applications and
everything is good to go as long as we
don't have bugs right there's pretty
much like infinity combinations and
variations of what could be happening on
any system computer or phone at any
given time and it would be ridiculous
almost for a programmer
to have to worry about that all right so
the main question that we should ask
ourselves is who is exactly preventing
these programs from bumping into each
other whose job is that whose
responsibility is that well I'm sure you
guys have a basic intuition of who's
doing that and it's the operating system
the operating system does many many
things but one of the most important
things it does is manage all the
application memory of all the processes
that are running the operating system is
doing a lot a lot of work behind the
scenes to make our lives a lot easier
and even if we just accept it and we
don't really know how it works we have
to have a really deep appreciation for
it now we're gonna start talking about
virtual memory the operating system
provides this big blueprint of memory
for every single process and what's
really cool is that this blueprint is
exactly the same for every single
process let's just take an example that
it's a blueprint for a house okay so the
operating system for every single
process out there it's gonna give them a
blueprint of a house to use its memory
the operating system can just be like
okay flappy bird you can store your data
in the garage and it's at address 5,000
now when facebook comes along the
operating system tells it the same thing
okay Facebook you can store your data
also in the garage at address 5,000 this
blueprint that the operating system
gives for every single process you have
to store your data at address 5,000 in
the garage it's the same for every
single process
no one is treated any differently every
single program sees the same blueprint
of memory that the operating system
provides but wait a minute that would
mess things up right if the OS told
everything to put this data at address
5,000 wouldn't they all collide with
each other okay so if a light bulb just
went off in your head and maybe it did
this is exactly what virtual memory is
the address 5,000 is a virtual address
that the operating system provides
every single one of these different
processes and that virtual address
actually maps to different physical
addresses in the real system so even
though flappybird a facebook both use
address 5,000 to store their data that
5,000 actually points to a different
part of memory real physical memory and
the operating system manages that
virtual address 5,000 for a flappy bird
could point to a real address of 20,000
while a virtual address of 5,000 for
Facebook could point to address 30,000
it's virtual it's the operating systems
job to make sure that these virtual
addresses never really collide in the
physical space and it does a really
really good job with that so this is
kind of like the beauty behind virtual
addresses the operating system gives the
same exact blueprint of the house to
every single process in the system when
you develop your programs you don't
really care where the memory goes right
you just use it allocate it but you
really don't know where it's actually
being allocated
that's the operating systems job all we
can do as just the average regular day
application developer is we just try to
use the system not use too many
resources and the operating system will
make sure our programs don't collide
with all the other programs that are
running at the same time another really
cool to think about is imagine if in
many processes shared the same pieces of
code SAVE Facebook and flappy bird share
the same piece of software do you think
the operating system would duplicate
that same piece of code between Facebook
and flappy bird or would it duplicate
the code between 100 different processes
if it was shared
well the operating system is also really
smart it can recognize which pieces of
code are shared and it can map those
virtual addresses to actually the same
place in real memory or when it knows
that things can't collide it'll map the
virtual addresses to different places
it's just like really it's almost like
crazy smart and it's just happening for
you for free almost all right guys so
that's just a really really high level
intuition the
hi in virtual memory and hopefully we
all have a deep appreciation of what
it's doing for us remember the operating
system is doing a lot of stuff for us
besides memory management memory
management is just one out of many
important things that's happening behind
the scenes another really cool little
side thing is that virtual memory
actually takes the coordination of
hardware and software together it's not
purely a software things hardware and
software work together to make virtual
memory work but that discussion is kind
of outside the scope of this video I'm
gonna wrap it up about now alright guys
hope this was fun
hoped you gained a better intuition and
give some love to virtual memory which
is kind of one of those things that it's
always working for us but many people
just don't understand it because we
don't have to worry about it so as long
as we understand it a little bit
appreciate it a little bit and if you
want to go the extra mile and really dig
deep to understand it you'll find that
it's one of the craziest most
complicated but cool topics like ever
alright guys so that's the end of the
video hoped you liked it and just
enjoyed some of these cool tricks of
computing and I'll see you guys next
time
all right leave me a comment if anything
drop me a like and please subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already ok
see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
