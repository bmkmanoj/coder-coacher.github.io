really really well got a great question
the other day which is the inspiration
for this video but it's from somebody
that wasn't really technical but was
looking to be able to communicate better
and be more confident with the
developers and programmers who is
working with you'll find that as the
developer you will always appreciate
other people trying to understand what
you're doing a little bit better alright
and that kind of goes both ways if
someone else wants to take the time to
understand how your code works and how
their tech is working you also need to
take time to understand what their job
is like what's the designers job like
what's the business development person's
job like alright so it's a two-way
street and always really appreciate it
when someone wants to understand what
you're doing so we're going to go
through some basic buzz words talk about
them a little briefly and actually dive
into them a little bit more behind just
surface level definitions I'm catering
some of this video to more of a wider
audience I'm not going to make it too
technical for just programmers or
developers or whatever but this really
is for everyone that just wants to
understand this stuff a little better
and that just means everyone I think
everyone has a basic mental picture of
how web architecture works and let's
just keep that picture all right so I
think the basic picture is like you have
a front-end application it hits a
back-end application that application
hits a database does some special
business business logic and returns a
response to the front-end all right so
that's the basic mental picture it's
still very accurate but we have to do a
little better than that right so the
whole purpose of this video is to take
that little mental model and break it
down a little bit more alright so
there's four four parts of this video
the four parts are going to be we're
going to talk back end first then front
end then we're going to tie them
together with some basic use cases and
then we're going to go a little bit
beyond the basics all right four parts
so let's just put a really simple
definition to back end back end is any
application that's connected to the
Internet or the cloud whose primary
purpose
it's the service request just say it one
more time just to be really clear but
it's any application on the Internet
whose main job Tony jobs it's a service
request all right that's the general
gist of back-end now with that said it's
better to learn by example and let's
just take a few samples of the most
common back-end processes all right and
we're going to just cover web servers
and databases and get into some more
advanced stuff later but for this
section the two most common back-end
processes are web servers and databases
a web server is really easy to
understand but also really easy to
overcomplicate alright so what exactly
is a web server but a web server process
is anything that can respond to an HTTP
request and return a file to it that's
all it is if you're doing something
really basic like a really basic static
page that doesn't change I just present
something you could actually do that
with just one web server right a web
server could do something as simple as
just return a file from your computer
that's the most implicit use of a web
server right just it could serve up
random file so you could hit ww-why
homepage com it hit the server somewhere
all the web server does is locate a
static HTML file and just return it
right away and then you could that's
technically a website ok so the second
most popular back-end process that's
running it's going to be database all
right we just talked about the most
popular back-end process obviously
that's a web server you guys know what a
web server is now the second most
popular one is a database so every
single semi-intelligent web server is
going to leverage a database that
persist something all right but with
that said it's also important to know
that is you don't have to use a database
just for web technologies right if you
have a scientist and he's running all
these experiments he might be gathering
tons of gigabytes of data from his
experiments and they're all offline he
could just save them in
a database and that could be a perfectly
good use case for database so you don't
have to use a database with a web server
but if you're doing anything intelligent
with a web server you probably need a
database all right when a web server
leverages a database which is 99.9% of
the time unless you're doing a dummy
website but for those 99% of the cases
the web server always sits on one
computer and the database sits on a
different computer and they have their
own connection the reason why a database
is almost always on a separate computer
is that both web servers and databases
are things that really try to perform to
the highest ability and they use a lot
of resources so if you run a database
server on your computer that database is
going to use a ton of memory to try to
perform as as best as possible all right
and if you run a web server and a
database side by side on the same
computer usually they compete for
computer resources so that's why usually
people separate them unless your
computer is insanely powerful you're
going to have your web server here in
your database over here that's enough
for back-end for now let's talk about
front-end a little bit and then we're
going to tie the two together
all right section two we're going to
talk about front-end really quickly but
usually this is a little easier to kind
of understand or conceptualize then back
end but front end or client-side code is
any code that runs on a client while
writing clients includes the Chrome
browser using to watch this video or
your mobile phone remember the basic
premise of the Internet right the basic
premise of the instrument is a
client-server relationship
there's clients making requests to
servers just like you go to a steakhouse
you're the client and the restaurant is
the server and you order your steak the
restaurants going to respond with a
steak right the same analogy for the
internet so we just talked about
back-end stuff which is like the
restaurant and essentially all front-end
is is a client one important thing to
remember as an
technical person is that when you
request a change from a developer a
change isn't always siloed to just front
end or just back in they always come
together unless you're asking something
really simple like I want to change the
button to read but if it's not that
simplistic just assume that everything
you want to change is intertwined
between front end and back end all right
it's all intertwine in the concept of
web applications they're not just
back-end tasks or just front-end tasks
they almost always come together
all right section three I think this
section is probably going to be the most
fun and most useful section if you have
a basic idea of what back-end and
front-end means at least intuitively
client-server we can move on to section
3 which is going to be tying all this
stuff together so remember our basic
model and we're always going to keep the
basic model in our head all right so the
basic model is a front-end application
is something you interact with right you
are the one pressing buttons on the
front-end application those applications
make requests to back-end processes all
right the two most common vacuum
processes being web servers and
databases the web server and is going to
either read or write something from the
database it's going to do some business
logic that's custom to your application
and it's going to return something to
the client all right so that's the
mental model and let's dive into exactly
what is the back-end returning to the
client the older way of doing things was
that the back-end would render all the
HTML in its entirety and return it back
to the front end and the front end would
just take that HTML and display it all
so that's kind of the old files all the
HTML is rendered on the back end and
it's returned in the response all the
browser has to do is display it the
newer style the newer style of
architecture that many of the fancy web
applications are using these days is at
the back end the back end doesn't return
HTML anymore all returns
is data javascript data and the front
end the front end is actually what's
responsible in generating all those HTML
tags so the way I just presented this
kind of sounds like a little black and
white or old versus new but it's not
really black or white all right so
sometimes the back end could respond
with maybe half the page like 50% of the
page in HTML and then the front end
renders the rest so it's not all or
nothing but everything falls within this
kind of spectrum all right it's a mix
and match of who is responsible of
generating the final HTML that you see
it could be 100% the back end it could
be 50% of back end or could be 0% all
right everything falls on this spectrum
so what we just talked about is kind of
difference of responsibilities right
back-end responsibilities versus content
responsibilities and how they could be
shared and makes it matched but has a
non-technical person you shouldn't think
of all the tech you're working with as
like this magical black box like you
shouldn't think of it as just oh I press
buttons here and the right thing works
right if you think of it as a black box
you have like no understanding of what
it takes to get it future working I
think the best thing you can do as a
non-technical person like the number one
thing you can do to empower you to
communicate better with developers is
really understand what the
responsibilities are for different parts
of the technical system right and we
just talked about the most basic set of
responsibilities if you have a basic
understanding of what the backend is
doing what the front-end is doing how
much data is actually being passed
between the two how much
responsibilities is mixed between the
two if you have a basic understanding of
that system even between just those two
levels it's going to make you that much
more knowledgeable than just a oh it's a
black box where things work so for
section four I just wanted to make this
video pretty interesting and go beyond
the basics a little bit all right so we
talked about web server and the database
and those are just two
those are just two of many different
types of vacuum processes that are
running alright so think of the back end
as a huge system all right it's a system
of computers that are communicating and
connected to each other and it's much
more than just one webserver and one
database think about if you just go to
amazon.com and you press buy on
something right do you think when you
press buy on Amazon it just hits a web
server in a database do you really think
that's all that happens but no there's
probably a ton of stuff that happens
right when you click buy on Amazon I bet
it hits like 50 computers to process
your request hits payment maybe hits an
inventory system maybe it gets a
security system maybe it hits a
notification system to tell the vendor
to start preparing your you know box of
socks that you just bought but you just
hit one button on Amazon and I bet 50
process keys are activated let's talk
about two really common processes and
we're going to talk about background
processes and caching background
processing is pretty simple is when you
need more time to process a request
all right so usually when you interact
the webpage is really fast
click-click click-click and it's usually
responsive but sometimes it can't be so
fast right you don't want the user to
wait for you so one example I have here
is like what if you submit your homework
to an automatic homework greater website
but the grading of the homework takes
two days right you're not going to sit
at your computer and wait two days for
the system to grade your homework you're
going to submit your homework it's going
to be queued up in the line and a
background process is going to render it
and then two days later you'll get
notified and you can see what you go to
the homework right so background
processes are to handle things that just
take physically longer amounts of time
number crunching processing huge amounts
of data but not everything can happen
really fast all right the second other
background process that's also really
really popular is
cashing right so in the most basic use
case you get a request from the web
server and it hits the database and it
responds right but hitting the database
sometimes that can be a very expensive
tasks and what if you're hitting it with
the same request 100 times well you
might want to cache that responsibly you
can respond much faster to the client
remember the basic idea of the cache
right it's faster and easier access for
things that happen very often so your
sofa with your favorite jacket on top of
it is a cache for your closet or your
bookshelf in your apartment is a cache
for the library right it's faster easier
access to things that you use very often
managing caches is probably one of the
most challenging parts of software
engineering but it's also a pervasive
part all right guys that's the end of
the video we covered a decent amount of
stuff and I admit a lot of the stuff we
covered today this video is just really
really basic but it's catered towards a
non-technical audience all right so
don't kill me for trying to explain a
really simple point but remember we
talked about four major things we just
talked about back in what that kind of
means that buzzword is back end we
talked about front end would that kind
of mean to remember front end is
client-side code code on your phone
third we tied it two together and
remember why tying those two together is
really important because you can
separate the responsibility levels
between back-end and front-end and if
you're aware of the differences of
responsibilities between parts of the
technical system it's going to really
really empower you as a non-technical
person because you won't think of
everything as magical black box and
finally we just touched upon two other
popular back-end process technologies
which is background processing and
caching those are really popular and
those are all so pervasive parts of any
web application stack all right so
hopefully this video was helpful not
very technical but just another overview
video of basic web architecture all
right so
hopefully was helpful leave me a comment
like the video please subscribe and
thanks again for watching I will see
everyone next week alright
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
