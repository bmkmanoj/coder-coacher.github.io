doing well video this week hopefully
pretty simple pretty good it's going to
be programming words that everyone
should know all right
part one don't ever underestimate the
power and importance of just
communicating well and concisely and the
way you do that is actually choosing
your words really carefully so the right
programming words go into the right
places and everybody's going to know
what you mean you'll work more
efficiently everybody will like you more
and you can just describe what you're
doing a lot better oh yeah that thing we
design that does that custom behavior
during that special scenario yeah that
thing right this video we're going to
talk about three words really basic
words operators modules data structures
let's do it
all right first word we're going to
cover is the concept of operators you
guys have already seen this since first
grade we've been dealing with operators
our whole life well let's just get
crystal clear on what operators mean
with respect to programming you can kind
of compare operators kind of like
functions they take some kind of input
and they produce some kind of output but
they follow a very very specific syntax
and kind of set of semantics all right
so the most common operator that I think
everyone is most familiar with from
first graders to advanced programmers is
the plus sign or the plus operator we've
all seen this before especially all over
the place in programming a plus B that
plus sign those two arrows that plus
sign is called the operator a and B are
called the upper hands all right so
we're clear on that first what exactly
is an operand well every single operator
operates on something that's something
that we're operating on is the operand
operand it's a little weird to say but
it's still a thing the most common use
case is when we have two operators
involved and this is called a binary
operator all right so a plus B we
actually need two operands we need
add two things so this is a binary or
two operator next word that you're going
to hear sometimes is going to be unary
operator these are the plus plus or
posts or pre increment operators and
they operate on one operand so that's
why it's called unary operator all right
last but not least these are much more
rare but we have ternary operators which
operate on three operands I think
there's only really one of these that's
used in practice it looks like this I'm
sure you've seen it all before it is
really referred to as the ternary
operator so you've seen this before and
it's actually the only one that's really
used in day-to-day stuff now there are a
couple other words that we have to talk
through that are related to operators
that we just have to go over real quick
all right
and those are going to be in fixed
prefix and postfix operators and these
are also really basic words but they
have very special meanings an infix
operator infix operator is when the
operator exists between two operands
like a plus B or a minus B so in fix
when you hear that word it just means
the operator is in between in between
two operands prefix is pretty
self-explanatory there's a pre-increment
that everyone's used plus plus a and
finally postfix operands are when the
operand is on the right or after the
operand so a plus plus or b plus plus
okay this is the last thing I want to
talk about related to operators I know
I've over killed this way too much but
this is operator overloading and it's a
really common common thing across many
programming languages and let's just
talk through it real quick personally
I've never really been too big of a fan
of operator overloading it's really
powerful stuff but I also think it makes
the syntax a little too custom and a
little too complicated for my taste but
it's really popular so most operators in
any standard programming language have
well-defined meanings right if you do a
plus plus on an integer it's going to
increment the integer but there comes a
time when you want these operators to do
custom
if you want them to do custom things not
the standard stuff you're going to want
to do operator overloading so let's just
take a quick example so let's just say
of a sample class like this this is not
any programming language some pseudo
language I made up purely for
illustration purposes so don't get mad
at me it's just going to be a simple
class with two members it's just going
to be integer and a string that's
associated with that integer let's call
it a fancy number so one example of an
instance of fancy number could be the
number one and the string o-n-e or the
number two and T wo as a string
all right so simple class integer and a
string and they both correspond with
each other so we have an instance of our
class fancy number let's say it's the
integer two and it's the string T wo and
we want to do plus plus on an instance
of that alright so what exactly should
happen when we plus plus a fancy number
well maybe it should increment the
integer right and then set the string
accordingly to whatever we increment to
so if we plus plus fancy number two we
would get fancy number three with string
T HR e e so operator overloading is
really really powerful but also really
really dangerous because you could
really do anything you really wanted you
can make the plus sign do a minus or you
can make a asterisk sign do a division
and just like F up the whole system so
it's a really powerful but delicate
thing and it usually leads to crazy
complexity so I kind of stay a little
away from operator overloading but let's
just understand what it means alright
guys so that was just a really quick
basic overview of the word operator and
some associated lingo with operator we
had in fix postfix prefix we also had
unary binary and ternary operators all
right so a lot of words floating around
but they all have really really basic
meanings and if you just hear these
words being thrown out you'll know
exactly what they mean it's not really
rocket science but sometimes the words
can be
a little confusing but just use them
properly okay done with operators that
took a little longer than I expected but
oh well doesn't matter
the second word that I thought we should
talk about is the word module this is
just the word that I want to bring up
because we have to be really careful
when using this word because literally
there is no formal definition to this
word and it means so many different
things across so many different contexts
so I just want to talk through it and
what it kind of means alright but there
is no formal definition to the word
module okay so I just have this really
general three part definition to the
word module again there's no formal
definition to this and I'm probably
going to offend a lot of people by
describing a module like this but I
think it just consists of three basic
things number one a module should
encapsulate complex code and
functionality hide it away encapsulate
it away from the user the second thing
that module should do is always define a
well-defined interface for the users
every time a module is created it's so
someone else can use it or you can use
it but ideally a lot of people can use a
module and order for that to happen well
it should have a really well-defined
interface for the external users finally
the third aspect third and final aspect
about what a module really is is that it
should be plug and playable into
different parts of the system meaning if
I design a module it should be easily
usable by someone else inside the system
so plug and play I want to use it here I
wanna use it there you can use it there
no problem so again with modules no
definitive meaning across the board it
might mean specific things for very
specific languages like a module usually
means a very specific thing in Python
but that might not be the case for in
some other language but in general right
now we're just talking like very general
definition of module and I think those
three things were pretty decent to get
started
all right so just move on all right the
last word that I want to talk about is
data structures and actually
abstract data types versus data
structures I just want to clear the air
a little bit about this because I know
this could this caused me a lot of
confusion when I was starting to learn
programming so let's just talk through
how what abstract data type is different
from a data structure an abstract data
type is just a set of rules of how
something should behave and operate all
right and a data structure is the
concrete the concrete implementation of
an abstract data type let's just make a
quick analogy over to Hardware land a
little bit if you guys haven't checked
out my CPU videos remember the
instruction set architecture or ISA and
what that meant well the instruction set
architecture was the set of rules and
behaviors that a processor had to follow
now there could be one is a there could
be one singular instruction set
architecture but many many different
processors implementing that instruction
set architecture so for example we have
x86 which is one is a but let's think
about how many different implementations
are there there are M 2 M 1 Pentium 2
Pentium Turbo Pentium turbo plus plus
all those are implementations of a
single ISA this is the exact same
analogy for abstract data type and data
structures alright if you have an
abstract data type like a stack it just
defines the behavior like push/pop but
actually implementing that there are
many different ways to implement a stack
the two most common ways to implement a
stack are probably using an array or a
linked list or something much more
complicated but just make sure you
differentiate in your head the abstract
data type which is just the stack just
pushing popping versus the concrete
implementations of how you actually
write the thing with a linked list for
example so that's the major distinction
between abstract data type and a data
structure
I know this is a little confusing like
the word data is in both of these words
but in general and this goes for all the
programming okay this kind of concept
goes for all a programming but when you
hear the word abstract in any type of
context
there's no implementation evolve when
you hear the word abstract just think
this is an interface or this is a set of
rules I have to follow
there's no implementation for something
that's abstract whenever something is
abstract it can't really exist there has
to be concrete things like concrete
implementers of anything that's abstract
all right so aside from these two words
when you just hear the word abstract in
any type of programming context those
thoughts should go to your head first
all right so just remember that all
right guys that's all I had for today
kind of a long video but we only talked
about three major concepts we just
talked about operators and a little more
detail than we probably should have we
talked about how modules work or should
work and finally we talked about the
difference between abstract data types
and data structures so three really
basic words three words you're going to
use all over the place for the rest of
your engineering life but three words
that we every one should just understand
really well all right so that's all for
today I'll try to think of something
else for part two programming language
I'll write take care and have a great
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
