day today it's a big change from me
shooting you know in the dark with a ton
of artificial light so it's a little
nicer hopefully makes my face perk up a
little bit I know there's a lot of
gamers out there especially on YouTube
I've gotten a couple questions about
video cars and GPUs and kind of how they
work some of the comments I don't play a
lot of video games anymore but I had my
heyday back in the day with my voodoo3
Radeon 9700 if you don't know what those
video cards are I might be substantially
older than you are in this video I'm
gonna spend some time they try to give
you guys a basic intuition behind G P
use and video cards so let's do it the
fundamentals behind GPUs and video cards
come back to computer processors so I've
already made two processor videos before
and I really really think they might be
worth watching if you want to get the
most out of this video so please go
check them out and I'll probably still
be here when you come back so the first
thing we have to do is split apart the
GPU and the video card they're not the
same thing let's talk about the GPU
first alright if you guys remember from
the other videos and talked about this
thing called an instruction set
architecture or is a all processors are
responsible of implementing a particular
instruction set architecture so all a
GPU is is a specialized processor that
implements an ISA that revolves around
images and graphics the other
instruction set architectures I
mentioned in my other videos x86 arm
those are all very general-purpose
instruction set architectures and
they're implemented by very
general-purpose CPUs GPUs on the other
hand are extremely specialized and they
implement a very very specific
instruction set architecture that we'll
talk about so when I introduce
processors I made an analogy to chefs
the kitchen so going off that analogy a
general-purpose processor commonly known
as a CPU is probably like a chef in the
kitchen
I can do everything just okay a GPU is
like a pastry chef the pastry chef
dominates all things pastry in the
kitchen from baking to whiskey to you
know egg cracking while a
general-purpose processor implements a
very general purpose instructor set a
GPU implements an instruction set that
is super focused on graphics these two
instruction sets are inherently
different so while a general purpose is
a might have an instruction that adds
two numbers a GPU might have an
instruction that adds ten numbers at
once they might have instructions to do
fancy math algorithms or manipulate a
lot of data at once and anything that
revolves around image processing a
general-purpose instruction set might
never need to implement in the structure
like that the pastry chef needs to do
high-level pastry things while the
general chef doesn't really have to do
any of that stuff final takeaway from
this is that a GPU implements a very
specific ISA that CPU wouldn't so we
understand GPUs a little bit better now
let's talk about video cards there's two
main ways a computer system handles
graphics integrated graphics and
dedicated graphics so if you're a
hardcore gamer you want to run
everything on max res at 60fps you
almost certainly definitely have
dedicated graphics if you're just an
average Joe you don't play a lot of
video games you're probably just running
integrated graphics integrate a video
just means that your computer can handle
graphics and images without a dedicated
video card oftentimes the performance of
integrated graphics isn't quite as good
as a dedicated video card because your
computer has to share a lot of the same
resources with all the general-purpose
processing so one shared resource for
example is your ram memory if you're
using integrated graphics the general
processor EC is a little bit of that
memory and the graphics processing DC is
a little bit of that memory you can
imagine this saves a lot of power but
you're definitely not going to get some
high-end video
or something like this so for all the
gamers out there who don't care about
power 1000 watt power supplies or
whatever you guys almost certainly have
video cards what a video card is is
pretty much just an expansion on your
computer that provides dedicated
graphics to the monitor once your
computer system has a dedicated video
card you'll never have to use integrated
graphics anymore and it will free up a
lot of resources so you can imagine if
your RAM was being shared by General
prophecy and video processing once you
get that video card and all that members
freedom because the video card itself
has its own memory the GPU we talked
about earlier lives on that video card
and the video card is that big huge
thing that you stick into your computer
so what else lives on a video card
besides the GPU the video card has
dedicated ram memory which is solely
used to store graphics image data you
also have those big heat sinks and fans
that are cooling your GPUs just like you
have cooling your CPUs and you guys
remember all the caching and memory
levels I talked about in my hierarchy
video all that stuff is relevant to
video cards to video cards not only have
dedicated memory but they also have
various caching layers to optimize
performance so upgrades to your video
cards are really similar almost upgrades
to your whole computers GPU cores run
faster memory gets bumped up more
graphics instructions can be run in a
shorter amount of time and they get more
efficient these video cards have gigs
and gigs of dedicated memory they're
beasts so all those things are all
inside your video card dedicated memory
heat sinks GPUs caching fans it's like a
whole computer almost alright guys
that's the end of the video hopefully it
was nice and sweet but the major
takeaway I don't think is then don't use
the word GPU and video card
interchangeably because they're
different like I said these video cards
are like computers they're monsters and
there's a lot of stuff going on in them
if you're interested in more of the
details behind how they work
really
you guys to Google it or you know do
your own reading on how video cars and
GPUs work because you know you're really
complicated but also really cool all
right guys that's the end of the video
hopefully gave you guys a little bit of
intuition behind those really huge video
cards inside your computers right now
and talk to you guys next time all right
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
