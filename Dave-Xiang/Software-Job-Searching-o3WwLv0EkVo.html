I spent a couple weeks in California
which was really nice I could code and
look at a beach so it's super relaxing
but back now to regular busy city life
so it's good to be back
so last video we did I think the topic
was a little technical computer logic so
this video is actually going to be a
little non technical I wanted to talk a
little bit about software engineering
job search and kind of the stuff that
goes into that I made a video a while
ago about the interview process so check
that out really quickly if you haven't
but this video is going to be kind of a
supplementary video to that one so for
this video I thought of three different
tips for your job search and hopefully
they're helpful and without further ado
let's just start
so I mentioned in the other video that
still the best way to get an
introduction or get it in with a
potential job is through a friend a
co-worker or someone you know write
those referrals or those soft
introductions or warm introductions are
usually significantly better than doing
something completely cold so I just want
to put that out there first that the
best way to get a job is still through
someone that you really know all right
so you know someone that knows someone
that knows someone that knows Mark
Zuckerberg even though that's the best
way of going about it you still don't
have that luxury all the time and
everyone's still going to have to go
through this process of cold searching
for a job where you don't really have a
network to utilize right you have to
just send out emails send out resumes
just cold searching on the internet and
this can be a little painful so the
first major point of this video is that
when you're doing your cold search you
have to take really really really
special care and how you present
yourself so say you're just emailing and
applying to places online there's
someone else receiving all those
applications and they're making a yes or
no decision in like five or ten seconds
so you have like a five or 10 second
window to make a complete first
impression digitally which is kind of
crazy but what does it take for you to
get into the yes
Pyle and how do you present yourself to
make that happen so this video again
three tips on how to best present
yourself in the shortest amount of time
possible all right point number one is
always include a cover letter if you're
serious about a position at all you will
include some form of cover letter or
introduction about yourself if you don't
include a cover letter the very first
reaction from the recruiter and I
promise you this is the reaction the
very first reaction from recruiter is
going to be this person is too lazy
to write up anything so you don't want
to be that person it's easy to go on a
bunch of job portals and just blast your
resume out there's like ten different
job postings you just send your resume
to ten different ones and hope for the
best
that's easier right what's actually
harder is picking like four out of those
ten positions and actually writing a
real significant cover letter for each
one along with their resume that's hard
and that's what less people do but
that's what you need to do remember it's
still always quality over quantity you
don't want to blast your resume to ten
different software positions you want to
just pick four that you like write the
cover letters think about it reread
those positions carefully and send out
those four applications which have much
higher quality than if you just blast it
out writing the cover letter is also a
little tricky but my best tip for this
is probably just to keep it short and
sweet
and talk about the position the most
this is kind of like online dating right
when you send somebody a message and
online dating it's very bad to just talk
about yourself all the time right they
don't want to hear about you they can
always look up information about you
they want to hear about why you're a fit
for that position or why you're a fit
for the girl or something right so I see
a lot of cover letters where it's always
like me me me this is all about me and
actually that's the last thing
recruiters want to listen to what they
really want to hear is about their
position and why you're fit for that
position so that's what your cover
letter should focus on so what goes into
it just a short intro why you're fit for
a position and that's it don't include a
laundry list of
skills they can always look up those
skills on your LinkedIn profile right
there's no reason for you to include
those just keep the cover letter short
and sweet
prove that you read the position and I
promise you you're going to stand out in
like the top 1% of all applicants all
right that's point number one about
cover letters point number two is
choosing your words very carefully
making our first impression is always
like a really difficult thing in real
life and it's kind of even more
difficult in the internet or on the
digital world like how do you make a
first impression on the digital world
but your impression on the Internet is
pretty much all the words that you type
on the keyboard right the words that you
put in the profile the words that you
put in your cover letter the words that
you describe your job with on your
resume all those words are actually
making a first impression on other
people recruiters checking your resume
and your applications usually ignore
people that seem a little too
self-centered and this impression of
being self-centered actually comes
directly from how you describe yourself
and let me just give give you a few
examples
I completely refactor the backend of our
CRM system within three months of my
last job I overhauled our whole front
end with this new JavaScript framework
I'm a quick learner and I can pick up
anything really fast did you guys kind
of pick up on the tone of some of that
wording it's very kind of self-centered
it's right III me me me so actually you
might think it's natural to just sell
yourself and talk about yourself a lot
but actually it's a little
counterintuitive you don't want to give
off that impression it's better in my
opinion I think it's significantly
better if you give off the impression
that you're actually a more a
collaborative team player type of person
and let's just go through a few examples
of that at my last job my team and I
were able to introduce a brand new or M
into our back-end during my last
internship I spent a couple weeks
building this internal wiki to spread
knowledge across our company a little
more efficiently so do you guys see how
the tone of those phrases is a little
different than the tone of the more
self-centered phrases you want kind of
the first impression you give
with your words to be like I'm a team
player I'm very collaborative that's
like the first impression you want to
give when you guys hear phrases like
company culture what that really means
is that people with similar mindsets and
are similar wavelengths
they usually attract one another to be
honest you're less likely to hire you're
actually less likely to hang out with
people that are radically different from
you are right you'll probably only hire
someone who's like super different if
they feel a really really niche position
but most likely you're going to hire
people that you're driving with or you
guys have a similar point of view on
things so if you come off as
self-centered
you'll probably attract other
self-centered people or you'll probably
attract no people however if you come
off as humble and a team player you'll
attract people who value collaboration
value the team environment and that
might be what you're looking for and
that's probably what you need to be
shooting for if you're looking for a job
all right so enough about that closing
point is that anytime you're on your
keyboard writing stuff about yourself if
you're writing your profile or you're
writing that cover letter just just
think to yourself if someone I don't
know is reading this stuff I'm writing
what kind of impression am I giving them
third and last point that I just want to
make is to be very honest with your
skills if you're fresh out of college or
fresh out of this boot camp don't
pretend that you're a master of like
three different languages or five
different frameworks all right because
everyone knows you're not a master at
those things yet you're just a fresh
graduate the major point I want to make
in this video is that you don't really
want to oversell yourself because one
it's not really a good look and
recruiters can see right through it they
can see people that they know are trying
to upsell themselves and don't have the
skills to back it up so still I think
honesty is still the best policy and
even if you're a beginner just be honest
about your skill set first but include
more about how you have a good attitude
and how you can bring more things to the
table one example this could be like
hey I went to this boot camp and I've
been doing Android for the past four
months I still have a lot to learn but
I'm going to continue my android and
build that expertise within the next
year and I'm also dabbling in these
other frameworks so it shows that you're
a beginner it shows that you know where
you're at but it also shows that you're
trying to progress yourself all right
guys that's the end of the video just
three points I had to help you present
yourself better if you're doing a lot of
cold job
job hunting before I leave I just want
to say that obviously this video is
pretty highly opinionated I've been
looking at a lot of job applications
recently so that's why I'm thinking
about this stuff but these are kind of
the things I look for and other people
may or may not look for so just don't
take all these words as fact but
hopefully if you're looking for jobs
these things could be helpful just
remember to present yourself in the best
way possible
and it's really hard when it's all
through the internet right so for anyone
out there that's going through this best
to look hit me up with any questions if
you have any please like the video or
leave me a comment and I'll see everyone
next time all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
