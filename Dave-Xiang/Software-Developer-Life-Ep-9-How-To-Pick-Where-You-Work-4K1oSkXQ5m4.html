really well if you're from the states I
hope you had a nice Thanksgiving enjoyed
some good rest family time ate five
pounds ten pounds of Turkey if you're
not from the states I hope you enjoyed
watching some crazy videos of Black
Friday shoppers but anyways video for
this week continuing the series about
software developer life and we're gonna
talk about how to pick where you work
this video I'm gonna try to do it a
little differently here one personal
thing I did was that actually wrote up
less in my script usually I write out
like all the paragraphs today I kind of
wrote up bullet points so hopefully it's
gonna force me to freestyle a little bit
more but the structure of this video is
gonna be a little different instead of
me just telling you how to pick a job I
have five questions that I thought of
five questions that you could ask
yourself and the goal is if you ask
yourself these five questions try to
answer them it should lead you in the
right path to get a good job
alright so without further ado let's
start five questions about how to pick
your job all right before we get started
I think a prerequisite maybe a step zero
before these five step is that you need
to do a lot of introspection
before starting any of this like the
core of all this stuff is actually
introspection and what I mean by that is
you have to just to the best of your
ability and this is really hard but you
have to understand what you really want
so this is always hard and it's also
hard because it actually changes over
time the thing you want actually changes
over time but you still think it good at
uncovering it and that's kind of like
your own thing so this is really hard I
struggle with this I think everyone
struggles with this but before we even
get into these questions try to do just
a lot of introspection and figure out
like what you want right so anyone can
tell you anything but in the end it's
just up to you alright so anyways now -
question number one for real
first question to ask yourself is how
much this cash really mean to you all
right so let's take some notes so first
you just have to understand some of the
compensation differences between
different places you work
okay everyone asked about salary that's
one part of it but the first thing I
want to get clear or made clear is that
these these startup companies are really
hot I think all over the world but
everyone wants to work at a start-up
there's even TV shows about it but the
first thing to understand is that the
overall compensation your total
compensation is significantly different
between a start-up and a big company
like Microsoft so what exactly is
different but I guess the major way to
put it is that deep all in cash you get
at a big company this is just a lot more
so they do a couple things like 401k
matching they have stock purchasing
plans you'll probably make a higher base
salary they probably have cash so you
can get bonuses but the overall pile of
cash and I just call this all
compensation but that's greater always
greater at the bigger company alright so
if cash really means a lot to you you
should weigh the decision based on that
and for startups you'll just you'll
probably make a salary but a lot of the
incentive is in the equity in the
company right this is what everybody
kind of knows about like you owe an
expert of the company so it could grow
to this hypothetical number and that's
equity but that's not cash right so pull
pJAK hope that just all makes sense but
continuing on with that thought but the
reason why you should understand how why
cash is really important for you because
everyone should maintain a basic
standard of living not just you but it
also affects the people that are around
you right so what stage of life are you
in if you're just like a single person
maybe it's really easy if you
have like a pile of debt maybe it's a
little harder if you have like a wife
and a mortgage it gets harder if you
have like kids it even gets like crazy
right so like way your responsibilities
because all those responsibilities
dictate how much cash you really need so
ask yourself like how much cash do I
really need to support myself and to do
all the things that I need to do and
make a decision from that all right and
finally last point about this it's just
that you just need some amount of money
to live right you don't want to live to
frugally I would say that it's it's not
worth it to get that $300 a month
apartment this it might have rats in it
right like everyone has like a standard
of living and you should at least pay
and get enough money make enough money
to like reach some minimum standard
don't like skimp on that kind of stuff
alright because you don't wanna be
stressed out about like the rats in your
apartment you just want to be stressed
out about learning as much as you can
you don't want to think about that kind
of stuff if you can help it all right so
hopefully that makes sense last point I
want to make for this cash question is
that it's kind of an optimization
question right you can optimize for
different things you can optimize for
cash money just build it see that bank
account grow or this is kind of what I
like to do but I'm in a different
scenario but I like to actually optimize
for experience and learning so I'm not I
don't make huge tons of cash money I
probably if I really valued that a lot
more I could go get another job where
they would pay me a lot but what I'm
trying to do at this stage in my life
I'm just trying to optimize for
experience learning just keep that
learning thing going and try to
accumulate that as fast as possible
because honestly right now I don't have
too many responsibilities right I don't
I don't have a wife I don't a baby all
that crazy stuff so it depends on your
life but that's pretty much the cash
question so just ask yourself how much
cash do you really need and you know how
much do you value it
all right so that's enough of the first
question let's go on to number two okay
so let's start with question number two
and it's just getting a little more
technical but this is the question it's
how technically inclined are you and
what I mean by that is that are you
extremely technical and you really care
about that so let's just dive into that
a little more all right so like every
place you potentially work has a
different level of technical
requirements right like I would say that
just take Instagram for example right
the original version of Instagram
probably didn't take like
next-generation technology to build
right but if you look at Google X or
Microsoft Research or look over
self-driving cars those are actually
technically really advanced things so I
say this because I have a lot of friends
out there who like love to be on the
cutting edge of technical stuff and they
don't want to work on like Instagram or
like some kind of silly application they
want to work on like cutting-edge
virtual reality v3 self-driving cars so
one thing to ask yourself is like how
technically inclined are you and how
much do you really care because that
could actually dictate your job and to
be honest like the majority of positions
out there don't require you to be too
technical right I think let me just have
some notes here but like if you really
want to be super niche in tech there's
actually fewer jobs around that kind of
stuff like most jobs out there are
purely like solving a business problem
creating like a viable model like
helping someone out and just execution
and that execution part is just like
writing some software to like get it
done it doesn't have to be like
revolutionary so just ask yourself like
do you really care how technical you're
gonna be at your job if you don't really
care
you could work all sorts of places right
if you want to be on the cutting edge of
the latest and greatest stuff you might
have to work at
Google X research all right so just ask
yourself that question all right third
point I have the third point I have is
actually very very similar to point
number two but it's kind of with a
little spin so I just made it kind of a
separate point but let's just talk
through this is pretty pretty crazy now
I'm just going I'm trying to edit as
little eat as few times as possible
so if I fo don't get mad at me but this
is also gonna make my editing time go
down a lot so anyways back to point
number three so question number three to
ask yourself is are you more visionary
inclined or you're more execution
inclined and let's just talk about that
a little bit so I think the best way to
understand this is just via an example I
think everyone knows that the quit that
sexual be like super example of the
visionary is like Steve Jobs right
everyone knows that he wasn't that smart
he didn't execute he like got everyone
to execute for him but he was like the
visionary right so that's kind of that
spectrum and you should ask yourself
where are you on that spectrum are you
like a Steve Jobs visionary like this is
what's gonna happen in 500 years or are
you more like the Steve Wozniak
execution like I know process I can get
this stuff done all right so I think
everyone falls somewhere on that scale
and I think companies also fall within
that scale there are definitely more
like operational heavy companies and
they're more visionary companies but
actually from the business perspective
you really need both right you need to
be like visionary execution but I think
because this actually reflects a
personality I think a person can be a
visionary or can be heavily execution
based and that's also the same for a
company and one way I'd like to just
describe this is actually with my own
experience because I think I've worked
at two startups now that were
drastically drastically different in
this respect so
when I first moved to New York from
California I joined this startup trying
to create like a next generation mobile
product where you could like surf the
Internet much better so it's kind of the
basic premise was if you use this
product we built it could potentially
replace Chrome it would just be like a
crazy experience of the internet on your
phone so this is an example of something
that's really really visionary it's like
next-level stuff like someone just
thought of it you're not sure if someone
needs it like it doesn't really
represent a core business model but it's
just like this product out there that
you want to try to get to and you're
hoping that if you get to that level
it's gonna be something really good
right so like other examples of kind of
like I bet like visionary products I
mean like snapchat a lot of crazy
consumer apps that just take off you
know like it's less like business
operation is just more like we got to
build this thing and it's gonna work and
sometimes it does work and sometimes
it's so that's my first example of
something that's more on the visionary
side so now to give you guys an example
of something that's more execution it's
actually the current company I work at I
haven't talked with you guys about what
I'm currently doing but I'll do more of
that later but it's a garbage and
recycling company but I'm gonna use it
as an example so this is why this
company is actually heavily execution
based so it's drastically different from
what I was just that but pretty much
they were able to get a customer sell
something make some dollars before
building any tech because they're just
sales and operationally focused and it's
almost like a different mindset right
before they built anything like didn't
even have to launch an app they'd have
to build any kind of tech no code was
written and they got some dollars into
the business and that's why it's
differently every
thing is like execution focus and
operations so like a lot of the stuff we
build is to facilitate that like
facilitate the scale complement the
business make sure we can grow all that
stuff but actually I say that and it's
not exactly all good right we're really
execution focused but we need to move
more into like that visionary area
because like I said before you actually
need both to be successful you need like
like crazy execution like like tighten
the drum all that stuff and you need
some like Steve Jobs type of thinking so
we're trying to get to both but it's
just like that's my personal example of
being on both extremes so that was
really long but let's just wind it back
to the question but ask to yourself
personally to like ask yourself
personally do you think you're more
Steve Jobs like like visionary style do
you like thinking about new products do
you like thinking about new apps or are
you more like execution like you don't
have to think about it but once there's
an idea you can get it done so just
figure out where you are in that camp
and then align yourself appropriately to
a company culture that also potentially
fits them all right that's point number
three all right point number four kind
of gets into the your preference as a
software developer or your preference
and like kind of what you enjoy working
on and this is the question I have
are you more expertise inclined or you
jack-of-all-trades inclined alright so I
think the best way to explain these
concepts is just give more examples so I
have one friend who I think is like a
super good at game development so he is
like on the expertise level he knows he
loves game development he reads about it
and that's what he does he keeps pushing
the limits of that right so it's
actually very different from me because
I'm more of the jack-of-all-trades type
but everyone should ask themselves what
are you more inclined to work on like do
you love this one thing like the example
I just gave my friend
he loves game development like that's
what he does so I'm like that's totally
cool there's always positions for that
like he works he works at a sick company
like if you're highly have high
expertise in one area there's always
gonna be position for you all right so
just ask yourself that like do you want
to be very niche and like just focus on
one area like maybe you love computer
security just for an example right if
you love computer security that's all
you do that's all that you study that
like you study how what hackers do if
that's all you enjoy doing
there's a position out there for you but
some people are not like that like me
personally I'm actually more of a I
guess a jack-of-all-trades I kind of
like I don't get so deep into something
from really long I kind of like work on
many different parts I guess that's how
I have been just working on all sorts of
different parts from hardware to
software different types of software all
that stuff but that's just me right so
it's kind of different sides of the
spectrum super expertise in one area or
kind of like a little bit of everything
so I think you know what you're inclined
to do but just ask yourself like do you
really love something so much that's all
you want to do already kind of want to
dabble in a lot of stuff so so that's a
good example hopefully that describes
some of that but let me just also relate
that back to company stuff a little bit
all right so
this goes back to the startup versus big
company type of question but one major
dynamic of a big company versus a
startup company is like who can do
better in different environments right
so I think for a small company like when
there's very very few people it's
actually much better to be more flexible
because you got to do a lot of different
stuff right there's just less people to
do things so small companies startups
like less than 50 people it's actually I
think it's actually better to be much
more flexible in your software skills
right because you might need so many
different things like set up that
computer setup that app let's start
mobile app let's like like put in that
framework let's do some back and work
security so you got to do like all sorts
of stuff let's contrast that to a big
company right if you joined Google
you're working on this specific feature
if you joined Google you're working on
like a button on their Google+ profile
page so it's so specific you'll work on
a specific feature and most likely
they're gonna recruit you for like a
specific skill set so it's also kind of
dynamic like if you're a really super
expertise you probably are gonna join a
more well-established company where they
know they need your expertise right most
startups they don't even know what they
need to build because they're so new and
when you don't even know who you're
gonna hire for like you can't hire like
an insane game developer if you don't
even know that you want to make a game
so I think that's this is my opinion on
this matter but like if you're a little
more flexible I think you're catered a
little bit more towards kind of a
startup feel where it's smaller you do
more things that's kind of why I've
enjoyed working in startups I've worked
at big companies before so I kind of
know what it's like but if you really
are expert expert at something you're
probably gonna flourish at like a very
niche job at a big company all right so
this is a couple of examples don't take
my word you know as fact it's just my
opinion but
if we just wrap up to it this is much
more of like you introspecting your
technical like preference right do you
want to just be an expert or do you want
to get good at or you want to get like
okay and many different things and just
ask yourself that alright last question
this is question number five this is
actually a little more fun because I
have much less script here to read from
so actually usually when I was making my
videos I would write up all the scripts
that night before in like paragraph form
and I would actually try to read the
paragraphs a little bit this time I just
have a couple bullet points so I'm just
trying to hit all the bullet points try
to sound reasonable and reduce editing
time so anyways question number five
this is the fifth and last question that
I think you should ask yourself but do
you care about the industry you work in
and what does that mean so like there's
a lot of potential places to work right
and some people care a little
differently than like other people so
what example is that like do you do for
example I know a couple people that
really want to like help Society right
they want to work on something that
really helps a really significant
problem and they just want to really
help they don't want to work on like
snapchat version two or something like
like an alcohol delivery app right like
they're like alcohol delivery that's
bullshit like they really want to work
on something that actually helps
something you know like maybe makes a
good example but like healthcare stuff
education technology they want to work
on thumbs some things that really help a
potential problem and they don't want to
work on some whatever apps and let me
tell you if if you've ever like talked
with startups there's so many startups
doing like some bullshit type of ideas
like there's a start-up in San Francisco
my friend told me but their whole
company I think it went out of business
but their whole company was like
reserving car spaces for rich people so
it's like you're going to the city
parking is a bitch and then someone
you'll pay someone to see
there and reserve it for you and like
it's a problem for I know San Francisco
people that like to park in the city but
it's also like a bullshit idea so and
some people are okay with that like just
ask yourself do you care about the real
industry you work in and if you don't
care you could work wherever you want
like if you want to just maybe work at
it like a get rich type of company like
get rich fast type of company maybe
you'll work at some kind of bullshit
company where you know there'll be some
fast returns or if you're really like
humanitarian if you find yourself always
trying to like help people you're not
gonna want to work on like alcohol
delivery you're gonna want to work on
something more substantial so and
industry like how cool it is and when I
say how cool it is I mean if it's
bullshit or not so ask yourself like do
you have any kind of affinity towards
industries because as a software
developer you is kind of fun because you
could work in any single industry
you're not like silo to an industry
right you could work in healthcare
financial tech real estate ecommerce
education technology like every single
industry can potentially use software
that's why it's really cool so if you
have an affinity for you really and like
one like say you really like education
you like you like teachers you like like
teaching kids all that stuff if that's
the case you might choose to work at a
company that's doing some kind of tech
around education so but also if you
don't care about what's the industry at
all if this is not what you care about
then this question probably doesn't even
make sense right so just ask yourself do
you really care where you work like if
you want to work at alcohol delivery and
they're paying you like a million
dollars that's fine but you're working
on alcohol delivery so alright guys
that's the end of the video those are
just five questions I'm gonna keep all
five questions up here on this side so
you can just read them ask yourself them
periodically and this is kind of for if
you're like unhappy your job you're
looking for the next new opportunity or
you're in school looking for an
internship or just any opportunity you
Jews just like try to think as much as
you can about what you really want and
it's really hard right like if you're
like a school if you're a school your
student it's almost impossible I had no
idea I still don't have any idea what I
really really truly want but you'll just
start uncovering it over time so try
your best just think about stuff and
hear about what you really want and it
should make all this decision-making
much easier alright and I hope these
five questions bring out something and
what you really want to do so hope it
was helpful please leave me a comment
write me an email give me a thumbs up if
you enjoyed the video and I'll see
everyone next week all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
