want to kind of give it some kind of
structure so you guys know what I'm
talking about at least a little bit
every vlog I do this is my very first
one but I'm gonna try to just answer
five questions and I wrote the questions
down five questions I want to answer our
Who am I what I'm doing why I'm doing
this what I enjoy doing and what am i up
to now so I watch some youtube vlogging
tips look at the camera okay I just
found out that I guess everyone finds
herself but you definitely sound nothing
like what you think you sound like some
really different alright let's get
started my name's Dave David I'm an
american-born Chinese I was born in
Boston live there most of my life but I
gonna say hey go right now so I'm
starting a vlog and and this is it
alright that's an easy question why I'm
starting a blog I don't know why just
just because you can without YouTube for
a long time now I haven't dieting with
it I had a blog but I don't know I just
feel like talking to the camera
something new I never tried it before
but I don't know if people would like it
but I don't care what everyone else
thinks
I'm just kidding at least I can look
back on this five years ten years and
see what I was up to but I just do this
for myself for now saw was the best
thing to do right what do I enjoy doing
so I guess kind of like my hobbies give
you guys a background of what I do I
dance a lot I've been doing it since
late 2002 so yeah it's been a while I'll
definitely talk more about that another
post I'll make later but yeah I love it
I'm an engineer I got a degree in
Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon
so you know
Pittsburgh that's my day job so also
been doing that for really long and I
enjoy it too I do it's my job and I I'm
fortunate enough to actually like my job
so that's good
under San Diego I moved from Boston here
in 2010 I'm dancing out here still of
course I'll be dancing as long as
possible probably talk about that later
so I'm up here I work at a company
called Qualcomm it's a
telecommunications company we work on
cell phones so we make chips inside cell
phones I'll talk about that later
so I work it's a nine-to-five job like
40 hours a week sometimes a little more
when I get home I practice with my crew
there's a lot more I wanted to
accomplish in breaking my break in life
and so I'm just working on that to wrap
up I just thought this vlog would be a
good idea or just something to have I'm
gonna share it and I don't know people
are gonna like it but it's 2012 so might
as well make a youtube video of this I'm
gonna make an account just for this vlog
so we'll see how that does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
