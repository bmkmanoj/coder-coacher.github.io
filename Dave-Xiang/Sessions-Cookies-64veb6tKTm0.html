pseudo pseudo Tech video today and we're
going to talk about something really
really important about the internet
specifically sessions and cookies so if
you want to understand the internet you
have to understand what those two words
mean and that's the purpose of this
video today if you haven't seen the
first video on HTTP basics please watch
that first
remember that HTTP is a stateless
protocol and if that sentence doesn't
make sense to you just check that out
real quick and come back so sessions
cookies fundamental stuff everyone
should understand this and let's do it I
like coffee you probably like coffee I
go to Starbucks maybe twice a week right
now I have a very stateless interaction
with Starbucks every time I go I check
out the menu ordered my drink they make
me my drink I pay them a little bit and
I get it and I'm happy if I go back
three days later they don't really
remember what I ordered three days ago
right I'll just order again look at the
menu again and this time I'll just get a
latte so every single interaction I have
is stateless with Starbucks go in order
get my coffee so hope that's clear
let's just think about how would we
design a system so our interactions with
Starbucks could be a little more
stateful and what does that mean like
how could Starbucks remember what I
ordered last time or how could they
remember my 10 favorite drinks how would
you design a system like that
lucky for us Starbucks has already
solved this problem and the way they
solve it is exactly how sessions and
cookies work on the internet so the way
they've solved it is they give you a
Starbucks card that you carry with you
and what that Starbucks card actually
does is give you a very stateful
interaction with Starbucks and we're
going to talk through that so what
exactly is a Starbucks card anyways this
is not a real Starbucks card it's just a
card that I have but what does this
really mean this thing right here
actually means two different things
right when you carry this card around
this is your identification
four star books right but for Starbucks
they've already made an account for you
to track all your stuff like the last
drink you ordered your top ten favorite
chocolate drinks two parts right this is
what you carry around your
identification but it matches a thing on
the Starbucks server where they're
tracking all your info so for this whole
example this whole example is kind of
just analogous to the internet right I'm
actually the client ordering my drinks
at Starbucks I'm like a web browser for
the internet and Starbucks is kind of
like a web server servicing my request
so this ID card the ID card that you
carry with you this identification that
the client always carries that's called
a cookie so if we have our cookie right
the opposite thing to make this cookie
even useful is the session which lives
on the server so Starbucks is tracking a
lot of different sessions for all their
different coffee drinkers so why this
cookie is important because it's used to
match up with the right session this is
my identification so Starbucks knows to
retrieve my session hope that made sense
all right just going to repeat myself
again to make it extra extra clear I'm
the client Starbucks is a server this
identification card or cookie is always
client-side if you open up your browser
if you have chrome developer tools or
anything you can see every single cookie
that your browser is saved for all the
different websites you visited so it's
always client-side and the session is
sometimes but not always server-side if
I go to Starbucks I'm going to show them
this first right I'm going to show them
my identification so they can get
whatever whatever information they need
about me it's the same thing with web
browsers every single HTTP request made
by your browser sends a cookie along so
the server can do something smart with
it all right so I hope everyone's slowly
digesting this but you can see how the
Starbucks card and Starbucks tracking my
favorite drinks that's kind of giving
statefulness to my interaction with
Starbucks right at the beginning of the
video I told
my interaction with stateless order
drink on Monday order drink on Tuesday
order drink on Wednesday but once I have
statefulness my experience gets much
better hopefully this is the most
important sentence to understand and if
you understand this sentence now you
understand sessions and cookies sessions
and cookies are what makes HTTP stateful
I'll just I'll just say it one more time
- maybe I'll sink in but remember from
the first video HTTP is naturally a
stateless protocol sessions and cookies
make it stateful okay guys one last note
before we wrap it up but as you said
cookies always client-side remember that
when you hear the word cookie just think
client-side and the browser is handling
your cookies right but I mentioned
earlier that sessions where our sessions
stored normally they're stored on the
server but actually sometimes some
applications actually choose to store
session information on the client as
well and let's just talk about that real
quick for any web developers out there
I'm sure you know what rails is probably
one of the top if not the most popular
web framework in existence or maybe
right now but by default if you use the
latest rails they actually store the
session on the client by default and
this is a little different from what's
conventional because conventionally
sessions have always been stored on the
server what's what's the advantage of
storing session information on the
client well the one major thing that it
provides is that it's really really fast
right if your session information is on
the server you have to present this
first the server does a lookup in its
database of all your stuff and it gives
you your 10 favorite drinks but if the
session is stored on this client it's
actually right there always right it's
just really fast so one good thing about
storing sessions client-side is that
it's really fast now the main
disadvantage of storing session
information on the client side is lack
of space right lack of space if you
store a session with the cookie you only
get 4 kilobytes of space it
like if you have a really complicated
stateful logic like maybe you're
tracking shopping cart your preferences
all this fancy stuff and it can't fit
here then you would have to actually put
all that stateful information on the
server alright guys that's it end of the
video
hopefully it was intuitive to understand
if you ever come across these terms
before I would just think back to the
Starbucks analogy getting a Starbucks
card to use at Starbucks is just like
using a cookie and presenting it to a
website alright so sessions cookies
that's what makes the internet stateful
and you have to understand what those
two things are so I hope this video was
helpful please like comment subscribe
all that stuff ask me any questions in
the comments and have a great week
alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
