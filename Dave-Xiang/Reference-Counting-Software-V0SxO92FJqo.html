doing really well relaxing it's a
three-day weekend here in the States we
have Labor Day so everyone's chilling
relaxing Labor Day means no labor no
working so that's pretty cool we're all
relaxing I don't have any of my camera
equipment this weekend so decided to do
quick screencast video on a pretty
interesting topic reference counting if
you guys have heard about this it's like
a pretty cool programming / software
technique this video is going to be a
little bit technical if you're
interested in learning about what this
means I have some stuff written out and
we're going to go over this if you don't
give an F what this means go go relax
and enjoy your labor day but you know
reference counting pretty cool technique
whole purpose of the screencast is to go
over it and hope you enjoy it alright so
let's just start what is reference
counting pretty much this is a technique
to help programs manage their memory
manage their memory so what does that
mean you guys can just imagine a program
like chrome right for some programs
maybe the memory is very static you know
I have 10 megabytes allocate 10
megabytes I know I need 10 megabytes and
that's fine right but for most cases
when its user driven the memory is very
dynamic so I'm on Chrome i just opened
up look at look at all these tabs i'm
opening up right just by doing that I'm
requiring this program to allocate more
memory for me so it's very dynamic right
the programmer doesn't know how many
times I'm going to click new tab so
that's what I'm talking about memory
management is very tricky sometimes
because it's very dynamic and one way to
help manage all that dynamic behavior
really well this would do these memory
management techniques and one of those
techniques this reference counting so
reference counting it tracks the
references pointers or handles these are
actually kind of synonymous words but
i'm going to use references more because
it's kind of a catch-all but it tracks
the references to end
object and this can potentially make
memory management much more automatic so
I have an example written up and I
thought about it a little bit to go over
what this really means so if this
doesn't quite make sense yet it will
make sense I hope but what we're doing
is tracking the references to any object
and have a couple links up here just for
some reading if an iOS objective-c
slipped I know they have this whole
framework / system called automatic
reference counting which is a pretty
cool read if you've developed inside
this platform before i'm sure you've
learned about this inside c++ actually
c++ 11 and beyond there's the concept of
shared pointers and weak pointers and
this also does reference counting under
the hood so these two links could be
some good reading because what I'm going
to tell you is very kind of a brief
overview it's not going to be like the
guts of reference counting so read those
when you have time but let's just keep
going but first before we get started I
just want to have a quick link up here
to my object oriented video which
actually i'm going to use as an example
so if you haven't watched this video
where i try to explain object-oriented
programming please just go watch that
right now as a refresher all right and
then just come back to it but assuming
we watch that video one of the key like
most basic concepts in object-oriented
programming is this idea of composition
and I gave a real-world example of a
kitchen which is pretty easy to
understand like a kitchen is composed of
many different types of things like a
sink of fridge a kitchen but you can
just kind of see how this makes
intuitive sense right if we have a
kitchen object it would be composed of
many other objects to make the kitchen
itself work sink fridge chef other stuff
now this is just a really basic example
of composition and composition is one of
those times where we always have
references so that's where these two
concepts are kind of tying together
right object-oriented concept the
composition is a really good example of
where there's references
the kitchen has a sink it has a fridge
it has a chef it's just another way of
saying the kitchen is actually
referencing referencing the sink the
fridge and the chef it might have a
pointer to oat it might have a pointer
to those objects if we're and see if
we're in like C++ and might have of
references of those objects but I'm
going to use the word reference for the
rest of the video but hopefully it's
really really clear that the concept and
idea of composition directly correlates
the references right kitchen composed of
sync fridge chef a kitchen has a
reference to a sink fridge and a chef
alright so hope that's clear let's just
keep moving so if we keep going what is
this reference counting all about so
pretty much what from earlier if you
remember reference counting is tracking
the reference count for any particular
object and let's just take our first
example out of a kitchen so each object
counts the number of references to
itself kind of like this so if we have a
kitchen here there's going to be a
different reference count for sink
fridge and chef they each maintain their
own reference count and what if what
does that really mean so let's just take
the sink as an example the kitchen is
referencing the sink so at some point in
time kitchen actually allocated the sink
and is keeping a reference to it maybe
it's keeping a pointer to the sink we in
increment sinks reference count by one
when this happens so what does this
really mean from sinks perspective like
what is sink thinking so this blue text
is like a sink okay it's kind of weird
but what's up this is sink here right
now there is one thing referencing me
the kitchen and my reference count is 1
so hopefully that's also pretty easy to
understand kitchen is referencing sink
and each individual object is actually
tracked tracking that count so the sink
tracks that there's only one thing
referencing itself at this point in time
so what actually happens when we destroy
the kitchen
we made the kitchen and when and then
made all these objects but eventually
we're going to have to destroy the
kitchen and before we get into any
details I hope it just makes intuitive
sense that if the kitchen is destroyed
we're not going to need the sink anymore
right if the kitchen goes away the sink
the fridge the chef they might as well
go away to right that's what should
happen intuitively but let's break down
how that actually works automatically or
programmatically okay and that's what
reference counting is all about how does
this work programmatically so before the
kitchen is deleted the reference count
kind of looks like this right kitchen
has a sink fridge chef and the reference
count is just one each of them has a
count of one at the moment the moment
the kitchen is destroyed that's one less
reference for these three objects and
their reference count is going to get
decremented decremented meaning minus
one so it was one before if it gets
decremented it's going to go down to
zero all right what did I right here I'm
not saying exactly what I wrote but the
kitchen was referencing the sink so when
it goes away that sinks reference count
was one and it goes to zero and once
this special number goes to zero
something very special happens all right
so this is the sink talking again right
so sink here the number of things that
are using me has changed right now there
are 0 things referencing me and once
this happens once sink one sink kind of
acknowledges that there's zero things
using sink at the moment they can
actually delete itself like nothing's
referencing me anymore so nothing else
needs me now I'm going to destroy myself
and restore some resources okay so hope
that example made sense to everyone once
the kitchen is destroyed all everything
is composed of the sink the fridge and
chef they're going to get destroyed
because their reference count reaches
zero so I have one more example and
hopefully it ties some more things
together
so I have another example here just to
kind of solidify this idea now we have
two kitchens all right kitchen a kitchen
be but the tricky thing here or the only
thing that's different here is we're
sharing a chef object Joe the chef and
it's kind of global so kitchen a sink a
fridge a but it has Joe the chef's
kitchen be sink be fridge be but it
shares Joe the chef so hopefully this
makes sense we just double the kitchens
and we're sharing Joe so based on what I
just said this is the reference count
and it should make sense to you all
right kitchenaid a sink a has a
reference count of one obviously because
only kitchen days using sink a Joe the
chef has a reference count of two okay
and hopefully this makes sense because
both kitchens are using Joe or both
kitchens are referencing Joe so his
reference count is two right now almost
everything else everything besides Joe
is exactly the same so just digest this
a little bit digest this a little bit
and this is really important all right
this reference count of two actually
makes this example not trivial so let's
just destroy kitchen be first all right
we're going to destroy kitchen be so
this is the reference count of kitchen
beat after we destroyed all right we
don't need sink be or fridge be anymore
obviously the reference count was one
it's going to go down to zero because
it's decremented and just like our old
example those things are going to get
destroyed simple right but what about
Joe the chef Joe the chef's reference
count was two but now it's going to be
decremented by one because kitchen be
was destroyed but we can't destroy
joliet right because kitchen a is still
using him that reference count of one
pretty much means something else is
using you and we can't kill you yet so
more strange blue text here but hey I'm
Joe now there's one thing instead of two
things referencing me I can't get
destroyed yet so now I think you guys
might know where the examples going but
it
we destroyed kitchen a those reference
counts get destroyed decremented excuse
me those reference counts get
decremented again and there's at this
point nothing is referencing jodha chef
anymore once the kitchen a goes that one
this one from up here is going to go to
zero and once all these objects go to
zero they will all be destroyed all
right so that's one slightly a little
trivial but still slightly non-trivial
how reference counting works across one
shared global object which was Joe in
this case so hopefully that was pretty
cool I'm gonna wrap up the video here
small homework not really hard just
something to think about something for
everyone to think about but the question
I would pose is what about cyclical
references and this usually happens if
what happens if kitchen references a
sink but the sink also references the
kitchen and this is kind of like a
one-to-one cyclical references but you
can imagine how when things get
complicated you can unknowingly make
these things and these are really tricky
things so this kind of this kind of
problem it's solved by this idea called
weak references this whole video we just
talked about I guess there's strong
references all right an objective-c
they're called strong versus weak C++
it's shared versus weak but the ideas
are very similar so I would if you're
interested in learning about this even
further read about how to solve cyclical
reference counting via weak references
and both these languages have different
techniques or it's actually the same
technique they just call them different
things so just go read about it alright
guys so that's the end of the video
slightly technical video now sorry
wasn't thought out too much I whipped up
this document in like 10 minutes but
hopefully I just wanted to make a quick
video put it out there so there's
something to watch this week hope you
guys enjoy it please leave me any
questions about this topic reference
counting pretty cool topic spin around
for a while it's nothing new but it's
good to understand
alright so I hope everyone has a great
week and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
