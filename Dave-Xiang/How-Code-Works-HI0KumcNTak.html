today I'm going to make this video on
how a computer program actually runs can
you please explain how the electricity
going through the computer turns into
code and how code turns into electricity
that would be awesome
first of all this is an insane question
there's so so so much stuff that happens
in between code and electricity that
it's just answering something like this
would probably take a full college
curriculum in computer systems and
computer science or plan B is to watch
me explain it to you on YouTube so
alright so in this video we're going to
trace the life cycle of a really simple
computer program and how it runs through
your computer from start to finish the
only job of this program is to print
hello on the screen we're going to start
from the time computer programmer writes
this thing to when it finishes executing
on computer and you see that message
there's going to be a ton of stuff
that's going on in this video and
everything is really really big picture
ideas if anything I say or any word I
mentioned doesn't quite make sense to
you just pause the video and go to the
library at Google and look up that word
alright let's do it alright first of all
just check out this program right here
and it starts out his life as just a
simple source file a real person not a
robot went to their computer and type
this once they're finished writing this
program they'll save it using their
favorite editor and this source file is
going to be saved on your computer this
file itself is just a sequence of ones
and zeros which represent all the text
values that you
typed in on the keyboard literally the
fits represent the pound sign I and Cl
alright so quick aside on files bits
bytes and all that jazz
bits are organized into eight big chunks
called bytes a file is literally just a
sequence of bytes nothing more nothing
less
in fact everything you can think of is
represented by bytes from files to
programs running in memory to data
flowing across the network everything is
once and zeros the only thing that
distinguishes different data is the
context in which we view them in
different context the same exact
sequence of ones and zeros can be a
string a number or even mean a really
intricate machine instruction it's just
a matter of perspective and context so
in the code source file that we just
wrote each byte has a value that
actually represents a text character
like ABCD usually when the characters in
the file are human readable like you or
me can read them we call those text and
files in all other files which aren't
really human readable we call those
binary files and if we open them up you
would have no idea what they're doing
just by looking at them right now the
hello file is a source file because some
human wrote it and we can read it but
that's not the type of file that a
computer would understand now we have to
use other programs whose job it is to
translate source files into machine
understandable files otherwise known as
machine level code
this whole process which I'm kind of
glossing over is called compilation what
compilation essentially does is
translate human readable files to
machine level instructions it then
usually packages up those instructions
into another file which is called an
executable file or a lot of people just
call them executables for short
once the compilation is done it usually
saves this executable file somewhere
onto our computer remember this
executable file is on disk right now
it's not a memory it's not a ram and we
haven't run it yet all we've done is do
this translation part and now we eat
some ways execute this program all right
so we have an executable so how do we
run it one way to execute a program is
to use another program which is called a
shell if you don't know what a shell is
right now just google it real quick it's
the matrix like thing where you type and
magic happens the shell is actually
another computer program written by
another programmer and it's a
command-line interpreter there's a cool
line a command line which prompts you to
type in things once you type in special
commands this shell interprets them and
executes them for you pretty simple
right there are a bunch of built-in
default shell commands that do really
cool things if you type something into
the show and it's not one of its
built-in commands that it already knows
it assumes you're typing in a custom
executable file that you want to execute
now there's going to be a lot of crazy
hardware details that are going to come
into play the shell program interacts a
little bit with the keyboard so it knows
how to parse your keystrokes and display
them free also the program exists on
your disk right now so you know that in
order for it to be run by the processor
it needs to be
moved into membrane and there's also
special hardware to do that so we have
an executable file which is called hello
for example and we're going to type
hello into the shell and press Enter we
physically press Enter with our finger
okay let's take a quick step back
remember how I told you processes are
really dumb but powerful processor
pretty much execute instruction blindly
it just does what it's called so how
does the processor know what
instructions to execute at any point of
time this part is managed by the
operating system remember at any one
point in time you have a lot of
processes running on your computer and
the operating system is management it's
also telling the processor which process
it has to run at any point in time all
right now this is a really important
point to try to digest when a process is
running on your computer the operating
system gives it the illusion that it's
the only process that's running so if
the computer is one big house the
operating system gives each process the
idea that it's the only one in that
house it has exclusive use of the
processor it has exclusive use of the
memory and other resources in reality
though we know that this isn't the case
there's tons of processes running at any
point in time
okay so major takeaway from that is that
when a processor runs the OS is really
smart enough to give that one process
the illusion that is the only guy in the
house all right now let's go back to our
shell program and what we're trying to
run which is this simple hello
- so as I said before the shell program
is actually another process and it's
another application which is already
running so when you're getting ready to
type your command you have to realize
that the shell process has already
started we have the shell process
running first and once we hit that Enter
key we're going to start running the
hello executable that we wrote once we
hit Enter the shell program is going to
honor our request and ask the operating
system to transfer control to the hello
program from the shell program so how
exactly is this switching going to
happen well that's another job of the
operating system in order for the
operating system to switch from the
shell to the hello program it has to do
this thing called context switching
right before the OS decides to switch
from the shell process to the hello
process it has to save the entire state
or context that the shell program was
running it because we're going to have
to come back to that later it then
creates a new hello process with a brand
new context and gets ready to execute
that there are some setup steps and we
have to tell the processor and some
software that restarting of the new
process and that's going to happen all
before we start executing hello
so our Hello program is pretty short and
it's going to finish pretty quickly all
it does is print out hello right so the
operating system recognizes that it came
from the shell process
so once Hello is done it's going to
transfer control back to our show
remember how we saved all that context
before we switch to Hello that context
is just restored so the shell is exactly
in the same place as it was before we
started it's just waiting for you to
type more commands and do more things
this whole system of context switching
which happens a lot just context
switching in and out of different
processes takes a lot of work from both
hardware and software they work together
to make that happen and it's all working
under the hood for you okay so that's
recap real quick we typed Hello and we
press ENTER remember a processor can
only execute instructions that are in
memory first so one of the first steps
we have to do is move our program and
all its data from disk into main memory
or ring the operating system did a
context switched from the shell process
to our hello process that ran the full
hello process we saw our cool text and
we switch back to the show and ladies
and gentlemen the whole hello world
executable that we wrote has just run in
its entirety okay so let's go back to
processors a little bit right now
remember I said processors are always
executing instructions in memory there's
always executing it has this special
piece of memory or register which is
called a program counter and almost
every single processor has this special
program
what the program counter really does is
point to different instructions in
memory whatever the program counter is
pointing to the processor will execute
that instruction and then update the
program counter and it's going to point
to a new one this is pretty much all the
processor does from the time your
computer turns on to the time it turns
off all the processor is doing is
exactly executing the machine
instructions that the program counter is
pointing to it's all it does now the
processor itself is made up of a lot of
different hardware components a lot of
different hardware components go into
that little little square now if you dig
really really deep into those hardware
components all you'll find is really
intricately made out pieces of metal and
what do you think flows through that
metal electricity so pretty much when
you write custom software and you're
instructing the processor to do
different things you're altering the
flow of electricity through those
intricate layers of metal so what I just
tried to do is explain how code that you
might type turns into electricity that
flows through your computer code to
electricity what all right so that was a
crazy like 10,000 100,000 foot view of
the whole lifecycle of a program as it
runs through your computer
remember every single component of this
big process that we just talked about it
from compilation to context wishing to
processes thinking the only one in the
house they go way way way deeper so
we're trying to understand big
complicated systems like computers and
not only computers but this goes to like
anything the world but it's usually too
difficult to know every single level of
every single process in super detail it
doesn't have to be related to
engineering but where you're really
responsible for is at least being
somewhat knowledgeable and having the
foundation of knowing what the basics of
each trouble do you don't have to be a
master of every single part of the stack
in a computer but you have to be
articulate enough to know at least what
its responsibilities are so not only in
two computers you know this just to life
and stuff all right guys so I'm going to
wrap up the video here a lot of really
big picture ideas but hopefully it gave
you a little taste of what happens when
you actually run these programs on your
computer if you have any questions just
leave a comment here and I'll respond if
there's any part of video that didn't
really quite make sense
just ask me I'll try to make another
video or just answer your questions
directly so hope you enjoyed it and have
a good rest of the day all right please
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
