really well as usual video for this week
is going to be a little bit of a story
story time kind of video it's another
popular question that I've been asked in
the comments itself but it's kind of how
I've made various switches throughout my
career so I haven't had a career that's
too long you know I started working at
in 2010 so it's been seven or eight
years it's not crazy long but I have
been through a few kind of significant
things at least for me so a few people
have asked you know what have you gone
through how to do switch positions over
time and I thought it'd be pretty cool
if I just shared that story a little bit
more in depth in this video and
hopefully some of the stuff I've been
through you guys can relate to it and it
can help with whatever you might be
going through alright so I thought of
three three major kind of inflection
points in my career so far since I
started working in 2010 I hope they're
more reflection points but if I could
mean if I had to choose the top three
these are going to be them what I mean
by inflection point is kind of just a
significant moment in my life path where
things started to change
alright and I copied the words
inflection point from another book
there's this really good book by Andy
Grove I'll put a link in the description
but he wrote a book called only the
paranoid survive where he talks about
company and career inflection points and
if you guys don't know Andy Grove he
passed away last year but he was the CEO
of Intel for a long period of time he's
a legend he Intel is like one of the
most fundamental crazy important
companies of all time so i'll have a
link for that book and i highly
recommend anyone check that up so
anyways so three inflection points for
my career personally and i'm hopefully
going to tie in a couple lessons i
learned and bits of advice that
hopefully are helpful alright so what
are the three inflection points but let
me just list them off real quick
but the first one it's going to be when
i went from super super low level
software to high level software that's
the
first one the second one is high-level
software into startups or corporate into
startups and the third or final
selection point is from startup to
different startup
all right so without further ado let's
just get into the details so before we
get into these career inflection points
there's actually like a inflection zero
that I want to talk about so that
inflection point is actually right in
between working in school so a ton of
stuff happened during college during
school and then there's also a big
inflection point there when it all
switched to kind of professional work so
before we get into those professional
pivot points for me let's talk a little
bit about what it was like just during
school to summarize what it felt like
trying to get a job at the end of school
I can summarize it in like one sentence
it should take what you can get there
are always a few select people like the
5% the 1% the top students that could
really be choosers I always call them
choosers because they could really
choose exactly where they wanted to work
because they were so good like they had
offers from Amazon Microsoft Facebook
like the top companies we're all
competing for a certain select group of
really high level students but the
majority of people aren't in that group
so how people can choose where they're
going to work like I'm going to use I'm
going to choose my Google offer over my
Microsoft offer well good for you
that's cool but the vast majority of us
weren't really choosers I wasn't really
a chooser a lot of my friends weren't
for us it was really just take what we
can get like take the best opportunity
that is thrown at us and we can't really
like choose the option between Facebook
or Amazon so let me just describe to CMU
culture a little bit it might be
different now but back when I went to
CMU like 2005 to 2009 they did not
really focus on entrepreneurship so they
didn't focus on startups they didn't
talk about any of that stuff you know
they didn't focus on the up-and-coming
companies but all these focus on
everything you're judged on is like how
good of a company
you could work at after college so the
people that got into like the googles
were much better than the people that
got into like lesser companies but so
it's either you work for a brand name
company you work for
not so brand name company a lot of
people wanted to finance and a lot of
people went into government contracting
work like when you work on radars and
missiles I think the major thing I
learned during this time period is that
just you have to manage your
expectations really well when you're
really fresh or doing something
completely new very few people have the
ability to kind of choose exactly their
path of where they want to go
I was always stressed out just I was
overly stressed out at the time just
because everyone else next to me was
getting better job offers at better
companies that I couldn't get so that
was stressing me out and my expectation
for myself was that I should be at that
level but actually the thing I learned
just later on is that always manage the
expectations just for yourself when
you're really new you don't have the
ability to choose exactly your path you
really have to take what you can get
sometimes and just be grateful it's
always a blessing if you can get
something so don't say your expectations
too high always keep a level and don't
compare yourself level with a lot of
other people so a lot of you might be
thinking okay do you already work at
Qualcomm that's a great company you're
complaining about working there rather
than working at Google like you're quit
being a bitch like you already got a
really great job what I have to say for
that is that even though that's true I'm
super grateful for having being able to
work at Qualcomm which is like a great
fortune 500 company or whatever but
regardless of that I think the core of
it is always relative right you can make
any you can be at any position in life
and things that you can get versus
things that you don't get
it's all relative and it all kind of
hurts people the same way so don't be
too quick to judge people just because
they're upset over some outcome their
life's like you might think someone's an
asshole when they have like a Porsche
and they really want a Ferrari but
that's just relative for
then right from an outsider they might
seem like an asshole but in that
person's world which is actually what
matters for their mind it's all relative
so like I'm complaining a little bit
here about how I was stressing of not
getting to work at Google l should have
to go at Qualcomm which is sub tier but
all this stuff is relative alright so
just keep that in mind when you're kind
of comparing different people's
circumstances
all right so finally that was a really
long intro but finally I want to get
into these three inflection points I had
during my career I want to talk about
the first one that was they're all
important so let's just talk about the
first one the first inflection point I
had was when I went from really really
low level software to working on some
high level software so this is like
working in C always just writing
sequential level boring C code
moving up to C++ and some higher level
software design so there's two points
two major points which led me to switch
jobs like this at the time one is that I
was really curious to understand what
kind of real software was about because
the stuff I was doing was really really
low-level some people might not even
considered it real software development
it's still level and secondly I didn't
have too good of a relationship with my
manager at the time so I'm not going to
talk about the manager side of things
right now but I'm going to focus on the
tech side of things so first I just want
to give people understanding of how
low-level some of this code was and how
it's not so glamorous even though it
might sound kind of cool so all this is
very sequential style C code so it's
just C code that just has to execute in
some order and do the right thing and
the code we're writing was actually
being executable for the operating
system even loaded into memory so
there's no dynamic memory there's no
malloc like there's no virtual memory
like it's very different environment
you're writing like such specific C code
that it's just I'm not going to say it's
simple but once you get the hang of it
there's not too much
room for flexibility like there is a way
to do everything
so what I was really curious about at
this point was I was really curious to
learn what like bigger software design
was all about I was reading other people
working on my huge software projects you
know like create these software projects
high level languages doing really cool
things and I was stuck writing like C so
that was actually the main curiosity
point that triggered me to want to get
into higher-level software so for anyone
who's working and might have some of
their feelings that I did it's kind of
like I'm doing this I've been doing this
for a long period of time I'm curious
about what this other thing is like I
would only say before you jump ship and
move on to something else do you really
understand what the technical work
you're doing right now is all about to
understand if you really like something
or not you have to actually understand
it first right or be involved in it
significantly first I hear a lot of
people saying so many hypothetical
things on YouTube like oh I'm going to
love web programming they'll all love
game development like do you even know
what game develop is is like I hear a
lot of people saying stuff like that
like they really see themselves doing
game development when they've done zero
game development so I think we really
want to judge something technically you
have to get involved in it significantly
to at least understand it all right so I
was two years super low level C
programming I kind of understood what if
you like and I acknowledge that it
wasn't something I wanted to do so I
wanted to get into higher level stuff
all right so the second second major
inflection point that I had in my career
was going from high-level software in a
corporate setting to start up so fast
forward two years from that first
inflection point I got out of the
low-level software Department I
transferred to Qualcomm's RMD Department
it was too crazy interview process it
was actually kind of like interviewing
for a new job I did like six rounds of
interviews to get into that arm D
position and they were doing like these
crazy C++ projects
that's what I wanted to do and I just
got into it I was too scared to leave
the company so I just kind of switched
apartments but it wasn't easy to just
switch the apartment so R&amp;amp;D at big
corporate companies is pretty cool it
feels very academic you're actually
doing kind of research like things you
get a ton of funding from your company
and you work on stuff just to experiment
with it this is when I was working on
this cool like hypothetical neural
processor kind of like the power of
Terminator like on important eager it
was like a crazy concept it was
definitely really out there but that's
what R&amp;amp;D is all about right taking money
and pushing it into crazy ideas hoping
it becomes a real idea so this is the
position where I kind of first learned
C++ it was also about two years I came
from C to C++ is my first experience
with like higher level programming like
software design technique software
patterns there's actually programming
run with an operating system a don't
worry about memory crashes segmentation
bolts all that good stuff good stuff
so there's actually technically very
different is exactly exactly what I
wanted technically coming from the
low-level world but after a while there
is actually something else missing that
caused the second inflection point the
main reason I started feeling like
company had to change was that I wasn't
being fulfilled on a non-technical level
at this position so what I mean by that
it was I was very fulfilled technically
it was like cool my coolest C++
programming it was very technically cool
but it wasn't very fulfilling outside of
tech because one it was very academic if
you guys know an academic means it's
very rd nobody was using our product
like we would work we would put in hours
to make this thing and nobody would use
it who would use it we didn't have one
customer this is a little depressing
right you put a lot of like hours into
coding something and no one use me that
never feels very good the reason I
started kind of getting into startups
one obviously they're very hot and
trendy
stuff can't deny that startups are very
trending these days but one thing that
they always advertised was that at a
start-up you can work directly on
something then you could sell through
customer product Heights show people you
could like the work you did was easily
displayable to someone I wouldn't be in
like this weird R&amp;amp;D silo where all this
stuff I was doing was thrown away I
could be in a place where I could work
on stuff and show it off to people or it
could actually be useful so this
transition was also very hard coming
from a corporate world to a startup
world if you ever apply a startup
companies they're very like biased they
always favor people that have hardest
experience and it kind of like push back
against people that are too corporate so
I had like an uphill battle
so to play but it was all right so I
just knew that I didn't want to work in
San Francisco because I didn't really
like the bay area too much I wanted to
work at some startup where I could make
a difference to many people and I didn't
have much going for me right I had like
all the wrong technical skills if you
guys know anything about startup most
startups 99% of them use web
technologies like Ruby on Rails you know
web programming full stack developer
front-end developer mobile developer all
that stuff very rarely do startups need
like a C++ developer so I had the
complete wrong skill set for startups
that's why it was really difficult for
me to get in one crazy story I had was I
applied to rap genius back when they
were really small and I like cold emails
the CEO where I forget we want cold
emails one of the founders of rap genius
just seeing if there could be any
positions opening and he was like you
show me any web site you have and I was
like I can't I don't have a web
site to show him so I spent I literally
I got that email I spent one month
I built this portfolio website working
code in the browser I built that in a
month and then I emailed the guy back
and be like oh here's a URL to this site
I just need to show that I could do web
programming and he never responded to me
so that's up this is when CMU really
came to save me because the only reason
some companies some startup companies
would talk to me was because they've
read one line read that I went to CMU
and that name just kind of carried
through to just get in the door for
interviews but a lot of startups just
like shut the door on me real quick
because they saw I didn't have real web
programming experience so like oh this
guy did see a C++ like you can't
contribute to like our startup cool
stack so that was like pretty tough that
I kind of had CMU as my baseline to get
me in a little bit and eventually I
talked to one company that didn't mind
that I was doing C++ for so long and
they gave me a chance either started so
for anyone watching I think one thing
that really helped me at this point was
that I thought that I was technically
fulfilled I would be completely happy
right I wanted to work on people plus I
wanted to do software development I want
to do all this cool high level
programming and I got to do that finally
but I still have this like empty empty
hole inside of me because something else
wasn't fulfilled so I think if you
fulfill yourself technically I could get
you like 30 or 40 maybe 50 percent of
the way there but there's still a large
part of that fulfillment which isn't
technical so I think it was just a good
lesson for me so if anyone out there is
just thinking like oh if I work on this
technical stuff I'm going to be so happy
if I can work on game programming I'll
be so happy just you're probably that's
not going to get you really fulfilled in
the long run and just be aware of them
all right so when you're just
considering different potential paths to
take
they'll just take the one that only what
you want to do from the technical
perspective just ask yourself like how
do I be fulfilled in both parts like
technical stuff and then just wishing
gooshie stuff alright the third the
third this is a long video but the third
and last inflection point that I went
through my career was startup to startup
so coming from corporate the startup was
already a big change but then once
you're actually working with it
there's so many different ones to choose
from right start up a sitter who started
be they're all very very different so
the start up I joined was very I like to
call it consumer focus we were working
on like this new cool mobile app to
replace Chrome potentially so there was
a consumer product it was a cat Anja
basis' actually what I want to do coming
out of the corporate world right I
wanted to work on a product that real
people use potentially many people use I
want to my code to be seen and this is
as hard to do it right they were working
on like a really kind of visionary
product I think the one downfall I kind
of led to this next inflection point was
that all the eggs were in this one
product they were banking on this
product to be like a snapshot or
Instagram and really lift them off and
it never really has to do so what caused
this next inflection point was that
actually wanted to learn what it was
really like the start of real business
like with a real business model and
actually run a company I feel like a lot
of the startups that are just focused on
one product it's kind of like a
well-funded way to work on your pet
project right you haven't proven
anything all you have is this visionary
idea that you want to get you and you're
banking everything you're putting all
your eggs into the basket is banking on
that work and it's probably not going to
work so the experience that I wanted to
get after this
after realizing this was that I wanted
to be a part of like a real business
like a real operation so that's when I
started looking for different startups
that were more business orange so this
eventually led me to find the next
startup which are actually currently
working at I'm not going to talk too
much about it here because the important
part here it's just the transition point
but what I found in this next startup
which I really like is that they were
they have a real business model they
have a way to make money and they were
even able to make money before we built
any technology for so it just shows that
it's not like a really visionary like oh
what if we built Instagram again this
was like we've developed a business MA
we planned it out we have the operation
we know how to make some profits
everything was planned out so it made a
lot of sense what we worked on
technically so I know many people don't
like this style I think everyone is
really different from people are little
more visionaries some people like to
just sit and be like Steve Jobs other
people like to actually get their hands
dirty and actually build a real business
and I was just gravitating more towards
that side I wanted to be a part of like
the real operation and how it ran so
that's what led to that inflection point
and that's where I'm working right now
all right guys to wrap up the third
inflection point between star doesn't
start up I think the major takeaways I
just recognize every company is very
different all right just between
startups this was a major inflection
point for me the third one mics far as a
start-up but I think it's actually less
significant than my other two I should
think the first two were more like
game-changing for me the third one was
just me kind of tweaking what I wanted
to work on it was a little more control
the other issue were like
something's wrong I got a change the
last inflection point was getting a
little more controlled where I knew what
I wanted to go towards but that easier
said than done obviously so that was the
last inflection point startup to startup
and everything is different right so if
you're in if you're considering working
at a startup just take really good care
and trying to understand what that spot
is like compared to some other startup
you're considering all right guys that's
the end of the video long video again
more of a story I just hope that some of
the stuff I talked about is relatable
you guys can relate to it hopefully
apply it to something you're going
through or might be going through in the
future and it helps you alright so a lot
of this stuff as I was moving I really
didn't know what was going on but like
when I just think about it and
retrospect everything had like a not a
clear purpose but it developed me in a
different
so just watch out for those inflection
points in your life and take care when
you're going through them because you
don't think it's a big deal when it's
happening but then after you realize
like it makes crazy differences in your
career life all that stuff last thing
last random point I just want to put out
there is that always make sure to give
stuff second chances
when I was in college I had a couple bad
internships which kurd me really off to
web programming like I had one
internship where I found that I'm not
going to write CSS or JavaScript again
this stuff sucks like I don't want to
write it and now that's exactly what I'm
doing now so it's kind of like gifts up
a second chance like I thought I wasn't
going to be a web developer well in
college I thought oh no web developers
not for me and then after all these
pivots and turns I'm now doing web
development full-time so there will be
two quick don't be too quick to judge
something that you don't like all right
that's a last thing I wanted to mention
here but other than that I hope this
storytime was helpful for you it's just
kind of strange for me to recount
everything that's happened to me but
anyways it's been a popular question
that people have asked I hope it's
helpful I hope it's relatable please ask
me any questions if you want and see
everyone next week all right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
