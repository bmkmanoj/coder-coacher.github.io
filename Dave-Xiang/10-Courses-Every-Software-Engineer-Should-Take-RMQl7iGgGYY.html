is going to be dedicated to a handful of
questions I received regarding what
classes to take in things that are good
to know if you're lucky enough to be in
a school right now with a cool
engineering curriculum this video might
be irrelevant to you for everyone that's
not in school right now or isn't
involved in a really accredited
engineering program sometimes it's a
little hard to figure out exactly what
points you should be focusing on and
that's the purpose of this video each
one of these big topics has a class or
more than one class associated with it
and if you're not involved in any
programs right now just use these topics
as kind of an outline of what you could
kind of learn more about or look into
more everything we're going to go over
in this video is very high-level but if
you can speak to each one of these areas
relatively well and you're comfortable
explaining each one of these areas that
we're going to cover in this video we're
going to be really well off alright
let's get started number one the
prerequisite to everything in our field
at least is going to be intro to
programming if you're totally new to
this you have to just understand basic
words like for loops while loops
operators go over basic datatypes go
over basic program structure maybe get
into a little object-oriented
programming just very introductory level
stuff number two again is introduction
to programming just second time around
the point of this is to really reinforce
everything you learned in step one and
this is still a very introductory level
courses and I believe at most programs
most curriculums there's at least two if
not more intro level programming courses
the major point that I just want to
drive home with number two is that you
can't really take in all of intro to
programming with just one course so
whether it be one two three or four
courses whatever is available to you
just make sure you really get that intro
well alright spend a lot of time there
all right going on to number three on
the list is a basic math and/or
statistics course with basic math you'll
understand how to form real mathematical
logical arguments like induction strong
induction what does it take to prove
something with stats you can learn about
what this expected value mean what is
the binomial probability theorem it's
just really basic level stats and both
of these things are just going to help
with everyday life as well as
engineering fourth class I have on my
list is the basic algorithms and data
structures class and this one is really
important I'm not going to go into the
details of algorithms and data
structures but this is going to be your
first little bit of taste in real
computer science also the scope of
algorithms and data structures is really
really broad you can go from really
basic hash tables or length lists that
are pretty practical and you can go all
the way to very very high-level
theoretical things mileage may vary for
algorithms and data structures but they
are essential and you have to take it so
that's number four number five is going
to be computer systems and this is
understanding how computer really works
bits bytes virtual memory the memory
hierarchy basics of computer
architecture I've seen this course or
subject go under a lot of different
names but it all encompasses very
similar things
it's how computer fundamentally works
all right number six on the list is
going to be a very basic web application
course this might be the most practical
out of all the courses you'll take
because it's really probably getting
into a little more hands-on industry
level software that you might use on the
job this course will teach you the
basics of the internet how to build a
basic web application and use the basic
web framework but also teach you the ins
and outs of databases I put this course
on the list because I feel it's really
important as a prerequisite to get a lot
of jobs in the software industry these
days so make sure you take that
it's available to you okay so that was a
very high-level overview of big topics
and those six things all go into a very
basic list that I feel every engineer
should know about and be able to talk
about now it's time to go into a little
extra cool stuff that I don't feel like
it's a prerequisite to maybe getting a
job or maybe even being an effective
engineer but these are the extra goodies
that are really cool and if you know
about these things it's even better
number seven is going to be operating
systems just understanding how a basic
operating system works how does your
file system work
how are different processes scheduled
how is memory managed how is the OS
working what is exactly a kernel what
does that even mean number eight is
going to be a course about compilers and
if you take a course like this you'll
really understand how a computer
language is constructed and what its
grammar is like I know compiler seems
like really crazy wizard magic like
stuff but if you take a course on
compilers and basic languages you'd be
able to write your own compiler for your
own custom language after the course
probably it's pretty cool stuff number
nine nine is going to be computer
architecture this is kind of like the
big brother of computer systems and if
you take computer architecture you'll
really really understand what's going on
inside a CPU alright last one number ten
tenth course that I think would be
really cool to know about is computer
networks this is also like the big
brother of your intro to Web Application
courses when we build a web application
we just code it up use a framework and
we just put it on the Internet right but
how exactly does the Internet itself
work if you take a course like computer
networks or networking you'll really
understand how networks work and also
how the internet works now many people
could explain tcp/ip I can't I can't
explain it it's a really crazy concept
and it's always working for us but if
you take computer networks you'll know
the ins and outs of the Internet
and it's pretty cool all right guys
that's my list six really basic courses
and six basic topics that we all should
understand and for extra goody topics
which are really good to know remember
that you don't have to be a master at
every single one of these subjects no
one's a master at everything as you go
about your career and learning you'll
start gravitating towards different
areas
remember that gravitating towards one of
these areas doesn't mean you can be
oblivious to the other areas we should
all be able to talk about each area of
computing with a little bit of comfort
you know all right guys so there's like
an endless amount of things you could
potentially go over you could always
check out new things and I would
encourage you to always review the
fundamentals very often and I'll just
make your lives a lot easier
I hope this overview and kind of outline
of a curriculum it's helpful and can
guide you in your coursework or your
personal studies you know no one's done
learning this stuff drop me a comment or
give me a thumbs up and like if you
enjoyed this video and I hope everyone
has a great weekend alright take care
and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
