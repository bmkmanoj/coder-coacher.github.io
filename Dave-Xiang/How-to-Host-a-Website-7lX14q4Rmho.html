doing really well
wanted to hit another common question
that I've been asked which is how to
host a website so screencasts video this
week kind of a not too technical but
more of a big picture type of screencast
I just want to talk through basic ways
that you can host a website alright so
this is a common question I've been
asked there's going to be a decent
amount of text in this document but as
always just try to follow my voice and
I'll do my best to try to explain the
answers of this question so I guess the
big question is what are different ways
to host a website first just two
important distinctions that we have to
clear up upfront so there's two
important things one is hosting a web
application or a website and another
thing is registration and those are two
separate actions and for this video
we're going to be talking about hosting
a web application working knock we're
not going to talk so much about
registration but I just want to talk
about it briefly here so some websites
like GoDaddy Namecheap Bluehost there's
a lot of web sites out there that do
both of these things as kind of like
separate features so if you go to a
GoDaddy com
this is an official registration site
for the intranet where you can register
a domain name like my favorite com like
this is a domain and you can go to these
official places to register them under
your name and they provide web hosting
too but it's also very likely that you
can do these two things separately so
you can use GoDaddy just for
registration where you can use some
other service some other service to host
your applications all right GoDaddy just
provides both of these things so today
we're going to talk about different ways
to host a website not nothing we're not
going to talk about website registration
which is another thing so just get that
clear in your head all right
so what we're going to do in this video
is that I kind of just broke down
different levels of hosting a website I
came up with six levels these are very
high level 10,000 bird's-eye view type
of
and we're going to start from the lowest
level and go to the highest level all
right it's always good to start on the
lowest level of the stack and there's a
lot of text here but I'm just going to
read them so just follow along but the
most the lowest way to host a website is
you run a website on your computer in
your house that's connected to the
Internet so this is probably good for
pet projects really like testing stuff
out just like messing around if you run
a website on your computer and your
computer is hosted on the Internet that
pretty much means your website is on the
Internet
all right so if you run your application
and you have a listen on port 80 and
your computer is connected to the
Internet it's going to have an IP and
people are going to be able to hit your
website all right
even you can do this at a computer at
your house so some of the stuff that
obviously it's not going to be like a
real kind of server service you probably
won't keep your computer on 24/7 you
probably don't have any real internet
bandwidth to support this if you're
paying like 40 bucks a month for
internet it's not going to support any
significant traffic and your personal
computer is not really designed for this
all right I did this in high school a
little bit just the hosts counter-strike
servers for a couple hours with me and
my friends want to play and I was good
enough for like five or ten people to
connect to my computer and we could play
counter-strike alright so moving on from
that number two is that you buy real
server equipment and you put it in your
house so this is probably how early
internet companies like Google got
started they kind of call them garage
data centers where you set up like a
data center in your garage I have a
couple funny pictures here from Silicon
Valley so it kind of looks like this
so you set up like a data center data
center in your living room and you host
all yourself up there right so this is
like this is from Silicon Valley the TV
show so if you haven't seen this is just
picks from the show but they've set up
their own like data center in their
living room and they're a caught on fire
so so you can buy a real server heavy
beauty you can spend money and get
heavy-duty server equipment and you can
put it in your house you can totally do
this
you can keep it on 24/7 you're going to
pay a lot of money for electricity and
you probably also have to pay for some
significant Internet bandwidth to your
residence so you got to pay for
something more than $40.00 a month we're
going to be paying like $400 a month or
something you still have to manage all
this stuff yourself like putting out
fires pressing the restart button you
know whatever it takes to manage that
server equipment but you can totally
still put it in your house and I think
if you recreate your stories about
Google that's what those guys did in the
early days all right so moving on to
step three is that you can buy real
server equipment and put it into a
shared Center so shared Center probably
looks something more like this where
there's just like racks and racks of
Internet space this this looks like it's
from a movie but pretty much what a
shared Center really means is that it's
also called a colocation space I've
heard about this term but it's pretty
much a place to put your heavy-duty
server equipment that's not in your
house alright so you pay for the
computer but you also pay to keep it
somewhere safe all right so the space or
the facility they're going to take care
of like electricity Internet bandwidth
cooling and you pay for all this stuff
like a rental fee so pretty much you
could be paying for a little section of
this room or something and somebody else
has another section and a different
company has a different section so
somebody is probably on site some poor
soul is probably on site 24/7 to help
you reset your computer that's going to
be someone's job resetting computers
putting out fires and I heard that
sometimes if you do this if they can't
handle some simple things you might
still have to drive to the colocation
Center and like fix up your computer
it's like you can't do it remotely all
right so what colocation kind of means
is that the space we said this for the
space at the Centers is kind of rent
set out to different companies and you
pay for the space and you pay for the
computers and they call a Rackspace but
it's pretty much you pay for the amount
of space that you want to fit here with
your computer so if you've got five
computers you'll pay this amount if you
have like 50 computers you could pay
this other amount all right and I guess
colocation just means it shared it feel
like a data center but I guess if you
hear the word data center sometimes it's
like a pure data center owned by one
company right like Google could have
their Google data center in the middle
of nowhere just for Google computers and
it's not really shared for anyone else
like this picture is actually inside
Google so this is probably a real Google
employee in one of their dedicated data
centers and it looks like this madness
so so that's that's number three you can
buy real server equipment you can put it
in a shared space so number four is I
think really similar it's almost kind of
the same thing but I just split it out
into a different category but this one
is you rent the server equipment and you
put it in a shared data center so
everything is really similar to what we
just talked about but you also just rent
out the hardware you don't actually own
the hardware you rent the hardware and
you rent the space where you put it in
so the service provider owns all that
stuff and the service provider is
provides the space and the full hardware
support so good thing to note here is
that even though you're just renting
this computer you still have like full
access to this computer right it's
essentially yours you're just paying
like a renting fee rather than like a
house mortgage so you can install
whatever OS you can assault whatever
software you want you can go in there
reset things maybe upgrade things if you
want as long as you're paying your rent
on time it's pretty much your computer
all right
number five this is kind of let me make
this a new page number five is where
most people these days sit and we're
going to spend a little more time here
but number five is renting out a virtual
private server and this is what most
people do so it's very similar of
fueling to number four except you're
renting out a virtual server alright so
what exactly is a virtual server but
it's a pretty simple idea if you just
break it down it's pretty much a
virtualization of a computer on physical
computers so you can have many different
virtual servers on the same physical
server and you don't really care about
the physical server you just interact
with our virtual computer so what does
this essentially does this essentially
splits up the resources of a big
powerful computer into less powerful
computers all right so you could have a
huge physical server with like 32 gigs
of ram and you split it up between four
virtual computers both each with like 8
8 gigs of ram all right so splitting up
a big powerful computer in two different
virtualizations one important kind of
problem or not problem they have is like
the noisy neighbor problem this is
pretty I don't know if this is the right
word to use but I've heard this term
noisy neighbor before but pretty much
with a virtual server you're pretty much
sharing physical resources with someone
else right maybe there's one physical
server and you have three virtual
servers all right and you're renting one
of those virtual servers and other
people around the world are renting the
two other virtual servers if the other
virtual servers use a ton of resources
like if the other two virtual servers
are using a ton of disk IO or Network IO
they're writing a lot of file to the
disk they're pretty much doing a ton of
stuff to the computer they could
actually slow down your virtual servers
performance right because in the end
it's kind of three virtual things
running on the same real thing
how do people deal with this but if you
have the infrastructure capabilities you
can recreate another instance of the
virtual server on a different physical
computer or you can just spend more
money and rent your own dedicated server
you would have this virtual problem but
in the end you don't have too much
control over this all right so example
is a virtual virtual private server
rental services
I'm sure if you guys heard of these
digitalocean Amazon Web Services you
don't have full you still pretty much
have full access to the computer you
have root access you can install
whatever whatever software you want and
you're pretty much paying a rent or fee
and these providers are going to give
you updates if anything bad happens so
it's like oh we had a fire your
your physical computer broke down or oh
crap we had to restart some physical
machines that your virtual servers are
on just for your information and finally
we're at the last level of this thing
and I think that the term these days
that people used to describe this is a
platform as a service or paas and the
most common one I know is Heroku and
this is pretty much like a one-click
shop for application hosting so they
handle a lot of the software management
for you you have much less control so
pretty much one example this is you
create a Heroku Dino to run a rails
application it's not really a computer
it's just like Heroku is going to set up
a virtual server for you and they're
going to install all the software on
that computer for you so you can run
rails and all you have to worry about is
programming a rails application you
don't have to worry about setting up the
computer so you definitely have less
control in the setting because you can't
log directly into the computer you can
only do what Heroku allows you to do so
with much less control for all the
hackers out there that kind of sucks but
you do get some added benefits one
example of this is like database backups
right for Heroku a database backup
system is like two clicks and you get it
as a feature right you get daily back
of your database very scheduled
consistently all you do is pay money but
you can do it in one click the
alternative to this the cheaper
alternative to this is that you can set
up all this yourself with your own
servers right but then think about all
that extra work you have to do you got
to make sure you have enough disk space
make sure you have the backups make sure
you have the proper code to do the
scheduling so you definitely have less
control but you get more added benefits
for free and for many companies who
don't have a lot of resources or
developers like if you don't have
engineer to manage this kind of stuff a
platform is a good option for you and
you just have to spend more money
all right so many startups are kind of
that's why many startups use Heroku
because you can't afford a dedicated
developer to handle all this
infrastructure stuff for you so if the
service if something like Heroku can do
it for you they're going to spend money
to have it done alright so that was a
decent amount of info for one video but
I'm going to share these documents
pretty much what we talked about in this
video again to summarize is that we
didn't really talk about registration we
just talked about different ways that
you can host a web application and there
are six different ways right and if you
just need to review just go through
these notes again there's definitely a
lot of different nuances different
probably variations of these schemes but
these are kind of like the big picture
ideas of how you can each even host
something on the Internet
all right so hopefully that hell was
helpful I hope you guys like got a
little bit of insight on how these
things are working on the internet on
the internet but I encourage everyone to
definitely look more into it all right
because this was a very overview type of
video all right hope this was helpful
please like comment and give me a thumbs
up alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
