video about 64-bit computing so you hear
this term all the time but it's good to
get a little bit of a deeper
understanding of what it really means
why does the website ask you if you want
to download the 64-bit version or the
32-bit version
everyone says 64 bits better than 32-bit
but why is it better alright so the
first thing to know about 64-bit
computing is that it comes in two parts
two parts so the first part is the
processor and the second part is the
software a processor can be either
32-bit capable or 64-bit capable and
software can also be 32-bit or 64-bit so
how do you mix and match these two
things so the one major point to
understand is that a 32-bit processor
can only run 32-bit software on the
other hand a 64-bit processor can
usually run both 32-bit programs and
64-bit programs this doesn't happen very
often anymore but normally when you go
to a website and download a piece of
software usually asks you do you want
the 32-bit version or the 64-bit version
the reason why asks is if you only have
a 32-bit processor you're just not going
to be able to run the 64-bit version of
the software so you shouldn't download
it so the best combination to have is a
64-bit processor and a 64-bit software
that's the best combo so we all know
that 64-bit is better but let's just go
over why it's better it's almost common
knowledge now that when you're using a
32-bit processor with 32-bit operating
system you're limited to only four gigs
of RAM or memory
so I'm not going to get into too much
detail about why 32 vids can only
address 4 gigabytes of memory but just
accept it for now and that's one of the
major limitations of only 32-bit
architectures so the first and really
important benefit of 64-bit computing is
that we can have more memory than 4
gigabytes that's the first but not only
benefit the other core benefit of 64-bit
computing is performance I'm going to
get a little bit technical here so just
try to stick with me for a little bit
I'll do my best
there's one particular way in which
computers kind of measure size and that
thing is called a word it's not a real
word like dog cat it's more like a
computer word and always has a fixed
size so everything inside a computer is
relative to this really fundamental word
size a number might be one word or a
really big number could be two words one
of the cool benefits of 64-bit is that
normally that default word size doubles
so why exactly is having a larger word
size better for performance well if I
could put it into one sentence it would
probably just be this with bigger words
you can add bigger numbers together and
when you can add bigger numbers together
you can do more computations and things
get more efficient so 64-bit isn't
really a new thing it's been in desktop
computers for a really really long time
the area where 64-bit is really new is
in mobile devices the only 64-bit
processor out right now in a phone is
the iPhone 5s that's the only one right
now and probably Android phones are
going to come out soon so let's just
reiterate some of the important points
from before
64-bit software can only run on a 64-bit
processor and also to reiterate if you
only have a 32-bit processor you can
only run 32-bit software so really
ingrain those points in your head and
then also remember more memory can be
addressed and higher performance and so
that's it for today and I'm just going
to wrap it up there sorry didn't go into
too much core details behind some of the
stuff I talked about but I just wanted
to give a quick overview of some 64-bit
fundamental sense is usually a little
bit hazy with people if you could take
away anything from this video it's this
there's always two parts when someone
says 64-bit its software part and a
processor part and they have to work
together if you want big bucks big what
does that mean stupid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
