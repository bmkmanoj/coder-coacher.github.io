programming is one of the hottest things
going on right now there's a lot of buzz
a lot of online courses and a lot of
promise behind it in this video I'm just
going to give my opinion on one of the
ways you can go about learning
programming I'm not saying it's right
there's probably a lot of people out
there that might disagree with me but
that's okay this is the Internet right
so I can say whatever I want
learning programming could really
benefit you no matter what industry
you're in it doesn't have to be tech you
don't have to become this super guru
wizard programming master no one is the
steps that we're going to go through
kind of mimic the curriculum you might
follow at a Technical College but you
definitely don't have to go to fancy
school to become a program so let's just
start the video assuming you have zero
knowledge and you're a total newb level
one warrior okay first thing do not I
repeat do not take one of those
three-month crash courses on Ruby on
Rails or learning Android as your first
foray into programming this is kind of
like learning to run before you can walk
and it's a little bit counterproductive
so let's do it a different way the first
thing that you have to do is pick a
programming language to start you off so
you can pick Ruby just don't pick Ruby
on Rails you don't have to think too
hard about what language you're going to
pick because you're big noob so just
pick one and that's where we're going to
get started one language that I usually
recommend people start with is Python it
has a really nice syntax and it's easy
to get up and running and just like
everything else in the world you can
Google for anything you want so once you
pick your basic language it's going to
be your vessel for learning right some
dummy programs Google for things figure
out what an array is how do you sort
something what is a stack what is a data
structure mean what's an algorithm mean
so there's probably also a lot of online
courses that you can use that help you
out
the only thing you have to do in this
face is just get your feet wet and play
around with that language a little bit
okay so after a few weeks or a couple
months of doing that you're probably
getting familiar with one language and
that's really awesome you probably can't
do anything really impractical with your
skills yet but that's okay if you got
this bar it's really awesome you know
you showed initiative picked up this new
programming language that not many
people can understand but just remember
once you get here it's still not time to
take those online courses yet just hold
back don't do it yet those crash courses
seem a little sexy because you can kind
of like make a website or write an app
right away but you're still not ready
for it at this point at this point
you're a little familiar with that first
language you picked and you have to bite
the bullet and study a little more I
know you're not going to be productive
anytime soon but this is the toughest
part that you just have to truck through
now you have to learn basic computer
science and you have to learn how a
computer works this might not seem
efficient if you just want to get a
website up but trust me just do this
part and it'll be well worth it okay
first you have to learn fundamental
computer science which is usually just
simple data structures and algorithms
there's definitely online courses for
this to just take like a general
introductory computer science course and
it should be really good once you do
this part I also recommend choosing a
different language for this part so if
you pick Python to get your feet wet
maybe you can pick Java to learn a
little bit more about data structures
and algorithms the next part second part
is that you have to just kind of
understand how computer works on a
really basic level you have to know what
a byte is you have to know what memory
is what's RAM what is compiling mean
what does a processor do what are the
basic responsibilities of an operating
system you definitely don't have to be a
master behind a lot of this computer
stuff but on a basic level you have to
understand
how it's all working besides just typing
on your keyboard and things happen so
actually a lot of the videos I've made
revolve around computer basing so a good
place to start is maybe watch my videos
and then read more on the topics so
that's the second part the first part
you have to learn computer science
basics and the second part is you have
to just understand on a really
fundamental level what a computer is the
computer is the backbone of programming
after all right okay so if you get to
this point that's really really awesome
so maybe at this point you know one or
two programming languages you have a
basic feel for computer science and you
have the fundamentals behind how
computer works Congrats if you get to
this level it's a pretty big milestone
for the next step now you can really get
into a little more application
programming based on your interests if
you wanted to build a website now you
can go look at that Ruby on Rails
tutorial if you want to build a mobile
app maybe you can go check out that iOS
tutorial so the main pet peeve I have
with a lot of the online courses today
not all of them but some of them they
kind of just jumpstart you right into
this phase without the proper
fundamentals if you start at the space
too early and just go through these
crazy tutorials without knowing what's
going on it's actually really really
counterproductive so while you're
learning how to program you should
always ask yourself do I understand why
this is working or why this is not
working if you're going through tutorial
and you're just writing a bunch of code
they're telling you to write without
really understanding what's going on it
doesn't help you too much once you have
a good foundation down the sky is really
the limit with where you want to take
your programming you can kind of follow
your interest around and just gravitate
towards what you think is really cool or
what you want to learn alright guys I
hope this video wasn't too long I typed
out a lot and I talked a lot so
hopefully I do some insane editing and
this all gets cut down the one takeaway
from this entire video is that please
don't take those programming crash
courses online we don't feel like you're
ready for
it's not even going to be a good use of
your time and it's not going to be
productive so my advice is really just
take your time it might suck because you
can't do anything useful but just you
know learn the fundamentals start
walking before you run and just have fun
with it it all pay off soon and you know
like I said before you don't have to be
an engineer in tech to really kind of
appreciate programming it's just like a
cool way of thinking and it could help
you out a lot I think all right guys
that's the end of the video if you liked
it you know please give me a like down
here or subscribe to the channel if you
have any questions you know feel free to
just hit me up on YouTube and I'll catch
you guys next time alright Pisa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
