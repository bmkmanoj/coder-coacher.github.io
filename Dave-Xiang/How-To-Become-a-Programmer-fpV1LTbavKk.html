this week I don't have my normal camera
setup so this video should have been a
vlog but instead it's going to be a
screencast just up front about this
we're not going to do anything specific
with my computer I'm not going to show
any coding or anything inside my
computer we're just going to talk
through a couple things in this video as
if it were vlog but I just have to do it
as a screencast because I just have none
of my equipment this weekend alright so
with that said just content wise I've
been trying to spread out my content
well and hoping to like cover popular
things that are asked and between
explaining technical concepts or talking
about software engineering I still think
the number one type of question that
gets asked is like how do I become a
software engineer how do I learn coding
what's the best language those type of
questions so this video is going to be
about that and I thought a cool idea to
go over today would be how to become a
programmer and this is not how to learn
coding this is not like what classes you
take it's just like my opinion on
straight up no how to become a
programmer and be kind of effective
alright so I have four core things that
I plan to talk through in this video
this can be a little live and impromptu
so bear with me but the whole point of
this is going to talk about how to
become a programmer alright so let's
just get some okay first thing we've
already talked about this a lot and it's
just basic table stakes but you have to
learn how to code which is a basic tool
that every single programmer needs it
kind of goes without question but we
have to list it the number one thing you
can do is watch my videos if you want to
learn how to code just kidding that's
not what you have to do so how you
really up the code just to summarize
this real quick and really watch my
video if you haven't I talked about it
in more detail but first thing to do is
pick one language it doesn't really
matter what language a lot of people
asked what's the best one for this or
that but if you're really a noob and
just getting into this all you have to
do is pick any language and it'll be
just your vessel for learning
the whole point of that language even if
it's not your favorite you just have to
learn to code with it so pick one
language it doesn't matter you have to
also understand computer science
fundamentals and computer system
fundamentals many people just write code
and they have no idea what the it's
sorry sorry sir they just write code
they don't really know what's going on
but to be a really effective programmer
you really have to understand how a
computer works like not only what you're
typing but how that those things get
translated and how they actually get
executed by your computer and why
they're working and that's some really
powerful stuff and you'll realize that
if you understand those fundamentals it
puts you on some next-level than people
that just know how to you know write
syntax of code
alright after you do that you can pick
another language to learn and also
another important part of this whole
process of number one is to get mentally
frustrated and practice your analytical
skills because at this like stage in the
game when you're just learning how to
code you really have to get into like an
engineering mindset where you're
confused 24/7 you figure things out by
yourself
people don't handhold you so all this is
a process of learning and this stuff is
just kind of as I said it's kind of
table stakes to learning how to program
alright so number one learn to code we
won't spend too much time here but let's
just move on
all right next thing to do is learn
frameworks and this is getting into how
you actually become useful as a
programmer so at this level you are not
going to become useful at all but if you
do this level you are going to become
useful so pick one framework that you
enjoy so if you like web program you can
pick Ruby on Rails or if you want to do
gaming you could pick a gaming framework
whatever you want just pick a framework
and this is actually what's going to
make you kind of useful to like real
life if you know how to do stuff like
this because this is what you know 99%
of companies need people that know how
to use a framework so
that's part two is like learning a
couple popular frameworks and that
really makes you kind of effective and
practical to even hire in the workplace
because if you only know how to code and
you don't know number two at all you
won't really be useful yet and once you
learn one of these frameworks learning
other ones is much easier let me just
write that down so the key is once you
pick up one in some kind of realm
whether it be gaming web or whatever
it really makes learning a lot of
frameworks much easier in the future so
this is also really important and
another important point that I want to
make up is that you cannot go into this
step without doing step one so if you
try to learn a framework first before
you know how to code you're not going to
get much out of it and you just will
probably be confused I'm sure you'll be
confused then this is what a lot of boot
camps do because the let me just talk
about boot camps real quick the whole
point of boot camps which they're really
good but they prepare you to be useful
at a job they don't prepare you to be a
programmer they train you to be like
useful at a job in three to six months
by teaching you a couple popular
frameworks so you can actually
contribute provide some value to a
company but they don't go into this
stuff too much alright so like I said
one and two you have to learn how to
code I would actually do this first and
then you pick some frameworks that are
useful so you can actually make a
difference alright let's go to number
three let me just fix a couple it's
tough to type and speak at the same time
so I just have some silly type of
mistakes here but let's just move on
it's not a big deal hopefully no one
yells but okay okay the third thing you
have to do to be an effective programmer
is to understand software design and
what do I mean by software design but
software design is like how you
structure your code and organize your
system that's pervasive across
frameworks so let's write that down
so we need to realize that learning many
of these frameworks they're very
application specific and they will
promote the new things a very certain
way but that's because many people have
contributed to this framework but along
with using it as a programmer you have
to also understand fundamentals between
how to design software which goes across
any framework so this is kind of basic
things like design patterns clean code
you should know this right you should
know how your tests how to test your
code this is a really important concept
it all falls out to software design some
people like to call this software
engineering but it's kind of a realm
that is so general that you're just
expected to know this no matter what
framework you're using so these are very
general skills you should like basic
design patterns you should know what
they mean so just like builders
factories observers template pattern you
should know basic design patterns in
software what's really important to note
is that whatever software you're writing
it's honest I guarantee you it's not
unique people have been writing software
for a very long time the applications
change but the peer software design
problems haven't changed too much so I
have to do is do some research read some
books really learn how to organize your
software well like all problems we face
in software
really they've been solved before and
the tough problems are actually dealing
with people which we can get into later
but in terms of software and designing
software nothing you encounter is unique
so just do your homework and really
understand software design and that's
good my third point so let's just recap
real quick but learn to code table
stakes learn about some frameworks so
you can be useful to some companies
because every different company uses
different frameworks and they will
eventually hire based on people that are
more proficient at one or the other
and finally
Oh point three is that just understand
software design alright so last point
number four let's do it my fourth point
to becoming an effective programmer is
that you have to learn some soft skills
like communications not being sorry
excuse me communication not being an
asshole so let's just talk about this
real quick I just want to reiterate that
even if you're really really awesome at
coding you can't assume that people are
going to want to work with you or you'll
actually be an effective person wherever
you are like if you're trying to found a
company nobody wants to work with you
nobody wants to give you money that
really sucks if you're on a team and you
think you're some hot nobody is
going to want to work with you so even
if you're insanely insanely good at
coding if you don't have some level of
soft skills I guarantee you you're not
going to become a good programmer a
right or good engineer so my last point
in all of this is that you have to have
some level of soft skills so you can
work well with people and produce better
work
so let's just just get into a little bit
of details here let me just write down
some points here so I have some
experience with this just working with a
couple different teams but there's some
insanely good coders who are just a
nightmare to work with and in the end
it's just overall overall much less
productive so you don't want to be that
guy who is a nightmare to work with
okay so soft skills other things you
should be able to talk to non engineers
as well as you can talk with engineers
one thing that you will always be judged
by is your communication especially with
people that are not technical you should
be able to communicate just as well with
the technical person as well as a
non-technical person okay another point
is learned how to write well so writing
well is also important for coders
because if you code well you should be
able to write well you know consolidate
articulate your thoughts concisely
but writing well is also really
important and really a valuable skill
for any kind of programmer so write code
well as well as write emails and message
as well it's going to be really really
important
last but not least I just want to make
the point that these soft skills come
with time and experience and this is why
you get internships and jobs pretty much
like you cannot read a book or kind of
watch so many videos or listen to me
talk to really good get good at soft
skills what you really have to do is try
your best to get your foot in the door
via an internship or some kind of job
and that's where you really learn these
soft skills once you have the experience
and are thrown into some kind of
situation where you have to work with
people because number four is always the
deal breaker if you want to make this a
career so I guess I'm assuming that many
of you are watching everyone has
different goals right if you want to
just use software as your side project
and it's just your fun thing on the side
you can screw number four it doesn't
matter if it's just going to be your
side job and your real job is like a you
know pizza chef but if you're going to
make programming your engineering your
career number four is a deal breaker and
actually I would say that every single
one of the points we've talked about
this a deal breaker if you really want
to be an effective programmer so let's
just review this real quick this is a
long video but if you're still here we
can you know just recap number one table
stakes is that you have to learn how to
code and preferably learn how to code
with the proper fundamentals so you're
not just writing syntax so basic
prerequisite coding is your friend
number two learn some frameworks
frameworks are what make you valuable at
a company in different companies use
different types of frameworks and
they're very application specific so
just pick a couple frameworks and you're
going to become immediately useful
number three is learning software design
skills which are general to all
frameworks and you really need to
understand these the right good software
so
framework or no framework if you have
good software design or software
engineering chops it's going to be
really helpful last but not least we
have the soft skills which we discussed
in length but these really come from
experience so I can't talk about this
too much but this is a deal breaker for
working anywhere even if you're going to
start your own company or you decide to
work at anywhere but soft skills are
super important and you need this to be
an effective programmer and that's all
to say about that all right guys this
video has been really long and sorry for
being so impromptu I just didn't have my
equipment this week I couldn't really
write a real script and consolidate my
thoughts too much so if you're still
here I hope this video was helpful I'm
just trying to be super upfront about
what you need to be calm and effective
programmer besides just programming like
coding is just like 25% quote unquote
how to become a really effective
programmer in any kind of real life
situation so hope you guys enjoyed this
video you know I know it's really long
but maybe just watch it again I hope I
didn't rush myself but I'm coming up to
this 15 minute mark and I'll have to cut
this off at 15 minutes so please leave
me a comment if you have any questions
I'll be happy to answer them please like
my video subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and I'll see everyone
next time with a more polished video ok
