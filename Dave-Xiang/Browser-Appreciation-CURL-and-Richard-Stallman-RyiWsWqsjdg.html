doing really really well I've been a
little caught up the past few days so
didn't have time to make a fully edited
super awesome rocket video but what I
wanted to do this week is just make a
screencast and actually this screencast
I wanted to make it a little more
dynamic where I'm actually cooking and
typing and showing you guys something in
real time we're trying to show you guys
something in real time so the theme of
this video is browser appreciation and
what I thought would be pretty cool to
showcase is what we're all used to today
like in 2017 using Chrome versus what
things were like back in the day so
something people don't realize all the
time was that the internet existed
before the internet browser existed so
you didn't always interact with the
internet with this browser thing back in
the day when the intranet was first
coming out people used to use the
command line
there was command-line tools there are
still command-line tools that were going
to show soon but people used to actually
browse the internet with just commands
and read stuff on their terminal before
Netscape and all the crazy browsers came
into the picture and obviously browsers
changed the game for the internet but
they didn't come at the same time the
internet was first and then browsers
came so what I want to do this video is
that we just want to contrast how
different it is browsing the internet
with a thing like Chrome versus browsing
the Internet with a terminal and we can
showcase what it's like to do the old
old way and the new new way and that's
what we're going to do this video all
right all right first let's just give a
brief overview of what's on the screen
on the right obviously we have a
terminal on the Left we have Chrome the
only thing that might be able to new for
some people is this thing on the bottom
which is Chrome developer tools if
you've done any work inside the browser
or your front-end developer you
definitely use these tools before but
these are just an awesome way to see
what's going on with the browser you can
see every single Network request here
you can play with JavaScript in this
terminal you can see all the HTML
elements that are powering this page you
can see a different data
the browser is holding for you but all
in all it's just a very helpful tool
it's almost an essential tool if you're
doing any work in a browser all right so
what happens when we just refresh this
page on Google Google's homepage what
happens but first I want to showcase is
that there's a ton of requests being
made this is a temporal sequential list
of every single Network request that is
made to power this page the first one is
google.com and then a bunch of others
are created so armaid sorry so there's
all photos assets different things but
we can check out what this request was
well it's a nice photo of my face so you
can see that request number six one two
three four five six the browser made a
request to this resource to get a
picture of my face obviously to put it
up here the top right for my avatar
image and everything you see down here
is very similar different assets all the
stuff that goes into goes into making
what you see right here the most
important request that I want to look at
is this first one the one to Google comm
which starts this whole waterfall of
things but the browser is making a
request to this resource and actually we
can do the exact same thing in terminal
so there's an old-school command to do
this
it's called curl if you've never seen
this before so just checking it out but
it's just that's a picture of my face
but let's just curl for this Google's
homepage and see the data that we get
back in the terminal so so this is the
data we get back obviously it's it's
nonsense for us to read but it's just a
huge crazy string so what the major
thing I want to show is that the data
that's returned on the right by the
terminal is actually the same exact data
that the browser is getting back and
we're going to prove it in just a second
but obviously when we get this data back
in the terminal our terminal isn't
designed to showcase this data anything
that's returned it's just raw data right
when you request something you get
broadly
back but then you just interpret
different the browser interprets the
string s tree of elements that display
versus the terminal doesn't know how to
interpret it so just spits it out to you
but let's just see how the data itself
is identical so just go to the top where
is this data start it starts somewhere
around up here right this is like the
first data that's returned now just take
a look at the elements on this page so
if you just think a close look here at
the element on this page you can see
this head element meta content search
the world's information including
webpages images videos and more you can
see that that exact information is right
up here in a meta content search the
world's information including webpages
images videos or more so what that just
proves it's like almost a no-brainer but
that getting this data with a
command-line tool is you get the same
data back that you can get via a browser
the browser just interprets it
differently and shows you something
really cool and back in the day before
this thing on the Left even existed
everyone used to browse the Internet
with commands like this because now
since there's browsers what data is
returned by the servers is all HTML tag
visual data JavaScript data it's really
crazy but what the internet first
started people used to host essays
documents papers on the internet so when
you would curl for them you would just
curl and get someone else's essay from
across the world back you can just read
it on a terminal or save it on a file
before all this HTML craziness came into
the picture so that's how it was used to
done and some people some people still
use curl to get data and they don't like
using web browsers so that's pretty
crazy I'm going to show you guys one
more cool thing okay one other cool
thing I'm going to show you guys is what
these web pages look like if you're
coming from a phone so another cool
feature of this developer tool kit is
that you
pretend you're visiting Google's website
from an iPhone 6 and then you can see
how the page is different right so these
days a lot of web pages are mobile
optimized and what that means is that
when you hit them from a phone they're
going to return different data that's
what will optimize versus if you hit
that same webpage from your desktop so
obviously if I hit google.com from my
iPhone 6 different stuff is going to be
returned and we can also mimic that with
curl on the right so I'll show you guys
how to do that but let's see so the
major thing that's different is that
there's a special piece of
identification information that's sent
in the request that tells it where
you're coming from so it's called a user
agent and every request made on internet
most of them have this thing to find so
if you look closely here the user agent
when I mimicking iPhone 6 is that it's
Mozilla 5.0 iPhone iPhone OS 9.1 but
pretty much this little string here is
dictating where I'm coming from and if I
was on the desktop this would be
something else this would be like back
OS or something but since I'm mimicking
an iPhone it's an iPhone thing and
actually I can do the same thing with
curl here so how to do that is you set
the special a command which is the agent
you set it as iPhone and then you curl
the same page which is this page could
have just type that so obviously the
data here if you guys forget what the
let me just show the old one real quick
this is the old data it looks like that
just remember what that kind of looks
like and now this is the one with iPhone
you can tell that the data is already a
little different right now let's just
prove it so a lot of scripts going on
here but so obviously you can't use a
command line to really surf the internet
but this is what people used to do which
is a pretty crazy
so obviously I can't okay so I can't
find something too easily so what I can
do is let's just look at this web page
real quick there's something special on
the web page that I can test for again
okay this thing on the bottom so you
guys see this thing on the bottom it's
better in the app this little bar on the
bottom is probably only showing up with
the local site it's better than layout
they wouldn't show you this string if it
was just a desktop version so we're
going to search for this string in our
response here and make sure we find it
so we're going to grip for its gender in
the app yeah and we find something she
grabbed found something here which just
proves that the data that we returned
from that response has this data so
actually just to prove that even further
I'm going to prove that this data
doesn't actually exist when I changed
the user age so let's just go back to
our regular curl and then I'm going to
grab for the same thing here and I'm
expecting it not to return with anything
right it doesn't have anything because
this tag doesn't even exist when we hit
the webpage from the desktop but it does
exist we hit it from an iphone so
hopefully that just pretty much I'm
doing in the terminal what I'm doing on
the left just a really terrible way
alright guys that's it for the live demo
hopefully after seeing those two things
side by side just get it appreciation of
you know everything the browser is doing
the browser is taking all this stuff
interpreting it for you and showing you
guys something super pretty but back in
the day people use the terminal so last
to just close off this video I want to
introduce a crazy person it's one of the
legendary computer scientist but I was
reading this guy's bio the other day and
it's just insane so first of all Richard
Stallman
he created canoe if you have no idea
what can do is it's pretty much the most
free
the whole project is based on free
software and this guy started that
movement so definitely read up on this
guy but something that is really crazy
about him that I've read from this
Wikipedia article is personal wise so
yes I'm reading about computer
scientists personal life but check out
this sentence right here
according to Stallman with the exception
of the few sites such as his own web
site or sites related to his work with
canoe and as I said he usually does not
browse the web directly from his
personal computer in order to prevent
being connected with his browsing
history instead he uses W get or similar
programs W get is kind of like curl he
uses W get or similar programs that
fetch content from web servers and then
sent that content to his email so pretty
much if you guys didn't get it but since
this guy doesn't trust web browsers he
doesn't use Chrome because he's afraid
chrome is tracking him and he's right
every time we use Chrome Google is
tracking the out of us they're
tracking every single click because they
own Chrome they know exactly what we're
doing but if you don't want Google
tracking that stuff you can be like
Richard Stallman Jesus W get to browse
the Internet so essentially what this
pretty much means is that this guy
Richard Stallman he browses the internet
like this he uses curl W get he hits
resources and he gets documents then he
sends those to his email to read so
that's if that that kind of blew my mind
that's just crazy like this guy doesn't
trust I can probably understand he just
doesn't trust the system enough he
doesn't want Google snooping in and all
this stuff and you use a terminal to
still browse the Internet in the 21st
century which is pretty crazy so that's
just a little bit of random trivia for
everyone but if you don't know who this
guy is Richard Stallman he is like
legendary
computer scientist there's he's one of
many and I encourage everyone to if
you're curious read about people like
this it's like they do crazy crazy
things alright guys hope this video was
a little bit fun a little dynamic hope
you guys have a deeper appreciation
everything the browser is doing to help
us and wide the Internet is such an
amazing experience but you know back in
the day just twenty years ago things
were really different alright guys I'll
catch everyone next week have a great
week do some awesome things and take
care all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
