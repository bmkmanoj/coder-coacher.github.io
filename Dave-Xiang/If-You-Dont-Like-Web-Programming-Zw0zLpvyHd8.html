doing really well
received a few questions on my emails
regarding people that are saying that
they just don't like web programming and
these are pretty strong emails they're
saying they want to do everything to
avoid web programming but they're still
very interested in software so thought
about that question a little bit today
it's gonna be the topic of this video
all right so for anyone that shares
these feelings or just feels like they
don't like web development or
programming at all I had the same exact
feelings maybe nine years ago almost ten
a long time ago 2008 that summer I had
an internship doing purely web
development and it was really different
for me because I was coming from my
major which is electrical Computer
Engineering really really different
world than the web development world but
I just wanted to try it to get a taste a
bit but long story short was after that
summer after those three months I did
not like it at all and it was like kind
of a major turnoff for me I didn't like
styling CSS positioning divs you know
banging my head to write sequel I just
didn't like it so after that summer I
didn't like web development at all but
now obviously that's what I do
as my full-time job and I have been for
a while so somewhere on that timeline I
made a switch but why the first thing
that everyone should consider is that
when you're first exposed to something
like web programming you could be coming
from a lot of different backgrounds
right if you're totally new you have no
concept of technology software
programming whatsoever and you're first
exposed to web development it's actually
really fun and you could be very open to
it but what I found too is that if
you're already predisposed if you're
already technical you've already made it
in some kind of engineering field like
maybe your hardware guy you're already
kind of technical then you get exposed
to web development you're less open to
it because it seems less technical so
depending on where you're coming from if
you're totally fresh or you have
engineering experience before it kind of
will influence what how you perceive web
development before getting into the meat
of this video and talking about this any
further
long story short too long don't read is
that I don't think web programming is
going anywhere
it's definitely a useful skill to learn
for anyone and I'm gonna try to back
that up in this video but that's a long
story short first thing I want to say up
front too is that the the reason why a
lot of people that have been exposed to
tech before the reason why they are
they're not very open to web development
is because at a pure technical raw sense
it's actually not that technical it's
not like building a rocket it's not like
building the next level of aei is just
from a pure technical perspective web
development isn't like high level
technology for many people so it's not
that technical just let's assume that
for now it's not like building a
processor but the reason why web
programming is so popular why it's so
pervasive is not that it's it's not for
its technical reasons it's for what it
can provide you and that's connecting
obviously with a large amount of people
through the internet the raw tech of the
Internet has already been established
like we've already put wires under the
ocean people billions of nodes already
connected on internet that raw technical
part is already established and what's
left over is a means to an end so the
reason why people are drawn to web
programming the internet is not because
of its so cool and tech it's because of
what they can do which is just connect
you with other people
so this concept of connecting or the
concept of a human network is different
for many people right for some it could
just be a way to build a community with
like-minded people maybe if you're a
business person it's a way to reach more
customers maybe if you're like an
activist is a way to send your message
to many many different people and just
the mere fact that we have a medium of
potential communication like that it
makes it really powerful so the tech is
done it's already old news like that
networks all that stuff it's really cool
it was a technical you know crazy
achievement but it's done now what's
left over is just what are you gonna do
with that so let's just talk about one
thing that the web changed for sure just
back in the old days not even old days
but if you're semi old you'll remember
the days where you had to go to the
store you bought like a plastic
container and has CD inside you put the
CD in your computer to install that like
that those days are already almost
over due to the internet right nobody
goes to the store nobody uses CDs nobody
just installs something on their
computer right so many things we do it's
just all through a web browser all
through the internet all these services
are provided through web interfaces like
everything is accessible via the
Internet right if you make your product
or service accessible on the Internet
that's so much more flexible than
putting it in a box and giving it to
random stores right so that's just one
example of how the web you know kind of
changed day to day stuff but I don't
think it's going anywhere because now
people just take this connectivity for
granted it's almost assumed in many
day-to-day life for many people just
assumed everything we do is connected
it's assumed you can talk to people
around the world it's assumed we have
the network and that assumption isn't
going anywhere just because human nature
- once you get something you're used to
it and you're not gonna give it up too
easily like if you can't make phone
calls or talk on whatsapp to your
friends you might get a little upset so
that feeling of connectivity isn't going
anywhere people always want that there
it's an assumption now so that's why
it's not going anywhere and because of
that the Internet is not going anywhere
and so web programming is an item so
back to the main point of the video for
people that don't really like web
programming really think to yourself why
you don't like it I can understand if
you're like a pure technologist if
you've gone to school and if you've done
operating systems high-level Theory
you've done like compilers and you're a
super die-hard technologist I would see
you why web programming might be a
turn-off for you just because it's not
as technical as some of those other
things but I'm not gonna change the
minds of the die-hard technologist but
what you have to recognize is that the
one thing web programming provides is
that little bit of human part of it it's
like the ability to connect with
potentially millions billions of people
that's a very powerful thing not just
for businesses for communities for
people for politics all that stuff so
that's why the internet is what the
internet is today like if you're a super
technologist you just still just stay in
your cave pushing out the latest and
greatest compilers all the power to you
but for maybe the ninety five percent of
us the other
side of us you have to appreciate the
human side and that's still what the
majority of people are gonna use the
internet for so that's why I don't think
it's going anywhere I'm not gonna change
the minds of the super die-hard
technologists but if you really don't
want to learn web programming just ask
yourself why would you cut such a crazy
opportunity from what from your
knowledge base let's do a little bit of
an aside and I want to talk a little bit
more about like the guts of the
programming just look a little deeper
than what I have in because I've been
super high level for this so web
programming I don't want to make it
sound like it's so easy it's so like
it's trivial it's like nothing compared
to like processor design like web
programming has its own challenges and
they've been crazy there's been crazy
architecture systems developed it's not
a trivial thing it poses its own
challenge just think about the scale at
which like Amazon Google a lot of the
crazy web programming the web technology
companies operate this had a crazy level
and they've solved crazy problems to get
there so I don't mean to like belittle
or like make it sound like it's so easy
it has its own challenges if you get
into the world of web programming or web
development there's pretty much like a
bifurcation like this but this polar
opposite kind of thing going on but
that's pretty much I don't like the
words but it's front-end to back-end
some people like to call it product
engineering versus infrastructure
engineering whatever you want to call it
there's like a clear distinction so
let's just talk about the distinction a
little bit more right I'm going to call
the front I don't like the word
front-end so I'm gonna say the product
product side product engineering part of
web development that's what you're
building the services and products
you're building for your customers this
is the most flexible most dynamic part
of web programming because this is
always changing you've got to build this
feature that feature next milestone
you're gonna like review your website or
like upgrade your service this is
directly what service you provide to
your customers and that's always
changing so that's kind of like the
product or outward facing part
now the other side of that coin which a
lot of people call back in or whatever
or I'm gonna
I hate back in so I'm just gonna call it
infrastructure aside so if you if we
just talked about product level
engineering which is usually what the
customer sees the other side of that is
infrastructure and what I mean by
infrastructure is like all the
engineering that goes into hosting your
service scaling and making it available
to millions potentially billions of
people and that's also a difficult task
so this whole infrastructure part this
is usually this is how Amazon got famous
right you've obviously heard of Amazon
Web Services AWS all those crazy cloud
services they provide the whole purpose
of those services is so you could build
your own infrastructure for whatever web
application you want this whole
infrastructure part it's very it's
further away from the customer many
people consider it being a little more
technical like you don't have to worry
about oh the customer didn't like this
feature so so we should change it the
problems you're facing if you're working
on infrastructure is kind of like now we
have to support 10,000 requests per
second so there's different types of
problems and I like to think of it as
the current state of it now is almost
like a bunch of Legos and you pick and
choose the right Legos to solve your job
because in the infrastructure world it's
all been solved just look at the scale
of Amazon and Google look at the
billions whatever scale they operate
that it's crazy they've solved it and it
works and the amazon has made a business
out of it so they've solved their
scaling problem and then also they've
made it a service so you can use what
they've built to solve your problems so
if you ever look inside Amazon cloud
services they have tons of tools like
probably hundreds of different tools you
can use you just pick and choose
different ones of them different pieces
of those Legos and you can build your
own infrastructure so Amazon is really
smart because they've made a business
out of that whole infrastructure and
many of us we don't have to reinvent the
wheel we just pick and choose the
various pieces of that we want that
database we want that kind of web server
we want that kind of whatever we pick
and choose and we set up our own
infrastructure so
that's the current state of that and
some people might call it more technical
but it's just different it's like the
foundation you build it so at the top
your building application level software
for customers right and then it's got a
run on something and that's usually the
infrastructure and infrastructure for
web program being in specific it's
nothing new like it's been solved you
just got to pick and choose like what
you want to do with it all right time to
wrap up this video I've been talking way
too long but long story short is that
Internet it's not going anywhere if
you're watching this video or you're the
ones that send me the email saying you
really don't like web programming really
think to yourself why do you not like it
because it's actually a very powerful
thing if you want to stay working on
compilers in your cave all the power to
you just keep doing that but you have to
respect the human factor the power of
having everyone in the world being
connected and having access to that and
now since we just take that for granted
it's not going anywhere we're not let's
be real with ourselves we're not gonna
give up the internet one day now it's
just a normal part of life so that web
programming is very important to learn
and that's almost like basic stuff now
right so people are saying AI is basic
stuff right now so at the least you can
do is also understand how the web works
so one thing I forgot to talk about was
just my personal thing and what happened
after 2008 so like I said like 2008 I
did a summer of web technologies and I
just dismissed it a lot right I'll
sneaking cool courses in school like
computer architecture and then stuff and
why was I styling CSS but after school I
tried to stay away from it as far as I
could that's almost one of the reasons
why I did became an embedded developer
just ready see assembly doing C++ for a
while but I don't have a good reason for
switching all I can say was all I did
was follow the trends just like anyone
else like I'm susceptible to all those
trends when I heard about all those
cools to look in Bali startups like all
these cool web technologies so many
different jobs I was just the reason why
I switched out of that hole
betted world was just to follow the
trend and after i falled it a little bit
i started to appreciate it a little more
I mean there's obviously the clear thing
is that benefits from you have high
flexibility and jobs probably the most
in demand I'm sure many of you know that
if you're job hunting there's many more
jobs doing just web dev stuff and
writing assembly right so no question it
gives you a little more flexibility of
where you can choose to work or where
you can actually build but I didn't like
see the light when I switched for me it
was very simple just another engineer
trying to follow the trends and then
after I followed them a little bit I
started to appreciate it a little more
so it's not a really good reason but
it's honestly the truth just following
the trends and now I feel like you it's
hard to appreciate something before you
really do it but after you kind of see
what it can do you appreciate it a
little more so that's the least I could
do this whole point of my video is that
if you're one of those people that is
really like a stickler you don't like
web technology I'm just going to tell
you right now that just do a little bit
try to appreciate it for what it is and
maybe you'll see it you'll be more open
to it alright so that's all I have to
say for this video it's been too long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
