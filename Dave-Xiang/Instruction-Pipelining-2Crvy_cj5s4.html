and we're going to talk about
instruction pipelining and this is a
follow up video to I think my
instruction level parallelism video so
I'm just going to link to it right here
something and just check that out real
quick if you haven't seen it yet just
the recap ILP is a hardware and software
collaborative technique to increase the
efficiency of a processor if there's
really limited hardware and really
limited hardware capabilities there's
only so much a CPU can do despite having
really really high end software also
hero super beefed up like a really
strong CPU but your software sucks then
there's only so much the CPU can do
right so that's why it's a collaborative
effort so there are many many many
techniques to improve the instruction
level parallelism or ILP in a processor
and this concept of pipelining is just
one out of many techniques for this and
that's where we're going to go over in
this video instruction level pipelining
is actually a really simple concept you
see in everyday life and this video I'm
just going to use it to go over some
intuition concepts and I'll probably
make a follow up video on a little more
of the details and exactly how it works
inside a processor but this video we're
going to talk more high-level so we're
going to introduce instruction
pipelining with a real world example and
it's going to be doing laundry ok this
is the example I was introduced with in
school and I think it's a pretty
intuitive way to think about how
pipelining works so how exactly do we do
laundry well let's just break down an
instruction perhaps we have a do laundry
instruction and it consists of two major
steps the first step is wash your
clothes the second step is dry your
clothes we need two pieces of hardware
to do this let's say we have a washer to
wash the clothes that we have a dryer to
dry their clothes pretty simple right
and let's say each one takes 30 minutes
so first question is we have one batch
of clothes how long is it going to take
to do our do
laundry function do you have a guess if
we have just one batch of clothes we're
going to wash them in the washer first
right 30 minutes then we're going to dry
them in the dryer after that's done
another 30 minutes and it's going to
take one hour to finish okay now let's
move on and try washing two batches of
clothes and see what's the most
intuitive and efficient way to do this
let's just try to do this like as if we
were doing it in real life what we would
do we'll take our first batch of clothes
and just start washing it that takes 30
minutes and when that's done we're going
to put it in the dryer but then we can
start taking our second batch of clothes
and start washing that as well right
well the first one is drawing after
that's done the first set is done and
all we have to do is take our second set
of clothes and dry them and we'll be
done so this whole process actually
takes 90 minutes let's just rewind that
real quick and think about the most
stupid way to wash two batches of
clothes well the stupid way would be
take the first batch wash it dry it then
take the second batch wash it dry it and
that whole process would take 120
minutes or two hours right the reason
why we could do it in 90 minutes is
because of pipelining while we were
drying the first set of clothes we
already started washing the second set
of clothes this is essentially what
pipelining is the concept of pipelining
happens all the time throughout life and
I think once you realize kind of how its
broken down in a series of steps you
start seeing it everywhere like in
kitchens and assembly lines how you do
your laundry it's just all over the
place so the number one takeaway out of
pipelining is that we need two things to
happen we need to take a big process
called do laundry and we need to break
it up in two steps the first step is
washing our clothes the second step is
drawing our clothes the next requirement
for pipeline to even work is that we
need the appropriate hardware to do both
of these steps at the same time that's
why we need a washer and a dryer let's
suppose we have a different set of
hardware okay
have you guys ever heard of the
is washing machines which are like a
washer and a dryer combined in the same
machine I used to have one of those at
my apartment it's like just one box but
it does washing and drying if I have a
washer and dryer a combined washer and
dryer that takes one hour to do both the
washing and drying do you think it's
even possible for me to finish two
batches of clothes in 90 minutes it's
it's not possible right I have to do the
first batch first wafer to complete 60
minutes then do the second batch another
60 minutes and the whole thing would
take two hours the moment I got a
separate washer and a separate dryer so
I can wash and dry at the same time it
actually enables the pipelining and
that's how we got the thing done in 90
minutes all right guys I'm actually
going to stop the video here because I
don't want to get into too many of the
nitty gritty details of how pipelining
works in a real CPU but I just wanted to
go over some of the intuition about how
this concept applies in real life I'm
not going to go into it too much now but
inside a real processor every single
instruction like add is broken up into a
lot of different steps and there's
special hardware to do each step I'll go
into those details in another video when
we have more time but I just want this
cost of the pipelining the syncing with
everybody and just think about it just
think about doing laundry once you start
understanding this concept you start
just seeing it all over the place and I
find myself sometimes complaining about
it and I think you'll start complaining
about it too next time you're at a
cafeteria or a deli ordering a sandwich
you're going to be like crap I wish this
whole thing was pipelined a little
better this is so terrible hope you
enjoyed this video it's just an
intuition video and talking about this
concept pipelining is just an everyday
concept in everyday life but it's also
one of the most fundamental concepts in
computer hardware so it's really good to
understand it but it's actually in the
end it's really simple so I hope you
enjoyed the video please please press

you want to see more cool videos every
week
and have a great day all right take it
