doing really really well going to be a
casual relaxed hangout kind of webcast
this week is going to be a little
technical so if you're not in the mood
for anything technical you can leave but
we're going to talk through some numbers
specifically this idea of or this title
numbers everyone should know from Jeff D
so Fred I just learned about this guy so
apparently Jeff Dean is like this super
famous Google fellow person
he's been at Google since the 90s and
he's like a fellow which pretty much
means he's insanely smartest and has
probably designed like most of Google as
you know it this is like a PowerPoint he
gave about software engineering advice
from building large-scale distributed
system so if you get a chance you should
definitely check out his presentation he
talks about some good stuff but one
point that he made that kind of
resonated with everyone and now this
little thing this little title or phrase
is coined by his name or coined by him
numbers everyone should know and a lot
of people refer to this but he pretty
much gives this cheat sheet of how long
things take and it's all relative to
each other but when you see them all
side-by-side you can kind of get a
feeling of like how crazy it is like you
know in like elementary school when they
put the planets next to each other then
the solar system next to the planets and
then the Milky Way or whatever it's kind
of like that so it's just insane orders
of magnitude of how long stuff takes and
that's what we're going to talk about so
first thing is numbers let's just look
at these numbers you don't have to know
what all this stuff on the Left means
we'll talk through some of them but some
of them but the first thing to notice is
just take a look at the raw numbers NS
is nanoseconds so there's a billion
nanoseconds in a second and the list
just goes fastest to slowest so just
look on the right don't look on the left
yet it just goes fastest to slowest l1
cache reference is 0.5 nanoseconds and
then this thing sending a packet from
California to the nether
to California essentially around the
world that takes 150 million
nanoseconds or 150 milliseconds so just
to give everyone a perspective of this a
little bit more if you imagine this is
one second just imagine this is one
second let's see how long this is so
let's just do that real quick but
imagine this NS instead of NS is just
seconds so we have 150 million is that
150 million seconds there's 60 seconds
in a minute
there are 16 minutes in an hour and then
there's 24 hours in a day so that's how
many days it is so if this top thing was
a second that would take 100 1736 days
and what is that that's like four point
seven years so that's just to get a
sense of the magnitude of the scale okay
everything has increasing orders of
magnitude which makes it even crazy so
when this if this were one second this
would be almost five years okay so
that's just a sense of what we're
dealing with here so let's just talk
about the first one first and we'll talk
all the way through most of these
important ones we won't talk about every
single one all right let's talk about
this first one real quick l1 cache
reference it sounds really complicated
but we'll break it down so pretty much
were we the only thing this first line
means is l1 cache reference takes one
nano second or half a nanosecond
so first let's just get some context
when you go to Best Buy and you buy a
processor it's like 1 gigahertz right so
what does 1 gigahertz actually mean 1
gigahertz that's a measure of frequency
and that means your processor runs at a
billion cycles per second a gigahertz is
a billion just trust me on that but so
most processors run the order on the
order of billions of cycles per second
and if you do the reverse math of that
it's roughly a nanosecond per cycle so
billions of cycles per second is roughly
nanosecond per cycle so in other words
what this is really saying is if the l1
cache reference takes about you know one
nanosecond to get done that pretty much
means they can get done in one clock
cycle and that's literally the fastest
that is the fastest computer can operate
in one cycle that that's as low as it
gets you can operate in half a cycle if
you can finish something in one cycle
that is the fastest possible thing note
that no.2 computing so so what does this
mean let's just like actually what this
is mean it it's not really it's a little
cryptic but we can break it down so
let's just take a look at some
processors so I got some pictures here
this is like a fancy a seven Apple
processor you know I think you guys have
seen it it's those little black squares
you put on your motherboards or you see
in the phones we break them out but this
is the a7 processor this is already
really old there's already eight eight
eight nine I'm just using it as an
example but I'm sure everyone have seen
those little squares before they're also
called dyes so what's inside this black
what's inside this black thing so what's
inside this black thing is a system it's
actually this red thing so this red box
is this black thing
so just associate that to but what
you're seeing here is actually all the
transistors all the metal laid out and
it's just covered by this nice plastic
thing but inside it's this so what l1
cache reference means it means how long
does it take the CPU to access the l1
memory which is right here so you can
see there's two l1 memories here there's
probably actually a dual-core CPU going
on here and they both have an l1 cache
and they both share an l2 cache but this
first line that we were just looking at
l1 cache reference is how long the CPU
takes one cycle remember how long the
CPU takes to access l1 so it's literally
this this little distance where
electricity is going through this little
distance that takes about a nanosecond
so that's just to give you a sense of
how long things take
and when you're acting on this level
when things are so close together this
is when distance actually makes it
different so see how the l2 is a little
further away from the CPU than L 1 that
means the CPU to access l2 memory it's
going to take longer for the CPU because
it's physically a little further away
than l1 and line 3 here you can see how
L 2 cache reference is 7 nanoseconds so
that's about 14 times slower than l1
cache reference but you know when you
break it down on this level like the
metal level it's literally just the
distance right it's just a distance away
from the CPU so this big red block is
the a7 and this is like the you know
sexy marketing picture of an a7 but
here's something which is a little more
concrete this is actually the diagram of
the actual hardware if you open up an
iPhone you would see this so you can see
the a7 thing is right here I don't know
why it's gray and other pictures black
but pretty much that's the a7 and
there's a bunch of other components on
this thing so let's take a look at this
second bullet so this second bullet is
Elpida
whatever whatever lpddr3 SDRAM so pretty
much that turquoise color or that
greenish color that is your main memory
and this one in this iPhone it's Elpida
SDRAM and I think this version of the
iPhone had a gig of this so this is your
main memory right here alright and
that's really important because also our
processor accesses main memory very
often like it's going from this a7 thing
to the Elpida Ram very very often so
that's important because main memory
access is also a very important thing
that we want a time so a main memory
reference how long that takes is going
to be a hundred nanosecond so this is
already a hundred times slower than l1
cache reference but this is if you want
to access main memory or read data from
main memory this is going to be
how long it takes and what exactly is
main memory well main memory it's not
that crazy main memory is literally the
processor inside that a7 accessing this
Ram over here alright so just to give
you a sense and even with everything
when you measure this it's literally
just distance because remember when we
were back on the processor look how
close these two things are CPU to l1 but
now if you want to go CPU to main memory
which is also a very common task you got
to go CPU you got to go to this main
memory interface once you hit that
interface then you're going to go over
to this green block and then you can
read main memory and all that stuff that
whole thing that's going to take 100
nanoseconds just to reference it but if
you actually want to read it it
definitely takes a little longer so
that's the next level of how long
strings take if you're over here this is
almost instantaneous the next level is
going to be reading from processor to
memory and this is what it like
physically looks like alright so we
talked a little bit about memory and you
can see how these first see these first
three things our processor related then
we get into how we reference memory and
referencing memory is also very very
fast but the next thing that I'm sure
everyone knows about but accessing
memories fast and accessing disk is
really really slow so you can see how
the disk stuff these three lines like
read one megabytes sequentially from
disk that's going to take 30
milliseconds and the computer time
that's already really really slow we're
already getting to like the years like
we're already at the bottom so reading
anything from disk is really really slow
and what does that look like physically
but we can break that down too so if we
go back to this diagram do you see this
third one here Toshiba whatever whatever
whatever 128 gigabytes NAND flash but
this is a cell phone so it's using a
NAND flash memory which is faster than a
normal spinning hard drive but it's
still in the sense of our word
it's going to be discs so this thing
this brown box that's going to be the
disc so to speak for this system and
it's you can see how it's even farther
away from the processor and this is
actually very very slow to access and
the general rule of thumb is the bigger
the memory gets the slower it is to
access and the smaller the memory is the
faster it is to access so getting from
this a7 pink thing all the way over to
this Toshiba thing and the brown that's
going to take a really really long time
and that's what they're saying here that
this seeking and reading stuff from disk
this takes so long just remember our
analogy this up here that's second if
this were second this stuff down here is
going to be years so it takes crazy long
in computer time so everything we talked
about was for one little computer like
all the stuff we talked about here
that's just inside one iPhone right all
these other numbers here they're
actually referring to network stuff
actually when we send data over the
internet like sending one kilobyte over
the gigabit network takes 10,000
nanoseconds or this one is actually
really cool to think about this is
sending a packet from California to the
Netherlands back to California and that
takes 150 milliseconds and we obviously
this is really slow in computer time but
this is sending a packet around the
world in 100 to 150 milliseconds which
actually if you think about that in the
real world that's pretty crazy this is
actually kind of close to the speed of
light so let's just take the speed of
light so the speed of light travels
around the world 7.5 times in a second
so one second is a thousand milliseconds
and it's speed of light can travel in
7.5 times that means it's going to take
133 milliseconds
through the speed of light to go around
the world one time
so honestly 133 milliseconds to 150
milliseconds around the world you can
see like this is not quite the speed of
light but it's on the same order of
magnitude as speed of light like you're
sending data across all these wires
under the ocean whatever whatever in 115
milliseconds and it's slow in computer
times but still this is really fast this
is like on the order of breaking into
the speed of light and to wrap this up
what I want to give everyone a context
with is I was googling this but what is
the average human response time and the
average human response time is 0.25
seconds
that's about 250 milliseconds so I think
for you or me or for anyone that's not a
gamer you know our response time is like
100 to 200 milliseconds when things are
lagging by like 200 milliseconds we can
probably notice but if something is
lagging only by 100 or 50 milliseconds
we can't really notice that at all so
even though this is so slow in computer
times it's almost the speed of light the
normal person would not even be able to
detect a hundredth of the millisecond
difference so that's pretty crazy like
that's the scale we're operating at when
we go from computer land to look
real-life land and it's just a little
while to think about like these packets
are almost traveling at the speed of
light and still this is years and this
stuff is second so just food for thought
guys but it's crazy stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
