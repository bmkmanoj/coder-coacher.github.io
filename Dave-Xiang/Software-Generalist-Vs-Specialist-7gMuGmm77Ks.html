doing really really well of course last
video I did a comparison between junior
and senior developers I think I think
the video was well-received so today I'm
gonna do another comparison video but
this time it's gonna be between
generalist and specialist so breakdown
of the video three important points I
want to talk about we're just gonna get
through them and hopefully it's helpful
alright let's get started before we get
into it I think it just needs another
introduction sorry for people that might
not be familiar with the words
generalist or what they mean generalists
versus specialist so for this video
everything we talked about is in the
context of software development coding
computers there's a lot of people that
think software is just synonymous with
tech which is wrong these days so if you
want to become a neuro network designer
if you want to become this insane
computational neuroscientist that's a
very very different track than learning
how to code alright so just make sure
you separate those two so a software
generalist my opinion of what this means
is that you can give this kind of person
a very abstract problem and he or she
will be able to solve it so it's just
like a random business person has an
idea of something hey I want to make an
alcohol cookie delivery service if you
give that problem to a generalist he or
she will have all the right tools be
flexible be able to work in different
environments to solve that problem on a
macro scale now on the flip side of that
on the other side of the spectrum let's
talk about specialist specialists more
often they don't solve really abstract
broad problems when you hire a
specialist or when you talk with a
specialist you know exactly what they're
good at and that's the job they're gonna
do you're not gonna ask a specialist to
hey build my pizza delivery service
you're just gonna ask them very very
specifically I need you to build the
algorithm for my pizza delivery service
and that's it so specialists they're
just really really good at one thing
they know they're good at one thing and
you hire them to be good at that one
thing all right so I hope everyone's
getting a gist of what these two things
kind of represent there's a quick inch
but now my three most important points
of what to remember when considering
these two styles so first you always
have to be a generalist before you
become a specialist this is another
fancy way of saying learn your
foundation first but more often than not
a specialist is kind of created from a
generalist at first I think eventually
all of us naturally in life as we just
progress in life we find things that
we're good at and we try to push those
things out a little bit more so I think
naturally stuff I'm trying to work on
everyone is trying to work on is that
you always always start as a generalist
being flexible knowing how the big
picture works and eventually when you
find something you're very passionate
about or something that speaks to you
you start slowly becoming a specialist
and I think this is only natural but
remember the progression is always
generalist first and then you become a
specialist and it doesn't go the other
way around
point number two very important point
but point number two between generalists
and specialists is the mindset and this
is very very important because it Maps
very closely to your personality various
personalities are drawn to different
sides of the spectrum so first let's
talk about the mindset and personality
of a generalist I think a generalist is
very flexible very open-minded they like
taking this large unknown problem and
potentially implementing a basic
solution for this problem they're
flexible they can jump around different
technologies they don't mind they can
work with a diverse set of people they
just like working on the problem more so
than working on the tech if that makes
sense but that's kind of the personality
of the generalist you can dive into any
problem you just like solving anything
and your mind is very open very flexible
okay so now let's talk about the
personality and mindset of the
specialist
I think the specialist is a little more
elites he or she knows what they're good
at and what they provide what they
provide most value in they don't care
about flexible problems building a
business person's idea from scratch if
you tell a specialist that just build
your random pizza delivery service
they're gonna be like no no no have
someone else do that come back to me
when you need real help so maybe a
generalist would build the MVP maybe a
generalist builds the found a
of a pizza delivery service but they
grow so so large that now they need
technical operations now they need a
crazy security expert because the pizza
operation is so large well when that
happens you have a very very specific
need you have to bring in the elite
people I need a security expert so I'm
gonna hire Joe because he dominates
security so if that's your personality
the personality of a specialist is very
I'm good at this I know I'm good at this
and this is the value I provide so point
number two this point about personality
I think is the most overlooked points
because most people try to decide what
they're gonna do based on what the
market says or what's most sexy but
really a lot of it is dependent on just
your personal your personality so what
you like doing are you more of an
elitist are you more flexible like do
you like working with a lot of different
people or do you like working on one
thing but just usually you have to take
your personality into account a little
bit more when deciding will kind of
tracked it take instead of trying to
look at the market or the trends or
whatever just what are you drawn to you
what part of the spectrum do you lie and
not be maybe a better indicator of what
kind of path to take last but not least
we have to talk about job prospects
Wow i sat next to construction there's
nothing I can do it's already too late I
have to I'm going to talk over it I have
to so job prospects but obviously if
you're a specialist you're specialized
or less jobs and the companies are gonna
pay you more to do that one thing really
really well you're probably not suited
for a small company for start-up where
you have to wear a lot of different hats
specialists usually go to larger
corporations that know exactly what they
want so what that means is you'll
probably go to the Rd Department of a
big company or you're gonna be the
security guy at a really big company or
you're the network guy you're the AI guy
but you usually go to a larger place
because they can pay you more obviously
but they also know exactly what they
need you to do now for the generalist
obviously generalist there's a lot more
of you there's a lot more of us so
there's many more jobs there's still a
lot of job opportunity we get paid a
little less than the specialist but it's
a little more flexible because that's
the whole point right you're a
generalist you can work in many many
different environments on many different
things one thing that generalists are
particularly good at I think is working
at a start-up because startups are so
open-ended you solve very vague abstract
problems you shift a lot so that mindset
and the skill set of a generalist is
particularly suited for the startup in
addition to that I don't want to say
that generalists can't work at big
companies because the big companies like
Amazon Google and Facebook they need a
ton a ton of generalist as well those
big companies they're always creating
new products creating new services
thinking about all the different
products that Google creates so those
companies they're always they're still
shifting they're still making new things
and they need flexible people to you
know point them in different directions
just like okay we're cool drive now ok
Google Apps ok Google Plus or all these
different things but generalists they
have a place anywhere they can work at a
start-up they can work in big companies
there's always a demand for them because
they're flexible and they can work on
any
it's too loud it's too loud we have to
move
let's steal quick summary before signing
off but if you're thinking about this
problem a lot make sure don't try to
become a specialist before your
generalist don't try to just become
rocket scientist
straight out of college first thing you
can get there if you know the specialty
you want to go and that's your North
Star that's really good but remember
always there has to be some kind of
foundation and base first and for many
of us that starts as being a generalist
and we naturally move in a particular
direction second always remember to make
sure you take your personality into
account don't just try to go with the
markets and the trends different
personalities match the spectrum a
little bit more
remember open-mindedness versus I'm
super good at this finally if you work
for a while you kind of have a idea of
your personality you know if you like
open-ended problems or you know you like
working on very very specific things but
once that happens the decisions you
choose to place yourselves on your path
start becoming a little more clear so if
you're a specialist you might want to
surround yourself with more specialist
if you want to build rockets maybe you
got to go to SpaceX and build more
rockets with Elon Musk or something but
if you're a generalist you just like
solving problems rather than solving
specific technology maybe you want to go
work at a healthcare start-up because
you care about health care you want to
go into education and share your
software knowledge with a lot of people
so after you kind of figure out your
personality then you can kind of choose
your path a little bit better so that's
it for the video hope it was helpful
just spitballing on what I think are the
major major differences between these
two different styles generalist versus
specialist everyone you're all going to
find it you'll find out what clicks for
you and
like the video share the video give me a
thumbs up leave me a comment all the
good stuff and better audio next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
