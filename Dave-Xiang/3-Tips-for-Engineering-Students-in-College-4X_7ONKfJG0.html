is for engineering students or soon to
be engineering students I'm going to
give three tips for college specifically
around engineering but it all revolves
around time management which is
everything the people that can manage
their time well are the ones that can
get a 4.0 and still play video games and
everyone else that doesn't manage your
time well those are the people pulling
all-nighters
time management leads to less
all-nighters less time in the sticky
computer lab more time to hang out with
your friends more time to drink more
time to play Smash Brothers you know all
in all you need time management if you
want to do well three tips for
engineering students in college all
around time management let's do my first
thing is to just prepare for the lecture
and you would not believe how much time
this saves 90% of students go to a
lecture without preparing and they
retain like 10 percent of it and if you
fall asleep in class you retain zero
percent of it you have the syllabus and
you have the notes on exactly what the
professor is going to cover in each
lecture what's really good to do is
before the lecture just spent 30 minutes
to power and prepared and read a little
bit about what the professor is going to
talk about I didn't do this personally
for some of my heart engineering classes
when I started college and it killed me
killed me after lecturers are over or
when I was starting my homeworks I
realized I didn't retain anything from
the class so after each lecture I have
to spend like three to five hours just
going over the notes reading the
textbook and making sure I understood
things again a little bit of prep goes a
long way and you don't have to play
catch-up after the lectures over once
you start doing this just preparing for
the lecture you just get it you just
understand it more when the professor is
talking about it you don't waste your
time if you go in there and everything
is over your head you waste a ton of
your time the whole lecture is wasted
and then you waste like multiple hours
after election
just the ketchup my second advice for
engineering students revolves around
coding assignments which are sometimes
the hardest the thing you have to do the
moment you get your coding assignment
just to breathe through it all and
actually put it into your subconscious
actually it sounds a little fluffy but
it's really not it's like if someone
implants a problem in your brain you're
just going to think about it for a while
when you walk the class walk to the gym
go get your lunch you're going to
subconsciously think about this problem
let's just take two scenarios if you
read the assignment in its entirety
right when you get it you'll probably
have two to three weeks just to think
about it and complete it well but if you
just pick up the whole mark and the
coding the weekend before it's due you
don't even have time to think about it
and you probably won't even finish it
it's just planting the idea into your
head into your subconscious just read
through the assignment you don't really
have to start it or finish it on day one
just read it and figure out exactly what
you don't know remember you have to
figure out and know what you don't know
if you don't know what you don't know
you're really screwed use your
subconscious a little bit just implant
these problems as early as possible and
I promise this is going to save a lot of
time okay third and final tip about
saving time is to find a friend actually
of course you're going to have friends
all engineers are really social right
well I guess the point of this is that
it's really really good to find someone
to periodically sync up about what
you're working on find another person in
your class hopefully equal levels as you
you guys have to be around the same but
use that person to periodically sync up
and explain to them what you've been
working on then after you're done
explaining have them explain what
they've been working on to you I
guarantee you that if you spend some
time explaining what you've done you're
going to under
and it a lot better and you think it's
kind wasted just sitting with another
person go over anything so you've
already done but it's actually a lot of
time saved I promise this doesn't really
have to be your best friend it could
just be someone else in the class and I
promise they will greatly appreciate
anyone you ask me to do some work
together alright so time management is
really everything once you get your time
management down you won't even have to
stay up all night you can play your
League of Legends you can drink your
beer keg so have time to do that stuff
and still learn a ton of alright
guys hope this video was helpful for all
the students and potential students out
there a lot of time management things
helped me out a lot when I was in school
so hopefully you can use some of these
things please just drop me a comment if
you have any questions give me a thumbs
up and watch my video next week alright
take care and have a good week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
