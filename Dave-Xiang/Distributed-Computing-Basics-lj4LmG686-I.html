really really well screencast video this
week and I wanted to do a continuation
from another screencast I did which was
how does a computer work and where we
left off with that video was last time
we talked about how does one computer
work and I did two screencasts about
that and we left off saying how does
that lead to many computers working so
this video it's going to be distributed
computing basics distributed computing
101 but more than one computer so basic
prerequisites before we get started
please watch the other screencast first
how does a computer work two parts in
that video and also this internet
playlist that I have all these words
should mean something to you Internet
sockets IP web frameworks HTTP browsers
hosting if this is super does not make
sense to you maybe this video is not
going to make sense to you so check that
out first and I have to think of a
better way to group all this stuff
together because YouTube and playlist is
not the optimal way to group things so
maybe I have to make like a curriculum
or something but let's just take it up
where we left off last time so we talked
about this concept of inter-process
communication on one computer last time
when multiple processes can talk to each
other so what does that really mean for
a network right if you think about it
all networked information movement is
inherently interprocess because they're
on different computers your browser
right now it's a different computer it's
a different process than the YouTube
server process that's running so of
course nowhere communication is going to
be a form of inter process communication
but it's almost just a given so people
don't call it that people don't call now
or communication IPC or inter process we
just call it distributed computing and
this quick video is going to showcase
two broad strategies or styles of doing
communication between computers so the
thing I want to introduce the whole
concept of this video is these two
categories that sink
versus asynchronous communication and
before we get started these are really
abstract concepts all right synchronous
and asynchronous do not refer to
anything that's concrete just think of
these as styles so there's many ways to
implement an asynchronous style of
communication likewise there are many
ways to implement a synchronous style of
communication so you can't say my system
is implemented asynchronously because
that sentence is meaningless right these
are just abstract concepts and we're
going to talk a little bit
implementation to later in this video so
first I just want to talk synchronous
style because this is what everyone is
used to I'm a lot of examples in this
video but this is the most common
example of synchronous style of
communication is your standard blocking
HTTP call everyone's used to this if
you're a developer you must be used to
this this is where you hit an endpoint
or you go to a web page and you make a
blocking HTTP call to some resource on
the Internet
so this is pretty easy but the flow goes
something like this client makes a
request and waits service gets the
request does something after it's
finished doing something it sends a
response back to the client client gets
the response and resumes wherever they
left off right and these colors are just
symbolizing different processes so this
is blocking from the sense of the client
right
when step one happens the client can't
progress until steps two and three on
the server finish so the client will not
move forward until that request comes
black comes back so that's kind of the
essence of blocking and that's what
makes it synchronous all right just let
that sink in for a bit and I think it's
gonna make more clear sense when we
compare it with asynchronous stuff but
on the back end the server could process
the request in many different ways
steps two and three is the back end
server processing whatever you requested
but it could do it many different ways
it could be
it could be fast it could hit a database
it could hit a cache it could write a
file it could read a file they can do
whatever it wants but all it needs to do
is at the end of the day it has to send
back the response back to the client to
unblock it you can't just stall out and
like you can't take more than ten
seconds 20 seconds after sometime if you
do not respond to the client something
is going to timeout the server should
timeout or the client will just close
the request and move on so this is the
essence of blocking and I hope that
makes sense so when things get a little
more cool is when we kind of talk about
asynchronous style of communication and
before I get into what this really means
remember this is abstract this means
nothing if you say it just like this
it's just asynchronous as a style and
the example I want to use as amazon.com
so what exactly happens when you click
confirm purchase on Amazon what do you
think happens on their system I don't
really know but I'm gonna guess a lot of
things okay so what do you physically
see what do you physically see can't
type sorry
what do you physically see when you
press this button on Amazon well your
computer usually gets redirected to a
success screen that says thanks Bob for
your purchase please shop with us again
that's what you see as a client right
and you continue your day with your
shopping you're not blocked by anything
so let's talk about what's more
interesting which is what you do not see
what do you not see when you click
confirm purchase on Amazon but this
pretty much kicks off a lot of Amazon's
back-end services I don't work at Amazon
I don't I know a couple people that work
but this is only my guess what's
happening so Amazon's payment system
kicks in to withdraw from your bank
account
Amazon's inventory system kicks in to
track the item attract the item count of
what you just bought you know items
available - - Amazon's analytics gets an
update with your purchase statistics so
machine learning kicks in models are
retrained
your recommendations are improved Amazon
vendors have to get notified to start
preparing the items you just bought to
ship them Amazon Dispatch has to be
notified to make sure you get then the
warehouse is ready to deliver your
product within two days so just infinite
stuff this is like there must be so many
things that are kicked off an Amazon
system when you press that green button
that I can't even fathom it but this is
just my best guess at the big ones so I
think at this point you should be
getting the picture of what's happening
when you press confirm this is a very
asynchronous style of experience so the
summary I want to get across with this
Amazon example is that this kind of
experience is very asynchronous because
you can keep moving on to do your
shopping while things are happening in
the background you don't have to wait
for all this stuff to happen it's
happening what after you click the
button but you can still continue
shopping so just imagine what if this
was a synchronous experience right if
this was a very synchronous transaction
you would have to wait for all those
back-end services to complete before
moving on and it would probably be a
very terrible user experience this is a
very common case where a lot one button
creates a lot of things in the
background that are done at some later
point in time but there are still times
when we need very synchronous
transactions and I have a couple
examples here so there are cases when
things should be very synchronous
blocking so if you're transferring money
to and from bank accounts or you're
handling a very precious type of
transaction in your favorite video game
the application might actually elect or
opt to block and wait until everything
is successful but tell me before telling
you that everything is okay so there are
some situations where it will be a
synchronous kind of experience where you
have to wait until everything is good to
go before moving on but many times when
you click buttons on websites like this
a lot of stuff is happening in the
background that you don't know about and
that's the essence of any synchronous
so let's just keep it moving hopefully
that distinction is now clear right just
a quick recap before we move on but you
should be getting a feel for sync versus
async async' is more interesting so
let's just talk about it a little more
and get a little less abstract all right
the first common way to do asynchronous
communication is something called
Message Queuing and this is really a
common way that notifications are passed
throughout a large system so we can just
go back to our Amazon example but the
moment we press confirm purchase a
special message and payload is generated
and put into a queue a message queue for
processing so imagine a payload
something like this purchase item on
website item ID date user me user ID I
paid 350 bucks for this it's not prime
special instructions please put a ribbon
on my package so other systems in Amazon
have the ability to observe messages in
the queue and you know this payload was
generated when I pressed some button so
when this payload is broadcasted the
payments analytics inventory system
they're all going to kick in they're
gonna kind of say oh Dave just purchased
something let me kick off my special
processes and workflows to handle that
so this general style of communication
is also known as pub/sub or publisher
subscriber you might have heard this
phrase before but it's a very broadcast
style of communication so it's like just
broadcast something and if you if that's
important to you do something but I'm
just broadcasting this so with that said
I also want to say message queues in
general are very flexible so pub/sub is
not the only style of Message Queuing
you can use message queues in very
different ways you can use it to
communicate directly between two
computers so if the website the website
amazon website could send very
specialized messages to Amazon Payments
be a very special message queue and it
doesn't have to blast out the whole
system alright so message queues are
very very common technique and way
different parts of the system
communicate asynchronously all right
hope that makes sense the last one I
want to talk about is a very easy one
another very common form of asynchronous
communication and that's this concept of
web hooks so it sounds complicated it's
not complicated this is very simple the
only mental model you need for this idea
is that think of these as callbacks
between computers
okay callbacks between computers for all
the programmers watching this you should
be familiar with coding or programmatic
callbacks like execute this thing first
and then call this function when it's
done or execute this request and call my
success function if nothing broke
execute this request then call my fale
function if something broke right these
are all special callbacks based on
certain scenarios so web hooks all a web
hook is is essentially callbacks between
computers all right that's the mental
model and just keep that in the back of
your brain so one example I thought of
this like syncing with Salesforce
alright this is very common whoops
so you're a software developer you
decide that you need to integrate with
Salesforce Salesforce is a very popular
sass platform to track your customers
you should have heard about this but
let's say you want to keep important
copy of Salesforce data on your system
to track some kind of analytics how do
you keep those two different systems in
sync one really easy way to do it that's
kind of you know maybe a little
error-prone or slow but you could re in
port the data every hour every night and
that's kind of cool you could just
resync it whenever you want but what
happens to the data changes very fast
what happens if you have 1,000 employees
updating Salesforce data all the time
how do you keep it all in sync
Salesforce is like somewhere in the
cloud it's outside your control so how
do you how do you manage to sync that
data with your system you can do that
with something called web hooks so all
you do is you pretty much tell
Salesforce hey anytime data changes on
your system I want you to call this
special web hook
or callback which hits my system so I'll
say that again anytime data changes on
your system I want you to call this
special web hook which hits my system so
the flow is kind of like this an
employee logs into Salesforce changes a
user's email address on the Salesforce
website right Salesforce calls a special
registered web hook which hits your
application so the moment Salesforce
recognizes that a user has changed its
data it's going to call a special web
hook which is my super app Dave API
Salesforce user updated right and then
what happens is my app receives the call
from Salesforce and it does whatever it
has to do to sync up the stuff and they
can do this processing you know whenever
it needs to do so it's essentially a
callback I think you guys can just i've
elaborated it way too much but the very
essence of it is just a callback
function but just think of it as a
callback function between computers all
right so that's all I had for today just
made it in time just doing a basic recap
there's a lot more to talk about for
distributed computing but the essence is
how do multiple computers communicate
with each other and there's tons of
different ways peer-to-peer what we just
talked about client-server there's just
many different styles and it's pretty
much how huge systems on the internet
operate alright so I hope you enjoy the
video and let's talk more about this
next time all right guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
