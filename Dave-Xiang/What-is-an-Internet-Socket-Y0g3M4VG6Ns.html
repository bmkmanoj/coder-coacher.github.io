excited about the internet so let's just
keep the videos rolling about that last
week we talked about web framework
basics so if you haven't checked that
video out just go watch it real quick
but today we're just going to get a
little more low-level for all the
developers out there it'd be wise to
understand how the internet really works
but this video is not really about them
for this video we're just going to
assume the Internet Arby exists it's
huge it's out there everyone uses it and
it's just waiting for us to build stuff
on it so what are the fundamentals of
this and how do we build Network
applications today we're just going to
talk about two basic things web sockets
and internet connections I think I'll
make another video on web sockets but
it's just impossible to fit all those
details into this video and hold your
attention for more than five minutes all
right let's do this
at the end of the video you'll know what
an internet connection is and what a web
socket does let's do it you're sitting
at your computer right now watching this
YouTube video your computer is acting as
a client and YouTube is the server this
is a classic client-server model you
asked your waiter to get you a steak or
you asked YouTube to play you a video
client server
simple enough all right an internet
connection is very simple and it's
exactly what you think it is an internet
connection just connects two points on
the internet so that they can
communicate each other one process from
this computer can talk to another
process from that computer sometimes we
call this a point-to-point connection
that's the first basic part internet
connection just connecting two points
one-to-one internet connections are also
full duplex what does this mean it
sounds a little complicated but it's
really simple it just means data can
flow in either direction
you have two points you can set YouTube
data and also YouTube can send you data
back when there's a connection establish
data flows in both directions last point
to understand about an internet
connection is that it's reliable
reliable meaning that unless you yank
the plug from your computer or go into
the ocean and cut all the big internet
lines all the data is going to be
transferred to the other computer as
long as the connection is open reliable
pretty simple right it's reliable fully
duplex and point-to-point it sounds
pretty sweet when you say all those
words together
so where do sockets come into play here
a socket is just an end to one of these
connections so given any internet
connection
how many sokka's do we need to one
socket at your computer one socket at
YouTube for every single internet
connections we have exactly two sockets
this is really important to remember one
connection to sockets one connection to
sockets let's always remember that let's
break down sockets a little bit and they
always come in two parts an IP address
and a port to start let's just talk
about the socket that's on your computer
right now that has a connection to
YouTube on the left you have your IP
address and on the right of the colon
you have your port number when a socket
is on the client computer that is your
computer it actually gets a random port
number from the operating system right
now this port number is 1 3 3 7 it was
just randomly assigned now let's just
check out the socket on youtubes
computer on the left you have the
computer's domain name which is actually
equivalent to the IP address I'm just
putting youtube.com/ in there right now
and on the right you have its port
number which is 8080 is a standard port
number for all of web traffic
it's a very important number and we're
going to talk about why that's 80 and
you have a randomly assigned port number
so IP addresses are pretty easy to
understand it's just your identifier on
the internet every computer that exists
on the Internet has an IP through the
Madras it's pretty easy right it's just
your name now when it comes to ports
it's slightly more complicated
why does YouTube always have port 80 as
a server and why do you get a randomly
assigned port 1 3 3 7 let's just think
about it a little bit you and millions
and millions of other users are
connecting to YouTube
YouTube isn't connecting to your
computers as a client connecting to
YouTube you have to know exactly what
you want to connect you I want to
connect to YouTube at port 80 just
imagine if the YouTube servers assign
random port numbers you would try one oh
that doesn't work try 27
oh that doesn't work has to be a
well-defined port on the servers now
let's just consider your computer you
probably go on YouTube for a few minutes
right so your socket is actually very
short-lived YouTube needs to be up 24/7
in this system whoever does the
requesting or the client gets a random
port number because it's actually very
short-lived this special random port
number that your computer assigns to
your socket when you're making a request
it has a very special name it's called
the ephemeral port it sounds kind of
crazy but that's what it's called every
time your computer requests a different
web server YouTube reddit Google hotmail
your computer actually assigns an
ephemeral port or a Ren important for
those sockets when you make requests all
a connection is is really two sockets
one from the client and one on the
server you just have to remember that
the socket on the client is very
short-lived or ephemeral while the
socket on the servers are well defined
your computer and YouTube has a
point-to-point connection going on right
now just so you can watch this video if
you close this video you don't like my
face or you just close the tab that
connection is going to be closed the
length of these internet connections can
be they're really short or really long
if we just visit a simple page that gets
an HTML a really dummy page we'll have a
very short connection so the server can
send us back the HTML and that is going
to close that connection a connection
can also be open for a very long time
have you ever edited a Google Doc at the
same time so your friends were editing
them and you can see everyone's edits in
real time that real time editing in
Google Docs that works because while you
and your friends have those connections
open Google can relay the information to
everyone so you can all see everyone's
edits it's really cool every single
Network application out there every
single website you visit it's all based
on this fundamental concepts of internet
connection and sockets HTTP requests and
responses are built on sockets
connections and sockets are just the
fundamental way that programmers can
interface with the Internet it just
allows us to connect to any computer
it's so crazy you can just open up a
socket and connect to any computer on
the Internet
it's wild when you think about it all
right guys that's the end of the video
and it was a basic introduction to what
an internet connection is and what a
socket inherently does remember one
connection but two sockets connections
are reliable fully duplex and
point-to-point
if you forget what those fancy words
means just and rewind the video I hope
you guys learned something if you have
any questions about the
in turn it just feel free to ask me in
the comments give me a thumbs up if you
liked the video and I'll see you next
time all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
