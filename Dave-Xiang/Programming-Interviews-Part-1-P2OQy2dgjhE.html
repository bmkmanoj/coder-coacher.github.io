last week's video I was feeling pretty
crappy last week and my voice sounded
really bad so wouldn't have made for a
really good video feeling a lot better
this week so we're back at it with
another screencast type of video this
week I wanted to talk about programming
interviews I've received a lot of
questions via email and some comments
just regarding this topic I haven't
touched upon it all too much but it's a
pretty big topic a lot of details
nuances go in how this works and this
video will be dedicated on the process
and the flow and what you kind of expect
when going through this and specifically
programming interviews and if you're
watching and you're interested in
software you want to pursue software as
a career you will have to go through
some type of programming interviews
alright and yeah this is gonna be
dedicated to process and let's just
start first thing I got a lot of really
good points here from this really good
book I have and there's a lot of books
on programming interviews one that I
thought is really good was programming
interviews exposed let me just get you
guys the link yeah this book so this
book is actually quite helpful it's goes
through not only the process which we're
gonna I'm just pretty much gonna
regurgitate in this video but it goes
through also a lot of different topics
questions also goes through everything
till negotiation and a lot of stuff so
this is a really good book pretty much a
lot of the things we're gonna go through
in this screencast is just me repeating
and maybe adding two small points the
major ideas in this book so watch this
for sure but in the end and you're still
interested check out this book alright
alright let's just start making outline
for this whole process first thing that
you want to do is find out comfortable
is everything bold find a company
or position that interests you the most
and this is just the first start of the
process and this is just the part where
you have to do some introspection and
what do you want so instead of just
going out there and trying to execute
your search on everything under the Sun
it's a much better filter if the very
first step you take is just do a little
bit of introspection and ask yourself
what do you actually want and the best
way to do this is to ask your friends
what kind of job do you think you want
very much of the times what kind of jog
you think you want and you hear about
that job it's not actually it doesn't
sound that cool afterwards so the best
chart
best point of this is just ask your
friends first if they're working in any
type of software or programming position
what their job was like and see what you
think and also do a little research on
what different types of jobs are like at
different types of companies
so also companies vary in size positions
are also very different and different
jobs different companies you guys get
the idea
tons of combinations of this so know
what you want and try to filter that
down first let's just go through big
companies you know where to find them it
would be something like Apple if you
want to work at a big company a lot of
people talk about big floor I only want
to work at Microsoft for Google
obviously their jobs they're no secret
you can find them anywhere job
descriptions and probably more in-depth
information for all those big companies
it's very easy to find for start-up
companies it's also a little harder you
have to do a little digging yourself so
for smaller companies you definitely
have to dig and it's a little trickier
let me just get some tips on digging if
you're interested in a startup company
I'm gonna leave big companies at that
it's pretty much it so for start-up
companies one way is to go to a bunch of
VC websites DC is venture capital
websites and each venture capital
company will have portfolios of all the
companies they invest in with some BIOS
so actually this could be an interesting
way for you guys to find small companies
some VCS are very general some are very
specific like they only invest in like
green or environmental companies and
maybe that's where you want to work so
find a VC like that see where they've
invested in their portfolio and you can
find some companies that way you can
also read the startup press which is
well it's like a constant slow startup
news going in and out all day every day
so reading the press can give some
insight on different companies and
different industries and then overall
it's pretty much Google for press fun
racing stats and Industry so we just
covered press fundraising stats are
actually a cool point behind any startup
because this gives you insight onto how
big or how far along that small company
is actually doing obviously a company
like uber that is fundraise a lot and
it's quite big it's very different than
a small company and us fundraise very
little and this is all public
information so it's really easy for you
to find this if you just try and
obviously industry if you know what you
want or you feel you know some gravity
or affinity towards a particular
industry you can just search by that
alright so this is about finding
something that you think what do you
want and just do your own research first
before you start executing the search
itself because it's doing step one as
well or best you can it's going to make
stepped you much easier okay so once you
start once you've like asked yourself
what do you really want and filtered it
down a little bit you're gonna be
prepared to kind of start executing the
search and what I'm gonna do here is try
to give a list of how to execute the
search from the best option first to the
worst option last so this ordering is
important and it's just my opinion of
what's potentially the best way to go
about X
fusion of the search so first is
referral with your close friend and why
is this good because this is like the
closest most personal and easiest way to
find a position in any company not only
programming just overall so I'm the
friend you mutually respect and trust
they will know potentially also they'll
have insights on what you like what you
don't like and if they're at a position
at a company already they might know
that a position or job there might be a
good fit for you and they'll let the
company know and they'll let you know so
this is potentially the easiest and best
way to find any job this is also cool to
potentially even prevent the interview
so a lot of the times when referrals
come in there's already a set amount of
trust between the company and the
potential candidates so this sometimes
just even kind of bypasses programming
interviews because you're coming from a
closed source all right so that's first
referral with your close friend the next
is also really similar but it's going to
be a referral with your not so close
friends and this the reason why a is so
good but it's also super rare so many of
the times many referrals can come from
indirect friends or people you don't
know so well and even if this is just an
acquaintance maybe a professor or
somebody you might have just had one
group project with in class indirect
friends also expanded network
significantly and are probably the
second best way to get introductions to
a company so good points about this is
you have to be you have to be a bit
aggressive yourself to reach out to
these guys because since you're not
really close friend so then you're
pretty much doing you're not doing
anyone any favors this is for you right
so you have to be a little bit
aggressive on your end to reach out and
just be as
professional as possible like these
friends aren't very close so you should
treat all this interaction as
professionally as possible when you
asked to get introduction to set company
obviously part a these are your close
buddies it's a little more casual for
here just keep everything professional
and remember you're using your network
at this point another point is companies
still enjoy this a lot
whatever introduction they can get or a
recruiting manager you can get even
though it's from any type of
introduction rather than them reaching
out or them going through any other
system this is still really good so this
is just gonna tie tie off the loop on
referrals first try to do personal
referral second try to do kind of an
indirect referral let's keep moving on
the third one I'm gonna list as
potentially the easiest but this is also
a little bit of a double-edged sword and
we have to talk a little bit about
recruiting services so these are kind of
things like headhunters or recruiting
companies that are dedicated to trying
to find you a job and I'm sure once you
guys start looking you'll run to a lot
of these companies that are just kind of
in the realm of recruiting services
while I'm putting it here is that it's
very easy you kind of don't do very much
work because they find a lot of jobs for
you so you just kind of sit back you let
them know what you want and let them
know kind of what you're trying to
filter by and they will go out and try
to find positions for you but why I'm
also bad because they don't really know
you
so the bad part that I just want to
mention abusing recruiting services is
that in the end it's not as personal as
someone you might know or even they
don't know what you want right so
they're just trying to do their best to
make a commission make some money off
you get you a job it's gonna be very
easy on your part but in the end
recruiting services may or may not work
for you it hasn't worked for me in the
past but I just want to put it here a
third because is extremely easy to do
and yeah definitely check it out if you
want alright so let's just move on from
there okay so the next two ways to
execute the search are gonna be a little
less a little crappy to be honest so but
we have to listen out there because they
could still potentially be ways to
execute the search D I'm gonna put the
job fair and I really don't like these
job fairs and I started when I first
went to my first job fair
it sucked it was terrible and they
slowly got better as I got better at
them but I still want to put it here
because it can lead to some
opportunities but you just have to look
at jobs fair with the right perspective
to get the most out of it I think the
perspective that made me actually use
jobs fairs a little better is to kind of
use them as practice and it's it's
practice to communicate and present
yourself the best in like one minute so
at these job fairs it's quite
competitive there's a lot of people
talking to companies trying to look for
jobs you shouldn't consider job fairs as
the good way to find a job but what you
should do is just use it as like a like
a battlegrounds like a practice grounds
for you to just talk to people and
present yourself as best you can so I
use it kind of like as practice but in
the end it can still lead to some
opportunity so I'm putting it here and
this is probably the worst case I'm sure
all you guys know but this is all the
work yourself cold emails plus internet
so in the end after ABCD if you still
can't find any leads what you have to
resort to is doing all the legwork
yourself via email or just applying on
job portals on the internet so big
companies obviously will have job
portals where you have to make
portfolios to fill out all your details
write a cover letter all that stuff goes
into applying to jobs online it's sucky
grunt work and you just have to do it
sometimes you know I was all day doing
this for
like a whole semester in college at one
point and LinkedIn is also a good
research to get contacts and emails of
potential HR order people of making
recruiting decisions and if you find
their emails which should always be on
LinkedIn
especially refer recruiters that is
another way you can go about doing so
this work sucks I just want to reiterate
that but it's kind of like this sucks
but you got to do it so I'm putting it
last year but I'm not saying don't try
to do at all I think still maybe in the
end going through this kind of work is
still kind of gonna build your character
quote unquote and eventually move to
some interviews so don't forget even
though it's the worst all right guys so
I'm gonna wrap up the video here and
share this document let's just go over
quickly what it meant first those kind
of a little bit of the introspection the
finding what you want and then I kind of
went into the execution phase of it in
order so the ordering is important but
this is how to execute the job search
and hopefully after all this execution
you'll land some kind of interview and
I'm going to make another video
dedicated to this probably a part to you
but in part two we'll talk about the
actual interview steps themselves after
execution so we just went up to
execution once this is done you'll get
something and the interview starts so
that's going to be part two all right
guys so I'll see you in that to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
