doing really really well enjoying the
weekend I hope it's sunny wherever you
are but many people have asked or a few
people have asked why I haven't done
hardware or a low-level technical video
in a while and it has been a while so
this is a little overdue but I'm happy
to talk about this really cool
technology this really cool project
called ll the M so if you're interested
in understanding what it is plays a big
part in modern-day tech but we don't see
it because it's a very low-level thing
but it's very important very pervasive
first before we get deep into this video
there's a couple things you have to
baseline knowledge that you have to know
first I have four links in this video
and I think if you wash these in order
if you haven't seen any of these these
are my old videos but you should watch
these first before watching this video
so its basics on how CPU works
what's an instruction set architecture
what's a processor what does that mean
and also a high-level overview that I
give about how computers work so if you
haven't seen those videos wash them
first and you'll get a lot more out of
this video so do that and let's start so
first we need a very very high-level
abstract working knowledge of what LLVM
is and there's a simple sentence which
captures it LLVM is a collection of
compiler and tool chain technologies
we're going to talk about what exactly
these two bolded words mean compiler and
tool change but if you ever used GCC
before if you've ever written a little
bit of C or a little bit of C++ in a
class somewhere you've used GCC but LLVM
does exactly what GCC does but they're
very very different so first if you've
never done GCC let's just go through an
abstraction in your minds really quickly
so what is compiler but first don't
overcomplicate what a compiler is
they're very very complicated under the
hood but you have to keep somewhat of a
high level abstraction to just keep your
head straight remember always keep a
high level abstraction first before you
dig into the details or also details
make zero sense so all a compiler does
is take your source code
a bunch of stuff and translates it into
machine code that's the only abstraction
you have to remember and remember that
anything that needs to run on a CPU
anything that a processor runs has to be
in machine code a CPU doesn't understand
for loops while loops they don't
understand any of the code that we write
they have to understand machine
instructions and there's a ton a ton of
machine instruction so I took this
little snapshot from the GCC wiki page
but these are all the different our
construction set architectures all the
different architectures at GCC supports
and it's so many so I highlighted in red
some of the really popular ones x86
PowerPC arm you know arm is instruction
set popular for mobile devices that all
our cell phones x86 is more popular in
desktops but look at all these different
architectures that we have to compile
down for so this is what GCC supports
pretty much what this is saying is that
GCC can take your source code your C or
C++ source code and they can compile it
down to all these different machine
instructions which is pretty crazy okay
so now you're kind of aware of what a
compiler does what's the abstraction for
a compiler but the second part of this
definition LLVM is a collection of
compiler and tool chain technologies so
what exactly is a tool chain that's kind
of a fancy word but it's not really that
fancy so what is a tool chain honestly
it's just a fancy word for a bunch of
tools no no brainer of course it's just
a bunch of tools but more specifically
when you have a lot of steps together
and each step builds upon the last step
we usually call this a tool chain it's
just a chain of steps and each one is
dependence on the one before it so for
example let's just take your average
chain for a C program
well if you want to compile your C
program all the way down to in machine
instructions there's a chain of steps
you have to follow you have to
pre-process all your source files and
then the compiler makes sure your source
has no syntax mistakes then you assemble
your files into object files that you
link your object files into
executable files but you don't have to
know the details of the chain it's just
a chain and when we say something called
tool chain it's just a set of tools that
does everything in that sequence so LLVM
is a tool chain because it handles every
single part of this process from source
code all the way down to machine
instructions GCC does the exact same
things but even though they do the same
things they're extremely extremely
different so they're different let's
talk about how they're different because
GCC and LLVM are probably the two most
popular compiler tool chain technology
is so so they're both compiler tool
change but what makes them different
first number one big difference we have
to talk about is licensing okay they're
totally different in terms of licensing
if you're a company or your person and
you want to make a lot of money if you
want to write cool new languages and you
want to make a lot of money you have to
use LLVM you can't do that with GCC
because pretty much if you use GCC
everything you do it's free you can't
sell it so companies that want to write
proprietary software make money they
gotta use LLVM and that's due to
licensing terms that's a topic for a
different video but that's a huge huge
difference second difference is more
technical the second big difference
between LLVM and GCC is that LLVM is
very modular
when GCC is like a black box so GCC is
the black box you really don't know
what's going on inside this kind of
monolithic it's just this huge
super-powerful thing and you just can't
look inside and what it's doing LLVM on
the other hand it's designed to be very
very modular different blocks you can
mix and match plug and play but there's
like a front end a middle and a back end
to LLVM which we're gonna talk about but
you know there's a lot of pieces to it
this modular it's not like a black box
because you can take a peek at different
parts of it secondly LLVM is designed as
an API which just is a fancy word of
saying you can take a look inside what
the compiler is actually doing and with
GCC you can't do this very easily so
here is like a bear
a mental model picture of what LLVM is
but it's pretty cool LLVM has the front
end this red part has a middle part now
we're gonna talk about and a back end
which I highlighted in yellow alright so
the coolest part of LLVM again is that
you can mix and match these different
modules and this is the cool stuff that
enables Apple swift to exist or Kotlin
or like rust but all these cool
languages that people are creating
they're just mixing different parts of
the tool chain they're not creating this
thing totally from scratch so let's talk
about each part of LLVM from the front
in the middle and the back so the most
important part the most important part
of LLVM is this middle part the one that
I call the middle but this middle is
there's gonna be a fancy word coming up
but this is called LLVM intermediate
representation I'm gonna abbreviate it
by LLVM ir for short just to say it a
little faster but this is the middle
most important part of the whole tool
chain and you can think of this as LLVM
special special language it's not
specific to any processor we're not at
the backend yet it's just a very generic
language for LLVM and it's called LOV M
IR we'll talk more about that later the
front end the front end it's not
JavaScript I'm sorry this is not
JavaScript but this the LLVM front-end
is just taking your favorite languages
whether that C Fortran or Haskell it
takes that and a front end will
translate those high-level languages
down into LLVM ir so the front end just
takes source code and moves it to the
intermediate representation finally the
back end the back end does what you're
already expecting but the back end takes
the middle it takes the LLVM IR and
translates it down to
architecture-specific machine code so
that's x86 PowerPC arm it takes that
intermediate representation a very
general representation and a translate
that translates that's a very specific
machine instructions
so I want to take a moment and talk a
little bit more about this intermediate
representation of why LLVM IR is so
important but originally the history of
LOV MA used to stand for a low level of
virtual machine and hopefully by now you
guys are getting a gist of why is called
a low level virtual machine but the
project has grown so big that they say
it's not an acronym anymore it used to
be an acronym but on the website they
say the name LLVM itself is not an
acronym it is the full name of the
project but originally originally a long
time ago it used to stand for low level
virtual machines so you should be
getting the gist of why it's virtual its
virtual because this LLVM ir it's not
specific to any different architectures
it's extremely extremely generic there's
member there's so many different ISAs
for x86 for arm for all these different
architectures but this it's not specific
to any specific you know is a it's just
a very generic representation of our
code and let's take a look at what it
looks like but it's gonna look pretty
crazy it's gonna look like assembly but
remember it's not any specific assembly
it's a very generic language so this is
a seed source code file some Fibonacci
function and this is what LLVM ir looks
like it looks very low-level but again
this is not assembly this is a generic
language that can be translated to
different architectures so this is C
this is LOV Mir it looks pretty gnarly
it is pretty gnarly you're not supposed
to read it but that's just I'm showing
you what it looks like so if this whole
virtual language is not clicking for you
yet I tried to think of another analogy
so if it's hard to understand right now
think of a good analogy to think about
is Java in Java bytecode
because if you've written Java or know
anything about Java remember the holy
grail the holy premise of Java is that
you write it once you can run it
everywhere right it's supposed to be
very portable you write Java it compiles
to this Java bytecode and you can write
you can run that bytecode on tons of
different things well
that Java bytecode is analogous to LLVM
ir bytecode itself is another generic
representation of your code it's not
machine specific it's just another
virtual language bytecode is a virtual
language just like LLVM ir just a
virtual language okay so that's an
analogy so remember with your bike code
you use special Java runtimes which are
machine specific to execute a bytecode
so if you look at Java runtime
environment you can see that all these
different runtime environments these are
machine is specific right they have
solarz spark over here they have x86
over here they have Mac versus Windows
but you have to get a specific runtime
to execute the generic bytecode so
that's a good analogy if you're not
familiar with LLVM just compare it to
Java bytecode okay so the rap of this
video let's take a concrete example what
if you want to write your own compiled
language because you're awesome you just
want to write it you also want to make a
lot of money from your language because
you want to sell it you spent 10,000
hours on it so you can't use GCC or else
everything will be free you also don't
want to figure out how to compile your
language to million different
architectures you don't want to worry
about having it work on x86 and PowerPC
then arm it's too many details you don't
want to worry about that all you want to
worry about is your cool language
features so with LLVM larger their
design you can actually do this so all
you have to do with your cool new
language is you have to create a front
end for it you have to create one of
those blocks on the left side once you
create a front end for your language the
front end will translate your cool
source code down to LLVM ir and once you
do that the rest of the tool chain takes
over it because once you have the
intermediate representation once you
have the middle the tool chain will take
care of the back end for you so all you
have to worry about is making your
source code as cool as possible or
making your language as cool as possible
and that's really powerful because all
of a sudden you've designed a language
and that can be compiled down to all
these different things like phones
desktop sir
servers all these different things that
you don't have to worry about and that's
a more concrete example we can take a
look at swift so swift this appleís
language but I'm not gonna bore you with
the documentation but these are all the
different steps for the swift LLVM
front-end so they have parsing cool
parsing they have semantic analysis
warning error checking making sure Xcode
works well they have their own
intermediate language it's all boring
stuff but the most important part of the
Swift tool chain is that the last step
of their process is LLVM IR generation
the last part of all their stuff is to
generate that middle and then the tool
chain takes over so pretty much what
Apple did Swift is merely a front-end to
LLVM and then the tool chain takes over
for everything so Apple just made
another box on here the left for Swift
and then they use the rest of LVM to get
it to MacBooks to iPhones all the
different stuff they didn't worry about
that LLVM did that so alright guys
that's the end the video I hope you
found it pretty useful LLVM is used by a
ton of companies I think every big
company contributes to it every big
company uses it it's very very under the
hood but it makes creating languages
very very cool all you have to do to
create a language is you just make a
front-end for it you don't have to do
the whole thing worry about all the
different architectures you just make a
front-end a cool syntax and you pretty
much have a language that works on tons
of different architectures so if you
have any questions please leave me a
question please like please like the
video and see everybody next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
