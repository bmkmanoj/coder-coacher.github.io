processors part 2 the advanced edition
I'm just going to be upfront about this
a lot of the topics I want to talk about
are kind of complicated crazy ideas big
sounding words if you enjoyed part 1 of
computer processors I think this video
should be fun I'm going to go over a lot
of the secret sauce behind modern-day
computer processors I can't promise I'll
cover everything in five minutes again
but if you stick around hopefully you
learn something so if you're ready let's
do this
first we need to revisit the idea of a
computer program remember
the computer program is just a big list
of instructions that a computer
processor can understand if you remember
how I compared a processor to a chef a
computer program is just like a fancy
Italian recipe that a chef processor can
understand you give a chef a recipe he
makes a eggplant lasagna he comes
guziewicz cooze
okay so the chef or the computer
processor is just a machine he can't
think for herself and he can't write
recipes the recipes were in other words
computer programs are written by
engineers 10 different engineers could
write the same recipe for eggplant
lasagna 10 different ways computer
processors can write software they have
to execute software written by engineers
alright let's take a quick break and
make sure we're crystal clear between
what's the difference between hardware
and software the processor itself can't
change it's a physical device it's
hardware once you buy a computer with
this processor inside that's the one you
have until you switch it up and put it a
new one on the other hand software or
the cooking recipes can always change
that's why it's songs you can install
new software download updates or
uninstall it from your computer if the
software is broken that's fine you can
just download an update and it will fix
something on the other hand the hardware
is messed up you're screwed and the
world's gonna end
the software is written by people like
you and me it's very subjective
some people software will just be better
and other people's software straight up
all right let's go back to chef land a
little bit and take an example let's say
we're trying to cook pork fried rice and
we have two recipes the first recipe is
like start cooking the rice look at the
timer when it's done take it out and mix
it in with a pork a more efficient
recipe could be start cooking the rice
while it's cooking cut the pork up after
the rice is done you can mix it too if
the ship gets a crappy recipe the pork
fried rice is going to take a lot longer
to cook right - right more efficient
recipes for computer programs Engineers
often split up their programs to do
these things we call the Reds every
single computer program always has one
thread but that's the minimum you can
always have one or more threads so in
the pork fried rice example the bad
recipe could be only using one thread in
the more efficient pork fried rice
recipe there's one thread handling the
rice cookie then there's another thread
handling the pork cutting and they can
combine later on so it's really up to
the computer programmers to write an
efficient recipes or software sometimes
there could be a situation where your
computer program really needs more than
one thread what I described to you guys
is a basic idea of multi-threaded
software and a lot of complex programs
that you run on your computer almost all
of them I then are multi-threaded boom
now that we kind of understand
multi-threaded software we can move back
in the processors or hardware food boom
all right let's take a really simple
example with a computer processor that
can only execute one thread at a time
remember it's not one process at a time
it can only execute one thread at any
point in time just think about chefs a
little bit they can only do one thing at
a time
you can't tell a chef to cut the
potatoes and stir the rice at the same
time the only has two arms now when
you're using your computer you have this
crazy experience that everything is
happening at the same time
but it's really not like I said our
simple processor can only handle one
thread at a time it just switches
between every single thread between
every single process extremely quickly
so you get this awesome simultaneous
user experience remember these things
run in billions of cycles per second for
normal users you'd be surprised at just
what processor that can only handle one
thread can do everything you need to do
and it still probably underutilized you
can have your Spotify playing your web
browser up and your g chats going off
and it's still just one processor on
thread so it's time to upgrade the
processors a little bit I'm going to
introduce processor SMT and what SMT
stands for is simultaneous
multi-threading this sounds hell
accomplice a it right but based on what
we've been talking about you guess what
it means when the processor can do SMT
it means it can handle more than one
thread at the same time if you have SMT
one processor instead of having one
thread at a time it could handle the two
or four threads at a time the chef
analogy of that is if I grew four or six
mARMS if I had six arms I could handle
three things at the same time I could do
three step instructions at the same time
with six arms but if I had six arms I
take up mad space and I take a mad
energy and my chef's battery would die
superfast wouldn't it all right so let's
take it another step further and
introduced multi-core multi-core is when
the processor itself is duplicated in
the computer system so when people say
dual or quad core there's actually two
or four processors on that computer this
would be analogous to two chefs working
in the same kitchen
or four chefs working in the same
kitchen also remember that each chef
might have six arms so you could have
four six arm chefs working in the same
kitchen so what we're talking about here
this multi-core processors and each of
them can handle multiple threads if you
have four processors and each one can
handle four threads technically a
computer should be able to handle 16
threads at one time so a lot of people
think that having quad-core means you
get four times performance and that is
the wrong guru with more processors it
doesn't make everyone happy
think about if we had four chefs working
in the kitchen not all the chef's can
get to the refrigerator at the same time
right if one chefs using the fridge all
the chefs with a weight before they can
access the fridge just like a kitchen a
lot of components of a computer system
shared like the RAM memory for example
if one processor is accessing a
particular part of memory then other
processors aren't be able to access that
same region
that's why four cores doesn't
necessarily mean four times better you
could stick tons of chefs into the
kitchen and it could just become
inefficient after a while so if I
haven't lost it yet and you wash up to
this point of the video you should
understand what this phrase means I have
a multi-core system with SMT capable
processors doesn't that sound kind of
cool SMT is also known as Hardware
threading too sometimes but I think the
term SMT is slightly more efficient
actually if you ever bring up SMT or
Hardware threads in real life nobody
would understand what you're talking
about so you can call them whatever you
want you can call them unicorns so let's
review a little bit don't get Hardware
threads confused with software threads
remember software threads is how
computer programmer splits up this
recipe to make the pork fried rice more
efficiently Hardware threads is when one
processor can handle more than one
thread
at the same time I don't know if you
remember this but back in the day
there's a lot of buzz when Intel first
released their hyper-threading
technologies so it sounds pretty cool
but what hyper-threading is is just
Intel's
version of SMT other companies that make
their own processors have their own
version of SMT hybrid threading is just
one particular implementation of
simultaneous multi-threading all right
so I packed a lot of stuff into this
video hopefully you added some new big
computer words into your vocabulary or I
just probably confused the hell out of
you I just wanted to give some
big-picture concepts about some of the
ideas that people really don't know
about not many people know what
multi-core even means so next time you
go to Best Buy and you want to be a
douche bag you can just ask the sales
rep how many Hardware threads is that
laptop handle but now you know the
difference between software threads and
Hardware threads you know what SMT is
and you know what multi cords remember
quad core doesn't need four times better
all right I hope you liked the video or
hope you learned something please like
or leave me a comment I'll certify you
officially processor savvy you can catch
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
