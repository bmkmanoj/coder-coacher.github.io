school matter this is probably the most
popular question that I have been asked
recently and I've written up the same
answer a bunch of time so this video is
just me sharing some of that stuff and I
just have three points that I want to
talk about first point that I want to
make and it's probably the most
important one is that going to a good
school does not automatically make you
successful there are plenty of people
that go and graduate from Harvard and
become lazy bums if you're attending a
not-so-good school and you put in a lot
of work and hustle you automatically
surpass somebody that went to an elite
school and just is not working very hard
remember that school is very short but
learning is probably your whole lifetime
I know a lot of you guys watching are
probably in high school or in college
where four to five years it seems like a
long time but actually that's nothing
compared to your whole life school gives
you a jump start great resources for a
little sliver of your life but in the
grand scheme of things this always gonna
be up to you okay so point number two
that I want to make is that a school's
name always carries weight and if you
decide to go to school you need to get
into the best program possible because
that name stays with you for the rest of
your life this is not relevant for
schools or just universities and
academics everything we do and
accomplish in life we wear it as a badge
school is just one of these badges
throughout your life you're always going
to be judged I don't know if you've
accepted this or not but we are always
judged by everyone we interact with 99%
of the people you meet they don't have
time to get to know you all you can
really do to form an opinion about you
is to go through the list of what you've
done so far and that's exactly why we
still have resumes LinkedIn all that
stuff okay so quick story about me and
a professional history I switched from
kind of a corporate engineering job into
startup land which is a really different
environment during that switch I didn't
really have a lot of experience that a
lot of startups wanted I knew different
programming languages I worked in kind
of different industries and nothing I
did previously was relevant to a lot of
startups
the only reason literally the only
reason why some startups would even talk
to me is because that they saw I went to
Carnegie Mellon just graduating CMU gave
me that little badge of just being there
and I felt like it was really the only
thing I had at the time so point to
again point to again is that ass coolest
name always makes a difference point
number three last point in answering
this question is the difference in raw
education you'll receive at a better
school I'm not trying to exaggerate
anything here but the coursework you
receive and an elite school is going to
be just straight-up better than of
course you'll receive at a community
college computer science program if you
were to compare MIT computer science
courses with your average community
science intro to programming it's not
it's not even a comparison there's a
reason why MIT is MIT all those online
courses those programming boot camps
learning in three months
those can't even touch curriculums add
these elite schools it's no comparison
let's move that back and relate it to
point number one I made first and that
was that school is really short remember
four years of MIT is much better than
four years of Community College but in
the end it's only four years so the hard
work and the hustle that you do for your
whole life not just those four years is
the deciding factor all right guys let's
just summarize the three points really
quickly first point is that school never
beats hard work hard work always beats
whatever program you're involved in two
is
the name always counts and you wear it
as a badge so if you go to school get
into the best school possible last point
I want to make is that the education you
get at an elite school is straight-up
better there's no contest just accept
that
all right guys those are my thoughts on
that question and hopefully they were
useful no matter where you are I know a
lot of people watching you're probably
still a school or thinking about going
to school so I hope this helps you keep
working hard stay humble and get as many
of those badges as you can in your life
all right take care and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
