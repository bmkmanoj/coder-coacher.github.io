doing well it's starting to get really
hot here so when he gets really hot and
you walk around New York a lot of liquid
from air conditioning units falls on you
kind of sucks we haven't done a
technical video in a while so this video
is gonna be a little bit techie but
hopefully it should be good and we're
gonna talk about how computer logic
works so before we get into it this
stuff is gonna sound super super super
basic and very oh yeah that's a
no-brainer but we'll see that all the
basic things we'll cover here is what's
the foundation for all the advanced
things in all computers so let's do it
so I know a lot of people watching are
more into software than they are
hardware and this video is gonna kind of
err on the side of more hardware in
software I know you guys are used to
writing a lot of conditional statements
loops if this happens this thing happens
else that happens then this other thing
happens and those are also very logical
statements but the logic we're gonna
cover in this video is not software
logic so the logic in this video is a
little more low-level and we're gonna
get into how logic really works inside
the computer and hardware we're gonna do
three things in this video we're gonna
introduce basic logical gates what that
means we're gonna go over binary really
quickly and then we're gonna add
something three things and we're gonna
do it all in this video if those three
things didn't make any sense to you
hopefully it will by the end of this
video and we're gonna really go into
some guts behind how our computer works
all right okay first thing we're gonna
do is we're going to get a really brief
introduction to what is a logical gate
and this is the core of logic components
inside a computer and we're going to
talk about and first and like a and D
and so analogy is always good first
let's just take a quick example real
life example of when you might use a
logical and
this is a boy and he's tall so that's a
sentence this is a boy and he's tall
pretty basic sentence right if both of
these things apply to you boy and tall
then the answer to the sentence or
question is yes so this is kind of the
basic essence of the word and and let's
just keep breaking it down further in
computer land we draw and like this this
is a logical gate for and two inputs on
the left side one output on the right
side let's just tie this add gate back
to our example of a boy and tallness so
two inputs right gender and height and
the output is gonna be yes or no so I'm
gonna put up a table here don't look at
the table right yet we're gonna discuss
it in one second but this table
represents every single possible outcome
of this question input eight is gonna be
your gender if you're a boy or you're
not a boy I know that's not typically
correct but for this video a is gonna be
a gender okay B is gonna be your height
or more specifically if you're tall or
you're not tall first scenario you are
not a boy zero and you're not tall so
obviously the answer is going to be zero
you're not a boy and you're not tall
second scenario is you're not a boy but
you're actually tall still not quite
good enough so the answer is still no
zero third outcome is you are a boy but
you're short it doesn't cut it and the
answer is still no finally we're at the
last scenario when you are a boy and you
are tall and finally if you're both
these things you are a boy and a and D
you're tall and the answer to this
question is going to be yes or one so as
you can see this stuff isn't really
rocket science it's pretty
straightforward but once we start mixing
and matching different logical ideas
together it can get pretty complicated
but just take another look at this table
4 and boy and tall and just let it sink
in
quick so so every time you see that wire
in these diagrams every time a wires
going into somewhere and out of
somewhere that represents a binary
yes-or-no or one or zero or more
realistically electricity flowing or not
flowing
okay so let's quickly go over a couple
more logical gates there a lot of these
and we can't get into all of them but
let's just go over the or gate really
quickly first scenario you're not a boy
and you're not tall so you're not either
of these things the answer is no second
scenario you're not a boy
but you're actually tall but the answer
is yes in this case because remember or
you're tall you're not a boy but the
answer is still gonna be yes third
scenario you're a boy but you're short
at least you're a boy so yes or one
final scenario is that you are a boy and
you are tall obviously the answer is yes
in this case two four or so those are
all four possible outcomes for the or
logic in computers
okay so last piece of logic we're gonna
check out is the exclusive for logic and
just check out this diagram and this
picture real quick this is exactly the
same as the or logic except for one case
when you're both a boy and you're tall
the case where you're a boy and you're
tall or if both inputs are true the
exclusive-or logic actually returns
false all right so this is when the word
exclusive really comes into the play
you're either exclusively one thing or
exclusively the other thing not both at
the same time so if you're a boy and
you're tall this is actually gonna be
false because you're not exclusively one
or the other all right so this exclusive
or is one of the most important logical
ideas in all the computers and just look
at it real quick and understand how this
is different from the or logic all right
exclusively or
okay so hopefully that sunk in a little
bit and that was a quick introduction
into basic logic we went over ad or an
XOR and there are many more and I
encourage everyone to go online and read
about other types of computer logic but
those three are gonna be the most
important ones for this video
all right part two of this video is that
we're just gonna go over binary really
really quickly and I don't have time to
explain really how binary works but all
we have to do in this video in terms of
binary is just count to three all we
have to do is count to three and it's
kind of baby stuff this is zero to three
and binary so just take a look over here
zero one two three
trust me I'm not an expert at binary but
I can at least count to three you know
that's like preschool level counting so
just trust me this is how you count to
three in binary okay so yes I assume you
trust me we can all count to three in
binary let's just do some really really
quick additions in binary first so we
know how to add normal numbers let's
just add binary numbers really quickly
it's exactly the same
zero plus zero is zero easy right 0 plus
1 is 1 1 plus 0 is 1 and finally 1 plus
1 is 2 right yeah
1 plus 1 is 2 pretty much what's
happening here is you're just doing a
carry if you go back to your elementary
school days and you did your addition on
paper remember when the digits are
greater than 10 you carry over a 1 to
the left well this whole carry concept
is exactly the same in binary it's just
that you can't count to 10 so 1 plus 1
we actually carry the one to the left so
it's 2 so that's all it means 5 Plus 5
is 10 right and look how we carried that
one over to the left this is exactly the
same as 1 plus 1 equals 2 so it's just
carrying digits over all right binary
decimal exactly the same almost
okay so you remember these tables from
before we laid out the tables and the
outcomes of and/or etc all that stuff
well we can make the same exact kind of
table for adding something so let's just
pull up a table for this adding concept
real quick alright so your two inputs
are going to be a and B and we're gonna
have two outputs now so the C column is
actually that carry column that we were
just talking about in binary and the S
we can call it the sum column so
remember our basic baby binary addition
let's just double check that this table
for adding something makes sense in
binary
all right zero plus zero equals zero
that's cool
1 plus 0 is 1 0 plus 1 is 1 and 1 plus 1
is 2 and that carry bit is sent over to
the left so just take another look at
this table and let's just verify that
that's exactly how you add two basic
binary numbers remember we're just
adding zeros or ones right so the max we
can get is 2 there's only four
possibilities do you notice anything
similar with that C column the carry
column and our and AMD logic look at
those two tables side by side real quick
you'll notice that they're exactly the
same now look at the results for the S
column and notice how these are exactly
the same as our XOR or exclusive logic
right just do the table comparison real
quick
I'll let you look at it but you'll
notice that they're exactly the same so
what does this all mean and what are we
trying to get at really but if you look
at those similarities the carry bit when
we add two binary numbers is actually
equivalent to the and of those two
numbers and remember the S column we
just compared it to the exclusive or the
s output is exactly the same as the
exclusive or output so let's just draw
both of them up here all right we're
gonna draw it right here
all right so let's just take a look at
this diagram over here look really close
the other
each gate is two inputs one output two
inputs one output when we consider this
whole addition thing our baby binary
addition remember it's actually two
inputs to outputs because we have to
remember that carry output keep this
picture up and just like try to let it
all sink in and figure out what's
happened alright we started with basic
logical ideas boy and tall boy or tall
we started with those basic logical
concepts and we've already constructed
it to do something useful or add two
numbers so we went from logic to math
that's crazy right just random logic boy
and tall to math which is like super
smart the conclusion to all this going
from stupid logical gates to doing
something smart like adding is how a
computer is built this is exactly how a
computer is built if you multiply these
gates by a hundred you have a hundred or
a thousand of these small little gates
you could probably multiply or divide a
numbers obviously we took the most basic
case of adding but you know add a couple
more gates here make it more complex and
you're gonna do more complex math if you
multiply these gates by 1 billion 1
billion gates that turns into your
processor see how that's crazy so every
single one of those logical gates that
we just talked about is all it is is
just pieces of metal and electricity
flowing through that metal you take
millions billions of those gates you put
it together you get hardware you put
Hardware together you get the computer
that you're on right now watching this
video you go to your computer you write
software which controls the hardware and
that software controls all those
electricity flowing through those little
logic gates that's a little crazier
right so just let that sink in your
writing software and the currents of
electricity is changing so
alright guys that's the end of the video
we definitely covered a lot
hopefully told a pretty good story of
how really really complex things are
just based on really basic ideas like
boy and tall and it builds up everything
please like the video if you liked it if
you have any questions I know there's
probably gonna be a lot of questions
just drop me an email or go below and
drop a comment and I'll try to answer
the question as best I can as always
please do any additional research if any
of this stuff didn't make sense and I'll
see everyone next week all right take
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
