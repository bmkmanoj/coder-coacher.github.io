doing really really well this is gonna
be the last video I make for 2017 I'm
gonna be traveling for a few weeks so
one I have time to make anything until
next year but still wanted to wish
everyone a Happy Holidays Happy New Year
and send everyone off well so didn't
have time to make a full-fledged video
here so I kind of just dumped some
thoughts onto the document I made this
pretty fast so sorry if it looks a
little crude but anyways I just wanted
to wrap up the year and talk about what
happened this past year in a really high
level so without further ado let's just
go through this kind of thought train I
had but Happy New Year that's the
important part so I want to start by
just saying what kind of happened
how is 2017 in terms of tech software
programming I know many people that
watch my channel or probably knew maybe
beginner level I think the majority of
people are and if you've been living
under a rock or if you haven't been
living under a rock for the past few
years you probably know that tech is
trending a lot
it was trending in 2016 it's still
trending in 2017 we have an HBO show
we have boot camps we have Elon Musk and
Jeff Bezos in the news they're like gods
to everyone now Tech feels like very
mainstream it feels very accessible it
feels very cool and even the word Tech
is trendy so what does this all mean so
this whole idea of tech is trending
right this this major idea of this video
tech is trending what you can also
interpret it as is that I just think
right now there's a huge demand for
developers and it's rising a lot I think
everyone feels that and that's why
everyone's kind of drawn to tech and
programming a lot more just in the past
five years but 2017 is no different the
demand for developers keeps going up and
up and up and up and up and then with
that there's always a supply to fulfill
and meet that's a man right you have
increase in demand in something
somebody's gonna try to take advantage
of that and provide the supply and while
this all sounds really good you know
we're in the trend if you're in tech if
you're if you're a program
it all sounds really really good but
there's also a lot of things that be
cautious about in times of trend in my
opinion so what do we have to actually
be cautious about but the one question
that is at the root of a lot of this I
thought was that what's fueling the
developer supply and the major fuel for
that whole supply it's just a ton a ton
of advertising and I might make it sound
like advertising is a bad thing but
advertising and marketing are not bad
things they're actually just a
straight-up a part of life you need
advertising and marketing to sell
anything and make the world go around
for all the developers out there how
many times let me ask you the question
how many times have you built something
you thought was really really cool
only you couldn't get anyone else to use
it you just thought it was cool the
result of that is that you just didn't
know how to market or advertise what you
built and it's really hard so before I
get too cynical with this video and
start talking smack about advertising I
just wanna I don't want to understate it
advertising and marketing is not a
trivial thing and never underestimated
okay it's actually very very difficult
especially for people who are very
analytical so I don't want to discount
this at all it's extremely important
moving on so what do I think
so advertising if you advertise really
hard and you have the product or service
to back it up it's all good I have it
green green means all good but if you're
advertising really hard and you don't
have something to back it up or you're
hiding something and you don't show what
you got then you got to be careful
alright so advertising is kind of
surface level right is how you present
your product or your service to the
external world and you're always gonna
present it well and if you've got the
inside to back it up and you're good
you're green otherwise you gotta be
careful so this is what we want to talk
about right when should you actually be
careful with this advertising and I
think in the tech world you have to be
careful more often these days in like
2017 probably next year probably
next five years so the number one new
form of advertising that everyone is
susceptible to now is the advertising
for your career and for your learning
and this one is really dangerous because
it has financial ties it like takes your
time it's huge responsibility stuff like
this so number one thing the past few
years is this whole idea of boot camps
right how many times have you guys heard
this line like study for six months get
paid a hundred thousand dollars a year
or become a full-stack software
developer in three months or four months
like that's straight-up advertising okay
they're advertising learning and they're
advertising a career for you like an
easy entry into this super lucrative
career and it's really that easy you
have to ask yourself right so you have
to be careful with stuff like this
because this is advertising for your
career likewise there's also a ton of
advertising I see for your learning so
how many times have you seen a class
that sounds like this it's like
everything you ever need to know about
Python or everything everything you ever
need to know about JavaScript okay let
me just tell you that one class is not
everything you need to know about Python
right obviously they're slow trying to
get you to use that class so just be
cautious of that because I think this
style of advertising with Career and
learning it's potentially the most
dangerous for you personally so that's
why I put it number one number two it's
more just me talking it's not as
important but advertising also comes in
the form of companies and you have to
take this with a grain of salt right so
these days any company that puts the
word Tech in their name automatically
becomes better somehow but really like
do they really become better
so like healthcare company versus
healthcare tech company or hamburger
company versus hamburger tech company
juice company versus juice tech company
and I guarantee you somewhere in Silicon
Valley someone has made all these silly
companies on the right like somebody in
Silicon Valley has definitely made a
juice tech company and got millions of
dollars for it so what does that really
mean like like it's a little bit in my
but this is just a lot of the fluff and
the hype even around businesses in
around businesses using tech to their
advantage these days and I read this
other article this past year but this
past year obviously bit coin and crypto
that's been blowing up just the past few
months but in 2017 there's a handful of
companies there's actually a cool
article about this but there's like a
few companies that all they did was put
the word blockchain or put the word
Bitcoin at the end of their company name
and their company just grew like 200 300
400 percent of value for nothing for
just putting the name in their company
and if you guys were around like
probably in the 2000 this is exactly
what happened no calm when everyone put
calm or whatever dotnet in the 2000
crash and they increase their valuation
like crazy it's the same exact analogy
here and it's already happening with
tons of company using blockchain toward
Bitcoin to do the same so there's like
this funny article listing all these
companies that like tripled in value
just by adding one word to their name so
obviously that's not right the last type
of advertising I want to talk about is
just advertising Tech itself you know
Tech is supposed to be pure you can't
dispute it you know it's a language it's
designed by developers this very pure
but actually these days I don't think
it's so pure anymore I think it's
lending itself to be more like just
trying to sell it to you you're being
sold stuff so how many times have you
heard these kind of absolute phrases
like react is the best JavaScript
library or XYZ is the worst JavaScript
library or this language is the best
language to learn that language is the
worst language to learn machine learning
will solve everything but one thing
that's a little scary for me is that I
like to think that tech in itself is
pure and people take it for what it is
if and for what it isn't which is also
important but these days Tech itself is
being advertised to you it's like crypto
can't solve anything
or like blockchain technology can solve
anything but really can it like you got
to ask yourself
question so be wary because tech I don't
think it's as pure as it used to be and
it's just becoming advertised that go
with the trends but the phone to close
out this video I just want to give my
only warning for all this stuff I this
is kind of a cynical video on being a
little you know sad I'm not very
positive in this video but my only
warning for 2017 is that everyone that's
watching especially if you're a beginner
you're just starting your journey into
programming or whatever always stay very
aware and conscious of when you are
being overly advertised to just be
always stay alert to that because again
I'm gonna say this again if you're
advertising real hard and you have the
product to back it up it's all good
but if you're advertising real hard and
you don't have something to back it up
you got to be careful because
advertising creates a lure right it's
something attractive it's something sexy
it's something accessible you can make a
ton of money it's something easy and
that's when you have to be very very
careful about it and I think Tek is kind
of going too close to that dangerous
level of advertising because I hope it
doesn't get this bad but I kind of
compared it to the advertising for
fitness and weight loss right look at
the fitness industry there's so many
like pills and diets and easy plans to
lose like 50 pounds but if you ask
anyone who takes Fitness seriously or
has ever lost a lot of weight it's not
easy and it's not fast right so I hope
Tech never gets to the level of fitness
or weight loss advertising but if it
does you have to be really careful so
that's my last point but anyways to make
this video a little less sad what's my
conclusion for 2017 but always remember
the ultimate purpose of all this
advertising stuff you're gonna you're
gonna be seeing it much more now and
into the future
but the ultimate purpose of all this
advertising is to feed the trending tech
business all right and unfortunately you
can't avoid it I'm not gonna be able to
avoid it you can't avoid it it's always
there you can't avoid advertising it's
subconscious to a level but I think
the best thing you can do is you have to
actively take all in don't try to block
the advertising because sometimes as
advertising good things but take all of
it in all that stuff all that news you
hear just take it all in and arrive at
your own conclusion about it so you know
all the questions you asked in the
comments and the emails and you probably
ask a lot of people because these are
natural questions to ask but all these
questions like well booked do I read
what do I study well language do I learn
do I go to this boot camp that I want to
work at the startup do I don't want to
work at whatever place like do you
really think you'll be satisfied getting
an answer to any of those questions just
by accepting some kind of advertising or
accepting the trends you probably won't
be satisfied with the answer to any of
those questions if you just kind of
follow what everyone else is doing you
will only be satisfied with the answer
to these questions if you just arrive at
that answer yourself from your own
research that's actually the purest way
to be satisfied but answering any of
these questions I know everyone's
thinking about these questions so even
if I tell you in a video I tell you
exactly what book you should read or I
tell you exactly what the study you
shouldn't listen to me because that's
just my opinion of what you should do
and that's probably wrong so anyways
just wrapping up the video some random
thoughts about 2017 I apologize if the
video was a little random if the
document was a little random I'm gonna
share the document please everyone have
a great year I hope you enjoy the new
year as well don't drink too much stay
responsible please like the video ask me
any question I'll answer it please give
me a like share the video and I'll see
everyone in 2018 all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
