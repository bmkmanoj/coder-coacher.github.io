doing well trying a new type of format
for this video which is kind of gonna be
like Q&amp;amp;A so I went through a couple
comments and questions that I thought
were particularly relevant or they came
up often I'm just gonna try to knock a
lot of them out in this video because
hopefully they're helpful for everyone
so just random questions I found no
particular order didn't even write a
script for this video so they're gonna
kind of freestyle but let's see how it
goes alright let's do it
I can understand the syntax of most
programming languages but I still can't
code so just this question itself this
is for everyone who is actually a pure
pure beginner just trying to get into
software and I can tell when people ask
questions like this they really are like
the pure Greenfield beginners and I
think my only piece of recommendation
for people like this is that watching my
videos are just looking at YouTube is
not really how you're gonna learn how to
program and you just should find a
curriculum so finding a curriculum you
can go about in many ways you can just
find a free one online find a paid one
online try to get to a school but
overall when you're that newb you need
some kind of structure to help you so I
guess instead of going around asking how
to get started I don't know where to
begin
just find a program doesn't matter just
find a program alright so you need a
little bit of structure just to get
going so that's that question if I know
c-sharp do I know Java if I know Java do
I know c-sharp so short answer is
straight up no you if you know Java you
don't know c-sharp I know what people
mean by this question like they take
languages that are very similar and they
try to compare them and see oh I know
one so it just means I know the other
this is a hundred percent obviously not
the case because they're different
languages you know they might share some
similarities share some influences but
you either know one language
or the other so you could pick it up
faster maybe you can pick up Scala
really fast because you've done Java for
your whole life but I wouldn't say you
can just say I know Scala because I've
done Java for a long time it's
inaccurate so don't say that don't think
that and just learn both languages all
right let's just keep it moving next
question I was just wondering what
programming languages you enjoy using
the most okay
short answer probably just do a short
answer in a long answer to this question
short answer is that out of the few
positions I've held I thought the most
fun in terms of software development was
probably using C++ and the reason why I
thought it was a little more fun was
that I thought that language or maybe it
was just my experience using that
language it was the closest to really
hard core like software design skills it
was like we were focused a lot on pure
software design it was like 30 engineers
trying to design a system and C++ really
was like allowed us to do very specific
things design very specific patterns do
things very custom so I know I thought
it was the most fun from a software
perspective but obviously C++ is not the
language of choice for a wide variety of
different other applications you know
companies that like to do web apps or
mobile apps are obviously going to use
different languages from that so
depending on what you need to do you
have to pick the appropriate language I
just personally thought C++ was a little
more fun all right so that's that no
that guy is a sweet name what is the
difference between software developer
and software engineer oh yeah so this
question comes up a lot what is the
difference between a software developer
or software engineer coder programmer I
think I've answered this maybe already
in another video but I honestly can say
that don't think about these titles too
much they really are supposed to mean
similar things like use your programming
skills to solve a problem
and help a company help yourself help do
something with your programming skills
all right so the act of coding or
programming is a skill in it in itself
right if you're a software developer not
only do you have to code but you have to
do many other things so think of coding
as just a pure skill to have and don't
dwell on these titles too much all right
so overall it's just some person you can
solve problems make people's lives
easier with your technical capabilities
which one of them happens to be coding
all right so don't think about it too
much
you look like rice gum so sorry this is
not a question but I just put it on this
list because I thought this guy was
saying I look like food and I looked up
rice gum and it's not a food it's just
another youtuber who's super famous and
I guess I look like him all right so
irrelevant but I spend like a couple
minutes looking up that thing thinking
it was food so next question how how
long does it take to learn your first
programming language so this is another
question that you can't really put a
time limit to obviously the longer of
time you spend using and programming
with a particular language you're gonna
learn about it a lot more all right I
guess just to give a little bit of a
story I first saw C C was my first
programming language I first saw it in
like 2003 or 2004 I think I was a junior
or something in high school I took a
class about intro to see I sucked at the
class I understood it up to like four
loops then we got into pointers and it
like confused the hell out of me at the
time I think my mom helped up helped me
out a lot with all those labs in high
school I started actually understanding
programming in college using homeworks
labs using C to like do all my you know
projects coding projects but I wouldn't
say I really even mastered the language
through academics I think when I really
got a good grasp on C was one my first
couple years on the job as an
better developer and I was using it a
lot like using see a lot getting into
the details doing some tricky things
with it so that was in like 2010 2011 I
first saw it in 2004 so first
programming language 7 years so good
luck next question is my computer says
not enough RAM when nothing is open at
all help please
so first just to get it out of the way
just because you have nothing open it
doesn't mean you have nothing running on
your computer you have less things
running but there's a lot of things that
run a lot of processes that the
operating system is running all the time
that you don't physically see alright
and while you're the reason why your
computer's probably blowing up is
because you're running out of resources
so remember that every program that runs
on your computer takes resources and if
the program is written not very well
it's not going to use the resource as
well and it's even gonna waste the
resources if you hear of things like
memory leaks if those are just software
problems so a long time ago and I think
chrome was first coming out as pretty
notorious for eating a lot of resources
and if you left chrome open too long
your computer was emp'd so a lot of the
times you're just like alright just stop
restart chrome your computer should be
okay but overall remember every single
program you're running is written by
humans they're not perfect they're
probably eating a way of resources and
that's why you kill those processes or
you restart your computer all right so
just because nothing is open doesn't
mean nothing is using resources on your
computer so worst case scenario just
restart it and you know keep going how
long how do you know all these things I
don't know many things I just try to
explain them well how old are you I'm 28
all right next question
okay this question is a little long hi
Dave thanks for the video I have a
question not relative to agile but still
in computer science I have a problem
with changing languages and tools
between
master's I guess so I guess the major
gist of this question sorry I'm not
going to read out it completely just
because it's a little long but it's kind
of being frustrated or having it being
challenging doing a little context
switching swishing from one language to
another language one framework to
another framework across semesters I
just want to say that while this might
seem bad in school you're always going
to be contact swishing between various
projects and usually it's very hard to
work on multiple things at the different
times so you do switch every now and
then like there's a reason why people
don't do ios and android one developer
doesn't do both of those at the same
time because if you're an iOS developer
you're so used to that environment it's
not really convenient or even practical
to just oh let me just jump over to
Android in the afternoon let me jump
back over to iOS in the night I'll jump
back in the morning
so contacts wishing always happens but
even in real life you do spend certain
amounts of time focused on certain
frameworks because it's not really good
to always be contact switching
nevertheless even though it's not good
to switch a lot you do have to get used
to it so as you start accumulating
knowledge from languages different
frameworks like different environments
of development you'll be able to learn
how to adapt to various different
environments it's always gonna suck to
switch over but you still have to get
used just wishing you over all right so
practically it's not really good switch
all the time but you still have to learn
how to do it alright last question how
can one reach out to you if I have any
questions that's kind of one-on-one if
there's any type of one-on-one question
I will answer it but is I prefer if you
send me an email
I'll just put my email again in the
description please
I'd rather somebody send me an email
that's kind of well thought out
well-written and I'll respond to that
then getting like random Facebook
messages so I mean I love Facebook thank
you I appreciate you guys adding me on
Facebook but to respond I'm only gonna
I'm only gonna try to respond on email
just because it's a little it's more
convenient all right so that's all if
you need a contacting me I prefer do it
on email or just actually a comment it's
perfect - all right just facebook
Messenger
not too much all right all right guys
that was just the list of questions I
had accumulated today obviously this
video is a little bit more freestyle I
just wanted to like knock a couple
questions out of the park if those
questions were on anyone else's mind
hopefully I hit them maybe I'll do this
again after I accumulate another set of
good questions I'll make another video
like this just trying to diversify a bit
and hope this video was helpful all
right so I'll see everyone next week and
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
