everyone's doing well today we're going
to talk a little bit about software and
programming everything I'm going to talk
about this video is related to your
mindset I'm not going to talk over any
code anything with any particular
language I just want to show you guys
that attitude and your mind make a huge
huge difference when it comes to
programming if you're considering doing
software at a company or you're already
a professional developer hope this video
can help you and let's do it alright
number one is to hold your ego there's a
90% chance at a job you're going to be
programming with other people one of the
hardest parts of software development is
working effectively and productively
with other people it's really really
really rare to work solo on any project
if you're at a company so my first point
is to really leave your ego at the door
there's never ever really a good reason
to really push for a fancy programming
technique that you think might be right
but doesn't jive well with other people
disregarding patterns and doing things
your own way a lot of the time just
kills productivity create follow and
design patterns with the rest of the
team so you can follow them together the
second point that I want to make is to
always leave the code cleaner and how
you found it
the thing about crappy code is that no
one really wants to fix it so the code
just gets more and more crappy
if you see something just fix it even if
it's really really small it's just a
typo in the comment or the variable is
named a little weird just clean it up
right there if everyone collectively
leaves the code cleaner could how they
found it it just slowly becomes more and
more awesome this point is really up to
you
when you see something just fix it don't
let it rot and make the code slowly and
slowly better my third and last point is
that rewriting an application is almost
always the wrong choice unless the
program has really really really really
gone to
you probably shouldn't rewrite it the
ability to work with old where legacy
code is just part of programming it's
your responsibility of dealing with
other people's code reading it and
improving it for the future so if you
think rewriting something is going to
make it better
I can almost tell you with 100%
certainty that it's not going to do
anything there's something really really
subtle with decision-making when it
comes to programming if you're starting
a brand new project today and you make
decisions XY and Z to implement it
you'll realize that in one or two years
when you look back on those decisions XY
and Z they'll seem like those weren't
the right decisions at all every single
decision that you make in programming
you can always use hindsight and say
back then I could have chose something
more optimal so the only time where you
should write something completely from
scratch if it's a brand new idea a brand
new service or if it's really really
gone down the tubes for the 95% of the
time we don't write something completely
new it's your responsibility as a
programmer to add and improve that
rewriting code for the sake of rewriting
and just making it better just never
works and it usually just reflects pure
laziness
all right guys so those were three quick
points that I had to improve your
mindset as a programmer and hopefully be
more effective
always remember there's a lot that goes
into being a really effective engineer
besides just being really good at peer
coding just get your mind in the right
place and you're going to be awesome
just killing it okay so just wrapping up
the video there hopefully it's pretty
short I'm going to try to stick to my
three or four of and a rule and see you
guys next time all right leave me a
comment and see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
