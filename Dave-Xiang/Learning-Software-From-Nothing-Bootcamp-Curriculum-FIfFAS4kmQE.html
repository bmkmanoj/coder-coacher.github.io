really well screencast video this week
and I wanted to talk about another
recurring comment question which is
getting into software from scratch okay
and this question happens a lot it kind
of manifests in a lot of different forms
like how do I get into full stack web
development how to become a software
developer so two parts of this video I
want to talk about how you could
potentially ask good questions and think
about a flow of getting into software
development from nothing and then also I
wanted to talk more in depth about a
bootcamp curriculum and just go over and
digest it with everyone so let's get
straight to the point but I use this new
open source tool it's like a mind
mapping tool it's pretty cool I've seen
a lot of other people make flows like
this kind of like this entry so I
thought I could just make a really
simple decision tree - you know
compliment the video so green questions
grey answers kindness so let's get
straight into it but this decision tree
is geared towards anybody who's looking
to get into software from scratch
alright so first question to ask
yourself why do I want to learn software
I made a dichotomy just two options one
become a software developer get a job
make money I want to be a full-time
developer option 2 I want to learn
software to supplement my skills become
more technical and I don't need to be a
full-time developer so we're not going
to talk about option 2 too much focus on
optional 1 this is probably the majority
so how can I learn software next
question one one is obviously this is
the conventional way the way that
everyone can talk about from ivory
towers the conventional ways probably go
to school get a bachelor's get a masters
some kind of degree get internships find
a job after graduating so the pros of
this good foundation it's always good
its structured methodical learning and
there's some level of credibility always
cons life life is the big con you know
life doesn't allow it
sometimes you too much money is too
expensive you can't take out the loan
you've got too many other
responsibilities you're not you know a
high school student like with zero
responsibilities life to its you can't
afford to drift too much in college
college is like very short so when
you're there to do something you have to
be sure you're doing it you can't be
there swishing majors not making up your
mind and wasting time and money and 3
the con is its overall its low
accessibility not many people even have
options of doing this conventional thing
so this is keep moving down second
second is non-conventional doing a boot
camp so we're going to get more in depth
into this but let's just do a quick
overview of this non-conventional do
boot camp pros fast flexible less
commitment and less money but still some
amount of money you'll probably be end
up end up paying five to twenty thousand
dollars u.s. dollars pros finely tuned
to get you a job and that's the only
purpose of a boot camp it's a finely
tuned machine to get you a job and we're
going to talk more about this in the
second half of the video cons of the
boot camp I think we talked about this
before you might have holes in your
knowledge that you need to eventually
fill and I think everyone's aware that
the second con of doing a boot camp is
there's some level of developer social
stigma you know a lot of people think
like oh I have a CS degree I'm better
than everyone that has a boot camp
degree this is inevitable I'm guilty of
you know judging people like this
sometimes but it's just what it is so I
think it's long as you're aware of that
there is a level of social stigma that
you just have to be aware of and just be
ready for that
so third just to wrap up the decision
but there it is non-conventional and
this is completely self-directed we
won't get into so much detail here
because this one's very loose so
non-conventional self-directed but the
pros to this is that no money completely
flexible zero commitment and you can
learn whatever you want
Conn's to completely self-directed
learning to become a software developer
is that there's no guidance probably no
guidance not much structure and you get
minimum - no credibility unless you
create something awesome if you create
something awesome and you can put it on
your resume it's a really good showcase
of what you can do and you did all this
on your own that's pretty awesome that
might shine through the not doing these
other things the last cost not really
calm but the last thing to just be aware
of if you can afford to do the
conventional way or you can do the
bootcamp or life is affecting either of
those things something like this where
it's completely self-directed will
require like some significant focus and
medical strings and that's tough for
everyone so so that's just a basic
overview of potentially really quick
high-level decisions you can make with
deciding to pursue this as a career if
that's what you decided to do one thing
I want to talk about in more detail for
the second half of this video is the
path of the bootcamp so I want to review
that path before we dive into it but
it's why do I want to learn software I
want to get a job I want to make money I
want to be a developer how can I learn
it I can't do the conventional way so
I'm doing the non-conventional way
through a bootcamp and the one pro that
they always advertise it is going to get
you a job so how are they going to get
your job and let's just switch gears and
talk about that all right guys so what
you're seeing here is the curriculum for
the App Academy bootcamp there's a bunch
of them out there I personally have some
experience with App Academy they're in
San Francisco in New York City and I
think they have a pretty good curriculum
that know they've iterated on it I've
been to some of they're like demo days
and met students coming out of that
macadam ii and i do think they do a
pretty good job of structuring their
curriculum and getting people that you
know don't have conventional degrees
into software quickly and getting them
jobs so pretty much what they promised
is let's just look at this date this is
what they promised they
trained a bunch of students and the
graduates get hired at top tech
companies and earn an average salary of
whatever so how do they do that but they
do that with a very structured
curriculum that we're going to talk
about and it's always good to know the
purpose of these curriculums this these
curriculums are not meant to give you a
deep knowledge of computer science it's
just to get you in the door that's the
only purpose they're fulfilling a need
of supply and demand there's a lot of
demand for developers now as you guys
probably know so to meet that demand the
supplies got to go up and to make a
supply go up you have flexible
accessibility to learn about development
so let's just dive into like what their
curriculum is and they have 12 weeks and
we'll go through kind I'm going to do a
quick rundown of all 12 weeks and you
guys can look at this offline but just
to give a taste of what you could expect
at a bootcamp so first thing they teach
you is you have to learn a language they
pick Ruby but before you get into any
frameworks into web into anything you
have to just learn a language so they
teach you basic Ruby object-oriented
design how to write to a file and they
teach basic basic algorithms and data
structures so that's just learning the
language and that's like one week so
it's pretty crazy week two you will push
it a little further and you learn about
test-driven development so I think week
two is a get more into data structures
algorithms but it's still learning Ruby
at its core by the end of week two week
three you go straight into other
technologies which is sequel and active
record is a popular Ruby library to you
know sit on top of sequel and some
databases but here this is just to get
you familiar with databases and sequel
which is another pervasive technology
across the board teaches you how to
write queries right drawings design some
basic schema learn what foreign keys are
how to make indexes but this is also
very basic and it happens pretty fast
once you've learned the ins and outs of
the database they start teaching you
slow
they get into the web so week 4 I think
is the first introduction into web
technologies so this is the first
application of the software you've just
learned they teach you what HTTP is what
rest is what MVC means what routing
means you know how different URLs route
to different you know methods in your
back-end and basic authentication so I
think week 5 they keep pushing on that
you start learning rails because rails
is a very standard way of doing a web
programming with Ruby
so all this rails that you did in the
prior weeks is leading you up sorry all
the Ruby stuff you did in the prior
weeks with leading you up to learning
rails which will enable you to build web
applications and that's kind of week
five so week six I think they start
getting you into JavaScript a little
more if you learn rails it's more of AI
guess it back in technology but still
javascript is the dominant language of
the whole world according to Stack
Overflow so they gotta teach you some
JavaScript they also teach you react
which is you know the popular Facebook
framework for doing JavaScript these
days and react is pretty cool it's new
it's relevant and like I think they pick
it for a reason because a lot of
companies are hiring for it and you have
to learn these days if you just know
vanilla javascript is usually not enough
so they teach you like one framework and
library to use with it now getting to
weeks eight and nine is kind of the cool
thing so everyone at App Academy they do
these full stack projects at the end
don't read into all this stuff but
pretty much what the full stack project
is is they just replicate an existing
site so they remake Facebook's
they remake Twitter they remake Airbnb
and they just remake popular sites and
you kind of do it from one really you
kind of make a prototype of Facebook and
do whatever it takes to make that happen
so that's pretty cool because there's a
more real life example you're not just
you know doing one-off little projects
in
tutorials we are actually designing a
website that companies have designed so
that's pretty much once week 8 hits
that's for the remainder of the bootcamp
so the last part of their curriculum is
what they call algorithms and career
support and this part I thought was
particularly pretty interesting because
this part is getting you really ready to
apply for a job so this is how to do a
job search how to do resume cover letter
stuff how to prepare for interviews even
like salary negotiations tech workshops
also how to hire or how to get hired and
this is just all interview prep so these
last three weeks it's completely
dedicated for you to also get a job
which is really great because I think
what app Academy does is they get paid
when you finally land a job so yeah I
want to go into too many details of this
also they have a very you know
high-level overview of what they're
doing but hopefully you guys you guys
I'll give a link to this page later and
also my decision tree but if you take a
look at the curriculum that the bootcamp
has provided for you you have to
recognize that this is what other
developers have decided is the best way
to get in the door of a company as an
entry-level developer so this is like
this is like highly fine-tuned is what
I'm saying like if you're trying to go
on your own or if you don't have the
resources to even to go to a bootcamp
you might want to try to follow this to
get the fastest way to get in the door
because what they're doing here is
they're like pummeling you they're like
injecting you with all the necessary the
prerequisite skills just to add value as
a developer as a developer in any
company so pretty much this is the bare
bones of what it takes for you to get
paid as a developer and if that's what
you want to do I would suggest you might
even outside as you review this and you
know if your life supports that maybe
even taking on one of these boot camps
because it is flexible
still it cost less money but I think the
main thing for many people is that it's
flexible and not many people go through
the conventional way as life moves on it
just gets harder and harder to do this
number one here as you know you progress
into life so yeah that's about it guys
so the whole purpose of this video just
wanted to talk about why let's just do a
basic recap but if you're asking
yourself this question why do I want to
learn software it could be for two major
reasons but really know why you want to
learn software like learning software to
get a job as a developer is very
different in learning software just to
become more technical and once you've
made your decision either one or two you
have to figure out your path based on
life resources your own personality what
you think is going to work best for you
but there's a lot of stuff out there and
as we said we just do white into this
boot camp curriculum but if you want the
quick finely tuned way to get a job just
review this and it should be helpful so
that's it for the video guys please like
it if you liked it leave me any comments
this is always a topic that is slightly
controversial but you know you happen to
have a discussion in the comments check
out these links and hope everyone has a
great week all right
