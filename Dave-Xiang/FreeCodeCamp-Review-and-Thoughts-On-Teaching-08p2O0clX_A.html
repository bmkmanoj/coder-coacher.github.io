really really well
purpose of life and purpose of
everything sorry sorry I blocked out the
purpose of this video is to give a
review of free code camp and I have no
affiliation this should be an objective
unbiased review but it was just a
frequently asked comment I think three
or four or five people asked in the
comments what I thought a free code camp
so I'm going to make a video about it so
we'll do a review of free code camp comm
and then we'll just talk a little bit
more about learning teaching and talk
about that just like we always do so
without further ado let's just get
straight into it first high level review
of the video but I thought of six
I thought of six major points that I
want to talk about regarding free code
camp four of them are pros to them are
cons so we can't say all these things we
can't say all bad things
so first let's get straight into the
good stuff I think my overall if you
don't want to watch this my overall
score for free code camp is going to be
at 92 so a solid a - let's just run
through these first thing that can't be
understated the number one thing that
differentiates this from everything else
is that is free so every single meeting
of learning in the current world it all
costs some money like school costs money
boot camps cost a lot of money or you
pay your salary textbooks books all cost
money online curriculums cost money now
almost everything you got to pay some
cash to get it but this is one thing
that's actually just like open source is
just completely free and that's very
rare first thing I'll ask everyone we
have to appreciate anybody that gives
stuff away for free the people behind
free code camp they put in a lot of work
put in a lot of hours develop a really
nice application and environment and
community and they just give it a way
for people for free so you have to
appreciate that because it's just point
zero zero one percent of
is actually completely free so that's
the number one thing and that's why I
think it's a really good resource so
that's the that gets it da - so free
best part of it
second thing I want to talk about that's
a really good benefit of free code camp
is that it's community driven so one
thing that's all usually lacking when
you're trying to learn something online
or by yourself is that there is no
community that can be built because
naturally those things are built easier
when things are in real life
so when things are online you have to
kind of make community so they have
forms a lot of the contributors a lot of
different people like pushing or
contributing their knowledge to free
code camp which gives it a nice
community and it's definitely clear that
they emphasize that because you can't
understate how important a community is
to learn being an environment with your
peers while also learning that's one of
the main benefits of school I think
because really learning by yourself just
totally silent by yourself is actually
much harder it has passed a couple mic
disadvantages rather than learning in
the community so it focused on community
good next probe that I want to talk
about that is usually a really good
thing can sometimes be a little bit of a
bad thing but first let's talk about why
it's good they put in a lot of work to
make their applications pre-code camp
very interactive for the students so
they have real-time immediate feedback
of if your code works if it doesn't work
how you're doing the progress you're
making all that stuff it built the whole
environment in the browser for you to
give you a very dynamic feeling which is
really nice so if they guide you through
all of these things and you're never
really lost because they're telling you
if your code passed the test or doesn't
pass assess they give you kind of the
sample and guide line step by step of
what you need to do so it's very
interactive very dynamic and for the
complete beginner that's
last good point I want to talk about it
that there's a lot of supplementary
resources to free code camp right they
have a lot of things they have their
website they got a popular YouTube
channel they got a nice blog post I read
some of their blogs from Quincy the
founder he's definitely a really smart
guy I can tell just by his writing but a
lot of supplementary resources because
remember there's a lot of different ways
we can learn whether it's video text
book online curriculum whatever it is
but there's a lot of different ways to
learn and they provided all for you and
aggregated just take my channel for
example like Mike this is just a YouTube
channel this is not an optimal place to
learn something all I do is I take a
bunch of my class I just upload them up
here and I guess some people enjoy them
but it's very just like a hodgepodge of
things one nice thing about free code
campus that they aggregate the resources
for you and there is definitely a lot of
value just in grouping it all together
remember the number one questions are
like what's the best book for that where
are the links for that what should I
read to do that but when someone just
brings it all together for you there's
already value in that end they're doing
it alright so those are four really nice
things about free go camp let's talk
about I just have two things that could
use improvement not really bad things
but I think just something to be
cautious about and keep on your mind
that isn't awesome so the first thing
I'll talk about is that there's a little
too much hand-holding with free code
camp and what I mean by hand-holding is
that they really spoon-feed you
everything because for the complete
beginner that's okay but even if you're
really new you should not be spoon-fed
or hand-held all the time one of the
quotes on the websites that they provide
the whole environment for you all the
testing stuff all the setup stuff so you
can just focus on the coding which is
good to a certain extent but you're
coding right around you're just coding
but around coding there's a lot of other
stuff there's how-to
your computer how to set up software how
to actually deploy your application
there's a lot of stuff that surrounds
just you know writing lines of code and
all the surrounding stuff is equally
important the fact that they kind of
abstract that all away from you so you
don't worry about that is a little
dangerous because that's actually stuff
you should worry about the other thing
that hand-holding does a little bit is
kind of doesn't push you in the
engineering mindset so we've already
talked about this a lot I've talked
about it probably a thousand times so we
all have to get really comfortable being
uncomfortable right the whole essence of
engineering and problem-solving is that
you just get into the dark you just fall
into the dark you have to crawl your way
out of it if your handheld too much of
the times you don't get that environment
you don't get that kind of like
sensation instilled into your brain
because we have to get really used to
just figuring out our way out of
darkness right and if it's just
hand-holding they tell you exactly what
to do where you're going wrong and you
never really get that feeling and that
feeling is really important so not
really a bad part of it I mean Rico camp
it is what it is they know there are
supplementary resources they're not
saying they can replace everything they
fully acknowledge that they're actually
a supplementary source so they are
hand-holding you a lot it's really
designed for very very beginners but you
won't get really that training of being
the dark from the website so that's my
major point of feedback but the next one
I have is for organization this is a
very hard thing to do and when I solve
Rico camps that are very ambitious which
is awesome so if you go to their website
I'll post a link to the website
somewhere but if you look at all the
table of contents of what to provide
they provide a ton of stuff everything
from front end to machine learning data
visualization v3 they have node.js
Express they have react they have they
even have videos on computer systems
like networking how computer works this
slice all that stuff but they're really
ambitious of what they're trying to
program
and provides other platform but it's not
very organized this is probably just
like a natural growing pain of what
they're providing but they've pretty
much dumped a ton of resources on you
but they haven't really told you how you
might kind of traverse and like take
each resource because the way they
present it it's just a straight-up huge
list that they recommend you follow it
step by step this huge list that they've
designed but you know there's so much
information you really can't just
blindly go through a huge list like that
and how to be really effective so I
think they're trying too much to stuff
it with data without thinking hard about
what is like the right path for people
to take all they're doing is stuffing
resources on you so when you look at
their website you're going to see a lot
of information and just kind of one
singular path follow which isn't exactly
correct all in all I think for you go
camp is a really good resource if you
haven't checked it out again number one
thing is that it's free they're doing
this for you for free and you just you
have to appreciate that but the next
second half of the video I just want to
talk about some other thoughts I had
about teaching and learning that are
related to this and we're going to start
where we left off with this whole
organization concept your learning is
never going to be straight sequential so
when I think of knowledge if you just
think of knowledge there's a term
knowledge graph knowledge tree there's a
video I shared a long time or a
computing civil where I showed like this
nice roadmap that somebody made where
this is nice graph of all the different
tech and technologies you can pursue and
it shows you all the different lines
that connect someone
you think of knowledge as a whole it's
more of a graph than like a straight
sequential lines we grasp many different
nodes many different edges so if
knowledge is a graph the analogy is
knowledge is a graph you're learning is
your traversal through the graph or how
you kind of move around inside the graph
there's only really two ways you could
potentially do this you can do a breath
like breath shallow search of the graph
or you can go deep like a depth-first
search like clean really really really
deep into categories those are really
the only two ways of traversing the
graph but you will control that
traversal I know this sounds really
abstract but if I can give one piece of
abstract advice on how to traverse the
knowledge graph is that if you're just
starting yet I would always stay shallow
because it's really dangerous to get so
far deep without staying relatively
shallow so what I like to do is you stay
shallow for a while and when you feel
really comfortable you take one and you
follow it deep but then you come back
and redo the shallow part again you
follow things deeper come back up and
then go deeper and eventually the
shallowness just itself gets deeper and
your knowledge of everything grows but
the only thing I would warn against is
you go too deep into one part of the
graph without knowing other parts so if
you're just starting yet you get so deep
the JavaScript that might hurt you the
next point I want to make is about
teaching and teaching I don't think
people really really give it enough
gratitude or understand how difficult
teaching is a lot of the times the
students are like crap I don't I don't
get it the teacher must suck but
actually teaching thorough teaching like
really concrete teaching is extremely
difficult
I think the reason why it's so difficult
is it's kind of like software think
about software for one second there's a
billion ways to do the same exact things
similarly we're teaching there's just a
billion ways to do things it's very
subjective no two teachers are the same
so you have like millions of ways of
teaching something and then on the
student side you have millions of ways
of learning something right and if
you're really lucky you'll find this
like perfect synergy of teaching and
learning but let's be real here you're
not going to find it so talk a little
bit about responsibility like what does
that mean like responsibility like it's
a more the responsibility of the
teachers to teach in really really good
ways or is it more of the responsibility
of the student to be able to learn and
digest information in different ways and
I think the answer for that is largely
based on your context so let's just take
quick dichotomy first is you're in an
establishment when I say establishment
it's like during that boot camp here in
school you're in college you're in some
established structure if you're in an
established structure I think the
responsibility lies on the teachers to
be very good at teaching you through
very different mediums like teaching you
through lectures homework lab office
hours all that stuff in establishment
the teachers have to accommodate the
students now let's take it to the other
side of the spectrum and do no
establishment what if you're not a part
of any establishment you're just trying
to learn on your own or self-directed
but if this is the case then the
responsibility lies on you to be a good
student because
when you're doing it by yourself you
can't change how someone is teaching it
right because you're not controlling
that you're not a part of any
establishment so when you're on your own
the responsibilities on you to have a
flexible mind to digest different types
of information you have to be able to
read a book by yourself do an online
course by yourself maybe take classes by
yourself but when you're on your own
that responsibility is on you not the
establishment because there is no
establishment
next kind of idea I had was this concept
of this trio of things so what is this
trio but here Mia first is platform
second is method and third is category
this is kind of like the trio of
learning let's talk about it a little
more the platform is kind of like where
are you when you're learning is it
online self-study in an establishment in
a classroom or whatever else it's the
platform the methods are kind of like
the medium or like how you're going
about just learning so four different
methods I brainstormed words theory
lessons labs or projects and this is
really like what is the method of you
learning theory could be just reading a
book reading a huge book lessons is like
lecture notes downloading lecture notes
having some kind of flow and thought
process through one unit like one lesson
labs could be like first hands on
slightly directives but hands on
exercise of applying some of the theory
you learn and then finally projects are
like undirected independence
type of work so those are different
methods and everyone's going to like
different methods equally if you can't
always stick to one remember you can
only do theory without labs you can't
only do project work without
understanding theory so those are all
methods and each method is paired with a
specific class one right you can do
self-study platform and do some labs or
you can do a classroom project and
finally the last part of the trio is
just the easiest quarter this is just
categories categories is the core thing
you want to learn like the language the
framework for computers you want to
learn about networking you want to learn
about compilers what is it the core
thing you want to learn but forever for
whatever you want to learn you have
those three kind of trio of options to
choose from if you're still here I think
I'm getting a little bit crazy I'm going
a little bit off the script and just
talking but this trio thing one last
thing about this trio thing platform
methods and categories but everything
this is obviously very personal like
that's a personal thing like you
choosing how you learn what classroom
you learn best and what you actually
want to learn that's all you so when I
get a lot I get a lot of questions in
the comments of like what's the best
book for this how should I learn how to
program how do I learn Python like how
do I do this like I don't answer a lot
of those questions not because I'm not
feeling like answering but I really
don't want to answer those questions
because that's all personal for you and
I don't want to give you what works for
me because that might not work for you
so all of those questions like how do I
learn that in itself is something that
you have to find out for yourself
because it's very personalized like how
you learn is going to be totally
specialized to you and not for anyone
else so just the fact that you have to
ask people
to determine how you learn shows you
haven't put enough effort in trying to
learn because there's kind of like a
subtle art form in like finding what
clicks best for you and maybe this trio
could help you if you wanted to take
this and break it down break it down by
all the platforms that you like you
don't like online but you like school or
you like school and you like online too
and then once you have the platforms you
like think about the methods that you
like do you like theory stuff do you
like lesson stuff more do you like more
independent you like handheld but
everyone likes different types of
methods and finally categories obviously
categories it's totally up to you you
can learn whatever you want but at the
end of the day you are picking so you
ask other people like me or anyone ask
no one can give you a really good answer
of how you should do it so stop asking
and if you ask and somebody gives you an
answer you always take it with a grain
of salt because it might not work for
you alright guys that's it for the video
that enough bullshitting here but the
main purpose of the video is to talk
about free code camp again summarize
amazing resource because it's freeing
they've done a lot of work to build a
community hydrogate information for you
interactive the only thing I would be
careful against is that don't be
handheld too much you've got to figure
out a lot of the stuff up for yourself
free code camp is doing a lot of the
scaffolding the legwork for you but be
careful because you got to do that stuff
as well and finally when you go to their
website it's a lot of informations can
be a dump a dump of stuff on you and
it's not very organized so the way you
organize it the way you organize your
learning or your traversal through the
knowledge graph that's totally up to you
and my recommendation for that is read
first and then
and then breath and this step so that's
all I have to say hope you enjoy the
video leave me a comment like click the
thumbs up all that good stuff and I'll
see you next time alright guys take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
