doing really really well it's July 4th
weekend here officially in the
full-screen of summer really hot and
humid where I'm at right now but we got
a long weekend hopefully everyone's
enjoying themselves the entire purpose
of the video this week is going to be
answering one email I got a long long
time ago sorry I responded saying I
would make a video to answer your
question and I'm finally doing that even
though that was months ago but I didn't
forget I thought this question was
really good really relatable relatable
for me probably relatable for a lot of
people and the general gist of it is
feeling left behind in the industry of
software or tech or whatever so first
thing I want to do is just read the
question all right so I'm going to read
this question word-for-word the English
might be a little broken but I'll paste
it here or something I'm working for
years IBM India and standalone java
module creation Java SE which will be
hosted in corpora I don't know what that
is and front-end made in Avila and Java
swings is a client legacy old
application created in 1995 yeah I'm
feeling alone to the industry I have no
experience in web development recently I
started working at spring boots when I'm
looking to learn as the list is big HTML
CSS JavaScript bootstrap well angular
react Ruby PHP JP hibernate VBS cloud
there are a lot of things and a lot of
people are already good at this I'm
worried if I'll be able to survive in
this industry I can't concentrate on
studying things this fear is always
there also my major of civil engineering
this is also dragging me back to
mentally everything I am learning myself
I believe in basics not going with the
trends this also may be a negative in
today's world from your videos I see you
as a guy who is keeping it simple I feel
this is what I am missing so I thought
you could help me for a self learner
could you please advise I need a path
board and helping hand
so that was a mouthful but I think
everyone got a general gist of the
question like the general tone of the
emails definitely one of anxiety scared
of being left behind and that's
something we can all relate to so whole
point of this video is that I just want
to break down dissect this question I
think I'm going to try to answer it as
directly and specifically as possible
and hopefully it helps everyone all
right let's do it
first thing I want to do for this
question is just break it down in terms
of emotions or feelings because there's
a lot going on in this email and let's
just break down the four problem points
first and then we can try to address it
so from my perspective when I read it I
thought there were four there were four
things on this person's mind they were
working on irrelevant technology falling
behind two is there's too much to learn
and it's overwhelming three is there's
slight impostor syndrome due to civil
engineering being a previous major and
four there's unknown steps about the
future following the trends or sticking
to the basics so those four things these
four things are the major kind of
emotions I got from this email message
and I want to talk about each one
specifically so let's just get straight
into it let's talk about point number 1
which is feeling left behind or working
on irrelevant technologies and first the
first thing I just want to say is that
this is a really common feeling I feel
that a lot if you feel it means millions
of other people feel the same way
second thing I want to address is that
the major thing to fix this situation is
putting yourself in the right
environment and I think environment is
the key thing here and I can't stress
that enough let's just take your
environment view and the email
completely objectively okay you're
working at IBM as a software developer
and even though you're frustrated
yourself by the team this position
actually if you read that on a CV or you
read that on a resume it looks really
good and a lot of people would kill to
be a software developer at IBM it's a
legendary company first let's just state
the obvious iBM is a huge company
the different teams let's just call them
tons of different environments and I
don't think every single environment is
working on code from 1995 there are a
lot of teams going on and I'm sure I'll
be very surprised if everybody's working
on code from the 90s so the first thing
I just want to ask you
writer of this email but have you done
the most that you can do to position
yourself even within IBM to work on
technologies that are more relevant
because you're on a team that's working
on code from the 90s but I'm positive
there are other teams really close to
you you work in IBM India
that's probably there's a huge you know
tons of stuff going down there and I'm
almost positive there stuff like right
around the corner that you could
probably look into so first thing is
have you done your best to position
yourself as best you can just within IBM
so all of us are human right you're
watching me
Elon Musk Bill Gates whatever everyone
is human and some people are different
than others but we all just have one
kind of tank of energy per day like we
have just one tank of energy per day and
it slowly slowly slowly depletes itself
it's physically not possible to work 16
or 20 hours at 100% for the whole day
you only have so much energy per day so
it's up to us to use those energy or
mana whatever you want to call it most
effectively and the easiest way to use
your energy points most effectively is
that you just have to position yourself
in the right environment so in your case
for example your nine-to-five job you're
spending nine to ten hours looking at
code from 1995 of course your brain is
going to be tired when you go home and
try to learn about web technologies you
just physically like biology you don't
have enough energy to do that well this
is really why I think environment is
really important and hopefully I didn't
lose you with this whole energy tank
concepts but if you're in a good
environment where you're kind of working
on things that you want to work on
that's the best because it's the most
effective way to use that energy you
want to use the energy as effectively as
possible and the easiest way to do that
if make sure it's aligned with your job
or your school your major or just you
environment it's really abstract but the
reason why I think you're so tired is
that all your energy tank is spent on
your day job looking at codes from 1995
and you're you're getting too tired and
anxious so what you really have to do is
really take a clear look at your
environment and change it and start
working on code not from the 90s and
then your energy tank will just be
aligned with most with your energy tank
will be aligned with what's most
practical and what actually is going to
give you value so that's the dream
that's what you need to shoot for and I
think you can do it
okay second second emotion that we had
to talk about is having too much to
learn and it gets a little overwhelming
so I should make this pretty quick I
don't have any groundbreaking advice for
this whatsoever the only thing I have to
say is that humans you know we work
concurrently right humans don't really
work in parallel we take on a lot of
things at the same time we take on a lot
of different tasks and eventually we
have to be done but you know it's proven
that you can't take on 10 or 20 things
at the same time and do them all
effectively so my very normal non
groundbreaking advice is just focus on
two or three things already in your
email you listed 10 technologies that
you want to learn and your lifts already
isn't that it isn't designed very well
it's all over the place you haven't
picked the two or three things that make
sense together you're all over the place
and once you do that you can't take on
ten things concurrently and do all that
because just think of your energy in
your brain as like a processor right a
processor has two contact switch between
different processes and that actually
takes that's a very expensive thing so
just like us if you have to contact
swish between ten different things all
your energy will be spent switching
instead of focusing on the two to three
core things so I think with this emotion
I think how I just read from your short
emails that you have it's pretty typical
I think there's just option overload
paralysis and when that happens you
really have to dissect it down to two or
three things so actually I mean I'm in
your shoes right now so I'm actually
trying to learn Java it's a new like
kind of realm
of Technology that I'm just getting into
too and I'm actually probably learning
the same exact things you're trying to
learn so right now I'm focusing just on
spring and hibernate
that's all I'm focusing on for now and
then I'm going to come back and dissect
Java the language more and then move
into more frameworks but I'm only doing
two things like - two things maybe three
things the two things at a time so I'm
trying to do this but you just have to
break it up I think the list that you
gave me just to just represent that
you're taking on too much you have to
organize what you're learning better
because you'll get better at that with
time but you just when you see that lets
grow more than five something is wrong
all right halfway done third third
feeling from this email is that there's
a little bit of this imposter I don't
know I don't know the right word but
kind of impostor syndrome due to civil
engineering in the past I get this a lot
too and I think it's actually maybe a
deeper issue in your mentality not
really in your technical skills but I
actually think it's somewhat
straightforward to overcome this because
I think a lot of these feelings is just
straight biology and neurotransmitters
so let me explain that a little more the
cliche simple device is always the best
advice so the civil engineering thing
you were a civil engineer in your
previous major and now you're a software
developer like you're a software
developer at IBM
there's no argument for that right now
at the present moment you are a software
developer and that civil engineering
thing is already in the past so the idea
is that you're a software developer now
and you're going to do whatever it takes
to level up and move forward in that
space because I'm assuming you've chosen
to be a software developer not a civil
engineer again so what that kind of
means is that when you introduce
yourself to a new person you introduce
yourself as hey I'm a software developer
and I happen to learn civil engineering
before you're not going to introduce
yourself as hey I'm a civil engineer
trying to be a software developer so
hope that makes sense it's kind of like
if you think too much in the past
you just get depressed right if you
think too much in the future you just
get anxious so you just have to think as
best you can just think in the present
moment but you know many people have
said that I'm saying it again but it's
the same it's the same advice for all
this stuff the second thing that I think
you should do is that you're feeling a
lot I can I can sense it that you're
feeling a lot of mental drag and I think
it's good to offset that by having small
wins for yourself
you mentioned stuff like you're tired
from work you can't focus on learning
all these new technologies you said you
said really briefly in the email that
other people are already good at this
which by indirection is kind of meaning
that other people are already good at
this why do I have to be good at this
but I can just tell that overall it's
like mentally dragging you down and one
thing you can do is you just need small
wins and it's biology because let me
describe small wins just make yourself a
to-do list easy to do this like number
one is finish online tutorial about Java
framework and once you do that you just
cross it off and you have one small win
for yourself because I think when you're
mentally dragged down you physically
need biology like neurotransmitters to
get those small wins and gets you back
up and get your self-esteem and
mentality back up because all it is
every feeling like every science right
you just have to it's all engineered
every feeling you're experiencing right
now it's just different signals and
neurotransmitters going through your
brain you can kind of control that if
you just give yourself small wins just
make us a do list check it off you just
get a little injection of dopamine into
your brain and you feel good and that's
going to hopefully offset it if you're
like depression like that's actually
like just you know a weird behavior of
neurotransmitters into your brain I'm
not describing that well but aside from
doing drugs you'd be surprised at how
well you could control just your
feelings if you're active about it so
don't do drugs you can do drugs if you
really want to but I think the mental
drag part is that you just have to
create dopamine essentially and make
yourself a little happier
all right so we're at the fourth and
last point that I want to address and
this is just having an unknown future
state you're not sure what to do if you
stick to the basics go with the trends
and I guess the general feeling is that
you're not sure how to go about this in
the future one thing that you mentioned
in your email that actually stood out to
me as potentially a very dangerous
sentiment was that you mentioned
sticking to the basics which is good but
you also mentioned that you don't want
to go with the trends which is very
dangerous
first I just want to clarify myself you
know if anyone who's watched my videos
for a while now I always say the same
things like look a foundation and keep
it simple go back to the basics but when
I say those things I don't mean that you
can neglect the trends so again just to
reiterate I want to make this crystal
clear is that I do preach foundation and
all that basic stuff but you still have
to keep an eye on the trend you have to
learn the trends with the strong
foundation I the only thing I say is
that you don't follow the trends blindly
without learning how a computer works
first you have to learn both
simultaneously and if you're stronger in
the foundation you can push the trends
up the trends up harder and if you're
not strong in this foundation you should
focus on that first before you try to
get deep into like VR programming when
you don't know how software works let's
think about it practically you do have
to follow the trends to a certain extent
because that's what makes you kind of
valuable in today's society and you know
the system is the system if you want to
get paid for the work you're learning
you've got to keep up to a certain
extent you can't avoid that you can't
just learn ski and be like I have I
learned CM better than that so let's get
a little more specific
just for your question right you are
interested in learning more about web
technologies and you've been doing
standard java not even enterprise java
but you've been doing standard vanilla
java at your job at IBM and it was
written in 1995 and to be honest yes
you're right what you're working on is
irrelevant the good news about this is
that java is still not going anywhere
and it's still a huge skill like a huge
demand skill and that's also one of the
reasons why I'm trying to learn it but
people still use Java heavily for huge
amounts of huge amount of things and web
is just one of them and it sounds like
you do want to get into more web
technologies so my advice for you
specifically from your case is that
don't switch from Java
you mentioned react JavaScript Ruby and
your list just stick with stick with
Java don't switch languages and do
everything it takes to learn about Java
as it applies to web programming and
there's only a certain select set of
frameworks or libraries that you really
have to understand so I would just focus
on Java and Java with the web and just
dominate that for now don't switch
languages don't look it to anything else
don't even don't look at javascript or
anything like that all you have to do is
learn web programming with Java it's
pretty it's pretty straightforward just
write right down on your wall like java
web programming write it on your wall
and then you just look at it every day
all right guys just final piece of
advice and all this is that we talked
about all these four different emotions
here but I want to go back to the first
one because I think the first one
definitely is most relevant in your case
and probably many people's cases but you
just have to align yourself well your
you have to align your energy tank your
energy points for the day with your
environment and when those two things
are aligned well you can progress faster
and not get burned up so for the person
that wrote this email if your team
really is just working on code from the
90s you do have to change different
teams because yes you're probably
getting irrelevant with your skills with
that said I'm certain there's some place
in IBM where you can go that is working
on newer technologies and if that's also
not possible which I think it is
possible but that you have to do
something drastic to switch your
environment to get out of that because
you shouldn't be maintaining code from
1995 I don't think you should be doing
that if you forget everything I said I
would still focus on the environment
because when you control the environment
or at least you position yourself in
your environment differently you're just
going to use your energy tank more
effectively and the only thing that
separates out different people is that
everyone has the same
amount of energy right it's just biology
you have a similar tank as me and we
have a similar tank maybe a smaller tank
than you know Bill Gates or something
but still every it's human we're all
human and we have a limited amount of
energy stays and stuff in our life and
well I'll just die one day so it doesn't
really matter so this focus use your
energy wealth align yourself with the
environment and I think everything
should be okay all right so that's all I
have to say about this email definitely
try to dissect your email as best I
could
hopefully this answer was good or
helpful even though it's long overdue
and please let me know if you thought so
but hope everyone join enjoyed this
please give me a like comment share the
video maybe but ask me any questions in
the comments I'll be happy to answer all
right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
