and it's inspired by some great views
that I just got today today my little
sister just called me and told me that
she got accepted into her very first
internship for any college student out
there getting your first internship or
co-op is a huge milestone it's one step
towards your career something awesome
you can put on your resume besides
working at like dominoes you're actually
worthwhile and it shows you that you're
doing something right we're all really
happy for her and we're gonna wish her
the best of luck
we ran her club I think it's a hospital
somewhere so now instead of a useless
student she can become just a useless
intern which is better just kidding this
inspired me to make a video to talk
about one important part of getting that
internship and that's the interviewing
so when I give five tips I have to help
you represent yourself to the best
whoever you're interviewing for there
are a lot of things to consider and
there's definitely more than five these
are just my top five and hopefully you
guys find it helpful the first thing you
should do is prepare obviously what I
mean by preparing is preparing yourself
on a personal level to be able to answer
any questions that are related to the
job to the best of your ability whether
it be professional or just a student
looking for internship the interviewer
has a set expectation of the skill level
and knowledge that the interview must be
at or half and it's your job to be at
that level and meet his expectation so
if you're a college student make sure
you can talk and explain everything on
your resume don't put stuff on there
that you don't know anything about it
just makes no sense if you're
professional and just be able to talk
about the projects you've worked on and
how you impact with your team here come
this is just preparation on a personal
level and if you spend enough time it
doesn't it won't even take you that much
time hopefully you'll be ready
unless you've been insane slacker at
school then maybe you're just not ready
you should be the number two is to just
kill the behavioral interview questions
behavioral interview questions are
really easy because the interviewer is
just expecting an answer out of you they
just ask them how to formality and you
just deliver what they want to hear so
questions like tell me about yourself
what's your greatest weakness what's the
best way to cheat on an in-class exam
name a time you had a conference with a
teammate and how did you resolve it all
these questions are just basic questions
that you need to feed to the interviewer
that's my point number two is just
really rehearse those behavioral
interview problems because you should
kill those point three is to ask good
questions interviewers just really
appreciate it
when you have a valid thoughtful
question to ask them about the position
or company it just reinforces your
interest for the position and it shows
that you actually care and one other
thing to note is that when you're
interviewing there are stupid questions
so don't ask the stupid question because
then the interviewer will hate you point
for that I want to make is the details
the details are what's gonna separate
you from the rest of the fish in the sea
if the interviewer asks you to put a
function don't mess up the syntax if you
feel like there's some information left
out of this question interviewer private
on purpose so make sure you ask some
clarifying questions when you answer
your question just make sure you try to
cover all the cases details
the last point is probably the hardest
point of all obvious it depends highly
on your interviewer the last thing you
should try is to get on a personal level
with the interviewer the interviewer is
not a robot he's also a person and you
can talk to him like a person so I'm not
saying to be completely relaxed call him
grow
we're trying to ask her out on a date
which is inappropriate but just keep it
formal and have a conversation with them
because that's what they're there for
well that was my last tip and that
concludes the five things that I think
are pretty important I hope you guys can
take some of this consideration and I
hope it helped next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
