quick episode today on software
developer life episode 3 and we're just
going to talk about performance reviews
performance reviews you guys know what
this is but it takes many different
shapes and forms between different
companies six months every year get
together talk about your goals what
you're gonna do in the future where you
did well on where you did bad on ok so
now for the honest truth but 90% of the
time doing these performance reviews is
like a chore for people they just don't
really want to do it people are busy
they're focusing on their own work they
don't want to spend their time you know
thinking about giving goals to some
other engineer so I mean you might be
really lucky I think maybe 5 10 % of the
time you have a really good manager
really good mentor he really cares about
you really cares about your growth but
that honestly that doesn't happen very
often in this video I'm just gonna give
three basic ways for you to improve
yourself alright point number one is
easy it's just whatever languages you're
working with read about them you need to
do better than just get things working
you have to really understand the
languages and technologies you're using
so reading is really good for this if
you're using C or C++ pick up some books
and really learn the ins and outs of C++
so you can really understand and utilize
the language instead of just getting
things working all right
point number two is understanding how
the system works around you many times
that big companies you're rather
isolated you're working in your own
little bubble kind of your own little
black box so you don't really know
what's going on around you well I think
point number two which is really
important is kind of understanding how
the whole system works if the system is
too big like you're working at like
Google you can't like understand
everything right but at the very least
you have to understand how the tech
works right beside you or your neighbors
so point number two is just to increase
your scope a little bit you know broaden
your understanding really know how
things work together and don't just work
in a little bubble all the time
last point third point is just do a
little bit of introspection on yourself
and this is not technical at all
introspection is just periodically
asking yourself what you really want
what you really want to learn what you
really want to get out of stuff
obviously like this is the stuff your
manager should be helping you with but
in the end your manager is not going to
understand what you really want more
than you understand it right this is a
little deeper than just goal settings
you just like introspect yourself and
figure out dig deep what you really want
last point about this is that you don't
think in this process you actually write
stuff down so when you're doing your
periodic introspection just write down a
list of all these things and I guarantee
you it's gonna be much better than the
goals for 2016
list that your manager puts together
remember you understand yourself the
best right so don't think about it just
write those things down all right guys
that's the end of this video software
developer life episode 3 pretty easy
it's just that honestly a lot of people
are not going to spend time doing really
good performance reviews for you so in
the end it's just up to you okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
