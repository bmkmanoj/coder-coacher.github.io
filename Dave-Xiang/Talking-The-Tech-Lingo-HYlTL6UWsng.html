well having a great week this video
we're gonna talk about talking obviously
this is not just any kind of talking
this is having a technical conversation
with someone talking tech tech lingo
talking nerdy whatever you want to call
it but when you're in a conversation
with another engineer or another
developer you want to be on the same
wavelength and that starts with having a
good conversation and using the right
words at the right time probably when
you're first starting out or you're
really beginner it's tough to follow a
lot of the words that are being thrown
around when you're talking with someone
you don't know what a lot of them mean
you don't have the right context of
what's going on and it's really
intimidating because you don't want to
sound dumb you want to sound competent
all that stuff but it's actually pretty
difficult and one of the reasons why I
think it's so difficult is because the
same exact words one word can have a
technical meaning that's very different
across different context and that's what
we're gonna talk about first let's just
define what this context means so when
you're having a conversation with
someone they could be jumping in and out
of different contexts first they're
talking about the operating system oh
then they're talking about the language
and then they're talking about some
third-party frameworks and then about
networks and then about your own code
but whatever it is people often jump
around you often do this too but the
moment you jump from context to context
let's talk about java or let's talk
about linux now but that's when things
get really difficult to follow because
every single word as i just stated it
could mean different things across
context so one of the main things that I
think a lot of people don't talk about
is that the first way to just ground
yourself in any conversation is you have
to be following the context at any point
in time you can't just have a dictionary
of definitions in your head and being
able to recite them you have to know
what special words mean as they're used
in special places that just comes with
practice of course but that's something
a lot of people don't actually talk
about you just have to be aware of the
context of a conversation and if you're
really a beginner it's a little bit
jarring so why is all this important
well two reasons one is easy you just
want to be able to understand and be on
the same wavelength as other people
around you but the second reason which I
think is more important is that all of
this the core of it is to help you
communicate better all of this stuff of
choosing the right context choosing the
right word knowing kind of your frame
all of this is to actually help you be
able to communicate your thoughts better
and when you're in the technical field
programming that's really really
important not just talking with other
developers but talking with all sorts of
people you have to communicate your
thoughts to every single non-technical
department as well as technical people
and that's when all this skills become
really useful so what we're gonna do in
this video is that there's a ton of
context out there I just took five five
examples that we're gonna blow through
talk about but there's a lot of
different contexts and you'll just get
more use of them as you become more
technical but we're gonna talk about
five and let's just get straight into it
so I have five different contexts and
the way it's gonna work it's gonna kind
of start from the bottom and go slowly
slowly slowly to the top so the first
one I'm gonna start at the bottom but
this is what I'm calling the system
context think of the system as anything
below the programming language you're
using so this is Linux the operating
system this is the big distributed
network but for most of us I'm assuming
most people watching like for me
applications software development and
we're using a language right we use a
language and then there's a bucket of
stuff under the language I'm gonna call
that bucket the system the nice thing
about the system all this huge pile of
stuff below our languages is that most
of the words are very well defined if
you're talking about Linux for example
your home directory always means your
home directory if you're talking about
networks latency and bandwidth have
well-defined meanings but in that
context the system like inside Linux or
inside the operating system all those
words mean very specific things and
that's a little easier so that bottom
level is the first level you
now if we go to the second level let's
go one level up and now we're going to
talk about programming languages right
you know most frequently asked question
is what programming languages should I
learn tons of programming languages I
think the number one most popular one
according to Stack Overflow is
JavaScript now but even words have
different meanings across languages
which is why you have to start getting
being careful at this area so just for
example the word module right very
general word module what does that even
mean but module means one thing in Ruby
it means one thing in Python it can mean
another thing in JavaScript but just
that one word it can mean very different
things across programming languages and
if you just take your Python definition
of module and you apply it to Ruby or
JavaScript it's not going to be correct
so this is the first level where you
have to start being really careful
because words are going to become
overloaded okay so let's just keep
blowing through this list one level
above programming languages it's our
third level and this is going to be
third-party libraries so as many
developers know we don't really write
100% of things from scratch if you do
you're probably a crazy Russian
programmer but most of us use other
people's software to helpless
third-party libraries so open source
stuff different frameworks cool
libraries we all take it into our code
as long as they have good licenses we
take it into our code and we use it all
to make our applications work because we
don't have to reinvent the wheel there
is so much software out there so very
general sounding words like controller
container worker processor whatever you
have it but very general technical
programming type of words they're often
reused in these third-party libraries
one thing that I found is really helpful
when you talk about this yourself is
that you can almost namespace or prefix
those words when you use them well so
let's say you're using rails to build
your application
rales uses a thing called controllers
they just call things controllers that's
a rails thing that's not a ruby thing
that's not a whatever thing that's
purely part of the framework but when
you're having a conversation with
someone instead of just saying oh let's
put the code inside the controller if
you want to be extra extra clear you can
say let's put things inside the rails
controller so it's kind of like
real-life namespacing so again
third-party applications you're
definitely gonna use them pulling
software from around the world but
you're pulling in software that you
don't control you can't really control
how they've named something so when you
talk about third-party software just be
extra clear of how they're using the
words fourth level up above third-party
frameworks is just your own software
right we're at the fourth layer and this
is your own application logic and this
is pretty much free game right you can
name anything whatever you want you
could call something a arbiter
orchestration super module and that
means gibberish but inside the context
of your code it could mean something so
at this level when you're working on one
application if you're doing it by
yourself it's easier right you name
things whatever you want to name them
and it's really really convenient but
the moment you share your application
code with the team with your friends
when there's a group of people working
on their code then you have to actually
be careful of how things are named so if
one person on the team decides to call
this class a super orchestration module
everybody should understand what a super
orchestration module needs in the
context of your own code right so this
is super subjective but as you go from
job to job department apartment you're
gonna work in very different code bases
with very different teams and each one
of those code bases is gonna have a
certain set of their own words that mean
very special things so the first thing
the best thing you can do in those
situations is that look at that code
base and just know what the words mean
all right we're at the last context now
this is the fifth-highest context and
I'm just calling this business stuff so
a very very few minority of people work
only with
for the most of us the majority of us if
we have a job we want to start a company
or do anything you have to work with
non-technical people or business people
right so if you have a whole basket of
technical words down here on top of all
of that you still have business words
business words are crazy acronyms that
companies come up with crazy words of
the company or corporate lingo whatever
you want to call it but these are just
totally words special for a company or a
project or business and these words even
though they're not technical whatsoever
you still have to use them properly
remember my first point I made in the
beginning of this video but one of the
most important things of using the right
words at the right time is just that it
can effectively promote your own
communication and that's not just
communication with other nerdy engineers
you have to be able to communicate well
with the business people so one way to
do that is not only do you have to
understand the technical words across
all the technical contexts you have to
understand the business words in the
business context and it's equally
important if you want to talk with like
the business analyst or the accountants
or the marketing people but it's equally
important and do not neglect it alright
guys those are all the context levels I
have for today of course there's many
many more but just the five that I came
up with five very general ones is going
to be system stuff programming languages
third-party libraries your own code and
then business stuff so those are five
very general ones but of course even but
across those five you can imagine how
the word module could mean very
different things okay so let's just do
some closing thoughts about all these
different things but how can you use
this information right this information
is a little abstract I didn't tell you
what a hundred technical words mean I
just told you guys an idea right but
often what I found personally is that
sometimes when I was confused it's not
it wasn't necessarily that I just didn't
understand what the words meant is just
that I didn't follow the context fast
enough as people were switching this
happened to me a lot when I
younger but when I would overhear people
talking they would be I thought I would
know the words but they would use them
in different ways I was unsure if I
really knew them but I just got lost in
the context and sometimes instead of
asking for what does that word mean you
can actually just ask for clarity on
what's the context of their what they're
talking about so if I got lost I just be
like oh wait a second wait a second are
we talking about the network now and I'm
like no no we're not talking about that
anymore now we're talking about the
computer so even just getting clarity on
the context could help you understand
digest better the other thing the
flipside of that one way to just be able
to communicate better is that when you
get really really comfortable with all
this stuff it could be very natural for
you to switch switch switch context
really quickly and if someone else is
also very sharp they can follow you but
oftentimes you got to talk with people
at various levels so one thing that I
like to do is that even if you're super
advanced just be very very clear when
you're squishing context and namespace
stuff so if you're talking about a
programming language for 30 minutes and
then you move to talk about maybe like
Django framework just make it really
clear you're switching just be like all
right now let's go talk about the
framework a little bit and then once you
specifically make that contact switch
everyone listening knows that okay now
everything's in the Django context but
if you're the one doing the
communicating just make it really really
clear when you're switching alright
everyone those are my thoughts for today
just a little video where we talked
about talking but again the only point I
want to get across is don't try to
follow the words themselves too much
just make sure you're extra clear on
what the context is in how the words are
used but this is all this is all
difficult stuff when you're new this is
really hard but it gets easier more
seamless to move between contexts as you
get more experience but it's difficult
so don't rush it but hope you like the
video please leave me a comment leave me
a like subscribe all that good stuff and
I'll catch you guys
next time all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
