had a great week topic of this week's
video is going to be how to write better
code and this is in the realm of
software engineering remember that
software engineering is slightly in a
different realm than just learning a
pure language one is kind of just
learning the syntax and grammar of the
language and software engineers really
putting it to good use
okay so the first thing that we should
do is just define what makes good
software good is good bad is bad you
usually know it you have a gut feeling
you just see a piece of code you're like
oh that's not good it's usually a little
easier to judge a whole system or whole
project rather than a few lines of code
but still if you see someone right a
couple crappy lines of code you can
still call them out all right but when
we judge good for good we're going to
judge a whole system the definition of a
good project or a good system is more or
less pretty simple it's going to be good
if it's easy to understand and it's easy
to change like two big things the flip
side of that is also really easy for us
to judge bad systems if it's difficult
to understand it's also very complicated
to update and also it's very prone to
break it's probably a bad system or a
bad piece of code not only do we have to
learn how to write really good code and
good systems but another piece of that
puzzle is also getting this kind of
sense this kind of sixth sense to smell
out bad code and what that means this
video is going to focus on where to spot
the bad pieces of your system and I have
three areas to go over so let's just get
started the first thing that we should
all watch out for in our system is this
concept of being overloaded and some of
you may have heard of things like
function overloading but what I'm
talking about here when I say overload
is just a really general concept so
let's just walk through it this usually
manifests itself in like a word this
word means something here but it means
something completely
different there and the same exact word
means something even different in
another place so that's kind of the
concept of overloaded something taking
on a lot of different meanings while
you're designing your software system
and you start to realize that the same
word is starting to have multiple
meanings in different places it's time
to be a little careful there are a
couple really general words that you can
use for anything like a controller or a
lair all these really general concepts
are words that we can just tag on to
anything we have to be really really
careful not to overload them this whole
thing also goes into a deeper context of
naming things well when you're writing
your code and it's really really
important to try to name things as best
you can really when you're programming
you could name anything anything but
usually we'll know when it's a crappy
name so just try to avoid that point
number two to watch out for bad code is
to be really really careful about your
dependencies if possible your dependency
should always be singular Direction
dependencies so what do we mean by this
let's say we have a kitchen class and
the kitchen class is dependent on a
dishwasher class as long as the
dishwasher doesn't also depend on the
kitchen this is a one directional
dependency the kitchen class is just
using the dishwasher but the dishwasher
doesn't really care right anyone could
use it it doesn't have to be a kitchen
so these one directional dependencies
are the easiest to manage in your code
it's impossible to always have singular
Direction dependencies but you should
try to have as many of them as possible
the moment you have dependencies going
in multiple direction things get much
more complicated and potentially much
more convoluted bi-directional
dependencies is when some entity depends
on another entity and this one also
depends on this one so they have to
exist together even though they're
separate the number one reason why some
systems are hard to update this is
actually the number one reason why
systems are hard to update but those
our convoluted dependencies you think
something is actually really easy to
change turns out there's 900
dependencies for that change it's not so
easy to update anymore is it so I said a
lot for that point but major take away a
point number two is to really watch how
you organize your dependencies and
strive for singular Direction
dependencies all right so that was point
number two my third and last point about
watching out for bad code is to always
keep your organization in check my
number one pet peeve or probably maybe
number three out of five in my personal
pet peeves is when I see a file in the
directory that shouldn't be there or I
see a directory structure that actually
makes no sense and represents a
developer being too lazy but when I
think when I see things that aren't
organized very well it's really really
annoying the thing that we always have
to remember about code project or system
organization is that you cannot design
the perfect organization on day one so
I'm not a soothsayer you're not a
fortune-teller none of us are like
clairvoyant in any way so we don't know
the perfect way to organize a project
from the start and once we add features
you know add delete reaaargh attack
things the organization has to be an
iterative thing it has to keep changing
and improving if a file is in the wrong
place or your directory structure isn't
generalized enough you should just fix
it right away when it starts to not make
sense the same basic idea also goes for
coding not only do files and directories
have to be organized but the code also
has to be organized down to the lines so
everything from lines of code to
software architecture to directory
structures to how your project is
packaged everything has to iteratively
improve this organization as you start
changing your project so my last and
final point this third point is to
always keep your organization in check
and you know once you see someone else's
code or project you can immediate
we tell how clear they were thinking or
how much they actually cared if it was
actually an organised project all right
guys that's the end of the video this is
just three things to watch out for when
you're designing your code or you're
working on some of your projects
remember that writing good code is equal
parts knowing good patterns and designs
as well as knowing when things are kind
of going wrong all right so let's just
review all those bad things to watch out
for when you're coding the first thing
was making sure the names and concepts
you use don't become overloaded
everything has a unique and descriptive
meaning all right don't have one thing
mean ten different things second point
was watch your dependencies dependencies
are the easiest way to make your project
difficult to update so always make your
dependencies really clear and singular
direction if you can third and final
point was just organization don't want
to talk about this too much but you'll
know when something is organized or it's
not okay
organization all right guys those are
just three tips I had about writing
better code not just reading better
lines of code but making sure the whole
system and project work well okay no one
cares if you write a few bad lines of
code except maybe you know an asshole
project partner you had in school he'll
probably care if you wrote some shitty
lines of code but as long as the system
works well everyone's going to be super
happy all right hope this was good hope
you all have a great week and I'll see
you everyone next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
