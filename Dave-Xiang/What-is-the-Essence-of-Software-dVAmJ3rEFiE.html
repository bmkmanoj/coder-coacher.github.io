today I'm at the park right now decided
to just answer a question outside for a
change of scenery and I was taking a
walk but I got a pretty interesting
question in my inbox the other day
regarding this is what the question said
it's a little weird but bear with me the
question asks what is the art of
software and obviously I think the
person asking this question didn't
really have a really well-defined thing
he wanted to ask but he had a like a
feeling that he wanted to get across
like what is the art of software or what
is like the essence of software and on
the surface that question sounds super
fluffy right like what does that even
mean sounds like nonsense but if we
think about it a little more I think we
can break it down so that's where I'm
going to that's what I'm going to try to
do in this video and yeah just talk
about so I made a webcast a while ago
about how computer works and I gave this
kind of my own definition of what a
computer really is but my personal
definition of a computer is just a bunch
of software telling a bunch of hardware
what to do and it all has to work
together because remember if you just
have hardware without software the
hardware is like a brick right and if
you just have software and no hardware
to run it on like what what is that just
like lines of lines of code to run on
nothing so both of those things are
almost like a unit they're obviously
extremely separate entities like
hardware software everyone makes a big
deal out of it but they have to coexist
and make anything useful so that's the
first thing so just the refresh everyone
my personal definition of a computer is
a bunch of software telling a bunch of
hardware what to do so if you think
about that a little bit
software pretty much is a convenient way
for humans to just describe the behavior
of a computer right you always hear
those terms like oh computers just
understand ones and zeros and obviously
can we humans can't sit down to write a
shit-ton of ones and zeros all day so we
need some kind of language some kind of
programming language that we can
understand where humans can write and
that has to be somehow translated to the
one-zero that a computer can understand
so what a programming language really is
just a convenient way for us humans to
describe and tell a computer what to do
let's talk about those ones and zeros a
little bit so yo tear the phrase
everyone says it oh yeah computers only
understand ones and zeros you send data
across the network as always ones and
zeroes so what exactly are those ones
and zeros mean so first of all ones and
zeros are just for casual sake it's
binary right binary is a certain way to
represent numbers and it represents a
lot of data and computers only represent
binary at the really really round level
but if you take just the concept of ones
and zeros that in itself is a little bit
abstract right because the concept of 1
and 0 is just binary it just means on or
off in the case of digital computers
digital circuits that on and off means
electrons going through metal or
electrons not going through metal but
that's just one interpretation of ones
and zeros right that's just the computer
interpretation of it you could have an
analog version of ones and zeros so for
example one could be the signal is on or
0 could be the signals off or one could
be my hair's orange and zeros like my
hair is an orange but even the concept
of one 2 zeroes itself is a little bit
of abstract it's a little abstract
because just in computer land ones and
zeros translate to electricity but
that's just with computers you can
actually use ones and zeros to represent
anything right I could use ones and
zeros to be like I'm Chinese or I'm not
Chinese so when you hear that phrase
ones or zeros it's not even specific to
computers it's just a way to represent
information and binary okay so we before
I was getting a little crazy with that
one two zero sync but let's just stick
to the realm of computers so in the
computer realm in the digital realm when
we think of ones and zeros that
translates to you know electrons running
through
metal for the most part when we talk
about computers so when people say old
computers only understand ones and zeros
that's actually correct because special
ones and zeros represent special
instructions that actually are you know
electricity flowing through metal again
but those special instructions will
instruct various parts of the hardware
what to do right you'll have special
ones and zeros that tell the computer
processor to add and you'll have
different ones and zeros to tell the
computer processor to subtract but all
those commands are encoded in ones and
zeros and in our case that's going to be
electricity in metal
so at the Rost level at the Ross level a
computer understands these ones and
zeros a computer understands electricity
this is when the programming language
stuff comes in but imagine you as a
person have to actually physically write
every single one and zero to program and
describe the computer tell the computer
what to do let's say for example you're
writing a program and you wrote 100
million lines of ones and zeros tell the
computer to like write a simple script
run a simple script so imagine if you
had to do that nobody in their right
mind would want to write a hundred lines
of ones and zeros right you need a
better way to do that next take it just
one level up and say you decided to
instead of writing your program and one
to zero to write your program in
assembly write really really basic
instructions add multiply subtract
branch whatever but you write basic
assembly so it actually reads like human
words like add add as a human word so we
can understand that but that assembly
now is digestible by a human we can
write it and that's going to translate
to the ones and zeros so let's just for
example if you wrote 100 million lines
of ones and zeros you're probably the
right close to that number of lines of
assembly so let's say you wrote 100
million lines of assembly to do your
same exact program but it's readable a
human can do it so again let's just take
this one level up nobody in their right
mind right too much assembly some people
do but you don't really want to write
that too much there has to be a better
way of describing behavior on top of
assembly so
let's say we wrote a hundred million
lines of assembly let's say we you see
now you got to see we got a compiler and
we can actually write C code to create
that assembly for us and now we see
we've got nice stuff like for loops
variables while lives whatever but let's
say now we write only ten million lines
of C code so we just came from 100
million lines of assembly if you do it
at C let's say you can do it in 10
million lines and let's say you don't
like C if you just go one level up let's
say you use Python now so maybe in
Python it's even nicer you have like
even better language functionality than
C does and now you can write just 1000
lines of Python to describe the same
exact program so hopefully you guys are
getting the gist the program just in my
ideas but the basic level you just have
ones and zeros nobody in their right
mind is going to do that and that's
going to take the most that is the most
verbose way to describe a computer
behavior right but if you go each level
up you can actually take shortcuts and
describe that behavior better instead of
writing a hundred assembly instructions
you could write a for loop right and
then just take it up and up and up and
up and you have just crazy language
features but all that at the end of the
day translates back down to ones and
zeroes all language is doing for you is
giving you a convenient way to describe
the behavior of a computer more
concisely less verbose
so that that's kind of the essence of
programming languages so I think you
guys get my picture but the emphasis of
programming language is just to describe
behavior we have to program something
and what exactly do we want the program
but we want the program cool hardware
right nothing we do would even be
worthwhile if we didn't have equal
hardware that we could write software
for so that's all the computers that
networks everything and we didn't have
that software almost would be worthless
right let's just take a couple examples
of hardware and why it's so amazing but
just think about saving a file on your
computer right you save a file to your
hard disk and save there without
electricity that's actually under the
scenes that's not even software doing
its job that's actually a very special
special purpose piece of hardware s
to store information even when there's
no electricity attached to it and if you
think about that that's pretty amazing
how could we just store random ones and
zeros how could we store bits of
information with no power
well we humans have designed a way to do
that and that's like an insane piece of
hardware we've got a program that so
what's another insane piece of hardware
think about the internet right the
instrument is an insane network that
connects everyone in this world there's
you know lines in the ocean that create
the instrument that connect the
continents but that itself as a hardware
right there's physical wires and
infrastructure to support the Internet
and you have that hardware you want to
program it somehow let's take another
example the processor we talked about
that enough but the monitor just like a
computer monitor TV monitors another
insane piece of hardware right at the
end of the day it's just the ton of
lights behind the screen that turn on
and off with different colors and tell
us magical things right your computer
screen it's just this crazy piece of
glass and inside the glass they're just
these LEDs or however monitors are
implemented these days but you know it's
a crazy visual hardware device that
we've created and once we have that
hardware it's pretty much useless unless
you have some software to program it
after that
hope everyone has a maybe a bigger
appreciation of hardware - there's
definitely a ton of hardware out there
and then obviously we have the software
to go on top of that and tell the
hardware to do special things you want
your monitor to show you you know your
favorite flappy bird game or something
but these things always go hand-in-hand
so the essence of programming like the
essence of programming programming
languages software all that all that
stuff is just for you for us humans to
be able to tell a computer what to do
and why would we want to even tell a
computer why do we want to tell hardware
what to do see use hardware is crazy
we've created insane hardware you
created crazy computer monitors we've
created crazy storage devices we created
creating networks all this physical
Hardware stuff it would be a shame if we
didn't have a way to program it alright
guys I'm going to check that other park
is getting pretty late but that's my
rant for today
hopefully makes sense really unscripted
but I'm just kind of bullshitting with
you I just want everyone to just get a
sense of what these two things really
mean why they have to coexist
why they're so important and why you
know technology is so cool but hope you
enjoy the video and I'll catch you next
time all right take it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
