having a good week and happy holidays
back home and sorry this is just on my
camera at my parents house just making a
quick video and hoping everyone's having
a nice Christmas treat for everyone this
week is that I interviewed my mom for 13
12 13 minutes my mom is actually a
computer science major as well she still
does programming still does coatings
been doing it for like 30 plus years and
I just forced her to answer some
questions and hopefully you enjoy it
alright see you in 2017 and Happy New
Year okay what was your first course in
programming it was a sample a language
what what assembly you remember I don't
remember sorry that was a 35 36 years
ago it's a way to remember where'd you
go to school I went to school in
Shanghai China for programming for
computer science major it was what was
your first computer science class do you
remember I don't remember it so
something basic and stuff smash discrete
math data structure basically always
dangles to the assembly language is high
language you like a floor trend was my
first high level language Fortran was
your first high level language yeah on
that time you don't have keyboard we
have our tape we punched the hole so how
did you punch holes use a tool instead
of a it's a little tool you can punch
the holes there we we had a computer
somehow it generates a big paint is very
since being paid
so if you have to read it if you
debugger you to cut off the tape and put
on a print statement then feed the table
to the Machine then run it was very very
early stage so you have a computer you
have a long piece of tape
you're not the people are it's like a
movie tape it's so you roll over Daniel
what did you what did you use to punch
all the holes in it it's like uh some
tools it has a hole the tools it can
punch it three four five but I bet the
Machine reads it but how do you know
that punching three holes means adding
something it's a ASCII code or something
that's old a very you know basic allure
level computer things
so you started programming by punching
holes on tape yeah how many people can
use a computer at the same time just one
right yeah just watch that's a bigger
machine you have to scan your time so
when you have your time you probably
have 30 minutes
you get everything ready so when your
time just go there just a three-year
tape in run it then it prints out some
things there you bring the result back
to how many times could you run yeah how
many times can you run one program in 30
minutes you can't run a field depends on
what's your debug it's a program
successful you're done if you have a
problem you probably have to make a tape
by adding some printed space that's the
only way to debug you just I don't think
to the tapes
yeah there's no debug at that time so
when and afterwards all you can do it it
bug you can stop you can bring are you
break you can print out the variables it
was like a revolution to us it's a much
efficiency okay so what is your first
programming language on a real computer
real computer Pro it's after work with a
keyboard with the keyboardist it was C
languages I came today you
so I learned a C in my graduate school
here in Boston this is hard
C is not very hard it's a little bit
different than program language I was
fortunate it was a fortune was mainly
used for the math C is more widely used
so our main lace C has that you know
data structure involved I don't think a
fortune has it if I remember correctly
then she has a Maroc the pretty hard at
that time you have to remember to
allocating memories and the freedom up
after you use it yes that's that's
pretty much the C I learned here that's
that's that afterwards you know after
work so after work then pick it off the
job C++
so you didn't you see it the job your
first job right I used to see in the
first job but I never learned C++ in
school so learn C practice process the
during the work although we learn
software engineering
masterda by then you know it has a
concept for object-oriented programming
master the data in caption data hiding
but you learn C++ virtual function is
mainly at work you learn all that our
work after school classes yeah and also
we invited as some people come to come
to the companies that have like a weekly
trainings you learn the C++
okay so you see at school C++ at work
yeah pretty much
how long did you use C++ for oh good a
month for five years before switch to
Java C++ the Java man see first dance
press + dance watch - Java
okay what version of Java did you start
with like - yeah yeah yeah bot - I think
so job was pretty new at this time yeah
yeah it's a duck Wow
so easy you don't have to worry about
memories garbage collection yeah it has
a bus still running some you know memory
issues may be its own somehow you know
garbage collection is not correct
oh we didn't properly define the
destructors dereferenced um they still
have reference so those memories it's
not being freed I don't know the later
on it's like it's more more Java fancy
things yeah so what how did you Deepak
stuff when it's a problem with Java not
a problem with your code like what if
their garbage collection it's not really
even working and you didn't do anything
wrong does that happen
did that happen yeah that happens
something you own then it's I don't know
how to debug it just we just review our
code to make sure we do everything then
you can reference - oh you can go to you
know some website you see oh the Java
version people already submitted yeah
problems and the similar issues people
are already facing so there's some
working around
are you updating your Java versions okay
so what how many years did you do Java a
lot how do I start a Java - yeah up to
five fussing Java five
yeah I think it's at nine now I know
afterwards I switch to a tester relay
that automation works
I don't really using Java ma off using a
script - relatedly
what is flash scripting Python what
scripting / Lisa T she'll actually show
yeah and you know it's yeah so that was
the teacher it's a very basic you know
you
some languages marshals teachers most
that then move to Python a little bit
pearl you good amount pearl then you
know Python is just for for hacker for
curiosities which I learned there it is
basically just google it you know what
do you want to do just don't just want
to find out that the syntax and also you
try to find out what's new what's the
what I provides you in the language
itself so you don't have to really
remember all the same tax so program is
easy now right yeah yeah yes yes or no
but right now we subscribe computer it's
a totally different ways you know
programming see you you're facing the
different problem problems when it was
all times every single process you don't
have to worry about a process to process
relationships and also you debugger
there's a log files on the one machine
you don't have to go cry go with all the
machines to collect your love taters
it's a different way no it's a totally
different way just to do is software
engineering to facing the problem in the
solving basic how much do you still code
everyday these days not because I'm
changing from developed to to testing a
lot of time I'm thinking about how to
break the software what is the
conditions are software might be break
so a lot of time I think in that
scenarios in stuff coatings so once the
testing is the more mature I'm just
thinking how is in my lives can some
repetitive master the testing I can
automate it so it's a safe my time
and also 34 aggression of four patch
released then we can just run the script
so we will understand that patch is a
stable didn't break anything else so in
that sense I don't really for time on
the scripting more of the overall under
standard systems yeah testing very good
very good
what-what-what-what any advice you like
to share for people that are learning
how to program or code young you have to
understand very basic a concept to start
always something when you just learn you
think oh that's easy I can get it for
later on everything is related until you
understand solid basics then you can
really keep moving you know starting the
foundations to know details to use all
the basic stuff of the programming
language itself and also I think as a
software engineer the attitude has very
important not only you have a foundation
of skills but also the way as a software
software have be very accuracy the
attitude as a program as a testing you
have to be really think about thinking
through it then you can generate a
quality of the work that is also very
important the work between the members
define the interface between each
other's between the the functional
groups is very important as well so
until the interfaces that defined it
really benefits our groups okay very
good
so I'm you know it's a very line in the
software engineering but still enjoy the
new technology I'm pretty sure
generations well they're much more they
think much more broader they have much
more trainings than 35 years ago I had
trainings but you know I as engineers
you'll never learn you never stop you
always learn some things as far as you
are attitude that's good
you all you always can learn and be
productive and so I'm like am i what I'm
doing
still all right very good okay any last
words I you know I don't know just do
what you like learn learn the things
with good attitude and have fun with
your work okay very good
thank you mom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
