had a really productive and good week
today's video we're gonna talk and go
back to software developer life I think
this is episode seven out of 1000 that I
wrote anyways in this video we're gonna
talk about a handful of really good
habits all in my opinion really good
habits of any software developer and
we're just gonna run through them and
let's just start alright let's do it
first helpful habit and I think this one
might be the easiest and almost a
no-brainer but I just want to put it in
the list is pulled the latest code very
often as often as you can usually when
you're working you're gonna be
developing on your branch or your
feature and other people are gonna be
developing in parallel with you a really
really good habit while we're doing
parallel development you the rest of
your team your co-workers we have to
periodically keep up the date or in sync
with the rest of the team which means
pulling in the latest changes every day
or multiple times a day not only do you
pull in the most recent changes but keep
up to date with other people's pull
requests check out what other people are
doing this kind of depends on how big
your project is when the project is
pretty small you can probably get a good
idea of what everyone's doing but
obviously if the project is really big
there's a ton of developers you can't
keep up to date with everything but just
try your best
so sync the code figure out what
everyone else is doing and you're gonna
be in much better shape alright second
really good habit of any software
developer is to always be as consistent
as possible and what do we mean by
consistent consistency is probably one
of the number one if not the most
important trait and any software
engineer or any good worker but it's
just a matter of keeping the expectation
level equal to what you deliver and
always doing that all the time so if you
set a very high expectation for yourself
make sure you deliver close or if not
equal to that expectation you don't want
to over undershoot it because that's
just kind of
looks a little bad and it gives off the
impression that you can't give the right
expectations on what you're gonna work
on once we get into a good habit of
creating that expectation and delivering
on that level we just have to make it
consistent and do that week after week
month after month etc etc and trust me
if you can do that and be really
consistent about it it's really really
good all right I was point number two
third point is going to be a software
developer courtesy point but you have to
always notify people when you make
changes that affect what they're working
on if you push up a brand new code which
actually might break the system or
require extra dependencies for another
developer it's your responsibility to
notify everyone you don't want to just
make the change on your own and it kind
of breaks other people's flow so just
notifying other people or just making
sure everyone's aware of how you're
changing things how your changes affect
the system and she's gonna make people
really really appreciate you a lot
better
no one likes random changes happening
behind the scenes so they don't really
know about it this is just really common
courtesy and that's point number three
all right notify anyone if your changes
affect them alright my fourth point is
to make sure when you merge your code or
you merge your features don't make it
too big many times I see developers who
just go into a cave and like work on
their features for like a month or
multiple weeks and when they're done
they just create this huge code review
which is like thousands and thousands of
lines of code and you really it's really
tough to make sense of such a big change
when your merges are way too big or
consist of way too many changes it
actually just reflects on pure laziness
on your part because you didn't take the
time to really break down your task set
like mini milestones and submit the code
cleanly you just kind of like plopped
thousands of lines of code into the
branch and no one appreciates this when
things get way too big just start
breaking down the task logically and
doing code reviews and merges
based on those logical units like I need
to fix a first after I do that I'll
handle B and C after that's done I'll do
my last review which will be Part D just
break it apart and make it easier for
other people to review what you've done
huge huge huge code reviews or mergers
are always bad and when I see something
that's well everyone's guilty of this
I'm guilty of it I'm sure all of you
have been guilty of it but it's really
impossible to review like thousands of
lines of code changes it's just too much
for one person to look at and digest in
a reasonable fashion all right so that's
point number four make sure your merges
aren't too big my fifth and last good
habit of any software developer is
another common courtesy habit and this
is if you're gonna make changes
substantial changes to someone else's
code that you didn't originally write
please let them know I'm not talking
about a little fixing or typos in the
comment or renaming a variable this is
if you didn't authored the code but
you're thinking of making substantial
changes to some piece of code some
library or some class make sure you let
the other person know that you're gonna
do this it's just common courtesy this
doesn't apply if someone has already
left the company if the original author
has left that code and isn't even at the
organization anymore then obviously you
can go ahead and change it but more
often than not there's going to be a lot
of code throughout the organization and
everyone's touching a lot of different
parts that are authored by different
people the reason why this is a good
common courtesy is if you make a change
to someone else's code without really
letting them know a good reason or why
you're making a change to their code
it's kind of a little personal in their
part kind of like oh yeah this guy my
code wasn't really good enough or this
guy thought my code was shitty so he
went ahead and fixed it that's probably
the default conclusion that many
developers go to when other people
change their code so it's just a really
good habit to let the other person know
when you're gonna change something
there's definitely a good reason for
either change this piece of code you're
not making it worse well I hope you're
not making it worse but if there's a
good reason for you to make the change
just communicate it to the original
author and it's gonna be a really happy
world all right
that's point number five all right guys
that was the end of this video pretty
quick and easy and hopefully straight to
the point video I just wanted to give
five really good habits for any software
developer these might be a no-brainer
but it's good to just be cognizant to
them all the time so you don't kind of
slip up and make a 4,000 line code
review all right don't do that I hope
these habits are helpful hopefully you
can apply them to wherever you're at
maybe even in academics or if you're
working if you follow these five things
obviously this is just my opinion and
not a Bible or anything but I do think
these handful of things are helpful so I
hope you enjoyed it all right please
give me a like share this video leave me
a comment if you have any questions and
I'll see everyone next week all right
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
