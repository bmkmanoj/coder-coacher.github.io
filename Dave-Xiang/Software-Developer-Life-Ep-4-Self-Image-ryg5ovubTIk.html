software developer life episode 4 and in
this video I just want to give three
small bits of advice that I think could
be helpful all right so these three
pieces of advice all kind of contribute
to how we're perceived as engineers so I
think it's kind of relevant to both
startups big companies even academic
life
remember that 24/7 365 days a year we're
always being judged by people around us
and what exactly do they form their
opinions around well it's exactly what
comes out of our mouth and what we type
on the keyboard so how exactly should we
be perceived as engineers well there's a
huge list of stuff right we should be
smart intelligent well-organized
clear-headed write code well write
documents well there's a huge list of
things that we need to do and that's up
to us in our own image to make sure
people think of us that way ok so I have
three points related to this theme and
let's just start with number one all
right
the first point is pretty simple and
it's just do not talk too much about
yourself you want to be a listener more
than you want to be talker learn about
people asking cyfle questions and really
only talk about yourself when you're
really prompted to in a perfect
conversation maybe you and another
person will have fifty-fifty about how
much you each talk about yourselves but
if we had to choose you should always
choose being more of a listener and more
of a talker why is this helpful well if
you listen more it automatically makes
you more likeable I promise it also
trains you to ask good questions and
remember I always say this but asking
questions is really like the lifeblood
of an engineer and when you start
listening to people more and figuring
out where they come from you start kind
of training yourself to ask more
insightful questions and get to know
them a little better so that's point
number one it's really easy just err on
the side of listening
ask good questions and don't talk about
yourself too much the second point
revolves around how we write emails as
engineers or how we write any kind of
digital message emails reflect how we
think so they should be clear and to the
point right because we're engineers or
we're just clear-headed people everyone
emails need a relevant subject line and
they must be very direct and
to-the-point
be very clear about who you're
addressing make sure you give them just
enough but not too much context and also
be very clear of what you're asking
always read your emails twice kill all
the fluffy words make sure it's proof
read you know write your emails like you
write your code short and sweet and to
the point
another thing that used to really tick
me off that I want to bring up or
relating this point is when we direct
message each other over chat people used
to always message me saying hi Dave they
would message saying hi Dave with zero
context and expect me to respond I just
this is really annoying when you message
someone do not just leave them at a
greeting you have to greet them and also
ask them directly what you're looking
for let's just go over a quick example
you could either say hi Bob and then
leave it at that or you could say hi Bob
I was just working with the new logging
system and I knew you had developed the
most recent Python client for our
logging system and it's not really
working do you think we could debug it
together when you send a message like
that you give Bob immediate context over
what you need and he'll have almost all
the information he needs maybe almost
all of it to give you a great answer
right up front and it just saves him and
you a lot of time remember that besides
everything that comes out of our mouth
every time we hit the keyboard every
time we produce any type of digital text
it also contributes that people's image
about us and I don't have to go through
the laundry list that things that
engineers need to be perceived us but
remember everything contributes to it
okay third and last point about this
revolves around meeting
and when you should talk at meetings for
anyone in the workplace not only
engineering but if you could name one
place where people will form some
opinions or judge you it's probably at
one of these meetings one cool thing
that you can do at a meeting is not talk
right away but just wait and try to
gather everyone's sentiment around the
room oh so that manager over there he's
super stressed out because the deadline
is slipping oh that engineer over there
is he's he's falling asleep
that other engineer over there he's
really mad because we didn't use his
style of coding and oh yeah there's a VP
over there who's super impatient and
just wants the big picture ideas
obviously you don't say these things out
loud or somebody would probably smack
you all you have to do is just think
quietly to yourself and get people
sentiment around the room what are they
thinking or what do you think they're
thinking once you kind of realize what
other people are worried about around
the room you have a lot more leverage
with providing value because you know
exactly what you could do to give them
immediate value if you speak right away
you can't gather everyone's thoughts
around the room that's why speaking
right away is really tough if you just
wait a little bit take a step back
gather your thoughts and gather the
sentiment around the room you'll be much
more effective in any meeting all right
guys so those are just three quick
points about how to really present
yourself as an engineer to help how
you're getting perceived we went over
how you can really talk remember be more
of a listener and more of a talker
second you know it's how you write
digital things make sure your emails and
messages are always to the point and
third is just remember speak well and
meetings and gather the sentiment of
everyone in the room before you talk
hopefully this video is helpful remember
you can't always control how people are
going to see you but you can always do
your best by paying attention to details
but in the end some people are gonna
think you're really cool some people are
gonna think your dish bag and there's
nothing you can do
do about it alright so hope this was
helpful a little bit fun and I will see
you guys next time alright drop me a
comment or like and as always take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
