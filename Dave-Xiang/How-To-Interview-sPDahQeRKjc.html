had a great week as usual changing the
frame a little bit of this video stuff a
little more room and I read that
everything should come in third so one
third here one third one third and
something like this the video for this
week is gonna be all about interviewing
and I've just been thinking about it a
lot because I've been doing it myself
the past couple of months and I it's
just been on my mind so I wanted to make
a video about it this whole thing is
really a difficult process it's
difficult for employers it's difficult
for candidates there's a lot of people
trying to solve the problem of
interviewing but actually it's a really
tough problem to solve because it's an
Abbott score it's a very social dynamic
psychological type of thing which makes
it really hard so I'm sure 99% of you
you will interview someone in your
lifetime you will be interviewed many
times your lifetime in this video I'm
just gonna give five tips my opinion on
five things that I think will make you
interview to the best of your ability
and it's a little bit catered towards
software of course and without further
ado let's do it alright let's get
straight into it first point that I want
to make is knowing exactly what you're
being measured on what are you being
measured on but everything all the
different types of things you could be
measured on just boils down to two main
things the first one being competency
and the second one being personality for
whatever position you're applying to
there's a big spectrum of things from
very entry-level positions this super
super senior level positions but there's
always like a competency level that you
have to be at just to be eligible for
that position so that's the most basic
thing that you're measured on can you
write code can you talk about the things
that you wrote down on your resume can
you solve a problem you know all those
kind of basic competency levels are
probably measured very quickly in the
interview process the one thing I want
to say about measuring someone's
competency level is always always always
be on the lookout it's not just measured
via the coding problem or that technical
quiz it's every single discussion you
might have with your employer
she measures the competency so what I
kind of like doing is I kind of just
maybe when I first speak with a
candidate on the phone just a
little bit talk about their projects see
how well they can speak to their
projects and if I can tell when someone
can speak really well about something
they can work they've been working on
and that actually reflects a high level
of competency or whatever competency I'm
expecting
besides speaking well obviously another
measure of this thing is just putting
pencil to paper and asking them to code
they have to translate all the thoughts
up here into some kind of code to be
useful right all right so back to the
main point what are we being measured on
but after a competency is kind of
checked off like okay this person is
competent enough the next thing to
measure is the personality which is what
the rest of this video is more about and
so many things bucket into this
personality thing but that's the next
major thing that you're gonna be
measured on after you've proven you're
competent enough would this person fit
in is this person a good culture fit
it's this person not an asshole do I
actually like this person could I work
with him or her so that's kind of the
topic for the rest of the points and
let's just go on to point number two
point number two that I want to talk
about is body language and this is super
important when you go meet the employer
for the first time but body language is
a really subtle thing that you might
overlook but it makes such a big
difference do you know all the times you
kind of thought that oh that was a
little bit of a weird conversation or
that interaction was a little off
usually when you think something was a
little off it's almost always very
likely to be a weird kind of body
language and you can't really describe
it well but you just have a feeling and
that feeling can actually be
deal-breaker
sometimes for an employer first thing
you could do is make sure you
when the interviewer stands up when
someone comes in to meet you you
shouldn't just stay in your chair right
stand up greet them halfway in the room
and just you know be like you want to
meet them
so just one quick story but one quick
story I was like third out of five
people interviewing someone and I walked
into the room to meet this person for
the first time he actually stood up but
we didn't meet halfway he just stood
there and I kind of walked across a
hundred percent of the room I walked
across the room and just shook his hand
right it would have felt much better if
we kind of just walked towards each
other and be like hi nice to meet you
but he just kind of stood up and I was
like oh okay let me just make my way all
the way over there make sure you face
the person just be attentive all these
little details in your body language
count if you want to learn more about
this just YouTube about just like
standard body language like facing the
person you're talking with just it's
really easy stuff and it makes a big
difference all right so that's point
number two third point I want to make is
that if you're doing a technical
interview be sure to talk out loud
especially if you're coding when you're
coding or whiteboarding or maybe sharing
a document with the interviewer and just
writing down any code it's not very good
to be too silent for too long if you
need a moment of silence just to think
just preempt that silence so it's not so
random just be like okay let me just
digest this problem I need one minute
just to think about it real quick so
just say that first and then start
becoming silent and think about it but
even if you preempt it like that don't
try to be silent for too long anything
you're thinking about like I'd really
mean anything you're thinking about for
these technical interviews unless it's
like cats and read it but anything
you're thinking about just get it down
on paper so you and the interviewer can
really be synched up because they just
want to know what you're thinking about
and your thought process so you don't
want it to have it all up here you
wanted to get it from here out into the
open
also when you're writing all this stuff
try your best to make it as organized as
possible a lot of people do like to
write things down but it's all over the
place
scribbles everywhere like some code here
some notes there some you know random
notes here so you can just practice you
can
just practices pretty easily like take a
coding problem and write down your
things as organized as you possibly can
because remember like what does writing
something in an organized fashion
represent it just represents organized
thought process right so that's point
number three don't think too much in
your head get your thoughts out point
number four is so easy this part is so
easy it's just follow-up messages and
this will take ten minutes your time and
it goes a very long way
just send follow-up messages it's nice
it's good practice it really there's a
good impression for the employer and
literally I can kind of tell from my own
statistics of interviewing people that I
would say like twenty percent or less
actually send follow-up messages and it
does make a difference
all right fifth fifth and last point I'm
gonna make in this whole video is asking
good questions asking good questions is
really really important because it
actually shows you're interested in the
position or the company without just
saying you're interested in the position
or company right it's one thing just to
say it it's another thing to show it
it's kind of like if you're trying to
get the girl right you can't just say
I'm a really funny guy they'll probably
just give you a that guy's sucks right
you have to actually show you're funny
or do something fun you can't just say
it it's like almost the same thing for
the job process to you when you're
interviewing don't just be like I'm
really interested in this position you
have to like show that a little deeper
via questions so again good questions
are a good way to show you're interested
without staying you're interested I'm
just going to give you a set of good
questions that I brainstormed over and
if you use these I think they're just
gonna work well how will you measure
success in this role what this assess
looked like for this role another one
could be how is the company and the
technology going to grow in the next
year over the next three years how would
I be able to provide the most value for
the company what is your typical day
look like what do you do let's let's see
what are some of the most challenging
things with the current software that's
being built major theme with all those
questions that we just talked about is
that all it does is read
your interest in the company and that's
exactly what the company wants to know
right it's almost counterintuitive it's
not really the company gets so
interested in you many times it's the
more you're interested in that company
the more the company actually becomes
interested in you because you stand out
you'd be surprised about how much you
can control in this whole process just
by being interested in like just
interviewing well but it's definitely a
skill to be learned not everyone is just
good at it upfront I know like if you
have the luxury of having some kind of
Career Center or something at your
school to help you interview prep I
would highly just recommend you do a
little mock interviews or just prep
because it's not just a job thing it's
like a people thing how you interact and
present yourself in a really good way so
I don't think of it as purely just this
professional thing and f-that just think
of it more as like this is a really good
life skill to have and I should work on
it all right all right guys that's all I
have for today hope this new spacing is
cool it's actually fun because I can
move around but I'll see everyone next
week all right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
