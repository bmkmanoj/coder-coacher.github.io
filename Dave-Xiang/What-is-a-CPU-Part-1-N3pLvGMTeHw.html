out a little bit more and talk about
computer processors if you haven't
watched my other video about Graham I
think it's good to watch before you
watch this one that you can just click
this link right here and check it out so
what do most people know about your
processors hey hey hey
yo check out this new complete processor
a gun man it's like 10 cores and it's
like 40 gigahertz each core no way dude
that's so fast man you're so lucky
alright if you guys are a little curious
about how these mysterious processors
work you should continue watching this
video all the concepts are relatively
simple intuitive and easy to understand
and I'm going to explain it to you in
less than five minutes so the first
thing that you have to understand is
what an instruction set architecture is
and I know this sounds really
complicated it has the term architecture
name what the hell let's break it down
an instruction set architecture is a
well-defined list of instructions that
the computer processor must understand
that was a mouthful let's take an
example my name is chef Dave I'm a
particular set of skills skills that
I've acquired over very long career
skills that make me a nightmare for
fruits and vegetables a chef is just
like a computer processor pretend I'm a
chef I'm responsible for a particular
set of kitchen and cooking skills if we
made a list of all the cooking and
kitchen skills cutting chopping stir
frying sauteing and we compiled a huge
list of all those skills that would be
called a chef instruction set
architecture we can just call it iron
chef's instruction the iron chef's
architecture which includes things like
cutting and chopping a computer
instruction set architecture might
include instructions like adding or
multiplying or computer type things but
you don't have to worry about those you
know I'm a respectable chef I'm able to
do every
that song the Iron Chef construction
setlist I can do all those things no
problem
I found a chef and there's a million
instructions that I have to be able to
do if I can't just do one of those
instructions I'm useless pretend if I
can't do cunning I'm a worthless chef
computer processor has to be able to
execute every single instruction in any
particular instruction set
if you tell a computer processor to do
1+1 it says 7 then it's probably less
useful than a break ok so hopefully
you're getting the gist of what an
instruction set architecture is just
think about chefs
sometimes in nerve lingo we abbreviate
it as is a so if you want to sound
smarter you can say I know what a is a
is actually you should never say I say
forget I said that
in your desktop computer and a whole ton
of desktop computing for the past
decades they followed this instruction
set architecture called
x86 in a lot of mobile devices like your
smart phones they have special
processors which implement an
instruction set called arm if you run
into those terms you'll know what they
mean all right let's talk about
processors a little bit not instruction
sets so this is a really important point
multiple processors can implement the
same instruction set so instruction says
don't change as often as processors do
you know back in the day when Intel came
out with pentium 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
all those pen cams were actually
implementing the same instruction set so
as I told you before I'm a respectable
chef and I can do all the instructions
in the iron chef's instruction set but
I'm not the only one that can do them if
we go to the Food Network and call on
iron chef morimoto key to you can do all
the instructions and the iron chef's
instruction set he can do everything
much better and much faster than I can
not all chefs are created equal not all
processors are created equal the reason
why there's so many processors that are
released every year is that each one
help performs its predecessors they did
the same instructions but the newer ones
just do them better ok so what exactly
is a computer
you can think of a computer program as a
complicated chef's recipe if you're
trying to make a fancy Italian entree
you can break down that recipe into a
very specific set of instructions that
might all be a part of that iron chef's
instruction set so any person like me or
iron chef morimoto that can execute the
iron chef instructor set would be able
to make that Italian entree given the
recipe all a computer program is there's
a huge list of instructions that are
part of a computer's instruction set
architecture that the processor can
understand all right so you buy a new
processor and like two gigahertz what
the hell is he here hurts hurts is how
we measure the speed of a processor
Hertz is also a measure of frequency
frequency is exactly what you think it
is it's how often something happens in a
particular amount of time that's it the
one Hertz is one cycle per second and
one gigahertz is a billion cycles per
second as we said before not all
processors are created equal processor a
might take ten cycles to execute one
instruction but another processor can do
the same instruction in only three
cycles so which one's better but still a
slower processor but it perhaps could be
more efficient with its cyclos could
potentially outperform a faster
processor which is really fast like 10
gigahertz but it's super inefficient
with his instructions all right guys so
that was some basic processor concepts
thanks for your time I hope you enjoyed
the video and you learn something
remember never say I am real-life or
else you will be a douchebag okay so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
