we're gonna do part two of the iPhone
series and we're going to talk through
the core hardware this video is gonna be
straight-up pretty technical and as I'm
writing the script I already know is
going to be a little longer if you're a
little rusty on processors I would
recommend watching some of my processor
videos again and just coming back I'm
gonna do my best to blow your mind and
we're gonna go over some pretty
complicated stuff from a 10,000 foot
view let's do it this is an integrated
circuit what is it integrated circuit
these are the little black squares that
come up in your mind when people say
Hardware little black squares everywhere
inside every single one of those little
black squares is millions of transistors
intricately laid up doing really smart
things integrated circuits come in all
shapes all sizes and they functionally
do really different things it could be a
little timer it could be just plain old
memory or it could be a fully fledged
processor inside this little black box
all the transistors are laid out and
electricity is flowing through metal in
different ways to do really cool things
really smart hardware engineers design
these things and combining various
integrated circuits together lets you do
even cooler things alright enough of
that we're leveling up this is an SOC or
system-on-chip SOC is a really fancy
name but all it is is a beefed-up
integrated circuit
the picture I have right here is just a
diagram of a really common SOC looking
at the real thing wouldn't really make
any sense if you want to look at what
million transistors and make sense of it
don't look at the individual parts yet
just take it in and we're gonna talk
about it what exactly is an SOC it's
actually pretty simple an SOC is just a
combination of various different
components that might have existed on
different integrated circuits all inside
the same chip
they're pretty complicated but they're
kind of just like the integrative
circuits big brother
inside each SOC there are a ton of
things there could be multi-core
application processors there could be
multi-core graphics processors there
could be different cache memories and
there could be digital signal processors
all in the same chip everything comes
together and it makes a system or SOC
system on chip for the rest of the video
I'm going to be saying the word SOC a
lot so just remembering all right the
iPhone and probably every single
smartphone that you might be using has
multiple my Sosa's okay just look back
at this picture right now and just take
it in it's a really general picture what
you see here are potentially different
components that might exist inside an
SOC in the middle at the top you see the
main ARM processor
remember arm arm as an instruction set
so when I say ARM processor this is just
a very general ARM processor that's
implementing that instruction set take a
look on the right side of the ship you
see a lot of special hardware that
interfaces with memory you can't really
fit two gigs of memory inside this ship
that's why they have special hardware
components or memory controllers which
talk with external memory they're way
too many things to cover inside this one
SOC but it's almost like a mini computer
and is the size of your thumb from the
outside it's also just a little black
square it's just a little bigger this is
what an SLC looks like in real life rule
of thumb the bigger the black square and
more transistors okay done with that and
let's level up this right here is a
logic board I'm going to be picking the
iPhone 5s in this video because it was a
really groundbreaking phone in terms of
hardware and this is actually the logic
board that you'll find inside the 5s
check out this picture right now this is
literally the hardware backbone of the
5s the first thing I want you guys to
check out is that Big Red Square that
Red Square is Apple's SOC called the a7
and it was a legendary system-on-chip
this SOC contains a lot of cool stuff
dual core processors to run your iOS and
also I think quad core GPUs to run all
your games this 8/7 or SOC is a full
system remember that red box so why
exactly was the a7 a big deal the a7 was
pretty groundbreaking because it was the
first SOC to contain an application
processor that was 64-bit this is pretty
much what had all Android people
sweating actually anybody that wasn't
Apple was sweating this was the first
mobile applications processors that
implement
a 64-bit instruction set specifically
the application processor inside the a7
implements in a structure set called
armed v8 for a really long time up into
this point almost all mobile processors
were implementing arm v7 which was a
32-bit instruction set
so when Apple came out with this a7 it
was just a really big step forward for
Hardware and Apple and the whole mobile
industry if you're a little fuzzy on
what arm is arm is a British company
which is best known for defining the arm
instruction set
so just google that later if you have
any more questions
ok so let's zoom in a little bit this is
the floor plan of the a7 this is what it
actually looks like you can see that
there are a lot of people in the world
that dissect these chips to really
figure out what's going on you can see
in this picture whoever created it they
dissected the a7 and they figured out
where the GPUs are where the cache
memory is how many processors there are
actually only Apple would really know
where everything is inside this thing
the a7 is rendering iOS and all those
GPUs inside are letting you play all
those games when you're taking your
number to a is for application powerful
shit ok let's zoom out again and go back
to the logic board we're outside the a7
now you notice that there are other
boxes right the a7 isn't the only SOC
inside the 5s check out the orange box
real quick that's actually a Qualcomm
modem that's given the 5s it's out
as I said before in part one there are a
lot of different parts inside the 5s not
coming from Apple that orange squared is
a qualcomm modem and Apple bought that
from Qualcomm to stick it inside their
phones to give you really fast internet
the modem is what gives you the signal
bars we're not going to zoom into the
modem it's really complicated trust me
and I'll just make us cry there's only a
few things boxed here but let me assure
you that on this logic board there are a
ton of different SOC end different
integrated circuits it's impossible to
go through all of them another SOC that
I want to mention this video is called
the m7 the N in m7 stands for motion
it's another full SOC and it lives on
the logic board inside the iPhone I
actually don't think it's the yellow
square I think it's actually somewhere
else but yellow squares some some other
thing the m7 does exactly what you think
it does
it has compasses gyroscopes
accelerometers and tons of sensor things
it gathers a lot of data from you and
it's that thing that powers a lot of the
fitness applications on your iPhone you
ever wonder what hardware is tracking
how many steps you take when you walk
throughout the day is the m7 here's an
apple guy presenting the m7 at one of
their presentations it's just a little
black square city on the logic board
washing your every move okay a lot of
information just happened so it's time
to recap a little bit
we started with integrated circuits
where share various simple circuits
doing very particular things coming in
all shapes and sizes if you combine a
lot of components together you get a SOC
or system-on-chip many smartphones have
multiple as
these apples signature SOC for the 5s
was the a7 and it's already old news all
the different SOC Slyke the a7 the m7
live on a logic board
that's right inside your phone and
remember beside the SOC s and the modems
on the logic board there's a ton of
stuff happening that I didn't cover you
have a lot of other stuff going on
inside the phone like a screen the touch
sensor the camera lens but this isn't
the real hardware those are kind of like
the peripherals and it's not the real
real hardware this logic board that we
just reviewed where all the SOC s are
sitting on that's the real hardware you
can see how a lot of different companies
contribute their products to make this
phone happen Apple does a lot of it but
not all of it so this is the hardware
inside an iPhone 5s crazy-crazy is it is
it crazy if you're a software guy always
respect the hardware engineers or else
your software would run on nothing if
you're a hardware guy respect the
software guys because without that
software running on it the phone would
be literally less useful than a brick
hardware and software each have a lot of
different levels within them there are
so so so many different levels and parts
of an engineering stack and they all
need each other whatever level you might
be working on whether you're a hardware
engineer or a software engineer you have
to pay respect the people working below
you and above you everyone's work
combined this huge stack of hardware and
software is what enables us to have
these crazy phones inside our pocket
alright guys coming to the end of the
video here and we packed a lot of
knowledge into this video this was the
10,000 foot view of hardware basics
inside an iPhone 5s and it's really
relevant to any other smartphone I hope
you learned something I think next time
we're gonna start diving into software
or maybe a little more hardware I'm not
sure yet if you liked this video or
learn something please like or share it
if you have any questions at all or need
further clarification just drop me a
comment and I'll respond thanks again
for watching and I will see you next
time alright take it easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
