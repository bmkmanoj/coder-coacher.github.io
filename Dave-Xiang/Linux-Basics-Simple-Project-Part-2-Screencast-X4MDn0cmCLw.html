this video no introduction because I
assume your hopefully watching part one
or else none of this is gonna make any
sense
alright so other directory that's really
common inside any project is a
third-party directory and this could be
named or organised in various ways but
the whole point of this directory is to
hold third-party code aka any code
that's not your own that's helping you
so if all your cut all the code you
write is going to be in source right but
obviously you're not coding everything
from scratch there's no point in
reinventing the wheel we all know that
so always always always
there's third-party libraries to help
you so there could be some nice helper
library that you're pulling into the
project to help you which comes with a
set of libraries and includes so what
exactly is includes and this will be an
introduction to what this means so the
library is pretty self-explanatory it's
going to be like some helper library or
helper libraries will come inside here
and you're gonna also have a header in a
header file for this library which would
look like this and let's just talk a
little bit about why you can't really
just have this you really need a header
file and usually when you pull it
third-party libraries the hub at least
some libraries and a few if not many
header files alright let's just go back
to terminal real quick
so I'm inside the library file if you
guys can see this check out the left now
these are some library files obviously
I'm not in a project or anything if I
was in a real project these files would
probably exist under a third party so
let's just take this one Lib X tables I
have no idea what this does but you know
something with tables and it's a shared
library and what would happen if
somebody just gave you this library by
itself well actually it would be now
cents because this library like you it's
just a straight-up binary file this is
like nonsense right what if somebody
just gave you this file looks like here
you go that's all you really get so
that's exactly why we have things like
header files
let me just header file will match a
library or set of helot
sorry I'm speaking too fast a set of
header files will match a library to
give you a nice interface into the
library and let me just find a header
file to show everyone should be one here
nope in here nope sorry okay so finally
found just a simple header file and
remember in this ecosystem a header file
is the interface into a library and you
need it or else you can just look at the
library binary because it's we just
looked at it it's nonsense it's not
supposed to be human readable so if we
just look at this one this one is going
to be a human readable header file
authored in 2000 by Dimitri which has
the interface to whatever this library
is and this is going to be usually like
a well-documented human readable file
that you know is gonna mean something
for a different set of libraries so that
is the purpose of a header file I hope
that's clear it's just that every time
we build libraries and you want another
developer to use your library it has to
come with an interface into that library
or else it will really make no sense so
this actually goes into what this
directory means like we said before what
are we building this project what
exactly are we building well we know
we're already building the LS executable
we're also building a library like all
this source code of the core LS
functionality we're building a library
for that
and we can't just ship these nonsense
binary library files we actually had to
ship a header file so in an include
directory it's gonna be LS core let's
just call it LS core
and this could be we write a header file
for our interface through the LS course
just like we include header files here
when we pull in third-party libraries
maybe somebody's gonna want to want to
pull in our core library maybe somebody
wants to use the LS core library in
which case we cannot pass them just
these files we also have to pass them
the public header file so I think I
repeated myself like 50 times in those a
few minutes but I hope it's clear why we
need those files alright so let's just
keep moving on
all right guys almost done this video is
getting pretty crazy but the last
directory that we want to just go over
is artifacts what are artifacts is a
pretty cool name but what these are are
like the final files and after
everything is all said and done
usually what goes into artifacts our
final files or pretty much the
culmination of everything you want to
build so let's just go over what is I
think you guys already know what's gonna
go inside this file
remember we're building and executable
and we're building the core LS library
so artifacts are gonna usually look
something like this the final libraries
the final binaries the public files and
probably some Docs so let's say after
all this is said and done after all the
source code is built we will get some
artifacts at the end of this and
remember we're what libraries have we
produced well we're actually producing
the core LS libraries maybe we'll have a
shared version of this produced and
we'll also have
a static version sorry for this page
break yes so right final library files
two of these bad boys final libraries
there's gonna be a final executable file
which is the LS command as we know it
for include we're also going to include
our LS library header file to use the
libraries and obviously if any developer
wants to use these libraries that we're
providing them they need the header
files or else this will be gobbledygook
alright and finally very common in
artifacts is documentation so we've
documented our code very well and
generated you know countless documents
of how to use this how to use this
libraries and usually inside artifacts
you'll also have somewhere to install
documents and those are probably the
four core things but there's many more
kind of vinyl files that appear here so
this is pretty much artifacts is the
culmination of any build process all the
final files are going to go here now the
last question we asked ourselves is how
do we get artifacts into the system and
this is a pretty crazy question I'll try
to talk through it a little bit here but
actually I take it back and take it back
so I think these two videos we already
talked about a lot it's a lot to digest
so let's just talk about this as a
question without going into it pretty
much what we talked about initially is a
basic project structure to produce
executables or binaries like remember we
took LS s as an example a cool
executable that everyone uses and how
that might potentially be built in a
templated project just some I just made
a
kind of simple common directory
structure here for this project and we
produce an executable and a library so
at the end we've got all these cool
artifacts here right but how do the
artifacts actually get into people's
system like this is just a developer
building source code right like how
exactly this LS get installed into like
every single linux computer around the
world that's like how its distributed
and installed and this gets into some
really cool stuff like packaging and
package managers and distribution
building projects for cross-platform
stuff and I can't go into the details of
what this stuff means here but if
there's any Linux users out there I'm
sure you use different package managers
for different distributions and pretty
much these things are the core things
that get these artifacts distributed to
everyone and building it is one part of
the puzzle and the second part of the
puzzle is the point or getting it out
there and that might be the discussion
of whoops that might be the discussion
of another video but not today
because I'm kind of tired but we
definitely went through a lot
please I'll just wrap with the video
here things might have gone through
really quickly I know I rushed through
maybe a lot of things there's a lot of
concepts that were presented I would
just suggest everyone to maybe just
rewash the both parts of the video very
slowly and if there's any word or any
little step that doesn't make sense just
pause it and google it and try to
reconcile your thoughts don't try to
watch the video straight through if
there's missing pieces in your head so I
really tried to just give a basic
overview building something as simple as
LS so I hope it was helpful please leave
me a comment in either video if you have
any questions this how do we get
artifacts into the system and
package management package managers I'll
do this in a separate screencast after I
think about it a little more because
there's actually a lot to talk about in
this realm
all right guys definitely hope you hope
you guys enjoyed the video I'll catch
you guys next time with maybe a
screencast or another video or what have
you please give me some suggestions and
take care alright have a good week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
