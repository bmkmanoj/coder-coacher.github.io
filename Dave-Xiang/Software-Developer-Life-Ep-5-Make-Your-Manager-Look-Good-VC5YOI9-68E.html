developer life episode 5 and this one is
making your manager look good I heard
about this piece of advice pretty
recently I think just a month ago when I
was perusing it through YouTube and it's
a real gem I never thought about this
too much but making your manager look
good is a really good good piece of
advice and first you can't take it at
face value and we're gonna use this
video to try to explain it a little
better I know a lot of people out there
your first reaction to this piece of
advice might be oh man but I don't like
working for the man
my manager is a jerk I want to do my own
thing why do I have to make someone else
look good don't I want to make me look
good if that was your first impression
that's totally fine let me just try to
explain why this piece of advice is
really good first point I want to make
is that if you truly work for a shitty
boss a boss who is unfair rude impolite
if you work for a boss like that
remember I hate to break it to you but
it's actually your own fault if you have
a terrible working circumstance is that
the fault of the company the fault of
this other person or is that kind of you
not putting yourself in a better
opportunity second point to remember is
that everyone answers to someone
everyone there really is no exception to
this unless you're just retired on the
beach all day but if you're a new
engineer at a big company you'll
probably answer to some middle
management if you're a CEO at a start-up
you might answer to your investors
everyone is answering and accountable to
someone else alright don't believe that
it ends somewhere also remembering that
this concept of answering to someone
else goes beyond the conventional
corporate ladder that we might be used
to just take Bill Gates for example the
wealthiest man in the world he answers
to all those charitable organizations
that he's involved in he's accountable
to them for being involved in their
project
and strength of someone doesn't mean you
just answer to the next person above you
if you've taken on personal
responsibility you're accountable and
responsible for other people as well and
that's also answering to them okay so
enough of that let's just bring it back
to engineering and how it's relevant to
an engineer's life as an engineer you
want to make your manager look good and
why is this a good thing not only will
your manager really like you for making
him or her look good but it'll also
cause other people to want you to work
for them
always remember that real recognizes
real and if you're doing a good job it
will be recognized if you make your
manager look good then other people will
want you to work for them because
they'll see how good of a job you're
doing okay so let's take the example of
CEO that may be a small start-up a
start-up CEO or actually any CEO
actually they want to make their
investors look good as well
right if you're a CEO or starting your
own company if you make your investors
look good it just naturally leads to
other investors wanting to be involved
with what you're working on this is
exactly why startup founders that have a
good track record just find it easier
and easier to raise money more because
more investors just want to get a piece
of the action this is really analogous
to the good work you do as an engineer
as an engineer you make your manager
look good so other people want you to
work for them as a CEO you want to make
your investors look good so all these
other investors want to just throw money
at you later it's like the same analogy
this piece of advice isn't about sucking
up to whoever's higher than you then the
corporate ladder this is really about
just doing a really really good job and
making your manager or whoever you're
accountable to look really good this in
turn results in other people wanting you
to do that good work for that
which just gives you more leverage this
is something you just do for the rest of
your life it doesn't really stop
anywhere just keep doing good work and
they'll be easy it will just be easy
just do your job well alright guys hope
