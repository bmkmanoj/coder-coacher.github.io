talk a little bit about the internet so
the concept of the Internet is really
simple about 40 years ago there's this
wizard who created this really big cloud
then he sent the cloud up into the sky
the cloud emits these electrons and they
can talk to our computers and give us
the Internet all right if you're ready
let's talk about some Internet's okay so
the first thing you have to understand
is what is a computer network you guys
probably have a basic understanding of
what a computer network is but let's
just review and break it down the lowest
level of a computer network is called
umeå LAN and it stands for local area
network and it usually goes across a
building or maybe just a small room
lands are made up of these things that
we call the third end segments and
Ethernet segment is actually more than
just that big fat wires the kinetic
computer right now an Ethernet segment
has two parts the first part is a wire
an Ethernet wire the second part is a
hub if you have a LAN setup in your room
with three computers each computer will
connect via an Ethernet wire into a port
on the hub I drew a picture for you this
is a picture of three computers or hosts
connected to one hub is so nice so hub
is not a very smart device all it does
is copy its data that it receives on one
port to every other port every single
computer connected to a hub sees all the
data when a lot of people get into a
room and create a LAN
this is also known as a LAN party what
if you want to connect multiple hubs
together if you want to connect multiple
hubs together you have to use these
things called bridges what bridges do is
connect multiple Ethernet segments
together to make Al and multiple
Ethernet segments are connected via
bridges
so when multiple bridges are used to
make lands the Lance can actually get
pretty big one land could span a whole
building or perhaps one college campus
also bridges are a little smaller than
hubs are they don't broadcast the data
everywhere a bridge can intelligently
forward data from one hub to another hub
only what it needs to get there so
actually the picture was getting too
complicated so we can consolidate the
picture with this huge big fat wire as
the land and it has different computers
on the land all right so we're almost to
the internet don't get too excited the
first thing you have to know is that
different lands speak different
languages the land you set up at your
weekly star crab party speaks a
different language than the land that
one company may use also both of those
lands speak a different language than a
wireless land for example how do
different lands communicate with each
other when they're all speaking
different languages
the answer is routers so routers are
actually pretty complicated devices but
all you need to know about them is that
they allow lands that speak different
languages to communicate with each other
that's all you need to know when you
bring robbers into the picture and you
start connecting different types of
lands this turns into a win which is W a
my area network when we say wide area
all of these is it covers a large
geographical location here is another
nice picture I drew of lands and winds
you can see one land can connect to
another land via a router and those
routers can actually form winds and talk
to other words it's really complicated
but this is the last picture I think so
check it out so the most popular when
today is the internet and it's
geographical distance
is worldwide for the internet is not the
only way out there there's another type
of man called the man ma n which stands
for metropolitan area network this is
just a network that could span a city
and help in city networking and
communications right now internet kind
of means two things so let's distinguish
them there's going to be a lowercase
internet and an uppercase Internet the
lowercase Internet is very generic all
it means is an interconnected network
it's just the combo of lands wins man's
now when I say the uppercase internet
this is the Internet as we know and this
is a little confusing but the internet
or the capital letter Internet is just
the most widely used in popular
lowercase Internet okay so I don't want
to say uppercase Internet for the rest
of the video so from now on when I say
Internet I mean the internet internet
uppercase to start talking about how the
internet actually works the core guts
behind the Internet is a thing called
PCP IP this stands for transmission
control protocol slash internet protocol
all this is is a language or protocol
you can just consider it a communication
standard or language in order for your
computer to be on the internet it has to
be able to speak and understand tcp/ip
tcp/ip protocol is very specific to the
upper case internet it's not specific to
generic internet is only accepted and
most widely used protocol for the
internet that's why it's upon you don't
worry you have tcp/ip I have DHCP IP
your cell phone as it were we're all
happy family there's two main jobs of
tcp/ip its first job is that there's a
well-defined behavior of how tcp/ip
sends data from one computer to the
other computer I'm not going to go into
the detail details of how this data
transmission works data set to these
things called
packets or data grams the second part of
TC
IP is that it's able to uniquely
identify your computer on the Internet
the way your computer is identified on
the Internet this via this special
number called an IP address I'm sure
you've seen these IP addresses before
it's some mumbo jumbo numbers with some
dots that number is pretty much your
name on the Internet
that's all it is in reality we never use
these IP addresses to access people on
the Internet I don't go into the web
browser and start typing mumbo-jumbo
into the URL that would be ridiculous so
for normal people like you and me we use
these things called domain names all a
domain name is it's just a human
readable text that translates into an IP
address the thing on the right the
dot-com is the first level domain name
and this is usually calm gov dot edu you
know the word after the.com from the
right is a second-level domain name and
this is google amazon Harvard or MIT
second-level domain names are always
owned by individuals or companies and
sometimes you have to buy them if it's
taken now to the left of the
second-level domain name is a
third-level domain name and those names
are defined by clover owns the second
level one so this example it's
maps.google.com Cobb is the first level
Google is second level and then Google
defines Maps and absent third level
domain name how do we know that
maps.google.com goes to some special IP
address somewhere to hit the Google Maps
or who knows so there's a huge database
worldwide called DNS domain naming
system which actually maps every single
domain name on the entire internet into
a particular IP address up until 1988
those domain names are actually kept in
one single text file now it's like some
big worldwide database I mean it could
still be one text file sitting somewhere
on a Wizards computer or something I
don't know so the main power of the
Internet is that if you're connected to
the Internet you can send and receive
data from anyone else connected on the
Internet and since literally the whole
world is on this win or the internet
internet we can literally connect to
anyone we want we get through the
internet via these things called ISPs or
Internet service and providers you don't
have to know much about ISPs there's
only two things to know one is that they
give us access to the Internet and two
is that they tell us to restart our
modems when the internet breaks so the
internet really is two parts it's all
the wires that make up the lands those
lands connect to routers and make lands
and those winds connect to other wins
that make big big wins that's the
internet that's the physical portion of
the internet the second equally
important part of the Internet is the
tcp/ip or communication language of the
internet both of those things the wires
and the tcp/ip together make the
Internet as we know it so if anyone asks
you what the internet is you can just
tell them it's like a big cloud that was
your main and then when they ask you how
it works you can just tell them to watch
my video personally I don't really like
how all the company is a marketing
advertised internet as this cloud thing
because it's really not a cloud when
someone tells you that that the
information goes to the cloud what
they're really saying is that I don't
want to explain what a network is to you
so I'll call it a cloud
I think it's BS to be honest because I
don't know about this cloud business
thanks for watching the video guys I
hope you learn something please like the
video if you enjoyed it or drop me
comments also check out my channel for
some other computer
if you're interested or you like this
one catch you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
