talk about something that's kind of been
on my mind for a while and that's how to
get people to like you more why do you
not like some people like what about
them rubs you the wrong way so I thought
about this for a while and my secret
vlog brainstorming chamber and I think
it's just because of one thing just one
thing whoops one thing that one thing is
being tactless before I get into this
vlog I just want to give a little
preface I'm not perfect and you're not
perfect not everyone likes you and not
everyone likes me I wish they did but
that's not the case
but I came up with a list of five things
about ways you can improve your attacked
and in doing so make people like you
more so let's do it
point one that I want to make is the
focus on the positive things if someone
asks you to proofread their paper for
example you don't want to point out all
the things they did wrong first you
gentle with criticism because it doesn't
have to take for everyone and make sure
you compliment someone first before you
lay down your hammer and tell them
everything they did wrong because that's
just me and they probably wouldn't like
you very much
point to that I want to make is to avoid
all-or-nothing thinking you have an
opinion and so do others and I bet you
90 percent of the time everything that
comes over your mouth it's just an
opinion it's not a fact so don't make it
sound like a fact you should try to
avoid absolute type of words when you're
discussing things with your friends
don't start your phrases with it's
obviously because or it's definitely
because of this don't phrase your words
like their fact because I guarantee you
they're not probably wrong be
open-minded and just share your opinions
with people point three that I want to
make is about healthy boundaries this is
pretty easy the gist of it is don't talk
to people that don't want to talk to you
if someone doesn't want to talk to you
they'll probably be looking at the
ground turning their body way or not
really bringing anything to the
conversation if you're invading
someone's little bubble then just stop
talking to them and don't force it
maybe you smell bad today or maybe you
got this huge booger hanging on your
nose but if someone doesn't want to talk
to you just leave them alone it's pretty
easy
point four I want to make is to avoid
sensitive topics there are a couple
topics that you should always just be
really careful we talked about them even
if it's around your friends
so topics like money religion politics
you should tread carefully when you're
talking about them politics always leads
to some kind of debate money leads to
the awkward situations a lot you don't
want to tell your friends about the new
BMW got after you crashed your old
Mercedes that's just not very tactful
sometimes
all the time I'm not even going to talk
about religion too much because I'm not
religious and if I say anything
someone's going to get mad at me so just
avoid the topics that could easily
offend people because more often than
not you're probably just going to piss
them off
so my last and fifth point about having
better tact is to just watch what you
say it's kind of common sense but you
should really just think before you talk
if you're having a disagreement with
someone don't reply immediately with no
or I don't agree a lot of phrases during
a debate can be made more tactful buying
prefacing them properly with things such
as I didn't quite understand your point
here could you clarify for me correct me
if I'm wrong but shouldn't it be this
way these are just like a couple easy
ways you can swish around your words to
make things just sound nicer to be a
little more tactful I know you guys all
have someone that kind of you don't like
and I guarantee you that it's because
they've said something that's kind of
offsetting to you I don't want you to
call them out on it and top of their big
dick face for me tactless but maybe you
could move them in the right direction
to improving the attack just a little
bit and then you might like them a
little more alright so those are just
five quick things I thought of and I
hope you found it a little helpful
please don't kill anyone all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
