doing really well video today on the web
and how web browsers work so I know
everybody uses Chrome all the time I'm
on it 24/7 I have it open all day every
day literally and the purpose of this
video is to walk through the flow of
what exactly happens when you type
youtube.com enter on your web browser
alright and how do you go from typing
that and seeing something on the screen
another developer actually downloaded
the source code for Chrome Firefox
Internet Explorer a lot of popular web
browsers and she literally debugged
built debugged and look through the
source code of all these browsers
millions of lines of code and shared all
her findings with us so I have the
article linked in my description a lot
of the info from this video I got from
that article if you want more details
please just go check it out all right
before we get started I just want to
have a quick disclaimer I think before
watching this video you should have a
basic understanding of how the internet
works no basic words like HTML CSS
because I'm going to use those words a
lot if you don't know those words just
maybe look it up real quick or else the
video is not going to make too much
sense all right but there's your warning
if you're ready to understand how web
browsers work let's do it first things
first we're just going to run through
the basic components of a web browser
here's a picture as a reference real
quick and let's just first as a summary
go through all the different blocks
number one is the user interface pretty
self-explanatory all those buttons
you're used to the back button the
forward button the address bar number
two is the browser engine this actually
facilitates communication between the UI
and the rendering engine we're not going
to talk about this block all too much
but hang on third one is the rendering
engine and this is actually going to be
the focus of this video so this engine
actually does a lot a lot of stuff which
we're going to talk about more but it's
pretty much taking all that HTML all
that CSS and putting something on the
screen for you fourth and next is the
networking block which is one of the key
components that the rendering engine
actually uses
the networking block usually uses HTTP
and request stuff all over the internet
right HT HTML here CSS there it just
gets everything
another thing the networking block also
does is it makes a lot of costs at DNS
to resolve domain names all right so
this is also a really important part but
we won't talk about it too much but it
does a lot of networking fifth component
that the rendering engine uses very
often is the JavaScript interpreter as
you all know if you developed any
webpage before there's a ton of
scripts running all the time on a web
browser so you need a really really fast
way to interpret and execute a lot of
that javascript and we're going to talk
more about that really soon six is our
UI back-end we're not going to talk
about this this is really out of scope
for this video but all you have to know
about the UI back-end is it pretty much
does the real drawing of a lot of
different things on your computer you
tell the UI to I want to see a rectangle
and you're going to see a rectangle on
your monitor okay and that's all we have
to know for that part for this video
vii last but not least we have a data
persistence layer on the browsers
because browsers also save a lot of
information every time you go to a
website you log in you click that
remember me that's actually saving a
little bit of data on your browser so
these are actually called cookies the
browser also saves random data like your
search history that you've clear very
often but there's always a set of data
that the browser keeps itself and that's
that persistence layer all right so that
completes it for the basic overview all
right guys if you're ready we're going
to start getting to the real guts of the
video as I mentioned earlier we're going
to focus on the rendering part of the
web browsers there's a lot of different
components as you've seen but rendering
is so complicated that we really can
we're just going to focus on that for
the rest of the video I broke it up into
five distinct steps we're going to do
them one at a time alright and let's
just get started
step one pretty simple it's just going
to be resource gathering we want to
display something we need something to
display all right and for a web browser
that's going to be web pages so the
whole point of restore
Gathering is the web browser uses its
networking module to just get all the
different resources on the Internet
it includes HTML files CSS files
pictures all that stuff we're just
gathering resources alright so that's
pretty much it for step one all we have
to do is get what we need to display
step two is going to be parse HTML and
create a Dom tree and what does that
mean so if you've ever seen or wrote
HTML before I'm sure you know it gets
pretty crazy there are a lot of tags
there's more tags nested inside those
tags and there's more tags nested inside
those tags right so there's a huge kind
of like tree structure that HTML creates
I hope you guys can understand how the
nesting kind of inherently makes a tree
like structure right we start at this
root node and we kind of have tags
inside that root and those tags have
more tags and those tags have more tags
and it essentially just fans out from
one central place all right creating a
tree once we create this tree it's going
to consist of Dom elements Dom stands
for document object model and the whole
tree is made up of these elements Dom
the document object model it's a very
official thing regulated by this thing
called
this organization called the w3 you guys
can check it out if you have some spare
time but it's all very official and
documented really well so read more
about that if you're interested one cool
thing about this step that's pretty cool
is that
since HTML is really really flexible
this parsing is also really flexible so
often times developers we write really
shitty HTML right we forget to close a
tag we misspelled some things maybe the
nesting isn't quite right well actually
the browser can handle a lot of shitty
HTML when you forget a tag for example
it doesn't just break the whole page
there's a ton of error checking inside
this parsing which lets the browser be
very flexible about errors developers
make so that that that's actually a
really cool part of this step because
you can actually write
bad HTML and they'll still look right
just to reiterate the whole purpose of
step two is to get all those resources
from step one all that HTML and we're
going to create a tree of Dom objects
okay step three is taking our Dom tree
and creating this thing called a render
tree so after step two we downloaded all
this stuff we parse all this HTML and
created this tree like structure now we
have to add some style to it not only do
we download HTML but we also downloaded
CSS cascading style sheets and those
actually define tons of different styles
and styling attributes to all the
elements inside our tree so the major
purpose of this third step is to take
all those styles and apply them to the
right elements in our tree one cool
thing that happens during this step of
translating the Dom tree to this render
tree is that the render tree only
contains elements that you can actually
see visibly one really common attribute
of HTML tags is setting their display to
be hidden so you can hide tags by just
saying hidden and when you say something
is hidden it's going to actually exist
in the Dom tree but it's not going to be
translated into the render tree because
the code knows that oh I don't have to
render that because they said it's hid
it so that's kind of a tricky difference
you have your Dom tree of all these
different elements it gets translated to
a render tree of what actually needs to
be seen step four is laying out the
render tree so at the end of step three
we have this crazy new tree with all
these different styles right but where
the after they go we need to position
them and give them size so we can
actually put them somewhere during this
layout step everything is in the context
of a box or square or a rectangle but
there are a couple different ways to
describe a box right you can give it
four different points or you could give
it one point with dimensions so
hopefully you guys have an intuitive
sense of what this step is doing step 3
put all the styling into one render tree
and step four is figuring out their
exact position and we
they go on the screen so that's step
four layout and I like that word layout
it's a pretty cool word so step four the
fifth and final step of this whole
process is called painting and it's
pretty much taking all that information
and sending it over to the UI back-end
to actually draw on the monitor or let
you see it the core UI back-end I'm a
little fuzzy on this I don't know all
the details behind this but pretty much
what happens is the core UI goes all the
way into your operating system or down
to your graphics libraries and actually
uses draw functions to get things onto
the screen so you tell the UI I want to
see a circle I want to see a polygon or
I want to see a rhombus and it's going
to draw a rhombus for you oh yeah one
other cool thing that this UI or drawing
part or this painting part does is
handle the Z dimension
so during layout everything is laid out
on the XY but also you have this concept
of a Z dimension or stuff that overlaps
so imagine two boxes and they actually
take up the same amount of space but one
box is over where you see that one box
over the other box the UI engine has to
be smart enough to recognize what's over
and what's under so you don't display
this guy so that's another cool thing it
does okay so that was step 5
taking all that layout information all
the style information and giving it to
the UI back-end to actually physically
draw so you can see it on your monitor
alright and that's called painting
alright guys so that was a basic
overview of the five steps during the
whole rendering process and we're gonna
talk about some afterthoughts now
because I want to show you how difficult
this really is so one of the core
reasons that web browsers are so
complicated is that this tree all the
trees that we describe the Dom tree the
rendering tree that stuff is constantly
changing when you're on a webpage just
imagine this you press a little button
on the webpage right what that little
button does it actually executes a
script that changes the tree structure
the web browser has the record
is this change in the street structure
ASAP and re-render everything so you can
see what happens after you click that
button this not only happens when
scripts are running you're clicking
buttons and different things happening
but imagine just dragging your web
browser with your mouse
every time you drag the web browser with
your mouse it actually has to relay out
some stuff right things don't just stay
in place when you drag stuff around I'm
sure you guys notice that when you drag
your browser around stuff actually
changes there's probably there's teams
of people working on each web browser
working on different components of the
web browser probably writing millions of
lines of code to do the right thing for
their component and it all comes
together in this Chrome button we click
on our screen that we have open 24/7 all
right guys it's pretty long video but I
think that's enough for today to give a
basic overview of how web browsers work
and how they render things if you're
interested for first thing you can do if
you're interested just check out the
article in the description and then
Google for anything extra you want to
know about if you have any questions
just leave me a question please like the

week all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
