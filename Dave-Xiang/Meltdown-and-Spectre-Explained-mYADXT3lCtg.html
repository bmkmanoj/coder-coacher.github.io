doing really really well
welcome to 2018 I hope you spent some
good time with their friends and family
brought in the new years for this video
I want to talk about a couple current
events if you haven't heard there's a
couple crazy security vulnerabilities
going around in the news called meltdown
inspector these are really really badass
names and pretty crazy problems a lot of
the technical details are gonna be way
over my head
but the whole point of this video is
that we're gonna talk at a pretty high
level and that by the end of this video
everyone's gonna have a basic intuition
of what meltdown and Spector are so
let's do it
so the first thing that we have to cover
is different levels of optimizations
that happen on a computer system so to
be very general I broke this down into
three broad categories of optimization
the first level is where we all operate
at as software developers and the
highest highest level of optimization
just happens at the software development
level and this is how we write our code
so unless you purposefully do something
really really bad you can't really mess
up at this level so this is like saving
computations cashing things in memory
basic software development stuff to
speed up your program so at the highest
highest level we have optimizations with
software all right so we just talked
about the highest level of optimizations
which happen at the software level at
the programmer level and now we're gonna
go one step below that and talk about
machine level optimizations so at this
level we already can't really control
the optimizations too much we can't
really control what the compiler is
doing besides a couple tweaks in the
parameters we can't really control what
the crazy runtimes are doing to optimize
all the dynamic things that are
happening but this level is already
beyond us and this is also the reason
nobody really writes assembly code right
nobody writes assembly code because
you're not going to do better than the
compiler does it so this is the second
level of optimizations compilers and
runtime are going to kind of generate
the best possible machine instructions
that they can so they feed it into the
CPU because remember the CPUs job is
just to execute instruction after
instruction after instruction and it's
being told what instructions to execute
so we gotta feed it the best possible
instructions and that's the job of the
compilers and that's already beyond us
now finally we're gonna talk about the
third and lowest level of optimizations
and this is gonna happen at the hardware
level at this level we have hardware
designers hardware architects those are
the type of people thinking about CPU
level optimizations and this level is
extra crazy because an ideal world we're
gonna feed the CPU perfect instructions
that are compiled from the best software
right but in reality even if you give a
CPU good software or you give it crappy
instructions good instructions the
hardware itself is gonna do its own
level of optimizations irrespective of
the instructions you give it so a lot of
the different hardware techniques that a
CPU uses are going to be beyond the
scope of this video and my personal
expertise but a couple examples of CPU
level optimizations are sometimes the
CPU can look a little bit ahead in
memory because remember you have a huge
stream of instructions you're doing it
one at a time sometimes the CPU just
looks a little bit in the future to see
what's going to happen that's one
technique another technique could be it
could add multiple sets of numbers that
don't depend on each other so it could
do 4 plus 4 here and a plus 8 here at
the same time because it knows those two
numbers don't depend on each other and
other it does a lot of crazy smart
things it's beyond the scope of this
video but remember at the hardware level
crazy things are happening
okay hopefully you're still with me but
we really needed to do this kind of
background talk before we talk about
meltdown inspector so to recap the three
levels of optimization highest level
software level is what we do as
programmers remember second level is
compiler runtime and machine level
optimizations wizard stuff and finally
the lowest level of optimizations happen
at the hardware level and unfortunately
that's the level where melt an inspector
happened the first thing we have to talk
about at the lowest level of hardware
optimizations is a really really common
technique known as branch prediction
branching is a pretty easy thing to
understand for anybody that doesn't
write code it's just different flows of
logic that your program can potentially
take so if this is true do that else do
this it's just basic logical flows and
that results in this thing called
branching so just like real life the CPU
can detect patterns and habits of the
software just like you and me have
habits we go to the store every Friday
we go grocery shopping every Sunday we
like to go workout every Monday
those are different flows and our life
logic and they all have patterns right
but similarly in software software more
or less execute roughly the same thing
over and over and over again because
think about what you do on your computer
normally you open up Chrome you open up
a few tabs you type with your friends or
you send messages with their friends you
play the same games would you you
probably update your software every few
weeks maybe every month but overall the
software that runs on a processor has a
lot of patterns in it and the CPU starts
to learning those patterns so one really
cool thing that modern processors all do
is branch prediction so remember
branching if this else that if this else
that but one thing that they do is they
can keep a history a branch history
table but every processor keeps a
history of all the different branches
taking and it slowly can develop
patterns of what's taken more so if you
take a branch 80% of the time if you go
through this flow of logic 80% of the
time the CPU is logging the history of
that and since it knows it happens most
cases it's gonna predict that it's gonna
happen for the next time so this is kind
of the essence of branch prediction it
just tracks the history of your logic
flow so it knows what's highly likely to
happen in the future
it's a crazy hardware optimization
technique think about how technical this
stuff really is but the intuition the
essence of it is still really really
basic this is just like every Saturday
your girlfriend goes grocery shopping
like every Saturday she goes grocery
shopping so you start expecting that
every Saturday evening you have the home
to yourself right because that branch of
logic happened so often you just start
predicting so let's just keep going with
this analogy okay so let's assume my
girlfriend every Saturday she goes out
grocery shopping and I get used to it
like 80 90 percent of the time every
Saturday she just goes grocery shopping
well sooner than later before she even
tells me she goes grocery shopping I'm
gonna actually start inviting my friends
over Saturday because probably she's
gonna be out and my friends can come
over right worst-case scenario
10% of the times I have to tell my
friends they can't come over but usually
if she goes grocery shopping I've
already invited my friends I've already
done that work and they just come over
and we have a good time on Saturday
night if we take those concepts back to
processor land so imagine you have a
special piece of code that's if some
kind of conditional is true execute the
special piece of code if the processor
detects that that conditional is always
always meant if it detects that branch
is gonna happen all the time it's gonna
actually do those instructions ahead of
time and that's actually the essence of
speculative execution that's also where
Spectre comes from but speculative
execution is the processor executing
instructions ahead of time based on its
branch prediction
all right so if you're still with me at
this point in the video you should have
an intuition of what speculative
execution is the processor is doing
instructions ahead of time because if
things that branch is gonna happen so
it's just doing things it's looking
ahead and doing the work upfront for you
and this is analogous to I know or I'm
expecting my girlfriend to go out on
Saturday night so I'm already calling my
friends to ask them to come over so for
everyone watching you're watching this
on your smartphone you're watching this
on the computer you're opening up Chrome
or Firefox or whatever but remember
that's just one process on your computer
out of hundreds thousands of processes
that are running all concurrently on
your computer right now Chrome you
watching me on Chrome there's just
hundreds of other stuff also happening
that you're not aware of so remember
that each one of those processes on your
computer have to follow very very very
strict rules one of those rules is that
your process like the chrome process it
can't access memory of the operating
system of the kernel it also can't
access special memory of other processes
that are running remember every process
is supposed to execute in isolation
so you can't have one process peeking
into the contents of another one so I'm
gonna put up some very pseudo code over
here to try to portray what could
potentially happen so what if you
purpose purposefully want to access some
of that system memory you want to access
that data that you're not supposed to
access so you purposefully put some bad
reads into your code and it's behind
this branch and for whatever reason this
branch happens pretty often the
processor detects that that branch has
taken very often so in its head it
starts detecting that it needs suspected
to be execute your bad code what some
processors are actually vulnerable of is
that imagine your processor is still
executing that if statement right but it
still spectively executing these bad
code this bad code and this starts
slowly reading it into memory to get
ready to use it but at this point and
things still aren't broken yet because
you
haven't done the bad code per se you've
just kind of predicted you need to do
the bad code so even if your processor
is still at the if statement it's
already temporarily loaded all that bad
content into the processor somewhere so
technically at this point everything is
still okay right because you're still
trying to evaluate the if statement the
processor is doing its own thing to read
that bad malicious data into memory but
still everything is still speculative
everything is still okay but it's at
this very very moment in time where an
attacker can read the contents of the
processor because it's loaded that bad
stuff into its memory and it still
thinks everything is okay but the
process but the attacker can kind of
read into those you know parts of memory
it shouldn't be reading into so that was
a really high-level overview of it but
that's kind of where the word meltdown
comes from because remember every single
process has very strict rules or
barriers of what it can access it can't
access other processes it can't access
the kernel memory it has very tight
barriers of where it can look but the
whole word of meltdown is that the whole
bug kind of melts down these walls or
melts down these barriers which enables
processes to utilize speculative
execution and look around in places it
shouldn't be all right so that's my
attempt at explaining a very very
technical concept hopefully by this
point you at least have an intuition of
what it means if you want a very very
technical explanation of what specter
and meltdown are you can there's tons of
resources out there
I think the Google alpha zero project
the team that discovered these things
they have highly highly technical papers
on it which is way over my head but if
you're interested go check them out so
what have people been doing to fix these
problems but a lot of companies have
they've just turned off the whole
feature completely so I told you branch
prediction speculative execution these
are all features of modern processors to
make them perform better but um one
thing that companies have been doing is
that is they just turn it off it's
easier right if you just turn
off the feature it can't be exploited
but the side effect of that feature is
that I think a lot of these processors
are running 10 20 even 30% slower than
they used to be so remember our levels
are categories of optimizations we have
software at the very top that we had
machine instructions within compilers
and then we had hardware level but the
reason why melt that aspect there are so
serious so pervasive and affect
everything is because they happen at the
hardware level and that's the hardest to
fix remember if you have a vulnerability
at the software level that's pretty easy
just write some code patch it up it's
software level it's soft you can just
fix it right but these vulnerabilities
this exploit is baked into how the
hardware itself actually works so that's
why it's so crazy people just have to
disable whole features you know it's
pretty crazy if you think about it and
I'm interested to see how people resolve
it but hopefully you guys got an
intuition of what all these different
things meant so if you guys have any
additional questions about Specter or
meltdown and hardware vulnerabilities
whatever leave me a comment I'll try to
answer this hopefully this video was
helpful please like it share it and I'll
see everybody next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
