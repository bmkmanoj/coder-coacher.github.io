doing really really well changing up the
scenery a little bit this week I know
I'm tired you guys are probably tired of
me sitting in the exact same spot week
after week so this is just a different
side to my apartment same place just
move some stuff around hopefully it's
refreshing this week's video is gonna be
a little less technical just accumulated
some books that I have flying around my
apartment I thought it'd be cool to
review some books with everyone and
behind every book there's actually a
small story so we can do a little bit of
storytelling and it should be fun this
has been a pretty popular question what
are the best books for this what are the
best books for that and there
so so so many books on so many different
topics that all you can really do is
just explore there's not going to be one
book to like rule them all just go find
some books go read some Amazon reviews
if it has four or five stars just buy it
and I'll probably be a good book alright
so not gonna tell you what book is the
best book I'm just saying go explore
some so I have a stack of books that I
got together it's right here we're gonna
run through the stack talk through each
book I own I didn't really organize it
too well they're just it's a big stack
right here and we're gonna go through
them one at a time before we do that I
just wanted to give a quick thank you
earlier this week I hit 10,000
subscribers so it's like a pretty cool
milestone it's like one order of
magnitude more than 1000 so that's
pretty cool I just want to thank
everyone again for watching the content
hope it's useful and for everyone that's
using their time or spending their time
watching this video I appreciate it so
thank you again 10,000 subscribers maybe
one day will be 10 billion subscribers
alright let's see what we have in this I
made a huge stack here there's just the
big books and we're gonna go over it
first book is this C programming book
this is like a Bible to some people or
it's not really a Bible it's just like
one of the original OGC books I first
got this when I took introduction to C
in high school there was a crazy class I
totally did not get the class whatsoever
my mom actually
a lot of the homework assignments like I
couldn't wrap my head around pointers
but this was one of the books that kind
of like started it all like my first
real programming course told us to get
this book and I was it tough tough tough
course so I don't I don't read this
anymore I still have it it's like
sentimental this next book algorithms
with C I actually got this book as a
supplementary book to help out with some
courses I took during college so this
one's a little different the first one I
showed you guys is more of a manual kind
of a reference this one is slightly more
structured it talks through a bunch of
basic data structures algorithms and it
implements everything in example codes
in C so it's pretty cool didn't read
this a lot of these books I don't read
front to cover they just have used them
or used sections of them at different
points in time so that's that one this
one random book a neat guide to stock
investing so actually guys I didn't just
pick my engineering books I just
literally got whatever books I had lying
around so they're not all tech books
this is a random like investing book
because I wanted to learn a little bit
more about how to you know invest my
savings a little better so this is kind
of useful I read through like half of
this I think but slightly helpful you
can't be oblivious knowledge like this
so if you don't know anything about
finance or personal finance you should
pick up something or something similar
all right so this next book we have this
is a crazy book this is the book I've
read this book cover to cover
it's like computer systems a programmers
perspective and I got this book
originally for one class at Carnegie
Mellon called computer systems and it's
written by Carnegie Mellon professors
but this book is crazy like I still
thrive I still like use the knowledge
that I got from this book like
day-to-day life like I'll still
reference this book up to this day if I
forget something I'm just gonna I just
open up a page inside here and it has
all the information I need and it's
still relevant so I remember this book
cost like a hundred and fifty dollars
when I got it at the bookstore I thought
it was a rip it at one hundred fifty
dollars is a ripoff but
this book this is a really good book if
I could recommend like one book out of
this whole stack it would be this one
and just if you understand this whole
thing
okay next book I have is this huge fat
look how fat this book is this is like
an algorithms book it's a pretty famous
one introduction to algorithms like it
goes through a lot of different ones I
actually used this book I got it for a
class but we ended up not using it all
that much because we just use our
lecture notes a lot a lot of these
College courses ask you ask you to buy
these books and then you just don't use
these books sometimes but this is one of
them I barely open this book and I've
used it as a reference occasionally I
just personally I think books like this
are a little unreasonable like look how
look how thick this book is like no
one's gonna read a book like this this
is why we have Google like Google is
supposed to replace books this this big
anyways this book is actually a highly
rated pretty famous book about
algorithms go through a lot of them I
didn't look at this one too in-depth but
I got it kind of because it was famous
so alright this book art of war this is
like not a technical at all this is like
an old Chinese sayings book old Chinese
proverb book but you know it's kind of
useful to read all it is is these short
phrases by this guy and they're supposed
to be applicable to war applicable to
companies applicable to your life it's
just some like Confucius say type of
stuff this one is pretty funny like this
one I got this after watching The
Hangover and 21 you know when they play
blackjack and they wouldn't a lot of
money so in California are you still
live in California there used to be a
lot of just random casinos you could go
to like easily you don't have to go to
Vegas to go play blackjack you can
actually just drive 30 minutes and go to
any casino and play so I actually
thought there is a science to card
counting it's like it's just math it's
not really cheating it's actually if
you're good you can do it I never really
pulled it off but I was interested in it
so this is a pretty crazy book this is
the same green book they read in The
Hangover to do the card counting scene
so it just breaks down all the math all
that's what you need to do all the
probabilities and if you want to do card
counting which I suggest you don't do
because it's probably a waste of your
time but all right this next book I
highly recommend this is the story of
kevin Mitnick I think it's an
autobiography I'm not sure it might be
an autobiography but it's pretty much
the story of this guy's life this guy is
like a revolutionary computer hacker
social engineer so not only does this
not only is he like a crazy computer
hacker but he actually does social
hacking which is like really cool here
about like this guy would call random
corporations pretending to be an
employee or kind of pulling off all
these like social schemes that get
accessed in to their stuff so this
hacking the hacking that you hear about
in this book it's not just straight
computer hacking on the terminal it's
like phone calling pretending to be
people tricking the system both on
computers and not with computers so
crazy book crazy guy and check this out
it's a pretty fun fun thing to read oh I
have a I have a Bible here I've read a
few chapters but I'm not religious I
just random Bible in my pile of books so
all right this next book I have is a
pretty fun book it's called
on intelligence it's about neuroscience
and how like our brains are wired so
when I worked in California actually
spent two years on this research and
development team working with a bunch of
neuroscientists to try to develop like a
new type of processor that good like
compute information similar to how our
brains compute information kind of like
Terminator type stuff so before we
started that position they made all the
employees scientists engineers they made
everyone read this book because
literally this book was the inspiration
for that whole team like we believe this
kind of stuff was possible which is how
that whole research and department
project got started in the first place
so this pretty much talks about how the
brain is potentially wired how memory
works how memory effects are like
cognitive ability it's pretty crazy it
just goes into like really details of
how compute
type processing is very different from
brain type processing so this is a
really cool book really visionary type
of stuff so if you're interested in
neuroscience or if you like terminator
should check out this book all right
this next book is some book that every
software developer should probably own I
have a few of these books this is one
that I've kept around it's pretty much
this one is called programming
interviews exposed so if you're a
software developer I'm sure a lot of
people watching are probably developers
but it's always good to prepare for
interviews and you'll always have to
prepare for interviews so getting one of
these books it's just a list of practice
problem solutions things to watch out
for in the interview process I think I
already presented this book in one of my
videos my interviews video but this book
is really helpful any book exposing
interviews or talking through technical
interviews is super helpful you're
always going to be interviewing places
you might find a good job now but I
guarantee you'll have to interview and
do some whiteboarding again for other
jobs so getting through this pile it's a
lot of books I didn't really organize
these books very well I just piled it
all together but this next one this next
one is pretty cool C++ coding standards
so actually when I was working at
Qualcomm that Ardi project that was on
is when I first started using C++ pretty
heavily and one of my managers actually
recommended these books to me these I
called them these like thin read books
because there's a lot of them I have
like I have three of the I have three of
these books so they're all the same
they're from the same authors they're
just different editions like these guys
the people that wrote these books are
contributors to C++ so they know their
 okay and my manager just
recommended me to get some of these
books when I was first picking up C++ he
was like if you really want to
understand the language if you really
want to know how this stuff works and
how to write C++ well get these books by
the people that invented that thing so
all right almost done this is a one more
software book I have this is another
old-school famous book I think this was
written in the 90s design patterns
elements of reusable object-oriented
software pretty much like very standard
software patterns like factories
observers like basic basic stuff this is
kind of the pervasive software
engineering or software developer type
of stuff that is pervasive across all
languages so no matter what software
stack or language you're using something
like this is definitely gonna be helpful
all it does is it just breaks down all
these different patterns and these
patterns have stayed the same for a long
period of time so get this if you want
to understand some of those this is the
last book I promise this is the last
book and it's just my Kindle so I just I
don't purchase real book books anymore I
think look look this is just the Kindle
there's a lot of books inside this book
so for anyone out there that just wants
something very convenient to use I would
highly recommend getting a Kindle or
some other kind of ereader you can
literally just get one hook it up to
Wi-Fi search Amazon click a button and
you have some books all on your backpack
so get a Kindle alright guys that's it
