doing really well as normal it's gonna
be a different video this week actually
so straight up before we get into it
this video is not gonna be technical at
all it's also not even cater towards
software developers or programming it's
in the same realm but actually the
audience for this video is gonna be
really different so video title it's how
to recruit software developers well and
actually got the inspiration for this
idea from good comments and one of the
other videos about how to better recruit
in a tech field and so the audience I
would say for this video is gonna be
anyone looking to recruit software
developers and actually this kind of
translates to anyone who is just curious
on how to approach a technical person or
understand them a little better alright
so a little bit of changing it up a
little bit here different audience but
this video is still in the general realm
of tech software all that stuff so let's
just get straight into it but how this
usually starts when someone is
recruiting a software developer if it's
not through a referral if it's not
through like a friend of a friend of a
friend this is also cold emails to
potential hires so you know not only are
you doing a lot of work to get to get
your job but actually since there's just
so many companies out there that need
developers and there's a huge pool it's
tough to find the people that are gonna
be good fits right so you're not always
gonna have a nice referral so many times
cold emails are sent out to just
potential hires that try to get them
interested alright so what I did here is
I just kind of broke up the email into
four major like important parts of the
email in my opinion what I think are
four major parts of the email after we
go through this I have an example good
one and an example bad one and we're
just gonna talk through that all right
so first let's just go over these points
and hopefully they're pretty clear but
you'd be surprised at how often like
some of these emails just don't include
any of this stuff
so number one number one is going to be
a clear direct proper introduction about
okay
no like sorry I didn't say that really
well a clear direct and proper
introduction do you represent the
company directly or are you associated
with a recruiting firm so some people
try to beat around the bush not be
really clear about who they're
representing just be really proper clear
and direct with this alright number two
is show that you've read my profile and
show a reasonable amount of competencies
so what what I kind of mean here is that
first just make it known that you've
read my stuff and I'm not just like
you're not just a copy and paste in the
interview and sending it out to 20
people you should actually look at the
profiles of each individual person that
you're reaching out to write quality
over quantity always so kind of go
beyond the LinkedIn endorse kills that's
easy and also show a little bit of
competency and whatever you're
recruiting for so as the recruiter you
should know what you're recruiting for
and then develop some competency around
those areas so let's just do some
examples you're recruiting for front-end
developers you should follow up on the
pros and cons of current front-end
frameworks if you're recruiting for iOS
mobile developers figure out what was
just released at the latest Apple
Conference if you're recruiting for
Android developers figure out what just
happened at Google i/o Google i/o so
it's kind of just doing your homework
that's related to what you're
representing or what you're recruiting
for and also just showing that you've
read my profile it sets a nice personal
tone for the email and it feels good
okay number three is gonna be brief
introduction of the company and role
this is almost table stakes but again
some recruiters just leave this out in
the emails so the company in role need a
proper introduction and the recruiters
have no excuse for not understanding the
rules they're hiring for so I know
recruiters kind of represent a lot of
companies at the same time and within
those companies even a lot of positions
but that's still you still have
to understand exactly what those roles
mean alright it's not just a Python
developer and we'll get more into that
later so I think the real cherry on top
for this section is that if you can link
the role the position and the person and
if you can make that link it's actually
very special so it's kind of like I saw
you how to experience with foo which
force you to gain a lot of skills in mu
which makes you a really good fit for
this position bar
all right so most people can give the
introduction about the role but if you
can make that link between the person
and the role that's kind of like the
cherry on top icing on the cake so last
but not least point last point number
four is don't Russian ending so a lot of
recruiters seem a little aggressive or
they need an answer and that shouldn't
be the tone when you're ending the email
there should actually be no sense of
urgency when the emails ending so
examples if now it's not the right time
maybe we can connect in six months in
three months maybe in a year let's just
keep in touch if this isn't a good fit
for me would I know any friends that I
could refer to to see this opportunity
so don't sound so aggressive in the
email and just leave it very calm
all right don't rush an ending all right
so those are the four major points and
now I just want to get into a couple of
good examples and bad examples I have a
good sample here we'll just read through
it real quick and then we'll read
through the bad example all right so
I've got this a few years ago I'm not
sure when but I always kept it as one of
the better recruitment emails that I've
received so I hope this message finds
you well and all as well nice warm intro
here I want to reach out to you as I
came across your background and was
intrigued by your technical skills from
what I can tell you seem to be a very
technology agnostic engineer C++ Python
etc and seem comfortable working up and
down the entire technical stack yes this
is good this person has read my LinkedIn
and it shows
looks like he's even tinkered around
with Swift which is great so this person
actually even went to my github because
at the time I was trying to learn Swift
this language when Apple first released
it and they'd like saw my github so I
made a couple new projects with this
language and they like did research and
knew I was messing around with that I
realized you may be loving life a
company I used to work at eight months
strong now but I wanted to touch base
regardless in case you're up to a change
spicing things up a bit so I really like
this sentence because it's not too
aggressive and it's also very positive
with my current position they
acknowledge that I'm liking my current
job but if I'm up to something new or
spicing things up I'd be you know open
to something so it's not aggressive and
it's really positive next there's a
clear introduction to the company all
right
we here at Palantir could use an
engineer like yourself as we are working
with we are always looking to hire
talented folks who are passionate about
what they do instead of me going into
some kind of elevator pitch here's an
Forbes article about us so again it's a
clear introduction it's also not very
aggressive and this person is not
selling the company so much right they
just link to an article and if I want to
read about it I'll just go read about it
they don't have to sell it too hard next
this is some cookie cutter stuff we have
multiple openings in our new york city
office meatpacking as well as washington
d.c palo alto etc so now let's talk
about the ending which I like should you
have a few moments I welcome the chance
to speak to you further regarding our
company our environment and the
opportunities at hand just let me know
when you might have a few minutes to
talk and the best number you can be
reached at I look forward to hearing
from you soon so again this is really
not aggressive should you have a few
moments there's no sense of urgency at
the end of the email and it just leaves
it very calm so I'll post these notes
but this was definitely one of the
better recruitment emails I've received
so that's that and let's now just go
into a not-so-good example you know you
can already kind of tell because it's so
short it's definitely kind of like you
can already tell it's a copy and paste
type of work but let's just break it
down
all right so first there's no warm intro
and some people think oh that's that's
just fluffy stuff but actually you know
you need a nice intro to these emails
right it sets the tone makes people feel
good and you just need it all right so
no nice intro here I'm partnered up with
some company to help them find it back
in engineer for their NYC office so
already the intro is a little unclear
I'm not sure a partnered up really means
are you like a recruiting firm partnered
up with a company which I'm assuming or
do some other affiliation but it's not
exactly clear what this kind of means
they are looking for someone with an
interest in music and building a
large-scale consumer facing products so
this is what they're looking for and
that's fine this is what they're looking
for this team is impressive they have
graduates of MIT Carnegie Mellon Brown
Columbia they've joined and they've
joined from Twitter and LinkedIn and
tumblr so overall this is name-dropping
which i think is it's little
lame and still here it's kind of like
there this is only talking about what
they're looking for
there's been no anything about what I'm
looking for what I've done there's like
zero actually research about me
so that's super obvious here even more
so last sentence I think you could be a
fit for this team are you open to a call
or email better to start so why am I
gonna be a fit for the team just because
I'm in the list of your candidates but
again there's nothing in here that's
personal there's nothing that links me
to this position
it's name-dropping is and this
is not a very good email all right so if
you're a recruiter kind of seeing this
and you're copying and pasting stuff
like this all over the place just level
up and do something like this all right
all right last point I want to make in
this rent well going on 11 minutes all
right so the last point I want to make
is how you can kind of identify someone
and the only point I want to make in
this is that a software developers not
purely identified by one language so
this is just my personal pet peeve and
some people are probably disagree but
many times the only thing a recruiter
knows is kind of this they're like I
need to hire a Python developer but like
what the f does that really even mean
right
Python is a huge language has a lot of
different use cases and you just want to
hire a Python developer all right like I
bet 99% of developers in the world have
used Python at some point in time so
Python is just one skill that is
required for this position but do you
really understand the position you're
hiring for if you say something like
this you probably don't understand the
position you're hiring for all right so
like if you could say something like
this it would be a little better I need
to hire a data scientist to analyze a
large scientific data set for company
foo bar they use Python heavily as well
as modules foo bar mu bass and goo so
you understand the problem you
understand the technologies they
currently use and that's why you need
someone that has Python skills all right
so again just to reiterate this but
understand at the core the position
you're hiring for all right if you're a
part of the company this should be a
no-brainer you should understand what
you're hiring for if you're a
recruitment firm you have to get as much
info as you can about the positions from
the companies that you represent all
right so what style of development is
this understand the roles web Enterprise
mobile systems distributed all that
stuff also just go watch my 13 types of
software developers video that should
help a little bit and also just
understand the raw skills you need to
recruit for all right don't just say I
need to recruit for a Python developer
you should understand that one of the
skills you need is the programmatics
of Python the language but you might
also need maybe knowledge for specific
frameworks specific libraries so I'm
looking for someone that knows Python
that has experience with the Django web
framework and also has experience with a
sequel alchemy module and we run it on
an angular front-end so if you know any
of these technologies you're going to be
a good fit and what is this this is
extra so I guess what I'm trying to just
say in this whole point here is that you
can't just identify a software developer
so simply by just identifying them by
one language like this statement just
represents that you don't understand the
position you're really hiring for and
that's I guess if you're a recruiter or
anyone that's kind of trying to if
you're trying to reach out to software
developers if you can only say this
about what you need you just don't quite
understand exactly what you need yet so
this part is just how to identify
someone and make sure you can speak to
it much more than just the sentence like
this alright so again I'll share this
talk with everyone the audience for this
video wasn't exactly for software
developers but hopefully if you're
anyone if you're in these two categories
like looking to recruit or just looking
to kind of empathize or approach a
technical person hopefully some of these
things could be a little helpful but all
right so hopefully that wasn't too
different in the same realm but
obviously this might not be so helpful
for aspiring programmer but if you're
actually a programmer or software
developer reading this reading these
videos if people approach you in a good
way you should respect that person right
and if a person if a person approaches
you in a kind of a BS way like a copy
and paste way then you know that
particular opportunity is probably not
as good all right so hope this video is
helpful hope everyone has a great rest
of the week and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
