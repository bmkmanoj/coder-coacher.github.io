doing really really well enjoying your
summer enjoying August I want to talk
about something a little Metta today and
that's going to be aligning your life or
just alignment to be perfectly honest
with everyone this is only something I
started thinking about the past three
four or five years of my life so I'm not
some alignment guru I'm not a life guru
I just have a few opinions about it that
I'm going to share so to start the video
the general gist my definition of what
alignment means is just steering your
life in the general direction that you
wanted to go so it doesn't have to be a
straight line there but it has to be in
the general direction very general
definition but that's the premise of the
video and that's what we're going to
talk about so a couple prerequisite
points just to start off the video but I
don't think anyone's in 100% alignment
or 100% in control of your life if you
are then you don't need to watch this
video I have nothing to provide you but
for everyone else you and me that don't
really have that 100% alignment we can
always think about it right so the only
thing I want to share with everyone is
that alignment that whole concept is
just something that we have to think
about because if you don't think about
it whatsoever you're just going to drift
and drifting is no fun for anymore so if
you can take anything away from the
videos that just take that really
general definition of alignment choosing
the general direction of your life and
just keep it in your mind don't forget
about it because the worst thing you can
do is forget about it but you just got
to keep it as a North Star have been
things so in this video I want to talk
about alignment and three broad
categories that's going to be technical
alignment career and personal and let's
just get started
okay first category to keep in your head
is just technical alignment I'm going to
blow through this topic because it's
pretty self-explanatory in my opinion
but let's just take two scenarios for
most of the people of Washington
either you're in school or you're not in
school
if you're in school - technically align
yourself you just have to pick what you
study very carefully so that comes down
to the classes and the curriculums
personal story but the major that I did
at CMU was a very very broad major like
you could pick a lot of different tracks
under this huge umbrella major but the
classes you pick even just one class you
pick made a huge difference in the track
you took so if you're in school if
you're in academics don't under don't
just pick whatever you want pay careful
attention to the classes or the
curriculums or the actual path in
academics to take and that's going to do
a lot for your technical alignment if
you're not in school and you're working
technical alignment is a little more
simple I talked about this a lot in this
other video I did about feeling left
behind in tech and please go watch that
you haven't already but the only thing I
have to say about technical alignment
out of school is that you just have to
work on the technical things that you
want to work on it's just it's that easy
but go watch that video I talk about a
much more in depth but we're going to
move on from technical alignment next
category is going to be career alignment
and this is the meat and potatoes of the
whole video it's only something I
recently started thinking about so it's
a very top of mind so if you could boil
down career alignment to its most
simplest form I think at its core is
just choosing where you work and what to
look for in a company so in my career my
career hasn't even been that long I've
been working eight years it's not that
long but at the start of it maybe eight
years ago I cared very very little about
the company itself that I went to go
work at I didn't like do any research
didn't get any feeling of what the
company represented what it was doing so
that's something I only started thinking
about just very recently and it's really
important so here are a few of my top
things to look for when thinking about a
company the first one is going to be
top-down and you've all heard this
phrase before I think but when you're
considering a company it's always
influenced first at the top and a trick
down throughout the whole company and
that doesn't matter if it's a small
company or the big company so first
really important thing to do if you're
considering working at any place is take
a look at the leadership the CEO the
executive team whatever is at the top
and that influence those values are
actually going to be the values of every
single level down and for example if you
have two technical people that founded
Google you can tell that influence is
the whole company or if you have a
company that started by a sales person
or a company that started by an
accountant or a marketer or a designer
but that influenced those values at the
top always trickle down and it's really
important to remember that so if you
have your own values take a close look
at the values of the leadership and make
sure they're aligned for the most part
so that's my first point sum it up
remember influencer always starts at the
top goes all the way down to the bottom
so always look at the top first to get
the really core of the principle you
only see like a slice of it at the
bottom of where you're going to work
you're not going to see the true colors
of the company second important thing
that I think any technologist software
person engineer should look for the
company is the company's perspective of
technology and I usually break it up
into two categories but a company that
is technically driven tech at its core
versus a company that's not when a
company is tech driven a real tech
company is selling the main thing it's
selling its product its business its
service is a technical product versus a
company that's not technical will
probably use technology and the
complementary or helpful you know
department so let's do a quick example
of that but let's take circle CI circle
CI is this awesome software service
software as a service company all they
do is provide a software for you to help
you do continuous deployment that's all
they do their product their business is
a piece of software they are a software
company in my perspective another
company let's say you have a bank right
all banks employ a lot of software
developers but is a bank a technology
company I don't think so
so be very careful of what your
company's perspective of technology is
every company I think every company
these days is going to advertise
themselves as a tech company of course
we're a tech company of course we're a
tech company that's a really sexy thing
to say you can't just say that not all
companies are set companies so be really
clear when you're evaluating a company
what is a really tech driven company
versus what is a company that's not tech
driven but still use this technology
just to help out with that said neither
one is good or bad I'm not saying that
tech driven ones are just better than
the other ones they're just different
okay if you want to work at a bank and
make millions of dollars a year and be a
software developer at a bank then you
just do that but know that that is a
thing that's not a software company so
neither is good neither is bad they're
just different the last point I want to
make about a company is this thing I'm
calling Brook sink and this one is a
little more complicated so I'm going to
take a little more time to give it a
backstory and try to understand it a
little better but what is this
groupthink thing so for anyone out there
that's currently looking for a job we
all find ourselves drawn to different
companies right maybe you always wanted
to work at Facebook or you always wanted
to work in Microsoft or whatever
whatever whatever but all of us are
drawn when we're looking for a job we're
drawn to different companies and there's
a reason - for our attraction right if
they're branding maybe we love Facebook
we love the color blue but there's
always this underlying subconscious
reason of why you want to work at that
company so every company has a brand
right you know Goldman Sachs has a brand
Amazon has a brand Google has a brand
but what that branding really is at its
core is kind of what the group of people
represent and I think at the core of
that what the
people representatives actually how they
think so a company a company at its core
is just a group of people working
towards a common goal that usually all
it is and maybe if it's a huge company
they got a lot of different goals but
it's just a group of people and
psychology just how do you effectively
manage and steer a group of people well
the only way to effectively do that is
to manage how they think it sounds
really bad I know but just it's a really
difficult thing if you imagine a company
companies could have tens of thousands
maybe even hundreds of thousands of
people and that's almost like a small
town or city almost so Jeff Bezos CEO of
Amazon he's actually managing a whole
city you can think of it that way and
the most effective way to do that it's
unfortunate but you got to get everybody
aligned and everything even if you join
a company for the first time and you're
not a part of their groupthink yet
you're not a part of their brand what
all the rest of the company thinks say
you've just joined Google and you're
complete newbie I guarantee that
inevitably after a couple years two
three years of working at Google your
mind is slowly going to be a part of
that group sync it's inevitable if I
haven't lost you yet hopefully you're
getting the idea of what this groupthink
is but what we're drawn to when we want
to work at some place we're drawn to the
company for some reason we're drawn to
their brand right and at the core of
their branding is this big kind of hive
mentality this group thing of what the
company represents and whatever you
employee at the company is trained to
think like milk company will say they're
doing this but this is actually like a
very subconscious process that they're
always doing one example if you haven't
heard of the Amazon's 14 leadership
principles but they say we follow these
principles to the tea everyone follows
that Jeff Bezos follows it like
entry-level people follow it everyone
follows these fourteen leadership
principles
it sounds really good on paper right but
under the scenes what it's really doing
is getting everyone aligned to the group
link I don't have any advice on this but
the only thing I'm going to tell
everyone is that make sure you recognize
this like every company is a different
brand every company has different groups
think before you get drawn to one or
jump into one just take a step back and
consider what each company represents
how they think so I just made this sound
really bad right we all want to be
individuals you're probably a young
person watching I'm I always want to be
individual run you just want you don't
want to be like sheep like one of ten
billion sheep but we all have a sense of
individualism but at the same time one
of the good things I'm actually going to
say something good about this but one
thing that the groupthink provides is a
sense of community humans also we're
individual but we always want to be a
part of something like a part of
something bigger than us like
cooperating with other people in a
community and if you're drawn to that
then the groupthink can also be a good
idea because what if you just love the
Amazon fourteen leadership principles or
what if you love the way Google thinks
you just want to be a part of that
community you don't care that the
groupthink is so strong you actually
want to be a part of it this too is also
very natural because it's also very
natural for human beings our
psychologies to go into communities
that's why we joined sports teams that's
why we join fraternities we all we all
want to be a part of a group and if you
trace that all the way back to homo
sapiens is the reason why homo sapiens
or Homo sapiens because one of the
theories is that at the time homo
sapiens
all of us we all share that but the
reason why we pretty much dominated the
planet is because we could come together
in communities and groups and just
destroy other people so other like
mammals and species couldn't do that
didn't have the groupthink to combine
communities but Homo sapiens had that
special power to combine and that's why
we could just destroy everything so
those are two sides of the coin right on
one side everyone's individual right we
all want to be individual to a certain
extent but at the same time everyone's
drawn to a community
down to our Homo Sapien roots everyone's
drawn to a group wants to be a part of a
group so just remember that those are
always two feelings that aren't
head-to-head but are always present all
right I talk way too much about career
alignment but let's just wrap that back
try to make sense of this whole thing
but remember career alignment at its
essence is choosing where you work when
you choose where you work what are my my
top three things to watch out for but
remember top-down influence all the way
from the top all the ways to the bottom
second thing to watch out for is a
company really tech driven or not
detective and just recognize what its
perspective of technology is and third
thing is the groupthink okay where's the
last category now this is going to be
personal alignment we already did tech
we already did career the last really
big thing for anyone out there is how
you align yourself personally and the
only advice the only advice I want to
give is that just surround yourself with
the people with the friends that you
actually want to be around sounds are
really simple but it's also really
really important because you want to
spend your time you want to spend your
communication actually with people that
you care about you know people grow
different right you probably all you've
all heard this like you grow apart from
your friends friends fall off whatever
but if someone is going a really
different direction that you are in life
you have no obligation to remain friends
with them just because you work five or
ten years ago so personal alignment is
also really important something that to
be conscious of but I think the most
important thing just to keep this short
is personal alignment just be around the
friends there you know you respect in
the same trajectory as you alright guys
that's it for the video just alignment
aligning your life a couple of my few of
my opinions remember three different
categories technical alignment career
alive and personal alignment there's
obviously a lot more but remember all
you have to do if you took away anything
from this video is just keep that
alignment keep the North Star always in
your head because we don't keep it in
your head you're just going to
ripped and you'll be useful so that's it
for the video please give me a thumbs up
like comment share the video ask me any
questions and I'll see everyone next
week alright take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
