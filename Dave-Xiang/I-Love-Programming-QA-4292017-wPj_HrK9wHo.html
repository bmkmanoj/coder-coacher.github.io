21:24 people watching for one second
just hold on
can people hear me how's the audio I
just want to make sure the audio
sounding all right
all right
okay
sorry guy there's a feedback in this
audio I'm trying to figure out how just
long live
I have streaming nude going to have to
do it like this so I don't hear myself
alright um yeah there's enough people
watching this was originally supposed to
be on Facebook so it's redirected to
YouTube so I just want to make sure a
few people know to come here
so just give it a second because this
wasn't originally supposed to be on
YouTube and I just want to make sure
people know
okay first things first just want to get
started with the quick introduction this
is originally hosted by I love
programming and Roman so Roman is having
me here and also helped me promote this
video on his um I love programming page
but I couldn't stream to Facebook well
kept crashing so we had to come to
YouTube it's probably a software problem
but so first just a little bit of
background like for anyone that hasn't
seen my videos before is coming to my
channel for the first time I'm just like
kind of a new youtuber I've been doing
software for about eight years now and
yeah so the main purpose of this webcast
is just to receive a bunch of
programming questions any questions that
could possibly be related to engineering
software development programming I'll do
my best to answer them to the best of my
ability all right so I think ask them
indi you can ask them in the YouTube
channel I'm going to read it from the
live chat I'm also going to read them
from the Facebook page so I would
suggest everyone go to the I love
programming page on Facebook if you have
access to Facebook and post up some
questions there alright and live
comments are good too but it's tough to
keep up with them
okay okay No
so Michael Michael Zorzi asked which is
a better way to learn programming one
learn theory as much as you can
including all the little things that
might but don't have to help someday but
then practice or to learn just basic
things about specific topics then
practice and if you solve and if you
encounter any problems learn as those
little things you skipped to solve it
what is the right time to learn
debugging so I think you have to learn
both of these two things simultaneously
the only thing I would caution against
if you only learn the raw basic things
and just follow tutorials like if you
only just follow random things and you
have no theory then in effect you just
do not understand anything that's going
on or why it's happening so I suggest
you learn both because you have to do a
little bit of Theory first just to know
how your changes are actually affecting
things so I would try to do both in
parallel and there's some you can't do
either one of those ways because also if
you just learn theory you'll become a
useless software developer but it could
be a lot of fun so I would switch the
two and it should complement each other
and there's no right time to learn
debugging because everything you do will
require debugging next question I'm not
going to answer specific questions about
programming some of these questions are
related to like very specific Android
programming using alert dialogue
inter-class can't not going to answer
that
I want okay I want to be a software
engineer to make games and want to work
in the gaming industry what should I
learn first this question is a lot I
also think this question is really
popular recently because gaming itself
in eSports and League of Legends all
that stuff is insanely popular and a lot
of people want to be game developers the
one thing I would say to do this is that
you do have to start early because game
development industry is very niche so
there's actually a very specific way to
program for a game specific platforms to
use and also just different kind of
problems you have when scaling games to
an insane magnitude you can imagine how
like how it how crazy it is to make
games like World of Warcraft League of
Legends but just starting gaming
industry I would say just to be a
software developer I'm assuming you have
a basic amount of fundamentals you just
have to pick a gaming framework like
unity that's in c-sharp and then that
has a few platforms they can push out to
like unity I think you can make desktop
games and that's a good place to start
as like a hobbyist game developer and
you must do that first and early and
then I think a lot of people what they
told me is that to get into the big game
gaming companies at EA or blizzard they
start off as testers and hopefully after
some while move up to development but
there are so many development tests
there's story tellers working in those
big companies so that's your decision to
make you could maybe try to gear your
education to work at a big gaming
company or there's a lot of indie game
developers where there's two or three
people and you can work on whatever
games you want to work on and I know a
lot of people like that style too but
basic programming probably OpenGL would
be good to learn so you can write some
graphics code and also if you just love
games and learning a framework you have
to learn a gaming framework you're not
going to write a game event loop by
yourself okay
ah this is harder than I expected okay
what what is the best programming
language for image processing okay I
think for some of this stuff when it
comes to image processing and just
high-level on either machine learning
computer vision a lot of those things a
lot of the prototyping program
programming is done in like high level
languages like MATLAB and octave which
they have a lot of stuff built in for
you that's why if you take I think entry
level machine learning courses they
teach you MATLAB or octave because it's
high level programming and you can
prototype things very quickly and you
don't have to do high performance tuning
so I think for it's a very general
question but just in general for things
like image processing I would say it's
prototyped and languages like octave
MATLAB and then once a prototype is
proven and there's like a use case for
it it will be further performance
optimized somebody will write like a
high performance C++ library to
implement that algorithm and also a lot
of people implement different pieces of
different parts of those big systems
it's not just computer vision as a whole
it goes through probably a pipeline of
many different parts and each part could
be powered by different applications
that are highly tuned and running on
different platforms so I don't think
it's you can't really relate programming
language to image processing but I would
say just there's a major difference
between like a prototype computer vision
application and the real deal thing that
your phone is using your Facebook is
using okay oh I missed I missed some
questions sorry so Marta has asked two
questions
question 1 how would you prepare for a
hacker rank type of interview if you had
less than a week for preparation
question 2 what was the most challenging
or memorable problem related to
programming that you ever had so I'm not
sure about hacker rank what that is but
I'm pretty sure it's competitive
programming so things like top coder
hacker rank I think most interviews
won't ask you competitive programming
questions because I think competition
level programming is a whole different
beast and it's usually while it's really
fun that's not actually what's practical
so maybe there's some companies that ask
you competition style programming
questions and to prepare for those you
should you practice competition style
programming um I know for top coder you
can download a special app like a top
coder app like a Java applet that runs
on your desktop that hooks up to their
system but you can also have they
support multiple language they have
histories this is top coder they have a
history of all their old events all the
old challenges I think there's three
difficulty levels if I'm not mistaken I
used to try to do it for fun but it's
really hard competitive programming and
it's a different skill to have so if you
have a hacker rank or competition style
programming problem then I would suggest
you just practice with competition style
programming
see second okay so the second part of
the question is what was the most
challenging or memorable problem related
to programming that you ever had so this
one this one's a lot I guess one of the
most difficult ones that I can think of
off the bat was trying to program it was
like an embedded project and I had a
program the startup sequence for a new
style of chip so like every hardware is
coupled with software and you know when
the hardware updates a lot of times the
software has to update a lot most of the
times when a hardware has an update the
software doesn't update too much but
every now and then what if the hardware
goes through a crazy restructuring
because hardware itself has its own
architecture and that also changes to
like sometimes in a new mobile phone
they'll add a bunch of processor so I
think a significant challenge for
software is actually when the hardware
changes significantly if the hardware is
just small iterations software doesn't
have to update too much you just maybe
update a couple lines but there's one
project I had where the hardware had a
significant like Ryoga texture and we
had to write a totally new software to
power that hardware and that was a very
kind of challenging thing because the
hardware was so different from what we
were used to so okay so I'm not go into
too many details of that but I hope that
answered the question well this question
is pretty crazy
this is programming virtually a lie from
the soul to the body
why can't when can we program machines
but we can't program human genes or
human behavior so this is not related to
programming but I'll I do say these days
I think people
are trying to program human genes and
human behavior it's really crazy like
just for example if you're like a single
woman maybe potentially having tried to
plan for a child because you really want
child you can actually pick random sperm
donors this is not like programming
programming but essentially this is
almost like kind of choosing evolution
because you're picking potentially the
gene the potential genetic makeup of
your potential child so in effect that
is kind of like gene programming and
people are trying to do that I would
suggest everyone read this book called
sapiens hold on so I think you guys have
heard of this book you've all say pians
he also has a sequel to this book which
is really crazy but he talks about this
this he this one he talks about the past
how Homo sapiens came to be the whole
history up into modern times and in his
follow-up book which I'm currently
reading and I already recommended but he
talks about the future of humans what
humans are trying to do how they're
trying to kind of become immortal the
new age everything about machine
learning what that means for society and
future so this is kind of past the new
one is future and that question you just
asked that about programming gene
behavior this guy will answer it much
better so just read three that okay this
is stressful stressful okay um trying to
pick out the best questions because I
guess there are hand flow questions
write a program to concatenate any two
integers it's not one
okay there's some questions here that
there's a fundamental lack of
understanding one question is do I have
to know Java to learn JavaScript I think
I don't know if you're just trolling me
or messing with me but if you really if
that's a serious question there is zero
relationship between Java and JavaScript
that might be a joke but I saw that
question is how do you make exe files in
Java yeah so I don't know for anyone
that's not maybe it's a lack of
understanding book Java runs on a
runtime it's a virtual machine the whole
point of Java is that you write it once
and you can run it everywhere right
that's different from things like C++
where has to be compiled down to machine
code for Java you always write your code
once and the major selling point of it
is that it can run on up you just write
it once it gets compiled to Java code
which runs on any Java Virtual Machine
that can run anywhere right so it's kind
of one level up from executable because
the exe file that's a Windows specific
executable and there's different types
of executables across platforms
operating systems so that question is a
little off-base let me continues okay I
should I think since this is on Facebook
I have to us on YouTube I'm going to
answer some YouTube questions first a
lot of the Facebook questions are still
from the post but I think most people
are coming here I if you're here you
should be coming here I'm going to look
at the live chat a little bit oh crap
it's long okay let me just
okay how to be a data scientist by
prasad it's it's not so simple like
first you have to understand the premise
of data science right what is the
premise of data science the premise of
data science is there is a large amount
of data and someone has to be
specialized to analyze and determine
patterns from that data right that's why
most companies hire that's why this
field is so popular because a lot of
different industries accumulate lots of
data imagine how much data is
accumulated by finance or healthcare but
that's why data science is so hot
because all data science is is you have
to take that data and have something
intelligent from it so how to start
obviously you should learn machine
learning algorithms all that stuff but
just understand what it means you're
interpreting data in a smart way and you
don't you can starting to do that you
don't have to be an insane machine
learning expert you could do like basic
like NLP to like kind of determine maybe
the language patterns of comments or
something really basic stuff you can
measure the frequency of words that pop
up in Amazon reviews you could um you
know like maybe check Wikipedia and like
try to parse it as best you can but I
think to start just to start if you want
to be a data scientist first you need to
get a subset of data and try to do
something with it and there's a lot of
free public data out there one thing
that comes to mind that's always used
for testing is you can dump all of
Wikipedia and there's also an API for
Wikipedia but you can download for free
I think that's the whole point of
Wikipedia you can download for free the
whole zipped Wikipedia like via
Wikipedia obviously it's like a huge
graph of knowledge right with links to
other pages but just download that and
what would you want to like interpret
from that data and then that's the start
of your data science career alright
what is the web stack of the future
that's a pretty good question Taiyo so I
don't think the Internet's going
anywhere but I do think the way people
program on the Internet has changed
significantly um I'm not too pro at this
but you all you guys already saw the
shift between when original programming
was done nothing was done on the client
side everything was returned from the
backends back to the clients right you
would request and the server's will
respond with all the HTML now what's
happening is own everything there's so
much stuff running purely on the client
because the browser's are such powerful
applications the phones are such
powerful applications and that's the
current shift where the backend only
responds with data and the clients know
exactly what to do
visually before the backers are doing
everything visual and logic now that's
kind of separated so that's the basic
history of it the web stack of the
future one I think
I'm if you're not already on the cloud
train I think one thing that is worth
mentioning is that everything we know is
probably going to become Web Services on
the cloud I'm not sure how pervasive
Amazon Web Services is around the world
but here it's almost ubiquitous
and the cost the reason why is that
these days so many people the future I
think the future also what the future
implies is that a lot of different
people are starting their own
initiatives rather than big incumbent
entities right just like the random
person wants to start a web site and
they have every single service they need
at their fingertips just 10-15 years ago
if you wanted to do that you would have
to be your own server master just to set
everything up now you also have the
cloud so I think for the future one
important part of that you said you have
to control your ability to use web
services a lot and to choose your stack
right like the tools are out there you
have all the front-end tools for you all
the web framework tools for you and all
the hosting tools for you
and I think as long as you just
understand tools at all those different
levels this is all relative to web you
understand tools at all those levels it
should be fine for the future and just
look up I posted something on this
YouTube channel about a road map so if
you're here on YouTube just check out my
channel there's like a road map for the
web stack that's particularly useful for
this one second room and okay what is
the most trending languages now
functional programming is hot it has its
time in place languages are not going
anywhere that's kind of the other thing
I wanted to mention like Python is
getting hot just recently because data
science has gotten hot recently and
that's why a lot of people are using
Python the Python has been around a long
time and no one paid attention to it
before and now they are paying attention
to it because the industry is
determining that they kind of should so
it's not a matter of what is a trending
language there's just trends in general
and they almost like dictate the
languages there's if you look deep
there's a lot of languages out there and
then the top ones are always dictated by
kind of popularity like Apple is so
popular that a lot of people like the
program for iOS in effect Swift their
language is very popular and it's
trending but would you attribute that
the Swift being awesome or would you
attribute that to just Apple dominating
like if Apple was an apple they couldn't
make their own language and have it like
Swift is probably now ranked the top 20
or something most used languages over
tons of languages that happen in the
past
and every language I think has a time in
place and also like recommended
application but the language itself
that's questions not deep enough the
language itself isn't what's trending
trending stuff is like stuff that
happens in the real world industries
companies that
are blowing up you know jobs that are
blowing up like data scientists and that
dictates the trends all right so it's
all it's all connected one minute I want
to I'm doing this sequentially but it's
not the best way to go about these
questions so I just want to give do an
overview of some of them and then come
back I'll do programmers get girls no no
they don't
okay okay I need to be a little more
picky with which questions I'm going to
answer so I'm just going to go back
because I think the people that asked
first
hold on room
is masters degree required to be a data
scientist no because data scientists
like everything else there's a wide
level of them you could be
and just maybe like
for high-level stuff if you're really
pushing the boundaries of pattern
recognition or digesting a lot of doing
something intelligent with large amount
of data you do need some probably
specialized knowledge of different
algorithms that are how do you see
computers after ten years I think
computers are going to continue their
trend Google did announce that quantum
computing the live stream held YouTube
is saying the live stream health is very
low can people still see and hear the
video well
that's to eat right
a lot of people want to learn how to be
data scientist dan so sorry I eat or
sorry I didn't answer your question well
how do you see computers after ten years
I think one is they will still follow
the original trends in terms of
computational power
I think if quantum computing is real
that's like a paradigm shift potentially
in computing but okay let's go off the
premise that quantum computing is not
entirely feasible but I think one is
that companies like Intel they still are
gonna for the foreseeable future ten
years out it's still like a processing
type of game right they're just
increasing processing power of compute
over time and that has also what's
enabled a lot of the a lot of these
things so some people say it's the
processing power that's enabled a lot of
these trends like neural networks has
been around so long but they were
physically incapacitated by compute
power because they will just take way
too long to like simulate a lot of these
complex neural networks on computers so
one thing computers are going to do is
just increase processing power a lot you
can see that a lot like GPUs are getting
crazy a lot of the scientists like
emulate and simulate stuff on GPUs and
computer processing memory all that
stuff is still increasing so that I
think is almost linear but what's going
to change is that what people do with it
so computers will just get more powerful
but I think that shouldn't enable more
things being that like because you have
compute power available you can actually
simulate your neural network and it
won't take like a week to simulate so
it's a mix between the resources
available for you and what you do with
them right like Intel as a company they
make the raw chips and the computers
more powerful and more powerful but then
all these other people that like build
their systems on top of Intel create
these applications that become insanely
popular so there's a little bit of a
difference between the compute or the
resource versus the application level
and I think the application level is
much more diverse and we'll see that
become diverse but compute will always
just kind of increase
processing power and which one is better
guys web development or software
development web development is a subset
of software development that's it what
age to start programming just whenever
you're interested just start right now
it doesn't matter if you're twenty-five
I would just start soon and just learn
about it because it takes time it
doesn't take time just to learn
programming it takes time to adjust your
brain to be a little more analytical
especially if you haven't been used to
thinking analytically before so if you
were like maybe a musician or artist and
you think programming is something you
might be interesting interested in I
think one of the most challenging parts
is like kind of switching switching the
wiring in your brain because programming
is like a it's like a science and math
right so in the end it's not just
programming but that's why it's always
coupled with math statistics science
because in the end a lot of that is
analytical style thinking and that
should be kind of the mindset to develop
and I think once you find that you're
interested in it just do it right away
what age to start is just whenever
you're interested
do you think we will see more or less
C++ in embedded development in the
future I think from at least my
experience in the embedded development
and I think it's still probably the case
but I think C is still the language of
choice for embedded development whereas
C++ is still going with your choice for
probably high-performing system level
libraries like I think when someone
develops like like Linux libraries or
even develops languages they would opt
to use C++ because it has a lot of nice
constructs but I think embedded there's
certain style of embedded development
that you don't really need C++ for like
you don't have to track a lot of classes
and entities in embedded development
usually not the case like if you're
writing a lot of driver level code that
interacts with hardware it's just
hardware that hat it's just software
that has to interact more or less very
simply with hardware and I still think
people utilize C more for that
do I need a cosh ask do I need to learn
the programming languages in a sequence
or as I wanted so one you can't just do
whatever you want there is like I will
say this but you have to follow if yours
like the question itself since you're a
beginner probably like you need some
kind of flow or curriculum and I would
suggest you follow a curriculum to learn
all this stuff you're not going to
figure it out as as you want it ok so
just follow a curriculum and then that
should guide you on your way and the
only thing the only purpose of a
curriculum is to show you a lot of
things you don't know because your
current path you cannot just pick and
choose random things in different order
by yourself there is a special order and
like you need to learn like just
programming before you start programming
like web applications right so there is
a basic order that's a bit on a high
level but there is a sequence so yes
that's the answer to your question um
programming languages to develop network
protocols probably C++ I think because
you're running applications that run on
a probably large distributed set of
devices so I think you know C++ might be
a nice choice also yeah there are a lot
of cool languages like that I think one
thing to do that's cool is that if you
look at companies like like whatsapp the
messaging company or any company that
runs a highly liked kind of distributed
process I'm not sure what level of
network protocols you're meeting Ron
because that could be like under the
internet protocol or like application
level application level Network
protocols and I'm assuming you mean
application level network protocols
because that's probably you're not going
to be rewriting a TCP unless you really
want to do that but I think a high-level
language should do well there
who are some of your favorite YouTube
programmers you watch so to be honest I
don't watch a lot of YouTube
programming's but what I do think
YouTube is amazing for is like getting
into the minds of really some high-level
people and that's primarily what I use
it for so I think like a lot of the
talks I watched TED talks i watch maybe
special talks at um like Stanford you
know a lot of the top schools when they
have guests they also broadcast those
seminars and like before it was like
almost crazy to just listen in on like a
Stanford's
lecture or like a Harvard lecture now a
lot of that stuff is public so a lot of
things I do is like you know there's a
handful of people that like I respect
like if Jack Ma has a talk or like Bezos
has a talk I would be happy to listen to
them and that's what I primarily use
YouTube for not for programming so I
definitely think that's one of the
awesome parts of YouTube is because
people take footage everywhere so you
can just see somebody that you really
respect like just talking answering
their own questions right so yeah that's
primarily how I use YouTube but I don't
watch any other programmers like live
programmers on it thoughts on
programming bootcamps I talked about
that so much you should watch some of my
other videos I talked about boot camps
and uh this question is a little yeah
can you give advice for college students
that are not good at college how to sell
your skills at an interview if you're
not extra good you do not want to sell
your skills if you know you're not extra
good right I'm not saying you're not
good but you might just be maybe not as
far along as your classmates but what
you want to sell is not just your skills
what you want to sell is like what you
can grow into right like I'm not good at
this programming thing now I've only
been doing it two years but you know I
like the job I like your company and
also I'm going to make an effort to
learn all the things to make me a
valuable member of this team so you
don't sell skills you don't have you
learn you sell where you're at and you
sell your mindset to some company and
you know if they like vibe with that
mindset they'll be like okay this person
has initiative and they will learn
whatever we need them to learn because
most companies they'll will train you
like on the like trainee on the spot so
don't think about selling your skills
because if you try to sell skills you
that you don't have use people see right
through that you can be like this person
doesn't know what they're talking about
so one second I'm reading off YouTube
but since this was originally from I
left programming I just want to check
their page and make sure I'm answering
some of the questions that might have
popped up there because yeah there's
probably different questions
Oh
oh there's a lot of questions here -
yeah started this
okay there's nothing new on here so I
hopefully everyone's migrated to YouTube
and I'll try to just answer questions on
YouTube live chat okay what is best for
a software Python or C++ so this it just
shows that you fundamentally don't
understand what the how those languages
are how they're set up and how they
behave they have different purposes all
right
Python is your just standard interpreted
language with a lot of utility and it's
popular it's popular for many different
reasons but it's very flexible
whereas C++ like like a typed language
like that it's good for just high
performance applications but before you
ask what is the best for software you
just have to understand what these
languages mean so I think Siddartha the
best thing is to do is just google
around the top stack overflow has
analytics for this like look at all the
top languages and look at their
characteristics like this language is
very good for functional purposes this
language is very good if you want to do
object-oriented design or you could a
lot of languages these days have both
flavors and you can pick and choose like
Java Script is blowing up that's
probably the number one language between
all developers but they have javascript
has like functional properties now and
they also are just injecting new like
object-oriented style stuff because
people are used to object-oriented stuff
and then you can use JavaScript in many
different ways you could be like very
functional looking JavaScript or very
like oo
looking JavaScript but yeah so there's
different tons of different languages
tons of different ways to use languages
and then tons of ways to different use
cases for those languages
um
that's right drink some water
Carolyn thank you for your kind words
trying to just answer a lot of these
questions
you should write a program to sort
questions yeah that'd be good yeah a lot
of data science questions I think I did
touch upon data science enough but I
think again rabbin if you just
understand the premise of what data
science means you understand what you
have to do just get your hands on data
and do something with it
and then you can probably call yourself
the data scientist why is dynamic
programming asked in interviews when
they are looking for DevOps yeah that's
a little weird so I guess one thing that
everyone has to understand about just
applying for programming jobs no matter
what programming job you apply for they
can ask you whatever they want and
usually it can be completely different
from what you're actually going to do
but that's just how a lot of companies
do it they'll ask you these are the
threesome styles I've seen su computer
science fundamentals just raw coding or
puzzle styles system level system style
questions or just like not like
knowledge-based questions and you could
just be you could be interviewing for
like an analyst position so there is
almost these days from what I seen which
is actually really sad but there's not a
good connection not a good connection
between the role versus like the
questions your asset interview time the
interview questions are just making sure
you're like kind of competent in various
subjects like dynamic programming or
maybe like sorting something or basic
like data structures but that's just to
get you in the door and then they'll
assign you to whatever position whether
that be DevOps or something so there's a
pretty disconnect in a lot of these like
the things you will be asked on your
interview are zero probably zero related
to you know some of the roles we'll be
doing
what computer do you suggest to buy if
I'm interested in coding should you
should buy the most powerful computer
that you can buy and then start up some
these days a lot of programming you do
in the cloud like you will log into
Linux machines and do a lot of stuff
there for your personal use
just your personal use I would not buy a
computer for coding just buy a computer
that you like if you like a Windows
computer just buy it and then you can
set up your programming environments
customized to whatever computer you buy
it'll just be different if you use a
different platforms like Mac Windows
Linux you'll have to customize your
computer to program on that environment
anyway so I think it's more of a
personal choice just buy what computer
that you think looks cool it's cheap it
has good softness good hardware
well the industry become increasingly
telecommuting based yeah I I think so
telecommuting I'm not entirely sure
about your word but I'm guessing
telecommuting means just people working
remotely communicating a lot or
traveling a lot just via like video
chats and stuff and I think these days a
lot of software development is
distributed for a variety of reasons
like one reason is that it's expensive
just one example in the u.s. quad people
that need software development bandwidth
it's really expensive so they do
outsource a lot of the work to different
countries where it's significantly
cheaper like we have a project in mind
let's have an agency in a different
country like Italy help us work on that
so that inherently makes a very
distributed style of work and these days
it is rare for everyone to be together
but there is still something nice about
every like having a headquarters right
like when you have the people in real
life when you have people together it's
much nicer to interact with them rather
than interacting with everyone you know
via the internet what do you think about
quantum computing how far is it to be a
real thing I have to do more study on
quantum computing I just know that
Google released something that said they
were close I know they've been working
on quantum computing for a real time and
the whole premise of it is really
amazing but as maybe got a long way to
go but it's cool that they're working on
something so far out I don't know when
that's going to be commercialized but I
think to prove it like definitively
prove that it's that kind of possible
and maybe like academic setting is the
first step and then we'll see what kind
of commercialization happens from that
that could be pretty crazy all right
let's go down
oh man cannot this interface what are
some good project ideas for beginners
okay I'm going to probably start good
project ideas for beginners I would just
I think for web programming just
replicate some websites that are
reasonable like get some basic tutorials
going and then just remake websites like
redo Facebook air B&amp;amp;B Twitter Twitter's
good one like yeah program a website
that's pretty pretty much essentially
Twitter do the feed make sure you could
read the feed make sure you can display
the feed if there's tons of tweets how
do you make sure it all renders properly
but I think those are good ideas for
beginners I know that's what boot camps
do very often you just take an existing
website and you just do your best to
copy it and it's core functionality do
you think I should start doing YouTube
videos yeah you should totally start I I
did it cuz my um friends - just ask me
that go you should explain computers
online and I didn't want to and then
it's still kind of weird but um yeah
Dave have you ever programmed arm yes
yes I have I have a couple videos in my
channel where I do a basic intro to arm
programming obviously that's really
detailed so that's not not but they
answer to the questions yes and if
you're interested in learning more about
arm you should definitely do some
research in it but that's arm is pretty
cool definitely
any advice for developers who've been in
the industry a few years and are
suffering from burnout all right if
you're burning out after a few years I
think something might be fundamentally
wrong with your job or maybe how you're
reacting to your job because it
shouldn't be so fast like if you if you
burn up just after a few years there's
some something could be fundamentally
wrong just maybe with how you're viewing
programming or how you're going about
becoming a developer so burnout usually
happens when you're in a very bad
environment and that usually happens I'm
not sure where your work this a number
runner if you've I would just take a
really objective look at the environment
you're in like ask people that are not
in where you're working like ask your
friends that have no affiliation to
where you're working and ask them third
party objective point of view does this
seem reasonable of where I'm working and
if the answer from them is also no
they're crazy that's why you're burning
out maybe it's the environment you're in
but also three years is a pretty few
years of pretty short time so you should
be careful like there's many more years
to go and I'm sure you'll be more burned
out so keep keep it up Anthony yes you
shall focus on Python yes
Jesse Pinkman that's good what tips
helped you when you were starting out I
think starting out the best thing to
help you is you have to know how to
formulate and ask questions well from
other people because the best thing to
grow I think is when you ask other
people for help very specifically you
ask other people for help and they
provide some assistant for you
assistance for you it's kind of like if
you're in school don't just go to your
TAS office hours with like some basic
questions of how do I do problem to just
try to go with some really core like
fundamental questions asking like how
does this work or like how this process
actually to process why and why so just
be very specific with your questions
understand what you don't understand and
then formulate a question to ask that
because the number one thing that helped
me when I was starting is getting you
utilizing other resources well like
there's other resources co-workers that
know a lot more than you do just people
around you that know a lot more about
you do and if you have the luxury of
using them as a resource ask them the
best question that you can ask them and
they will give you a good answer and can
should guide you and just look on
YouTube that's another that's why
YouTube is great because you there's
high level people on here so you can you
can just click a button and listen to
you know like linus torvalds
talk or something I don't know
it's impossible to integrate different
programming languages for instance
opening a C++ file in JavaScript I would
ask why would you ever want to do that
Li Li Anderson
Quincy Larsen I do like Quincy Larsen
that guy has a lot of good content says
JavaScript is the best language to learn
first do you believe this is true I
think if you're targeting web
development you must as one of your
first things you must understand
JavaScript and I think since web
development is the primary entry point
for all software development these days
I think that is a core language to
understand because it's used all over
the place now so I would JavaScript
itself like it's gotten updates recently
with like the new ACMA script
specifications and stuff but at its core
is a pretty basic language and you
should get the grasp of it it's not
JavaScript itself is a very simplistic
language what makes that whole ecosystem
complicated is that the environment and
all the external libraries and
frameworks there's so many different
things out there like people say
front-end programming is insane because
there's just so many JavaScript
libraries to use so that's kind of what
makes it hard is because it's like
option overload with stuff that you can
potentially use okay okay I'm going to
try to keep this between an hour and
hour and a half I don't know if there's
any newer questions
how do you maximize your study time the
way to maximize your study time is you
have to completely know how to manage
your time and a lot of time management
comes from just preparing well so before
you even start studying like the act of
studying just make a plan before you
want to study make an outline and
prepare if you go to a lecture prepare
for the lecture if you're go to meet
somebody if you go to office hours
prepare questions to ask in office hours
most time wasted in all of studying if
you just commit like three hours of
studying and you have no idea you didn't
prepare anything and then most of your
studying is just planning what to study
so preparation preparation saves you all
the time should I make a website adapted
down to mobile size yes that's a good
when you make a website it should be
mobile optimized whatever website you
make Paul
beginner ideas for software developers
who don't want to go into web design
yeah I think there's some like cool
ideas you could potentially do just like
if you don't want to go to web design
maybe like I think desktop applications
could be pretty interesting that's
definitely a beast
that's how a lot of computing industry
started with insane desktop applications
like before the internet blew up and all
these companies like Microsoft Apple
when like Apple came out with all his
computers or Microsoft was first
starting all its development everything
there was a desktop app now I dunno
desktop apps are kind of going out of
phase right now but I still think a good
quality desktop app all your computer is
amazing like there's still some key apps
that you'll use for development all the
time like Wireshark like the person that
made Wireshark is that's such a basic
such a useful tool so I know these days
people are moving away from desktop
everything should be in a browser
everything should be on a web but I
think one cool idea is that what if you
could make a really cool like desktop
level util utility level application
because that's how a lot of things
started like Excel was a desktop app
Microsoft Word was a desktop app like a
lot of these things got started like
that just imagine your computer itself
is a cool workstation and you can make a
lot of things that don't have to be in a
web browser so yeah just food for
thought how do you network JJ JJ I
already answered a lot of your questions
damn it what is your favorite part
nice I think I answered most of these
actually I think I can't almost caught
up okay I'll answer some of the newer
questions down below because
I think I'm more or less caught up keep
going for a while I don't know if I
should save this video
hey hey they've been following you for a
while thank you thank you very much what
do you think about an online cs degree
I'm currently in the military I was
looking looking for this yeah I think
online cs3 could be an awesome option
for you just because I know if you're in
the military like there's a lot of
constraints like just based on your
location your time so one of the things
that's really cool about the online
degrees is that you can do it on your
own time and I would I would highly
recommend it because you know that it
sounds really good because you pick the
online degree because of you know maybe
your situation and other things but you
should definitely pursue it and like I'm
not too familiar with the online CS
degrees but I would take a look at the
curriculums the class descriptions if
you can send them my way I can try to
review them but one thing is look at the
different online CS degrees and each one
should publicize roughly the curriculum
or the flow like this is a three this CS
degree has 25 classes here's the flow of
classes you can choose these five extra
classes so just take a look at those
styles and then take a look at those
curriculum sorry and you should be able
to pick a good online CS degree I think
and do it on your own time it's really
cool how is the market for full stack
developers it's always hot the market
for developers is really like kind of on
fire right now just because there's such
a need for developers and there's a lot
of access to start learning development
like everything happened at the same
time right demand for developers that's
why there's all these boot camps to
create developers it's like supply and
demand and all these companies are
realizing especially older companies
that are realizing they have to play
catch-up to a lot of the new tech guys
there's a lot of established players
with a lot of these new technical Misha
discs because they realize they have to
keep up without becoming dinosaurs so
the demand is always quite high right
now for full site developers
though I do think the entry point is
getting a little too easy to become a
programmer because boot camps don't
really make you full programmers but
there's definitely a market for it all
right
do this for 15 more minutes it's hard
it's kind of fun this is hard but it's
not I'm used to it
the c-sharp any good yes it's good
Julian Martinez it's good c-sharp is
good just learn both a you're heading
off to college you're going to C++ learn
c-sharp write it write a game in unity
and c-sharp see how you like it learn
C++ see how you like it every question
about language in this whole thread you
can learn whatever languages you want
and it will benefit you promise oh how
to negotiate salary that's an important
question and I don't want to answer
Jessica if you're still watching that is
like in a crazy topic and one thing I
want to say for sure is that there is
only a few amount of times you'll
negotiate your salary I think I've done
it three times not so many but you'll be
able to count them on your fingers every
time that happens and those like salary
negotiations those are one of those kind
of like really significant conversations
that you have in your life right there's
only so many of those maybe it's crazy
stuff like breaking up with your
girlfriend a boyfriend or addressing
serious issues but think about what a
salary negotiation kind of means like
you will meet with HR or you'll meet
with your boss you will me for only
15-20 minutes but that dictates how much
money you make for a whole year so if
that's how crazy that's how important it
is because such little time it's so
crucial because you negotiate for maybe
less than 30 minutes but it dictates
like your life for a whole year or until
you can negotiate again so
think that besides me I'm not going to
be the one to give you the resources
that tell you how to negotiate it I
would suggest just look up or meet SATA
and like how to negotiate your salary
there's a lot of techniques the best way
to negotiate salaries you just have to
be highly qualified and that gives you
leverage so I mean that's easier said
than done but that's what it comes down
to if you're a person of high value they
will pay you more like salary and
compensation always are correlated with
the value you bring so at the end of the
long term game is you up your value as
much as you can and your salary just
follows but for the nitty-gritty details
of salary negotiation I would definitely
Google watch a lot of videos on how to
do that well how to present yourself
well the only thing I want to say is
that that's an insane conversation and
always be ready for those type of
conversations because I just want to
stress the importance of it because not
the details I just want to stress how
it's important but it's a good question
it's assembly hard to pick up yeah it's
pretty hard to pick up if you're gonna
write okay I'll give you guys somewhat
of a backstory of how people write
assembly oh man I look like I
just I was reading these questions and I
haven't even seen how I look in the
video it look like it's 8 a.m. or it's
in the morning here so okay so assembly
so I think I'm waking up but assembly
programming it's hard I don't don't get
me wrong it's really hard when people
write assembly by scratch it's usually
to optimize a very specific section of
the code like there could be like a very
crazy bottleneck between how the
registers are used that it's not you
know being compiled well by the browser
or not by the browser by the
compiler but if there's a particular
section of code that needs to be
optimized and targeted and you pinpoint
this is the choke point of our system
you could optimize that in assembly and
it's a very specific part you would
never write a whole software system an
assembly that's nonsense but it's
usually the critical areas that you want
that you know you need to have
optimizations
performance improvements for you would
write that in assembly and you might
write that from scratch but also what's
very common is that you don't write
assembly from scratch you write your
program and you usually compile it down
and you have some compiled machine code
from something this happens a lot in
embedded processing - that they will
compile your source code first and it
generates the function first and that
function is based on what you wrote in
code but first with the assembly that
was compiled for you you start massaging
it from there so it serves as your
template like code first compiler does
the initial job gives you one block of
assembly and then you dissect that
assembly as your starting point like you
wouldn't write it from scratch but maybe
there's a couple lines in there that you
can optimize so that's how most people
write assembly is that they don't write
it completely from scratch unless it's
very purposeful but they start off with
some assembly and then they work it they
work it all right um yeah I'm gonna
all right I'm going to sign off in
probably like five minutes
it's an hour and eight minutes let me
check the Facebook page
all right ask any last-minute questions
for five minutes but hopefully some of
the questions answered here were useful
I have to probably rewash this video
I'll probably try to jot down the
questions in order but it was definitely
not as smooth as I would have liked
let's see
any last minute questions what's up
Hollywood what do you prefer to be and
some of these questions listen a lot of
people are worried about making money I
just say that like just work on your own
stuff if you just level up yourself and
you've got more valuable you just
automatically make more money alright
alright alright guys I'm going to sign
off I'm going to sign off for now I'm
going to write the script for this video
and try to list the some of the
questions that were answered next time I
just last but not least I just want to
redirect everyone that's washing to also
the Facebook page I love programming
which was nice enough to host this and
later I think we'll do more live
broadcast and things via I love
programming but there were some hiccups
with the Facebook streaming so yeah like
that page I think it's a good resource
just for day-to-day stuff and because if
you're on Facebook and yeah so hope
everyone has a great rest of the day and
we'll do this again and I'll do a better
job next time alright good this guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
