in a while and I just been lazy I think
I told people that I try to make one of
these once a week but that's not gonna
happen cuz these things actually take a
little longer than I expected in an
effort to make a cool video but not be
too serious let's try this I'm gonna run
through ten really unfortunate things
these things are just terrible terrible
things the first thing is wet socks
everyone hates wet socks you know when
you like step in a puddle by accident
your socks still on and it just wet and
uncomfortable and it makes that squishy
sound when you step second thing is
getting pimples on your nose or the
worst possible time I don't know if my
camera HD enough for this but if you
look closely you have this pimple on my
nose you probably didn't notice but now
you do that I pointed it up I remember
on prom I had a pimple the day of prom
and I had to use my mom's makeup to not
feel embarrassed
third is ordering something and then not
using it and then being too lazy to
return it how many times have you guys
ordered something and I realized it
didn't fit or you don't use it
or it doesn't work then you're just too
lazy to return it happens to me a lot
and it's just sucks fourth
unfortunate thing is chapstick not
having chapstick when you need it sucks
a lot so I have really big lips for a
Chinese guy it's not because my
great-grandfather was black but it's
just because I big lips look once it is
too are always carry chapstick with you
put it in your car like your office your
desk
everywhere that you could possibly be
just have chapstick the fifth thing is
not having soap when you wash your hands
I salute all these different house
parties once in college and all the
bathrooms had no soap it was always
empty soap and nobody would refill it I
know everyone does this you just neglect
and tell yourself that your soap is okay
but it's actually an
and the people that actually put water
in it six thing is dust I dust
I hate us cuz I hate how it accumulates
everywhere and you just can't get rid of
it you can like wipe down your table or
desk and then one week later we'll just
be covered in dust and it just annoys me
that it just always there it's a part of
this world I mean see I can't do
anything about dust which makes it even
worse number seven is people that take
up elbow space without asking actually
nobody really has to ask about taking up
elbow space but there should be some
like the universal discretion we're
taking of elbow space
it's like those times you go into
airplane and you go in the window seat
and the guy in the middle is just like
yeah all you can do is this right
there's some people that just you know
don't give an F it's - iy number eight
of my unfortunate things list is people
that never blame their own cell phone
you know one like cell must have dropped
calls or you can't hear them that well
or the signal is bad some people they
just always blame your phone their phone
is like perfect well it's not perfect
bro number nine on my unfortunate things
list is not getting the big portion I
know already the same thing it's kind of
lame but sometimes it's really good you
just want to order the same thing you
get the same thing as your friend oh you
got like one less piece of chicken or
like a little less of rice or something
and you just feel wrong last thing on my
list that I wrote down is losing your
friends the club it's like really really
sad you should like when you go out with
your friends you should take care not
losing them and if you go somewhere you
should like let people know everyone
around you is like squeezing you looking
at you funny because you're gone it's
not like you're low and being a creeper
you just lost track of your friends so
yeah keep tracking the friends man
alright so that was just ten unfortunate
things that I came up with honestly I
just put this
together to try to make a quick video
and I'll make a better video next time
and if I can't think of anything I'll
probably just make a video of 10 fortune
of things which is probably hard to do
because I always think up to negative
design hater hope you called your mom
