been hustling doing well stay hungry
stay humble in this video I'm going to
talk about the concept of concurrency
versus parallelism parallel parallel
versus parallelism these two words have
a very distinct meaning in the realm of
engineering and computers they might be
used as synonyms outside this context
but if we're talking about computers we
have to be crystal clear what each one
means first let's talk concurrency human
beings you and me we're very concurrent
every day you wake up and you have a lot
of stuff to do you got a shower you got
to brush your teeth you got to put on
your clothes you got to start your
coffee after that you get ready for work
or school you go to your classes spend
some time on your homework you talk with
your friends every day we have this big
pile of stuff to do 100 things and it's
up to us to figure out how to get that
done every single day each of these
tasks that we have to do throughout the
day may start and stop at different
times you brush your teeth first and
then you put on your clothes usually as
you go about your day you slowly chip
away at those 100 tasks what we're
really good at doing is multitasking
we'll be doing our homework we'll check
our email real quick send a text message
and go back to doing our homework the
really important thing to remember about
this multitasking that we do on a day to
day basis is that we can't do two things
at exactly the same time when you're
brushing your teeth you don't put on
your clothes at the same time right even
though we're handling a lot of stuff and
we're multitasking no two things
actually happen at the same absolute
time
concurrency is the ability to work on a
lot of tasks and have them all start and
finish at different points of time but
you can handle them all your head each
day you have a hundred things to do
you're not going to do all of them in
the morning but you'll probably complete
them all by the time you go to bed
unless your slacker
I think our day to day stuff and our
multitasking is really a good example of
concurrency just remember there are some
limits to this concurrency concept you
can probably handle 100 things to do in
a day but you probably couldn't handle
10,000 things to do unless you're a
Superman or something right okay now
let's talk parallelism you probably
guessed it but this is physically doing
two or more things at exactly the same
point in time or simultaneously if two
physical tasks can execute at the same
exact absolute time they exhibit
parallelism all right so I might have
made that sound a little more
complicated than it should have been but
let's just take an example human beings
you and me we do not exhibit real true
petals
we can't physically brush our teeth and
put on our clothes at the same time
unless you're really skilled wait
there's a chance for this to happen
let's say you grew another pair of arms
so you had four arms
so you just grew two more arms this is
pretty much a Gainey hardware if this
were to ever happen to you which would
be really cool and really scary you
could do a lot of things in parallel
you could really brush your teeth and
put on your clothes at the same time
with four arms if you were washing
dishes you could start the coffee with
arms three and four again when two or
more things can actually progress at the
same time or simultaneously
they can be run in parallel
unfortunately we might only have two
arms so we're still pretty concurrent
but I guess you could also count
showering and going to the bathroom that
can be done in parallel all right so if
you need a refresher on this I think
it's really good to watch my part two
processors video which I'm going to
include a link down here for you just to
recap a little bit but a single-core
processor is a really good example of a
concurrent entity let's say you have a
single core CPU and you have a hundred
processes going on your computer it's
context switching or multitasking all
the time to make sure all those hundred
things get done the thing is you don't
notice this but a single core CPU is
just doing one at a time it's just
switching between them really fast
what's your course go up like quad-core
you physically have more cores and then
you can do things at the same time it's
the equivalent of you growing those two
extra arms once you got the physical
hardware whether it be CPU or extra arms
you can physically do more things at the
same time also remember this is just a
concept it's not really relevant to only
CPUs if you have 200 computers like
literally 200 computers side-by-side
those are running in parallel too so
pretty much wrapping up with the video
here and I really hope you guys have a
better intuition behind those two words
concurrency and parallelism outside
engineering and that context you can use
them however you want but once we start
talking tech please please use these
words correctly you might see marketing
signs of the subway just throwing these
words out there with other fancy tech
terms like scaling and cloud but as long
as you know what they mean it's okay all
right so now I'm going to give a little
bit of my advice you can take it or
leave it but here it goes if you're kind
of new or just starting your
in technology or you're halfway through
no one's done but if you ever come
across a new word really really make
sure you understand what it means how to
use it pretty much the only way we can
effectively communicate with one another
is if we really understand mutually what
really important words mean I think
you'll notice that once you start
increasing your technical vocabulary
things just get easier to explain
somebody will ask you a quick question
and oh I got the perfect word for that
that's a cache soon when you have a
brand new technical scenario to handle
or tackle you'll know exactly the right
words to explain it all right guys
please subscribe to my channel and thank
you for watching if you got to this
point if you have any questions just
post some comments and I'll answer them
if you have any suggestions for new
video ideas or concepts let me know too
also I don't share my videos too often
with everyone I'm not really for the
whole super self-promotion aspect but
I'm gonna plug myself a little bit just
once I would really really appreciate it
if you guys could maybe share a video to
your mind if you liked it and that would
really mean a lot to me alright so again
thanks for watching and have a great day
keep learning and have some fun alright
you can go watch some funny vine videos
now alright
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
