really really well enjoying their
weekend wanted to address another common
question I've been asked in my emails
and messages and that's any tips or
things to watch out for when you're
starting a new job so I've been through
this a handful of times I've heard a ton
of friends complain about this good
experiences bad experiences I got six
things today I want to talk about I
think we can get through them pretty
fast they're pretty easy points to
remember and hopefully they help anyone
out there who's trying to start a new
position first no-brainer thing that you
have to do is that you have to
understand the code I have a video
dedicated to this which I'm gonna put in
the description cuz I can't make those
cool boxes anymore but I'll have the
link in the description where I talk
really more in depth about how you can
understand a code base and thoroughly do
that because that's point number one of
starting any new job the most leverage
the single most leverage you can get as
a developer is having control over the
codebase so if you haven't checked out
that video please go check that out
first and that's point number one you
just have to understand the code second
point I want to talk about is that you
have to be really patient with the
projects that you receive because you
won't always get really nice projects
you might get really crappy tasks so I
had one friend and she started a job
pretty recently and on the same level as
one of her co-workers but you know every
time you start a job you're per set
you're perceived a little differently
based on how you got that job if you
interviewed really well if you have a
really nice pedigree if you're from an
elite school versus a regular school but
before you entered the job no two
developers coming to the job the same
right the companies are gonna perceive
them very differently so one thing that
she noticed was that one of her first
tasks to do was just tons of bug fixes
like not high visibility kind of crappy
work just fixing bugs tracking tasks
like putting notes in JIRA while her
co-worker who started the same exact
time as her he got this really big
assignment of starting this brand new
micro service you know very big beefy
maybe more high visibility assignment so
off the bat it seemed a little unfair
because we start the same time we're
kind of the same rank why do you have
this
sexy project and I don't so this is
gonna happen more often than you think
you might get a good project or you
might get a really crappy project my
only recommendation when this happens is
that you have to be really really
patient with your work because you're
not always gonna get the good things the
only thing you can do is whatever your
assigned whether it's starting a whole
new application or just fixing a stupid
bug you got to do it really really well
that's the only thing so as long as you
do whatever your assigned well the good
projects will come in the future so
don't expect the good stuff right off
the bat you're not gonna be working on
the sexiest features but whatever your
assigned even if it's just a bug do a
good job of it fix it well and all that
good stuff is gonna come you just got to
be patient
third most important thing you can do
when starting a new position is that you
have to become independent as soon as
possible so independence is a hallmark
trait any developer you know the first
couple months maybe the first three
months you could be handheld another
engineer will guide you like through the
code how'd about how to develop what's
the workflow like but as quickly as
possible you have to show that you can
operate independently of anyone else you
can almost ask one for help in terms of
getting advice you know getting a second
eye on things but in terms of pushing a
feature through fixing something
developing something you have to show
your independence as soon as possible
and that's what every everyone is
looking for right that's how you're
judged that's how we're judge as
developers if you're a developer and you
constantly need help someone else is
always having to like handhold you
around show you what to do that's not a
really good sign that's only that's cool
for a month or two but as soon as
possible you have to get independent
with your work so that's point number
three fourth important point I want to
bring up is that don't try to outshine
someone and this is the most nuanced
point because it's most related to human
behavior and it all starts with a little
bit of your self-awareness and how your
actions are perceived by other people so
always always remember that the way you
perceive your own actions is going to be
very very
different and how others perceive your
actions so one example is that just
talking meetings for example you might
be really enthusiastic always share your
opinions always have something to say
you know always like want to contribute
to the coding design decisions but other
people in those same meetings they might
think you're overstepping you're trying
to outshine them so this happens all the
time the way you think your actions are
perceived are almost completely
different than how other people are
actually receiving them so you have to
be really careful
another example is like if you like
sending emails really late at night
you're working on something at 7 or 8
o'clock that's cool to work on something
so late but don't be sending emails
after hours because that just gives a
negative impression to other people just
wait until the morning to send your
email so whatever you do anything you do
not only think about how it reflects on
you personally and like oh this is how I
behave this is like what I enjoy doing
everything you do also think about it in
the perspective of another person 5th
15th to do fifth tip for anyone starting
a new job in software is that always
when you present your code make sure
it's the cleanest shiniest code that you
can present so when you're developing
you're gonna go through constant code
reviews with your team usually unless
you're like a one-man shop you're not
just merging straight into master all
the time whenever you change code you
got to open up a code review people got
a review it people got a you know
comment on it approve it and once it's
all approved then you can merge it the
key point is that when you put that code
review up when you actually get other
eyes to see your code you got to make
sure that code looks really nice even
the smallest things the code conventions
syntax you know does your code even make
sense
like did you this is sloppy anywhere
because that single-handedly kind of
contributes to how you're judged by all
the other developers you know at the end
of the day if you can code well and you
show that through all your code reviews
it makes a huge difference if you keep
I've seen other people they just keep
opening up a lot of code reviews but
it's not really ready their code is
sloppy they commit changes to the review
after they make it public you know
when you make something public for
someone else to see it's got to be
really nice it's got to be packaged up
look nice make sense
intuitive it just gotta represent your
clarity of thought so if you want to be
judged really well in terms of software
make sure your code looks good last six
point six and last point I want to talk
about is kind of just a life social hack
but you have to understand basic
psychology and human behavior and it's
really not that difficult to understand
you just got to interact with a lot of
people read a couple of good books and
that's that because the way you interact
with people really will affect you know
your work life how you're perceived like
how enjoyable your work is a lot so a
couple basic social hacks I can share
with everyone is that don't ever cut
people off when people address you
you're talking with someone after
they're finished speaking I always -
make sure you pause two to three seconds
after you're speaking because it
represents a lot of things in that pause
it represents you're acknowledging what
they have to say you're thinking about
it you just don't want to button cut
them off because if you talk immediately
after their finish it shows that you've
digested nothing that they just said you
were just waiting waiting to get your
point across and it just comes off as a
little rude cutting them off so when
people talk to you
just wait take it in all right that
makes sense and then respond to them so
social hacks like that there's tons of
these things but you always have to
remember them and use them not many
people think about this but just think
about a couple friends you have you
probably have a couple friends that
you're probably known for cutting you
off or they always have they want to get
their point across first
the real nuanced thing behind how they
respond to you if you notice those
people they always respond very quickly
after you're done talking they don't
wait those two seconds so that timing is
really really important another cool
social hack you can do is always
paraphrase what your counterparty has
said so if somebody's talking with you
you're trying to digest what they have
to say try to paraphrase what they just
said to reaffirm your understanding of
you know the conversation also it shows
them that you respect what they had to
say you
you show that you are trying to
understand paraphrase you know organize
your thoughts behind what they said
they're gonna feel a lot better
so sixth and last point this is not
really like a software new job thing
this is like a life thing it's just
social hacks to interact with humans
better and you know this is not like
rocket science you can there's a lot of
books out there to do this read about it
a lot of times you're probably making a
lot of mistakes you don't understand so
you just gotta read and figure out what
people are annoyed by so I just
recommend reading a little bit don't be
afraid of talking with people you know
expressing yourself and also taking in
what other people have to say because in
the end to make your work life better
your new job better is interacting with
a bunch of people and you got to
interact with them well so that's that
all right guys that's it for the video
hope all these points were a little
helpful you know if you're a software
developer whether you're professional or
just wishing jobs which in departments
or your intern or you're a senior or
looking for your first job you're gonna
go through this a lot of times you're
gonna be a new code bases tons of times
you're gonna meet new teams tons of
times worked with a lot of different
developers throughout your career like
these days like you'll be switching
maybe every two years or every three
years maybe every one year if it's
really fast but it's constant constantly
in new environments and these things
will usually always supply so for all
the software developers out there good
luck with your job search if you're
starting something new maybe these
points are helpful and you know best of
luck and hope everyone enjoy the video
leave me a comment or like if you have
any questions that you need answered a
little more in depth
I think emails better or just like the
video so hope everyone has a great rest
of the weekend and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
