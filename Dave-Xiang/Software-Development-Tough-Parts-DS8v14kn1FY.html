doing really really well I'm in an
alleyway
it's March it's already almost a quarter
of the way through 2018 and I hope
you're having a great weekend
so topic of this video I just wanted to
hang out and talk about something that
not many people talk about and that's
gonna be hard tough difficult times with
software development a lot of people are
little infatuated they think it's very
glamorous so sexy from the outside but
actually there's a lot of tough parts
and not many people talk about that so
this video I have three my top three
difficult tough parts of software
development it's gonna be technical debt
dealing with other people's egos and
staying motivated alright three
different points we're just gonna talk
through them let's do it
alright let's kick off the video first
thing to talk about first tough part of
software development is dealing with
technical debt you might have an
inclination of what technical debt
really means but by the time we're done
talking about all these examples you
should have a really good feeling of why
it's so difficult to manage sometimes so
I have five these are my top five root
causes of how technical debt is
generated there's probably fifty
hundreds thousands of ways these could
happen but these are my top five so
first one first one is pretty easy this
is just gonna be tight tight deadlines
so this is your boss coming into your
cubicle saying hey you need the future
done by today or by this week or by this
month and based on the deadline you're
probably gonna take some shortcuts
introduce some hacks and do some things
really quick that you wouldn't do if you
had more time so tight tight deadlines
is the first most common cause of
second second most common cause of
technical debt is gonna be developer
adjourned remember that a codebase
always lives much longer than a
developer does for one given kilobase
there's probably hundreds maybe even
thousands of developers many who don't
even work in the company anymore that
have contributed to that codebase so
pretend II just jump into some code I
bet somebody had created it five years
ago they're not at the company anymore
maybe you work on it for two years and
then you leave a company someone else
takes it on think about the codebase for
Twitter think about how many different X
Twitter employees have worked on it so
the reason why this causes a lot of tech
debt is that there's constantly churn
different implementations not consistent
patterns tons of people touching the
same exact system so obviously there's
gonna be some problems third third major
cause of technical debt is going to be
business requirement changes this
happened to me a lot at my old company
in California but there's one project we
worked on for two months wrote a lot of
code and right when we were just testing
everybody was getting together to test
this project they just cancelled it
somebody is something executives sitting
in a chair somewhere just cancel it so
this is another cause of technical debt
because many times you might work very
hard develop a lot of code change the
system to meet this business requirement
and then all of a sudden a business
requirement changes and there's not much
you can do about it and then you have
all this stale stuff sitting fourth
fourth cause of technical debt is gonna
be something that you can't really
control but this is when other libraries
become deprecated and sometimes you
can't really control this right right
now react is the hot thing but you don't
know in five years if the react is still
gonna be the hot thing in ten years or
five years ago react definitely wasn't
even relevant so I have a good example
of this in my current company but when
the product was first implemented they
used this cool front-end framework from
Yahoo called Yui but obviously we know
Yahoo status right Yahoo is irrelevant
anymore but obviously there's still all
this code that uses Yahoo libraries that
nobody can even touch anymore
Yahoo doesn't even touch
so many times technical debt is created
when it's beyond your control something
that you're using just dies and then
it's just sitting there so it sucks all
right this is the fifth fifth and last
point about how technical debt is
generated this is unfortunate but very
true this is just from bad coders
alright so obviously when I was an
intern I was working on some features
and I wrote some pretty terrible code
back then I don't know if any any of it
is still active but if the features in
code I wrote as an intern I know that
code was bad I know it was all bad but
that's probably technical debt for
someone else to clean up so at different
stages in your career or even right now
you're gonna be working alongside some
bad coders maybe right now you are the
bad coder and you're creating all this
technical debt but remember all
different coders are at different levels
and you can't just have some guru
implementing everything right there's
going to be some beginners doing some of
the work and those beginners aren't
gonna do as good of a job as somebody
more seniors so I know I created a lot
of technical debt when I was first
starting and now it's probably someone
else's problem
alright that's more than enough
information about technical debt
sometimes it's very hard to manage it's
a headache it can cost a business money
it can cause you sleep sometimes it's
just painful you can like bang your head
on a desk but that's a tough part of
software development that people don't
realize people think you can just go in
there and code away and make all this
new amazing things but very often you're
just dealing with this debt that's
accumulated over many many years and you
just got to deal with it alright so
let's move away from the technical part
a little bit I start talking about
dealing with other people's
I think this is particularly relevant
for software just because the nature of
the work is very subjective right
there's a million ways to do a single
thing so a lot of people that aren't
coding 24 hours a day or they're just
looking at it from the outside they
don't really realize how subjective
software development is it isn't just
like a to-do list of 10 things and once
you're done the 10 things you get done
you're done with your day right it's a
very very subjective a thousand ways to
do one thing and that's across the whole
spectrum from the language you choose to
the frameworks you like people are like
Java stinks rubies the best or Java is
the only way to go I love react and then
other people hate react you know it's so
many so many different opinions it's
just objective and what that lends
itself towards is just a ton of opinions
so a major part of software development
is you just got a deal with cons of
different opinions for different people
and some people are gonna be a little
more aggressive with their opinions and
this is highly highly underestimated a
lot of people think software developer
is a simple job in terms of dealing with
people but actually the toughest part of
it is just dealing with all these
different egos and you know angry
developers
last part last part I want to talk about
with software's staying motivated so
this is like a cookie cutter thing I
could say about any job but even if you
think writing software developing code
is super super sexy if you're not
motivated about the work it's irrelevant
right so one really good example I have
is a lot of my friends that work at
agencies experienced demotivation very
quickly because at different agencies
their contracts are one year or two
years so they're jumping from project to
project to project very very quickly
just half a year maybe sometimes but
they're always jumping from project to
project and they're in different color
bases all the time so they don't have
much attachment to their work it's not
their work they're just producing
something for client and then a
different client so we can make a
laundry list of how you would be
demotivated but it happens very very
often right software is just like any
other job it's not just fairy tale
coding you could be motivated because
your boss is a terrible person your team
is bad you're not making enough money
your company is doing terrible the
products terrible but there's so many
reasons you could potentially become
demotivated and it's gonna happen so you
can't just think of software as a super
sexy thing because you can write
software itself you're naturally gonna
become demotivated by external factors
all right I'm gonna wrap up the video
here guys but there's a lot of difficult
tough parts with software development I
think the way it's advertised is that
it's super super sexy super super fun
and writing code is amazing you make a
ton of money but there's a lot of
difficult parts with it so there's I
could list 10 but these are my top three
so let's just recap the real quick
remember technical debt always
accumulates every single codebase every
single company has technical debt and
sometimes it gets so bad you bang your
head on the wall second you got to deal
with a ton of egos because software so
some
active right everybody loves different
things you got to deal with some angry
people third and finally is staying
motivated software-development is just
like any other job and you will become
demotivated at times and there won't be
anything you can do about it so just
remember these things they're pretty
standard things but for some reason not
many people talk about the hard parts of
it they just talk about they try to sell
it to you they try to tell you how
awesome it is to be a developer but
often you know developers don't like
their jobs too so hope this video was
helpful please ask me any questions give
me a like give me a thumbs up share the
video and I'll catch everyone next time
alright take it easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
