had a great week and you're all enjoying
your weekend this video I wanted to make
it short and sweet and talked about HTTP
I'm sure a lot of you have heard about
this word before hypertext Transfer
Protocol it's kind of the backbone it is
the backbone of the Internet I wanted to
make this video first because actually
understanding HTTP and just the basics
of how it works is really the
prerequisites and like the foundation to
understand a lot of more complicated
internet and web things alright so this
video I wrote down six important just
basic points about this protocol HTTP
we're going to talk through all six
points run through them and hope it's
useful all right guys let's do it first
point most basic point is that HTTP
follows the standard client-server model
or request response model so I often use
kitchens I always use kitchens as my
analogies because I don't know it's
really convenient but we've talked about
this before basic client-server model
you're a person going to eat at a
kitchen your client in the kitchen is
responding to your request so you go in
I want a Big Mac the kitchen goes
alright here's the Big Mac so the web
browser you're using right now to watch
this video or any web browser that's
running on your mobile phones those are
the clients - HTTP and the servers for
HTTP are all those web applications like
YouTube Facebook that are sitting on the
cloud owned by different companies and
just on the Internet
alright so point number one really basic
client-server model and that's what HTTP
follows the second really important
thing to understand about HTTP is that
it's a stateless protocol and what do we
mean by stateless what stateless kind of
means is that every single transaction
you make through HTTP is independent and
it's not related to any other
transactions so let's just take a couple
analogies like flipping a coin
a coin is stateless right heads heads
heads tails tails just because you got
heads five times doesn't mean you
couldn't get it with the same
probability the next time right flipping
a coin is stateless so even though HTTP
is kind of a stateless protocol you'll
see that a lot of web applications still
track your state somehow right and they
do this via these things called sessions
cookies and a lot of kind of stateful
management of how web applications work
with all their clients but that's for
another video
all right so even though HTTP itself is
stateless you still get the
functionality of State through other
mechanisms so remember that the third
important point about HTTP is that it's
an application layer protocol and it
sits on top of a transport layer
protocol 99.9% of the case HTTP uses TCP
as its transport level protocol so if
the transport layer if the transport
layer is here the application layer is a
little above it all right in the stack
of things we can't get into the details
of TCP in this video but what it really
does is it defines how data is sent from
one place to the other how the data is
formatted how the packets are sent you
know how do you acknowledge things it's
kind of dictating the actual transport
or the communication of the data itself
that's what TCP does HTTP sits above
that on the stack right so from HTTP
perspective it doesn't care about how
the data is sent those are details it
doesn't care about all it cares about is
I request a web page on it get some data
back I request that web page on it get
some data back so it never cares about
all those little details that TCP
handles so HTTP up here TCP right below
it all right on to the fourth thing
fourth important thing about this
protocol is that whenever the client
requests something from the server it
always specifies a special action or
method along with it if you're a
developer watching this video before I'm
sure you've heard of all these different
methods
our actions get post delete but these
are all special actions to be performed
by the server get is really simple I
just want to get a page read a page
alright it's always read-only I want to
get a resource post post this you're
creating something new so you're
creating a new item in your shopping
cart or you're creating a new friend and
Facebook but post is always for creating
a new object and delete self-explanatory
fifth most important thing about HTTP is
that it defines response status codes
that the server's make back to the
clients I'm sure many of you have
encountered some of these before 200
means a ok 404 means not found 500 means
you effed up but if you look at the
documentation for HTTP there's so
there's a lot of these numbers defining
what all the different status codes
means but what's really difficult is
that it's actually up to the programmer
to return the proper status codes and
more often than not you don't really
return the proper status code many times
okay so the sixth and last point last
core thing to understand about HTTP is
that it supports these things called
headers all a header is it's really
simple all headers are are tiny bits of
custom information that you send along
with your request and with your
responses the main purpose of headers
and all this custom little bits of
information is to kind of tweak the
operation of the request so let me just
give a few examples to hopefully make it
more clear one header that you can
include in the request side of things is
the content type of the data that's
returned so you could say I want a text
file or I want an XML file or I want a
JSON file but it's up to the client to
be like I'm gonna I want some data but I
actually want to choose what type or the
format of the data I want to get back so
it's going to send a special header to
be like I want it
a text file and the server is going to
recognize that and respond with a text
file so what we just talked about was
actually a header that the client uses
on the requesting side when they request
stuff from the server but on the flip
side of that when the server comes back
with its response it can also include
custom headers one really cool header
that's returned from the server is
something called cache control and this
is a really really cool optimization
technique of the internet and actually
kind of determines how all these
different resources are cached by all
the different clients that are using
them all right guys so those are just
two quick examples of headers the first
core thing that you have to remember
always about headers is that headers are
included both in the request side and
the response side so you can include
headers in both directions
the next thing to remember about headers
is that there's no standard rule book
about headers all right there are a
certain there are a lot of them that are
kind of well-defined like cache control
content type the ones that we talked
about those are well-defined headers but
actually you can send whatever custom
information you want you could send a
specific header that works just for your
website and it's just there are no rules
so if you ever look at some of the
requests and responses that are going
across the network there's all these
random headers sometimes and sometimes
they're really application specific
alright so there's no rule book for this
all right guys that was six six
important things about HTTP that I just
wanted to share with everyone first as I
said in the beginning of this video
understanding this protocol it's still a
really basic thing but to really
understand how the internet works how
web application works how people hack
stuff how people do security you have to
understand HTTP first and that's why I
made this video first and it's going to
serve as a good foundation for future
videos when we talk about more advanced
things all right so hope you enjoy the
video please leave a comment like the
video subscribe all that stuff thank you
again and thank you for your time I'll
catch everyone next week all right take
care
