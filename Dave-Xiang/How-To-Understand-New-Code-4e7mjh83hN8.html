really well got a really great question
last week about how to approach an
unknown or really big codebase and I
thought this question was really awesome
because this is one of the things you'll
do over and over again new team new
project if you join a new company
there's always this like big codebase
waiting for you that you're expected to
understand alright so it might seem a
little daunting but it's really not
you know there's big piles of code
anywhere as long as you can break down
the steps you should be able to approach
any unknown piece of code alright so in
this video I just broke down kind of
like six six main categories of what I
think is really important to
understanding a new project or new code
whatever we're gonna go through all six
of these categories hope it makes sense
and let's just start alright alright the
first thing we have to talk about before
even getting into the code whatsoever is
the environment or the environment setup
alright so there are a couple important
points to consider for this environment
first you should at least be using the
same kind of system as the rest of the
team right either Mac Ubuntu cent fedora
windows that should at least be the same
for the entire team if everyone else is
using like cent OS and you're like oh I
just want to use Ubuntu because that's
what I like then that's not a good
decision on your part alright so at the
very least on the system level everyone
should be on the same page right we're
using fedora whatever release so that's
the system part now for any computer
this is kind of like the operating
system you're running on it should be
the same for every developer but then on
top of the operating system you have
different projects that different people
are working on right so like system
level environment right here and in
project environment right above it
project environment is usually a little
easier to manage because much of the
environment involved to kind of work on
a project if it's done well it should be
encapsulated inside that project right
you pull that project down and there's
some kind of configuration in there that
kind of sets a lot of stuff up for you
so project level is kind of
straightforward because if the project
set up well is just gonna a lot of that
dependency is going to be stated
dictated for you where things get a
little tricky is how people customize
their computer system and that's where
things get a little crazy in the
environment so let's do a couple
examples like if you guys use Linux
before I'm sure you use many different
package managers package managers are
like software to let you install other
software all right and each one doesn't
a little differently so at the very
least everyone should be using the same
package manager
like we're using sent OS and we're using
this specific package manager the other
thing that's really crazy about a system
is that it's highly customizable right
you have your computer nothing is
stopping you from totally customizing
your computer with whatever you want you
could upgrade that software package
there upgrade that library there it's
kind of like a free-for-all
so this is where things get a little
crazy in the environment and there's
kind of - there's like a spectrum of how
you can customize the system one is like
a really strict system set up and on the
other side is a really flexible system
set up so let's just give an example one
job I work that we were given like a set
image for development it like it was
like sent OS 6.3 and it had all the
packages supposedly all the packages we
need for development and we weren't
allowed to customize anything it was
highly frowned upon to do any kind of
customization so it was like start job
here's your computer install this image
and this is the image you have to use it
has everything so that's a very strict
style of development but it's actually
very safe because everybody is given the
same exact image right the flip side of
that if things
are really flexible it just gets a
little crazy because if you customize
your libraries just a little bit let's
say you upgrade all your libraries
because you just want to but the rest of
your team doesn't and if you upgrade
those libraries introduce some
dependencies along with those upgrades
and you essentially kind of disrupt the
whole environment for everyone else by
being so flexible so but people want to
be flexible too so it's kind of like
this spectrum of how you set up a system
there's got to be like a healthy medium
between the two all right so that's
enough talk about how to set up your
actual computer yourself let's move on
to the next one all right so the next
step in understanding the code is to go
through the build process and once your
environment is set up you've now pulled
the code down so you have the code on
your computer now you got this now you
got to get this thing up and running so
I say there's two passes at this right
the first pass is real easy maybe
somebody can help you but once you get
that code pull down just get it up and
running whatever it takes even if you
don't quite understand all the details
just get this code in and build it so
you can actually see something like if
it's a web server or web app you just
see it running locally right if it's
like a system library it should compile
to completion so first thing it to do is
just get that baseline set up all right
but obviously that's not good enough of
course you got to take into a deeper
level and the next level of this I would
highly recommend that you do your best
to understand the build process as much
as you can all the different nuances all
right so this is such a general thing
like there's so many software projects
out there I can't really speak to all
them but I'm just saying build process
to capture like the whole build process
there's like so many different steps
different nuances different ways to
track the appendices it's just craziness
right but whatever that craziness is try
your best to understand
those little intricacies because it's
going to help you like really control
that project a lot so just kind of sift
through the code what's the software
managing dependencies what are all the
steps it takes like how does it make
that file how does it compile that thing
just go through all the details as best
you can last point I have is that this
building is different across many
projects but one thing that's universal
is that it always has a final kind of
output all right what do I mean by
output but some people call these
artifacts but it's kind of like the
final results of a build system so if
you're developing a system library the
final output is like the final binaries
that you might ship to a customer all
right if you're building this crazy java
web application it could be that final
zipped up java file that you want to
distribute out so understand all the
different details of the steps of the
build process and then also understand
what does the build process produce in
the end right across all the different
software projects there's always a final
result and you got to figure out all the
different little steps it takes to get
to that final result all right and the
more you understand the building the
better a third category of the system is
started to get into the nitty-gritty
details and this is like code and
debugging and for this step is when you
really start to understand the source
code so let's get into this first when
you first open up a new project I
guarantee you will not understand like
90% of what's going on there will be so
many different files you know it's gonna
be crazy and daunting but you shouldn't
try to understand all the files one by
one that's not how you should go about
it you should do that a little later
when you have a better grasp of like the
flow of whatever application it is but
don't just look at source files first
alright one thing that I like doing and
I think it works pretty well is that
understand the code through debugging
and what do I mean by but you can just
use the debugger to help you
right if you're using Ruby use by bug or
use PDB for the PDB I forget Python
debugger or gdb for C but anyways try to
find a basic use case of the application
and put in a breakpoint just put in a
breakpoint somewhere so you can step
through the code and see what's
happening and let me just give you some
examples but you know if you're
developing like the command line
application just put in a breakpoint
inside the main function or something
and just run the program you'll see the
program hit and just start stepping
through slowly and see where all the
code goes all the code goes right this
is essentially debugging but you're
actually not debugging anything right
there's no bug to debug you're just
using debugging to help you understand
the flow of the code so set up a
breakpoint and hit it and then once you
hit that breakpoint once just hit it a
hundred more times and just really
understand how the code is flowing so
breakpoint hits you know checks these
logic goes to that function okay that
function uses this other function keeps
progressing and gets the output and the
first one is definitely going to be real
hard but you know do your first use case
debug through your first use case then
your second one it's gonna be easier
third fourth fifth and before you know
it you're gonna understand all the
source code alright so that's how to
understand all the source code in a very
practical way without just reading
through files alright guys halfway done
we just did three categories
environments building and source code
debugging and we have three more
categories to go alright
so fourth category that I want to put
out there is understanding the testing
and this is actually really important
because if the project's done pretty
well there will be some kind of test
structure in place to test the library
or test the web app or all that stuff so
it's gonna be really good this is kind
of the same mentality as understanding
the build process but try your best to
understand the testing project and every
single different software code base is
going to be tested a different way so
just a couple things that are commonly
used in testing you know there's always
some kind of like scaffolding that's set
up so scaffolding is kind of like these
helpers to set up an environment for you
to test right let's say you're testing
this web application there could be some
like scaffolds the set of a test
database for use test database to use so
you could like test out all these
different things there's going to be
probably like test factories to like
create these dummy models for you to use
there's also gonna be like mocking if
your web application uses a lot of
third-party services and it can't really
like hit all the third-party services
for real in a test environment so it's
mocked or like faked in a different way
too so like you know scaffolding like
test dummy models mocking those are all
just a couple few examples of many many
different ways to do testing but the
mentality here is just the same right
it's really good just to understand how
the project is tested no no not only so
you can write tests yourself but also
force you to understand what this stuff
is actually doing you would get the
tests aren't gonna read very well
usually tests are kind of like a
free-for-all but just at a basic level
understand the structure of the test
environment all right so that's testing
pretty straightforward spend some time
there let's go on to the fifth one fifth
thing to understand for any single
software project is going to be
deployment so let's just remember let's
take it where we left it off at building
all right no matter what software
project you're working on there's going
to be an end result to the build process
now you like done all your homework you
understand all the nuances of the build
and remember it all has a final product
or the artifacts so once those artifacts
are created they need to go somewhere
right if you're building a web
application has got to be deployed onto
a server somewhere if you're building
like a system library it's got to be
packaged up and
maybe pushed up to some online
repository but whatever it is there's a
final product and then there's a
deployment phase whatever that
deployment might be so step number five
it's like understanding the deployment
and what that means sorry I repeated
that word too many times but if the
project is kind of structured really
well there's going to be something in
place called continuous integration and
deployment so every time a project is
successfully built it gets deployed
somewhere so you have to understand how
that deployment happens right because
it's not just like you copy a file it's
actually very very detailed you might
have to like copy this project onto this
computer somewhere run restart a couple
processes on the computer do some setup
but this is also like a very very
important part of the whole project
right because deploying your project is
also part of the development so try your
best to understand how that project gets
out there for the end-user and it's only
going to help you all right guys last
but not least this is the sixth and
final category that I have for
understanding any codebase and at this
point if you did the first five steps
pretty well you have a really good
understanding of one project right you
can build it you can debug it you know
how the source code works you know how
to test it you know how to deploy bit
you know how to deploy it the last step
to understanding the codebase is that
you have to understand the other
projects that depends upon right so if
you're working in a professional setting
it's a very very rare that there's just
one application or one project going on
there's actually more likely many many
different applications being built many
different code bases going on at the
same time all right so and every single
application has some kind of
dependencies with its neighboring
applications all right so your
application is here right you know how
to build one very well but it might be
using many different things it's using
some third-party services like Facebook
login but it's actually also using
other applications in your system so
this last part is understanding how your
app interacts with other apps aside I
kind of call it like neighboring
applications like neighbors right so I
have my application maybe the team over
in Europe is working on this different
application that you depend upon so
you're always talking with them to like
figure out how to communicate so the
last step is not only understanding the
codebase you're working on but
understanding how it interacts with
other applications around it all right
and once you get to that level once
you're at that level that's starting to
get into the whole system level but then
you will really really understand how
all the software is working for the
whole company not just for one project
all right so that was the last step all
right guys that's six main categories
for understanding any unknown codebase
I'm gonna leave the categories right
here I remember the first time I did
this it was just really crazy to
understand and especially if this is
like your first job your first unknown
codebase this is going to be pretty hard
and take you more time but as you start
kind of interacting with newer and newer
random code bases you'll just get the
hang of this a little bit more alright
so hope this helps if you're looking at
any new project good luck to you just
like break it down just like break down
all the different things you need to
understand and just hit it one at a time
and it'll just be cumulative right at
first you understand nothing but after
the first thing you get the second one
is easier the third one's easier and
just and before you know it you just can
develop and write code all day so that's
it for this week guys hope you enjoyed
the video please send me a comment or an
email click like and I hope everyone has
a great rest of the week all right take
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
