different video this week but I decided
to do a screencast to let everyone kind
of peek inside my computer a little bit
a lot of people have asked what life is
like for a software developer and aside
from filming someone code for like 48
hours off I thought it'd be pretty cool
to just you know look inside my desktop
this is my actual computer right now and
just see some of my workflow things if
you're a developer I'm gonna go over a
couple of productivity tips and tricks
or maybe like workflow hacks that I use
very often if you're not a developer or
engineer this video might be completely
irrelevant to you so you can always stop
it right now and this isn't gonna be a
tutorial or anything this is just gonna
be me showing you guys a little bit
about inside my computer all right can I
just realize that this is super live so
there's no editing alright so this just
gets started with these tips alright
first thing to do is that anything that
you do frequently you must have hotkeys
so what I'm doing right now is switching
between my desktops minimizing some
windows
you could also show your desktop but
long story short here is that anything
that you do very often you should have
it always hockey because it just saves
to the milliseconds like all those
milliseconds count right so another
thing to do is you can hockey
applications as well as hockey your
operating systems so these are like
changing the windows also in chrome you
should memorize all these hotkeys and go
to them appropriately so just make sure
you memorize hockey's for applications
as well as hotkeys for your computer the
next thing to do is that everyone should
invest in the windowing management tool
I have a Mac so I use this thing called
better snap tool and pretty much what it
does it helps you manage your windows
better so a lot of the times developers
have many windows open all the time and
what this kind of allows you to do is
just to do whatever you want with these
windows you could put them in the top
left you know bottom or right you could
like you could make these things left
right you could maximize it
I guess the main thing here is that what
you want to do here is save yourself
time by not trying to drag and resize
these windows all day if you want to
move this windows to a certain location
all you have to do is hotkey it and you
can move it to the left side or the
right side or keep it up in the corner
alright so everyone should invest in
window management tool and I have better
snap tool which seems to do the job
another trick that I think would be cool
is that every developer I hope you're
using the terminal very often or using
some kind of command-line tools I use
bash you might use different shell
environments but Bash is just the one I
use my one major recommendation I have
here is that whoops are that's what I
get for no editing but any command-line
tools that you have you should be able
to customize it very well so this is my
bash RC file which makes a bunch of
aliases and customizations to my bash
environment so I have a bunch of aliases
here I have a bunch of helper functions
for random day-to-day tasks like fine
PID finds a process ID it can extract it
from files and sets of various
environmental variables assess the
various functions like parsing out my
git branch so if you use bash or
whatever you're using just make sure and
take some time read into these
configuration files and set up whatever
you think works for you because it's
gonna save you a lot of time even if it
saves you typing less characters it's
gonna help alright and also similarly we
have or I have a different one for git
so if you use git guess a source control
tool and I have a bunch of aliases for
my git environment pretty much what it
does this combines commands so I type
less and just overall helps my workflow
so you don't have to look at a text too
much it's not important but the major
thing I want to show you guys here is
that whatever tools you're using figure
out how they're configured and do your
best and make them a little more
efficient for you alright
okay my last point for the software
developer tips is that everyone should
invest in some proper and even paid for
software development tools whatever it
might be so right here this is a sublime
text too and I've been using this you
know for a while it's pretty good but
pretty much what this lets you do is
like even if this tool cost me fifty or
sixty or hundred dollars to buy you
should invest in some of these tools to
make your lives a lot easier this is
just a random project I've opened up
here but you don't be opening up random
text files or using notepad plus plus to
view these things just invest in a good
text editor or IDE customize it and it's
just going to make your lives a lot
easier
alright what's another one I have this
is another tool I like this is called
post to go I think it cost maybe a
hundred dollars but pretty much what
this allows me to do is save a bunch of
connections to various Postgres
databases that I work with very often
from production staging into local
environments so if I want to just
connect to a database that saves all the
info for me you can go inside each one
and see the schema see the rows you can
check out indices that you've made to
make sure it's all proper all in all
this is just a really cool tool and the
alternative to this is potentially doing
this on the command line the major point
I just want to show everyone is that
invest in some tools like these because
there's developers out there that all
they do is build these tools to help our
lives so other people in the world are
making these tools to make our lives
easier and we should use these tools you
know because it definitely helps a lot
this is just one that I used to check
out the database every now and then and
I need a new version of it all right all
right guys I hope this video doesn't get
too long I'm not even sure how it's
going to be received but it's just
something to do I'm trying if you like
this video just let me know if you have
any ideas for maybe more screencasts I'd
be help I'd be happy to do some more
screencast of my computer for any
developers out there I just hope some of
these tips and tricks were helpful all
in all it's just make your environment
as
efficient as possible all right hope you
guys liked the video and I'll see you
guys next time all right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
