had great weeks enjoyed yourself worked
hard and Dolch din something but topic
of this week's video completely
non-technical this is non technical in
its entirety but we're gonna talk about
the meaning of software and life before
we get into it wanted to make a couple
quick announcements I really really care
about this YouTube channel everyone
that's watching thank you very much for
your time and I appreciate all the kind
words I'm trying my best to do at least
one video a week as consistently as
possible but there's some weekends that
it's just really hard for me to make a
video and I'm getting a little more
caught up recently
so last week I missed one weekend's
video next week I'm traveling so I'm
gonna miss that week's video but just
want to let everyone know that I really
care about this channel all of you guys
and I'm trying my best to do videos
consistently next quick announcement
just wants to make the people at code
addicts were nice enough to send me this
free t-shirt not getting paid whatsoever
to wear this t-shirt just thought it was
a cool t-shirt and I also loved Stack
Overflow and Star Wars so they were nice
enough to send me the free t-shirt they
also send a discount code I'll put a
link to their website but this is not a
sponsored video at all just giving them
a quick shoutout because it's a cool
t-shirt alright that's it for the
announcements and let's just get
straight into the video there's a lot of
people right now even the media just
people talking about it but they're
making software sound a little more sexy
than it really is and don't get me wrong
I do software that's what I do almost
every single day that's what I plan to
do for the near future and I don't want
to dismiss it in any way but I do
believe it's being hyped a little too
much I just want to put it back into
perspective so the purpose of this video
is just to provide in my opinion a
really practical in general and just you
know realistic perspective of software
without so much glamour and alright it's
not going to empower your life make you
amazing you know software is software
it's like a job right so we just want to
talk about it from a very
practical perspective and that's the
purpose of this video all right so I
have four major points we're going to
talk through today hopefully they're
helpful and let's do it
point number one let's just talk about
the big picture purpose what is the
whole point behind writing software and
why do people do it
there are a ton of different software
developer jobs out there job types types
of developers there's infinite
possibilities I tried my best to just
put it under three major categories the
first category is pretty easy as what
most people do is you write software to
make money for a business write your
software you're working at a company
it's going to a product or service that
is gonna you're gonna sell or give to
someone that's probably the most common
type of software second software could
be used for more academic purposes think
about researchers that work at
universities or establishments at big
companies research establishments money
is not really an issue and they're
writing software working on tech to push
the envelope
for discovery and third last but not
least is just using software to make a
world a better place so I just listed
everything right I just literally these
three things probably capture everything
under the Sun and why would that even be
helpful but the major point that I want
to bring for this this part of the video
is that the reason why people write
software is not for a technical reason
it's always for a human reason let's
just take a couple quick examples all
right if you ever met an entrepreneur or
someone starting a company they're not
really passionate about the software
software they're passionate about their
company and they're using software to
get to their end goal right if you're
passionate about gaming you love video
games
you're gonna write software to make a
game if you're really charitable you
might use software to help developing
countries none of us very very few of us
write pure software because we just love
looking at lines of code there's always
something more human driving every
in any position all right so that's the
main point
Oh point number one and that's kind of
like the underlying reason why everyone
toils and spends their time writing code
there's always a human reason because
we're all human
point number two point number two that I
want to talk about is why this software
so hard the major reason why it's so
hard is because it's so so subjective
there's a billion possible things to do
and there's a billion ways to do it
right so billion times a billion things
it's just too many things it's like
overload sometimes one important point I
want to address is that many people get
very upset when we label software
developers as engineers a lot of people
don't think software development is real
engineering and I'm gonna explain why I
use these words interchangeably I don't
really care I think the word engineer
now is pretty much you can refer to a
software developer as an engineer it's
not the purest definition but these days
all the big companies do it you know I
have looked at the titles of all the big
companies is and everyone uses the word
engineer so personally I interchange
those words I really don't think it's a
big deal and if it really bothers you
that's too bad but for everyone else I'm
gonna explain why some people get upset
about this an engineer the conventional
definition of an engineer is someone who
can implement and build something with a
very specific goal and specification
think about an engineer that works on an
engine for a car or an engine for a
rocket right they have to there's
certain laws of physics and they have to
abide to science and really build
something that just works I can send a
rocket into space or you can think about
architecture think about the engineers
that work with architects a bridge has
to support a certain amount of weight it
has to allow wind to pass through the
tunnels all very specific things that
must be accomplished I hope you guys are
getting the
with these examples but that's kind of
like what pure engineering is it's very
well specified and there's usually like
tight patterns to do something right you
have a blueprint to build a building and
engineers are gonna build it so let's
come back to our original question the
original question we had was why do some
people not like calling software
developers engineers well the main
reason behind this is that software
development is so so so subjective it's
not like pure engineering where there's
really physics science rules of the
universe to follow engineering in the
software land is completely completely
subjective right there's a billion ways
to do things for all of you guys you and
me who are in software we know how much
it changes and it's flux right
throughout the lifespan of a project the
requirements are always changing they're
always changing and then how you
implement it is also always change it's
not like we have a blueprint to building
and we'll just get it done in two years
but software is insanely flexible and
that's why it's a little different from
pure engineering science these names are
interchangeable for me I will call
software developers engineers I don't
really care I think these days is widely
accepted but there is a kind of
difference in what pure engineering is
and software development software
development is so so very subjective and
there's so many billions of ways to do
things in software that many people
don't consider it real engineering next
I want to talk about what makes software
enjoyable and then after we're done this
section we're going to talk about what
makes software a pain in the ass all
right but for now we're gonna stay happy
and talk about why do people like doing
this
as always I'm gonna try to just break
this down into two simple categories but
first is really easy if you're working
on something you actually care about
it's going to be enjoyable if you really
care about education and you're working
on the next generation education
technology platform it's going to be
enjoyable for you because you care
second way that makes it enjoyable is
that the software and coding environment
you're in is actually very pleasant so
what do we mean by that if you're
working in a well thought-out codebase
its maintained by people who care people
follow patterns nothing is so insane so
if you're actually working in a coding
environment that's nice comfortable then
that's also something that makes
software very enjoyable obviously this
is much easier said than done right
because if you've seen enough software
projects you know that there's just like
shitty code everywhere and it's a very
very rare when you're like oh wow that
was written really well it all comes
down to really just one thing if the
project code base or system whatever if
you're working in some environment the
one way that it's enjoyable is that it's
written by people who actually care but
the code that's all it comes down to all
right if people that write and maintain
the code base actually care about it
it's gonna be a good place to work and
once people stop caring it's going to be
fourth and last section I'm saving the
negative section for last but this is
when software development is a pain in
the ass so similar to what we just
talked about just reverse it whereas
it's really enjoyable to work in an
environment where people care about the
code and things are nice but there's
also many times where you're in a very
very terrible environment and this is
when you're scared of making changes
nothing is familiar you don't really
know how anything works things are
encapsulated way too much the interfaces
really suck there's insane dependencies
flying around and you're scared like
you're literally scared of making any
changes I think out of all the measures
of bad software or bad environment comes
down to if you're really scared of
making a change when you're working in
an environment you should have control
over you should be very comfortable in
it and just know how to change something
you should know how to add a future if
you're working in a project and you're
actually scared of doing things you just
don't know what's going on that's the
sign
of a pretty bad software project so
remember there's two kind of parties
involved in software first you have your
users or your consumers or the people
that receive your software right that's
pretty much very easy very easy to scale
that's the whole point of software you
write software once you deploy it to
billions of people with a click of a
button on the flip side of the users you
have the whole group of developers and
sometimes the developers don't scale
this actually happened at Qualcomm very
often right Qualcomm had a bunch of
different customers like they had all
these different customers Apple Samsung
HTC you know blackberry all these
different customers instead of making
their software design smart and be able
to like scale or at least replicate
itself all they did was literally
duplicate teams per product line so it's
like software development team for Apple
software development team for Samsung
it's just it was not a scalable
operation inside the development this is
another way that environments can get
kind of bad is when companies they don't
really fix the core problem which is
software design software patterns they
just throw people and money at a
solution right and these days there's so
many developers out there it's easy to
just hire a team of 20 new developers
for your product but obviously they're
not going to be really high quality
developers the last point I wanted to
talk about for this section where the
not-so-good section I just wanted to
talk about a little bit more about the
human aspect of software all right and
this has been in the news recently but
as you guys know the software community
or environment or whatever it's
extremely sexism elitism and ageism
unfortunately you would like to believe
that it's not true but you know to be
completely honest with ourselves that
stuff is completely true no women
engineers are looked down upon if you're
over 40 you're useless
there's elite people that you know live
in Silicon Valley and go to Ivy League
schools but this stuff is just rampant
rampant in the community there's no
catch-all solution to solve problems
like this we can acknowledge those
problems that's the first step to do but
how do we actually solve those crazy
human problems behind software I can
think about that for another video but
the one thing that I wanted mention for
this video is that the one thing you can
do to you know protect yourself and all
this is that you still ultimately have
the control over who you work with and
where you work even two teams in the
same company could be very different you
know every company is different teams
inside the company are all different but
at the end of the day it's you who's
making a job decision right at the end
of the day you go out interview get
offers and you will make your own
decision of where you want to work the
best thing to do to protect yourself
against some of this human stuff like
this crazy
uber sexual harassment is that when you
meet the people you're going to work
with for the first time do your best
to check their integrity and their
character and their transparency alright
and this should just kind of be a gut
feeling for you but it's actually the
only thing you can control whatever
decision you use whatever job you take
just measure like does this person have
good integrity and hopefully if you take
time to actually think about those
thoughts you're not gonna put yourself
into a really shitty software
environment where everyone is like an
asshole all right guys to wrap up this
video I just want to say remember the
whole purpose of this video can be
non-technical at all is just kind of
talking through some of my gut feelings
about software these days but the way
media is portraying software development
these days it's like empowering change
your life you know change the world
alright but hopefully this video just
gives a little bit of a more realistic
perspective of what software development
is like and what it really means I know
it's been blowing up there's so much
hype about it so it's easy to think that
like this is your savior or something
but you know
you have to make a decision for yourself
maybe software's for you maybe it's not
for you but don't believe all this hype
oh I hope you enjoyed the video please
leave me a comment like subscribe share
something check out the link for this
cool shirt from code addicts again I
wasn't paid to do that they just were
nice enough to send me this shirt and I
will see everyone next week all right
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
