really really well back to the classic
video format in my apartment just
filming with my good camera but I was
inspired to make this video after
watching a recent TED talk with Elon
Musk so just last month I think end of
April there's a 3040 minute TED talk
interview with Elon Musk and I recommend
everyone who's watching this to go check
that out it's pretty quick and you can
hear a crazy guy get interviewed alright
so he talked about some insane project
he's working on like 3d highway
tunneling system in LA and there's a
bunch of other things he's working on
the guy is really insane I think he's in
mania I really think he's a maniac but
he's also changing the world so all the
power to him after seeing the talk and
hearing about a lot of buzz in the news
recently the thing I wanted to talk
about in this video is the idea that
technology AI and software are going to
replace humans and human jobs and that's
what a lot of people are talking about
recently so I just wanted to take some
time think about it everything in this
video is of course just my opinion but
thinking about the future is always a
little fun right so without further ado
let's just get started the first thing
that I want to just put out there is
that tech replacing jobs will happen
it's just a matter of time
I think 1020 years I believe that
self-driving cars all that stuff is
going to replace a ton of taxi drivers
and it's just a matter of time until
that happens what will those people do
what kind of jobs are available to these
type of people how many people are going
to be replaced so in my opinion the
major problem to solve is not how we
grow the tech or which direction we grow
the tech but it's how society handles
technology coming in and changing things
or disrupting things but I hate that
word so it's how society handles change
when tech has more influence in it
personally I have a very idealistic way
of looking at that problem so let me
just give everyone a background
the first thing we have to understand is
that computers and humans are
fundamentally different and we're good
at different things right computers are
good at crunching a ton of numbers
humans are good at telling stories so
because of this fundamental difference
there's just stuff that computers are
good at and there's just stuff that
humans are good at so there's a
fundamental difference and because of
that difference I don't think it's
really a matter of replacing I don't
think computers can fully replace humans
and humans cannot fully replace
computers but they have to work together
they complement each other and that's
the strongest way to do it so it's not a
matter of only computers are better than
pulling humans or only humans are better
than only computers it's that computers
and humans together are the best so
that's the premise of where I'm coming
from all in all we have no business
doing what computers are good at and we
shouldn't even want to do those kind of
jobs because as humans our time can be
better spent elsewhere let me explain
that imagine you're a cancer doctor
working at a hospital right you just got
hired new doctor or you're a new doctor
at this brand-new Hospital and you have
1,000 new patients each of these
patients has a history of all these MRI
documents that you have to sift through
so as a doctor you could spend three
months looking at tens of thousands of
MRI images or if you give that to a
computer for the computer to process if
you have this smart computer vision
model that's trained to detect cancer
and images the computer could run
through 10,000 images in minutes rather
than months and at least give you a
baseline baseline recommendation of what
to do with those images then has a
doctor you take the baseline and then
you put your human touch on top of it
right but you don't spend three months
looking at images so I think everyone's
getting the gist of where I'm coming at
here but the jobs that will be replaced
I
you think that those are jobs that
humans don't want to do and shouldn't do
in the first place alright so looking at
piles and piles of data sifting through
stuff or just imagine the Chinese
factory worker working on the assembly
line right assembly line repetitive jobs
are perfect examples of jobs that should
be replaced in my opinion I don't think
anybody really enjoys those jobs just
recently there is a story of somebody
bought something from Walmart someone
bought a purse from Walmart and inside
the purse they found like a note asking
for help from a Chinese factory worker
so stuff like that there are certain set
of jobs out there in the world like
factory worker assembly line really
repetitive jobs that I don't believe
humans should do but in some place is so
cheap that they force humans to do
crappy jobs like that but those are
exactly the jobs that computers the
Machine should do so now that we
understand types of jobs that computers
can potentially replace like those
crappy repetitive jobs sifting through
data let's go about it from the other
side
what are jobs that humans have to do and
computers can never replace the one
thing that I truly believe I don't think
computers will ever replace human
consciousness and what I mean by
consciousness is real the biology of how
we're wired so I think this is science
fiction and this will stay science
fiction kind of like iRobot or
terminator computers will never
replicate our consciousness and if that
ever happens if we're ever close to
having that happen I think mother nature
will just you know make this crazy
tsunami and wipe us all out because
that's that's something we shouldn't
even try to replicate consciousness is
being angry being sad feeling connected
to somebody comforting your friends get
a mad at your friends but all of that
stuff is innately
human and computers will not replicate
that stuff so those things will never be
so if many of the jobs that require
highly repetitive tasks are going to be
replaced like if all assembly line jobs
will be replaced we need to create new
jobs that require humans and those are
jobs that require some level of
consciousness and those are artery skips
so this is actually what society has as
a challenge because we have to put more
focus on those human jobs like being a
teacher being a high school counselor
like be a coach of a soccer team the
computer is not going to be the Little
League soccer coach right so those are
the type of jobs we have to put more
value in and it's already those jobs are
scarce these a lot of people don't want
to do for whatever reason like there's
not too many good teachers out there
I've never met I've only met one
therapist my whole life I met a ton of
Engineers kind of you know crazy smart
people but the people that I met who
have dedicated themselves to helping
others not too many of them so this is
very idealistic but for all the jobs
that a computer should do like assembly
line stuff those should be replaced and
to complement that we have to put more
focus on jobs that require a human touch
so the assembly line working loses their
job because a computer now runs the
assembly line but then we train that
assembly worker to maybe be a counselor
or to have one-on-one to help someone
maybe go to a school learn to become a
teacher and that's something only a
human can do so the thing is we have to
switch like switch those jobs and the
jobs that require a lot of human to
human interaction you don't need too
many of them but the thing is we don't
put enough value in them so people don't
want to do them in that first place
let's also just go back to the doctor
example like take our doctor who needs
to work at a new hospital and scroll
through thousands and thousands of
images that's not something a doctor
should spend their time with a doctor
should lead a computer you know make
predictions on 10,000 MRI images and
that's going to free the doctor to have
our time so she can help you know speak
to her patients more get more one-on-one
time with their patients she just spend
all her time doing things that require
her to be human and know no time spent
doing computer things so she should
never screw up through endless data okay
I'm talking way too much I need to bring
this all back wrap this all up but some
of the major points that I think or
major points of this video is that we
are not going to stop technology right
technology is always moving forward
because we have insane people and also
it's just human nature to want to
progress themselves so tech and you know
software and AI and all that stuff it's
going to keep progressing and we're not
we shouldn't try to stop it it's just
going to keep going and society is going
to change as a result of that so the
text is not the challenge but the
challenging part is how society reacts
to that type of change and I think one
of the things we have to do is we have
to put more value into jobs that require
you to be human that's probably just
like you know respect teachers more pay
teachers more make it more of like an
upstanding job like I really I've only
met one therapist my whole life you guys
have probably seen the news so many
shooting so many kind of terrible
incidents a lot of people aren't wired
that well a lot of people need helps a
lot of people just something is going on
up here and to fix that it's really a
human to human interaction like the fix
crazy problems up here you need that you
need people you need consciousness you
need like social stuff so I think we
have to put more value into that and
funnel more people into those jobs
people shouldn't be working on an
assembly line people should be trained
to be therapists so they can just help
someone overall people shouldn't do
things that computers are good at
computers should never do things people
are good at we're inherently
complimentary people work with computers
and that's the best combination so it's
not a matter of replacement it's just a
matter of working together all right
