really really well it's super hot this
weekend I hope everyone is enjoying the
summer it's kicking into gear but I'm
just chilling in my apartment today it's
too hot to go outside I was
brainstorming a script for the video so
just going to do this video with a good
camera don't have to go outside and
sweat too much but basic video today and
the topic I want to cover I was thinking
about is all related to software trends
and keeping up with those trends alright
let's do it the audience for this video
is anyone who's very stressed out and
not just any kind of stress this is a
very very particular kind of stress but
this is the stress any software
developer or any technologist would feel
when they're trying to keep up to date
with the latest and greatest
technologies alright so I worry about
this a lot some days I worry about this
a lot more some days I don't care so
much about it or I forget about it but
keeping up with the trends is something
that every single person in software
thinks about and if you're watching and
you stress out about this just make just
be sure that you're not alone in this I
think about this a lot everyone thinks
about this a lot and it's pervasive so
that's the first point second quick
point about this is that if you're
feeling stressed out about this just
imagine you and me we're just software
developers like here right we're
software developers at the bottom but
combined combined combined and all the
way at the top even the top companies in
the world are stressed out about this
stuff there's a reason why two three
four more companies are getting into
self-driving cars there's a reason why
Apple's just getting into augmented
reality and virtual reality even the top
companies they stress that about this
probably more than you and me stress
that about this all right so that's the
point that's the second point I want to
make is just that everyone from
individual software developer individual
technologists all the way up to huge
elite company everyone is stressing
finally let's just touch upon the nature
of the field right if you're watching
this video and you've decided to get
into software or get into technology you
kind of know what you signed up for
right the basic premise of tech this
industry whatever you want to call it
the basic premise of it is that it
always has to be progressing right if it
wasn't progressing something would be
wrong and if you aren't progressing with
it you're probably going to be left
behind right but that's almost table
stakes we all know that when we signed
up to pursue this profession but
technology just the just the essence of
it is that it's all based on progression
so let's just dive into this a little
more I wrote a bunch of notes here about
my current my thoughts just about all
this trend stuff because nobody likes to
just follow trends blindly right it
doesn't feel good like everyone else is
doing it so you have to do that that
never feels good right it's like a
follower feeling and no one no one at
their heart really wants to be too much
of a follower everybody wants to be a
trend setter but there's also a
practical practical aspect of this that
we can't forget so two major things I
want to talk about in this video first
is how to stay aware and always keep
your mind thinking about what's trending
and what's not trending so that's just
being aware of things being aware of the
environment and the second thing the
second thing is more actionable the
second thing I want to talk about is
what actions can we do personally to
align ourselves better with the trends
so first things how to be aware of it
second thing actions all right let's get
straight into it you don't have to think
about this a lot but you do have to
periodically every once in a while
spend a little bit of brainpower and
just think about some of these topics
right because if you completely neglect
this it's not good so the first thing I
want to say just to be aware of the
trends is that you do have to spend some
brainpower thinking about you can't
always be working in a cave just on what
you love you have to be a little bit of
we're aware of what's going on outside
there's some no-brainer trends that have
been going on for decades and they're
probably still going on
the biggest no-brainer trend is
obviously web apps the internet and all
applications that sits on the internet
you know Jeff Bezos Jack Ma all a lot of
crazy leaders in this world still think
the Internet has huge potential
even though it's decades it's still
trending there's still a lot to be done
with the internet and that's why you
know JavaScript's blowing up web apps
are like the primary things you learn if
you're just getting to the field but
internet isn't going anywhere and that's
probably the biggest no-brainer of
what's what has been trending and what's
still trending with that said there's
also certain parts of the internet that
have kind of died down over time right
if you guys have heard of a company
called Cisco Cisco is a giant company
they were huge an IT and networking and
they played a major part in developing
the infrastructure the networking for
the Internet so that's when the internet
was blowing up how did you connect the
whole world well companies like Cisco
played a huge part in doing that but
what they kind of missed out on was that
they were just on the infrastructure
layer but they kind of missed out on the
application layer right companies like
Cisco they did a lot for tech but now
they're not really like the hot company
anymore
that's just it just a bit but in the
next section I want to just give
everyone a list
I just brainstormed a quick list here of
things that I think are trending upwards
all these things that are trending
upwards it's hard to predict I can't
predict them I'm just kind of aware of
them not many of us are email must kind
of build tunnels under cities we're not
building the futures so if you are
that's awesome do it but the least you
can do is just be aware of what's kind
of trending so some of the things I
wrote down were blockchain technology
anything related to augmented reality or
a are anything related to AI virtual
reality is trending anything to do with
cars anything to do with self-driving
Internet of Things but that's just a
list I'm not a master at any of these I
doubt anyone is a master and all those
things but that's just a quick list of
things to be aware about that are kind
of potentially up-and-coming right so
that's an example of being aware of
what's getting more popular but also
equally important you have to be aware
of things that are getting less positive
one technology that I think is losing
popularity not really losing popularity
for just less novel is the whole era of
mobile application development so when
the first iPhone came out that was
revolutionary right that started the
whole trend of iPhone iOS you know
Android coming out like everyone started
getting a smartphone and everybody
needed a mobile app so that created a
ton of mobile developers everybody kind
of rushed to build mobile apps and
during that time it was the hot new
thing but now in 2017 I think mobile
apps is just Table six it's not really
novel in any way it's like you're almost
expected to have a mobile app everyone
that's a smartphone and it's just it's
like a website now of course you have a
website of course you have a mobile app
and it's not as you know differentiating
as it used to be the conclusion is after
whatever I just said the only thing to
remember is that all you have to do is
spend a little bit of your brainpower
and just think about what is gaining in
popularity and what's losing in
popularity and you know no one's really
a fortune teller we're not soothsayers
but it's good to just think about every
now and then the second second part of
this video which is almost more
important but the second thing I wanted
to talk about is what we can do
personally to try to keep up with these
trends it's one thing to just be aware
of it it's another thing to do your best
to keep up with it which is the root
cause of a lot of stress a lot of stress
for me probably a lot of stress for you
as well but for everyone so what can we
do about it
like I mentioned at the start of this
video we're all worried about the trends
keeping up-to-date about those trends
but companies big companies are probably
even more worried about that stuff and
one of the easiest ways not easy but one
of the ways you can stay up to date is
you just stay with a company and the
company stays up-to-date so let's just
give some examples if you aligned
yourself with Google if you could get
into Google you probably be better off
today than if you join Yahoo if you
joined Amazon you probably be better
opposite eight and if
join eBay or if you joined if you're a
software developer working at Tesla you
might be more aligned with the trends
and if you decided to take a job at Ford
Motors so that's this is very idealistic
I know this is really idealistic but the
easiest way to align yourself
individually with the trends is to align
yourself with a company that's also
trending so I just named some elite
companies right not many of us can work
at those elite companies but I just want
to get across this premise is that when
you decide to go to work for a company
it's going to be a very personal
decision for you and sometimes you won't
have a lot of options sometimes we'll
have a lot of options but in terms of
this whole trending concept even if you
can work at the elite companies you
still have to work at a company which is
still which has some long term vision
trying to do things different ways and
that could be any small company
medium-sized company they could still
have that vision what you don't want to
do is work at any company that's still a
little you know in the old days and you
can get a sense of that if you talk with
them so that's point number one it's the
easiest point I have is almost like a
no-brainer but no matter how big how
small of a company decide to work for or
even start if you're trying to start a
company or work for a company but if you
align yourself with a company as really
forward-thinking you will just naturally
be along with the trend number two is
really easy this is something I'm trying
to do a lot this is something everyone
should do but this is personally staying
up to date with all the new technologies
so the previous section I'll just bring
the list back up here but all these
previous technologies we brainstormed
arv are AI but you can also don't have
to dive really really deep into them you
can if you want to dive really really
deep but what I like to do and I have to
do better this is I have to become we
have to become much very literate in all
of these technologies so I've taken a
really really basic intro level course
to like AI but I still know nothing
really about AI and machine learning and
I have to make that area stronger given
how the world is moving right so that's
personal I need to do and that's
something that everyone can do right you
can just educate yourself a little more
learn the vocab know the knowledge know
the basic foundation of the newer topics
right there's nothing stopping us from
just taking a little more AI courses now
or getting into VR programming or trying
to make an AR app we can do that on our
own so that's point number two we just
have to self initiate some of that stuff
point number three last point I want to
make is about building your base and not
skipping and I'm going to tell you
almost exactly what I think is the most
valuable thing to learn for this section
so when I say no skipping this is kind
of intuitive right you can't just jump
into AI you can't just become an AI
machine learning programming a
cybernetic organism if you don't know
programming right so first there's just
no skipping so these are my three things
that I think every single software
developer needs to get a really good
grasp control over nets computers
software and the infinite alright it's
really broad but it's really important
so computers computers are not going
anywhere they're not going to disappear
or go out of popularity computers are
here to stay you have to understand how
computers work anything you do to better
understand computers will help you next
point software software is also not
going anywhere software is almost like a
new language right so like even a lot of
non-technical people are getting much
more interested to learn the basics of
software just because it's a new tech
lingo that everyone has to kind of
understand but software crafting good
software understanding software design
just knowing how languages work that is
not going anywhere so you don't to worry
about that like always learn software
super super well and only good things
can come finally the last one the third
one I have that is a must to know is the
Internet so many people think the
Internet's old radios invented decades
ago but look at it today there's a
reason why everyone learns web app
development
Internet is not going anywhere so you
have to really understand first how the
internet works what the cloud means and
just have a really good control over the
internet because it's really it's not
going anywhere
whatever we built in the future whatever
creates the ARA i we are whatever
craziness even cars all that stuff is
going to be built on the internet so you
have to understand it so that's my last
that's my third and last point of how to
keep up with the trends but it's not
counterintuitive if you think about it
but just to keep up with the trend need
to continually create your base or make
your base much stronger the better you
understand computer software and the
internet the more ready you will be to
take on some of those new and crazier
things like maybe if I make this video
five or ten years from now like the
fourth thing might be AI who knows right
but continually making your base
stronger will just make it easier for
you to adopt the trend you can't just
start from zero to machine learning
doesn't work like that all right guys
I'm going to stop this video here before
it gets way too long overall I just
wanted to talk about some of my thoughts
on computer software and how it trends
or just trends in technology just always
remember everyone worries about this I
worry about this a lot I try not to I
think four or five years ago I would
like I was losing sleep over some of
this stuff but I've tried to you know
take small baby steps and worry about
this less but everyone not just you I
worry about this a lot too everyone
worries about this Bill Gates worries
about this every single elite company to
small company worries about this but
it's just a nature of the industry so
that's what we signed up for
all right guys please like the video
please leave me a comment if you have
any questions maybe spark some
discussion about this I don't know if
what I said was controversial or not
controversial but give me a like and
I'll catch everyone next week all right
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
