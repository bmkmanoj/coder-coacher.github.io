enjoying your weekend by popular demand
and by popular I mean like 5 thumbs up
I'm going to be doing a video on my
experiences at Carnegie Mellon
University there's nothing technical
going on in this video today just a
little bit of storytelling a little bit
of me getting personal and pretty much
just sharing a bunch of stuff that
happened throughout college that
hopefully you guys find useful all right
let's do it
Carnegie Mellon or CMU is a relatively
small private school in Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania it's not only known for
engineering it has world-class drama
program which produces Hollywood stars
has a really good business and
architecture program so the campus has a
really good mix of people but you know
College of Engineering 90% male ok so
first thing is that when I was a senior
in high school I did early decision to
get into CMU early decision is when you
pick one school that you want to apply
to early and if you get in you have to
go if you really know where you want to
go or which program you want to be a
part of if you're in high school I would
strongly recommend early decision it's a
little bit scary because you're really
locking in potential for years of your
life but it's going to greatly improve
your chances and you'll be compared
against much fewer students if you know
what you want to do and you have the
perfect school of mind just do early
decision but take your time with the two
even if you're just in high school right
now you really can't afford to waste any
time transferring schools switching
majors swishing programs it all eats
away at your time remember don't waste
your time it's pretty much everything
you have and if you're really young
you'll understand that more later so the
first thing that happened when I got to
CMU was this crazy feeling of little
fish big pond in high school you're
probably a big fish in a little pond
you're top of the class you're
relatively smarter than all your
classmates the moment you get to college
the level just Rises up a lot and
everybody around you with the top of
their high school class so this is
something you just have to mentally
prepare for a little bit if you decide
to go to an engineering school you won't
be the smartest you have to get used to
getting terrible test scores and
everything's going to be much more
competitive in high school I had a
pretty easy time I thought I was pretty
smart I did well on AP test SATs when I
think about high school I just think
about playing having fun on the other
hand when I think about college and CMU
all I remember is working my ass off
even in some of the introductory
engineering classes I felt like I
couldn't keep up sometimes in any
engineering program that you might apply
to you have to be ready to feel like the
stupid whine
don't worry everybody internally feels
like the stupid one they just don't let
a show the one thing I can say about
seeing these engineering program is that
the introductory classes and all
engineering classes they're just
straight-up really hard what you have to
realize is that world class people are
putting these classes together
these are people at the top top top of
their fields the classes the homeworks
the lab assignments it's not just some
scribbles and notes that the professor
puts together every single one of those
classes is carefully over the years over
decades fine-tuned by professors and
crafted to be perfect almost perfect so
the other thing that was particularly
challenging about engineering school
CME's programs is that it really really
sucks when you fall behind even by one
homework assignment when you're picking
up engineering especially in the early
years
everything is cumulative everything
builds on top of each other the moment
you don't understand one level or you
don't understand a basic fundamental
you're screwed you're not going to
understand anything from that point on
so my one advice here is that when
you're taking classes you have to make
sure yourself it's a personal thing to
really understand and digest every
concept that's introduced to the
professor can introduce it to you but
he's not going to have a private session
with you you have to go back after the
lecture after you do the homework and
just make sure you really understand it
before moving on with all that being
said the other tip that I kind of want
to give if anybody's thinking about
engineering school is to not avoid the
hard classes you should take the hard
classes the hard classes are the ones
that you'll kill yourself over but you
also just gain the most out of if you're
going to a private school and you're on
full tuition you're paying a lot a lot
of money just to be there I kind of did
the math out in every lecture I would
miss would be like fifty to a hundred
dollars that's what every lecture costs
so if you just sleep in one morning you
have to be careful not to try to burn
yourself out by taking like three or
four engineering courses it might be too
much but you definitely shouldn't
you didn't go to engineering school to
just get by take the easy classes you're
there to take the hard classes and learn
as much as you can you're spending so
much money just to be there that it's
not worth it just to take the easy
classes it's almost like a waste of
money my major at CMU is called
Electrical and Computer Engineering
which is usually two separate majors but
they just call it the same thing
Electrical and Computer Engineering when
I first started out my first couple
years at college I focused more on the
electrical side which was circuits or
signal processing towards the end of my
undergraduate I started focusing a lot
more on the computer engineering side of
things which is integrated chip design
computer systems computer architecture
also this whole time I was taking some
supplementary courses in the computer
science department I wasn't a computer
scientist I was just taking some of
their courses - for fun you know some
people actually double majored in
computer engineering and computer
science those guys are crazy I couldn't
do that just doing one alone was crazy
hard if I had to put in a nutshell I
guess I majored in Computer Engineering
with a little supplementary work in
computer science
another cool part of CMU is engineering
program and probably every engineering
program is that the hardest classes you
probably take are the group classes
these are classes that are designed so
that it's literally impossible for one
person to finish it the classes teach
you how to work with and rely on other
people to finish the projects I work
together a lot in different groups with
my friends but on the flip side of that
there's a crazy amount of
competitiveness in all these schools
there's just a crazy amount of pressure
you have to compete with all your peers
around you you constantly feel under
pressure and adequate and slower than
all your peers all the time I felt that
for like five years there was one class
I took where they posted
the scores of every single student
publicly for every single coding
assignment by doing that you can
literally just log on and see exactly
how your code did compared to everyone
else in the class there is always a
person above you there's always the
person that solved the problem better
than you
it doesn't sound really healthy it was
also kind of motivating but we're always
under the pressure like oh how did that
guy do it and how come I can't figure it
out
so half good half bad you got to be
ready your mind to deal with stuff like
that but it also instills a lot of
motivation in you to try to be the best
you know they do all this stuff on
purpose they want to see that you're
doing worse than your classmates it's
just like part of this game or something
in I guess it works it didn't seem like
it worked at the time but I think years
later you realize that it helped a lot
now if we move outside the classroom a
little bit it was also highly
competitive on the professional or job
part every single student is fighting
for jobs and internships at the best
companies with each other you're always
fighting for the same positions when
your friends get an internship at
Microsoft Facebook Google and you don't
bat sucks right so I have a funny story
about when I attended this job fair when
I was a freshman so these job fairs are
really crowded you have to wait in lines
just to speak with company
representatives just the hand in your
resume you'll have to wait like 20
minutes in line so I waited in line to
talk to Nvidia which I'm sure you guys
know NVIDIA makes graphics cards but I
waited like 20-30 minutes in line and
right when I got there they gave me a
piece of paper and a pencil and forced
me to do a written quiz as like you know
a screening process this was when I was
a freshman I really didn't know anything
I remember looking at the quiz picking
up the pencil I didn't know what
anything meant on the paper I just
dropped everything didn't even hand in
my resume and just went back it was
pretty embarrassing there's like 3040
people behind me waiting to take that
is a lot of people have asked me about
finding a job and my only piece of
advice for that is that any University
or actually any academic establishment
has a lot of resources for you to help
you find a job
there's career centers I'm almost 100%
sure there's a career center that's
applicable or available to you sorry and
just go into it and use their resources
the whole purpose of the Career Center
is to help you get a job they can talk
with you give you tips on interviewing
set you up with interviews tell you what
to wear all that stuff I guarantee
there's a career center available for
you even if you're in high school
there's probably a career center just
use it with all that being said I just
want to reiterate my point is that you
don't have to go to a top engineering
school to be successful or whatever that
means for you right now you know there's
so many resources out now that if you
really are motivated I'm sure you can
make anything happen you don't need to
go to Carnegie Mellon MIT Harvard that's
just like a little plus but it's not
required the one thing that I can see
for sure is that I was lucky enough to
go to CMU and I still thrive off some of
the knowledge that I learned there even
to this day even to this day I still
reference my textbooks from different
classes when I just want to look up
something even for work or just I forget
how something works
I still look through those textbooks all
right
so I talked a lot in this video I think
I didn't plan it out so much but let's
just make some closing points before I
end it out the first thing is just to
mentally prepare yourself for the
cutthroat environment and be prepared to
just feel really really dumb push
yourself to take challenging courses
don't coast remember at any college your
money to be there and there's no reason
to slack off make sure you use that
money wisely and the whole point of it
is for you to sponge up that knowledge
and learn as much as you can last point
to make any college experience better is
to find some friends don't do work in
the library for 20 hours a day and just
find some cool people to hang out with
alright guys I hope this was helpful
sorry this wasn't a technical video just
a little bit of storytelling about what
college was like if you have anything
specific to ask me about anything
regarding CMU or college in general you
can just ask me in the comments I'll
reply or you can just email me directly
it's all good I hope the information was
helpful for anyone that's considering
going to engineering school and I'll be
back next time with something more you
know learning so take care and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
