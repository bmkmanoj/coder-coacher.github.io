different this time and we're gonna
cover a really big topic in parts I read
that the sweet spot for YouTube videos
is right around three to four minutes
which is shorter than every single one
of my videos so I'm just gonna try to
not sure how many parts are going to be
yet but hopefully each video is a little
easier to digest shorter and still makes
sense let's do it alright so I'm gonna
make it unfortunate first-world
assumption and just assume many of you
guys are probably using smart phones
phones have come a long long way and I'm
not sure if there's an official
definition of a smart phone it could run
a web browser you can connect to the
internet it can do magic tricks when you
tap on it and they can send videos to
your friends as louis c.k eloquently put
it it's going to freaking space
they're awesome it's convenient
everyone is glued to them and they've
made our phone bills extra expensive I
think the iPhone was the first super
super successful smartphone Android
phones are also badass windows phones
what-have-you but I don't think anyone
can dispute the fact that the iPhone
from Apple definitely set a tone new
iPhones come out you reserved it online
stand in the tornado for two or three
days pay Verizon a thousand dollars and
you're really happy in this series of
videos I'm really gonna try to give a
good overview of everything it takes to
make a smart phone what this Apple do
who are the other major players what do
they do and how it all works
Steve Jobs usually just starts off with
this idea I want an iPhone make it
happen so how exactly does that idea get
translated into this there are million
steps that have to happen and we'll walk
through each one one video at a time you
ready all right talk soon and see you in
a part one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
