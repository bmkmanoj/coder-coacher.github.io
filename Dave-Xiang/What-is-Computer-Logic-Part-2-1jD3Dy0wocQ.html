great week this video is gonna be a
little bit more about computer logic and
it's a continuation of this other video
I made about what is computer logic so
please go watch that first if you
haven't also small point I'm just going
to be away for the next few weeks so I
won't be making any new videos so I'm
gonna try to make this one pretty good
we're gonna do a short intro today and
just get straight into it alright let's
do it one super super basic logical gate
that we didn't talk about last time is
called the inverter and this is probably
the most basic gate and it looks like
this this triangle thing and it's only
one input one output this is more simple
than all the gates we talked about last
time if the input is 1 the output is 0
if the input is 0 the output is 1 it
just inverts it right so the name
inverter makes sense so that's clear
away and simple enough oh yeah a small
point on just whenever I say 1 or 0 in
the back of your mind in the kind of
hardware context you should think of one
as electricity flowing and 0 has no
electricity so just keep that in the
back of your head when you're here one
that's electricity we hear 0 no
electricity all right so this thing over
here this triangle thing the inverter
that's pretty nice people like to draw
it they like to draw those little
triangles but what's actually inside an
inverter and how is it implemented and
let's get into that now we're going to
talk about one basic way of implementing
an inverter using CMOS technology and
this video I can't go into the details
of what CMOS is or how it works or
really the science behind it but it's
probably one of the most pervasive most
common technologies circuit technologies
used to make integrated circuits and
pretty much those circuits are inside
everything you use so we're going to be
using that as an example today so we
have this diagram here and this is the
CMOS diagram of an inverter and let's
just explain all these weird symbols and
all these weird letters first before we
move on
a is the input easy enough and q is the
output alright this is an inverter
there's one input one help with a input
Q output that line you see at the top
that says VDD that's actually the
voltage source that line at the top is
called VDD and when you hear the word
voltage source always think electricity
is flowing electricity is flowing all
right now check out the line at the
bottom of the diagram which is labeled
VSS this actually means ground and many
of you might have an intuition of what
ground means but it's pretty simple if
something is connected to ground it has
no electricity or it's grounded ok so
what's left that we have yet to explain
well it's all this stuff in the middle
right you see these weird vertically
parallel lines in the middle you can
think of these two vertically parallel
lines as like a gate or connection okay
I'm taking out some liberties with the
words but it's just to portray the
meeting so those two parallel lines I'm
gonna call them a gate and when there's
electricity at the gate it kind of
connects makes a connection at the gate
so let's just take a minute and let's
just keep looking at this diagram over
here of the inverter alright let's just
for example let's say a has electricity
flowing through it or the input is one
but let's just imagine a has electricity
going through it alright well you see
that gate at the bottom which connects a
to ground well if there's electricity at
a it's actually gonna connect the bottom
gate and the output is gonna get tied to
ground all right do you guys see that so
pretty much what that means is when a
has electricity it's tying the output to
ground and the output is gonna be zero
now look at the diagram again and look
at the gate at the top that's connected
to the voltage source it has a little
dot in front of the gate alright so what
is that little dot in front of the two
parallel lines means well that little
dot is kind of like opposite an opposite
gate and what that means is for that
opposite gate if there's electricity
going to the gate it's actually not
going to be
connected and it's actually going to be
connected if there's no electricity
alright so it actually works the
opposite of how a normal gait works if
that little dot is there okay so let's
just go back to our example a little bit
and let's just say a has no electricity
now all right so it's zero no
electricity well as we just talked about
if there's no electricity that opposite
gate is actually going to turn on and
connect the output to the voltage source
and the output it's going to have
electricity so I just spit out a lot
kind of fast but let's just let this all
sink in try to let this all sink in a
little bit and see exactly what just
happened if a has electricity Q gets
connected to ground and not the voltage
source so Q has no electricity now the
flip side if a has no electricity Q is
actually going to get connected to the
voltage source and it's gonna have
electricity flowing so what's actually
happened here it's pretty much exactly
what we're talking about this is an
inversion of electricity it's just
inverting the input right most people
don't draw like this everyone just draws
it as that triangle thing but behind the
scenes this is kind of what's happening
all right so that's a little trivial
right just an inverter how it kind of
works with electricity let's move on to
something a little more complicated
which is the NAND gate we didn't talk
about this in part one but I'm gonna put
up the logical diagram here of what NAND
really means alright it's pretty
self-explanatory it's just the inversion
of an or the opposite of and if you
understand the and concept NAND is
literally just the opposite of an
alright two inputs one output just the
opposite of end so I'm gonna put up the
logic table right here and just check
that out real quick and let it sink in
of what NAND is representing so I'm
gonna leave the logic table up there for
nand but also check out a CMOS diagram
of man which is exactly the same symbols
and stuff we just talked about with the
inverter but now it's going to be
implementing the NAND logic alright so
we're gonna walk through just one of the
key
before the NAND gate and I'll leave the
rest of the examples up for you up to
you guys to check out in your free time
but let's just walk through the case for
nan when both inputs are 1 the output is
0 and let's just see how that flows in
our CMOS diagram remember both inputs
are 1 or in other words both inputs have
electricity all right and let's follow
that flow in our diagram all right so in
this diagram you can see how a and B are
feeding into two of the gates that's
connecting the output with ground right
and if both those gates are connected or
if both a and B are 1 the output is
actually going to get connected to
ground and it's gonna turn 0 actually
for the NAND gate the only way for the
output to be 0 is if both inputs are
actually 1 alright and every other
combination the output is actually going
to be 1 and I'll leave it to you guys as
an exercise to just follow that flow
with the CMOS diagram and just trace
kind of trace with your fingers almost
how the electricity flows from input to
output let's just check out what the
NAND gate looks like in real life so we
just looked at a CMOS diagram of NAND
gate which is still a little more
abstract and theoretical but now this is
a metal or layout diagram of a NAND gate
and it's really colorful right I can't
explain all these cool colors and stuff
today but this is actually what we call
layout and this is physically what's
happening to implement this NAND gate so
you can see VDD is that cool blue color
at the top well there's electricity
flowing through that metal and if you
see all those little black squares those
are like metal contact points which
connects like different layers of metal
with each other those black squares so
this is essentially what layout layout
looks like it's extremely complicated
and this is one of the most simple
diagrams of way out for this one gate
but just this is what it looks like in
real life alright guys so as we all know
for engineering programming Hardware
everything is building blocks right
everything builds on top of each other
we just went over the NAND gate which is
a really simple one gate one simple CMOS
diagram but check out this diagram for
an adder alright it starts to get pretty
complicated pretty fast once things
start getting more and more complicated
people also draw things a little more
simply right no one actually draws VDD
and ground all the time right they still
use those triangles boxes and squares
right and when things get even more
complicated they just draw things with
bigger boxes with little boxes inside
them alright so we just kind of took the
deepest dive to see like what it looks
like on the ground level and guys also
remember inside every single little box
inside every single little triangle that
you might see in a diagram under the
hood in real life is actually different
pieces of metal like a ton of metal
intertwined connected and all doing
these smart things with electricity
flowing through that metal alright
inside every little box you see in those
diagrams all it is electricity flowing
through layers of metal finally I just
want to show you guys what this looks
like in an even more real-world example
but this is a blown-up picture of
Apple's a5 chip this is one of like the
most famous chips it was first
introduced in the iPhone 5 5 s so you
can see how there's different sections
of different things on this chip right
there's like processors there's memories
all those little boxes has a ton of
metal going through them all the time
and that thing goes inside an iPhone and
that iPhone is running all your games
every day alright so from all the way up
to all the way bottom there's a lot of
cool stuff going on but this is just a
deeper dive into how logic kind of works
and how electricity really flows through
physical things to make it happen
alright guys that's the end of the video
kind of long hopefully it was a good one
not gonna be making a video for a few
weeks cuz just going on vacation so I
won't see you guys for a while leave me
a comment if you have any questions
please like the video if you liked it
and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
