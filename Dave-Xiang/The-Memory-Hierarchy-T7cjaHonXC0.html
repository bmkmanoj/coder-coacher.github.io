doing well today I'm going to be making
a continuation of my Ram video alright
so basic intro for this video is that a
computer system has a lot of different
types of memory
besides RAM I'm going to try to
introduce those other types of memory
and give you a basic understanding of
how they work and how they might be
utilized in the computer system let's do
it the basic foundation of computer
memory is something called the memory
hierarchy here is a picture of the
memory hierarchy don't look too closely
at that yet just let me introduce it
first first check out the bottom of the
memory hierarchy these include memories
that are really slow but really big
examples include your hard drives your
flash drives they can hold terabytes of
data and have your music your games your
porn on your movies you get the idea
right so bottom of the hierarchy is for
slow and big memories at the very top of
the memory hierarchy that's where the
fastest and smallest memories exist the
fastest and smallest memory is a
register and I'll talk about that later
ok so let's just recap real quick the
bottom of the memory is for slow in big
memories the top of the hierarchy is for
fast but really small memories just keep
that in mind and everything will be a
lot easier to understand
so the slowest and biggest memories you
already know those are your hard drives
they keep all the data in when there's
no electricity in them and you can carry
them around and they hold terabytes of
stuff now the next level of memory above
hard drives in this memory is RAM you
can never really have terabytes of RAM
just gigabytes of it it's much smaller
than your hard drive but it's much
faster to access remember any type of
program
run your computer has to exist in RAM
first for the processor to execute it
who can boot ok so now let's go one
level above Ram to a memory that's
called an l2 cache l2 cache memory
sounds really cool and it is really cool
so check it out the drill here is the
same an l2 cache is smaller than Ram
this also must be faster while you have
8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM your l2 cache
is on the order of megabytes maybe 256
megabytes the concept of an l2 cache is
more or less simple important data
that's access it frequently is kept in
the l2 cache so the processor can get to
a much faster without going back into
RAM if your closet was Ram then the l2
cache would be your bedroom floor where
you keep your favorite boxers all the
time that you wear every day
now all the memory that I've talked to
up into this point is called off chip
memory and what is option memory let me
just talk about that real quick if you
ever open up your cell phone and open up
your computer we see that processor is
that cool little square thing that you
plop in and then you put like a big
cooling system on to keep it cold right
that's the processor also known as the
chip whenever someone says something is
off chip it's not included on the little
cool square processor when you upgrade
your computer and buy two new sticks of
RAM you stick them on your motherboard
you don't stick them inside your
processor right so Ram is an off chip
memory l2 cache is also an awful chip
memory all the memory I've talked to up
into this point
hard drives ran out to cash that's off
of the shipment now let's talk about
what's on chip the first memory that's
on chip is something called the l1 cache
what is l2 and l1 it's just level 2 and
level 1 cache usually a level 2 cache is
auction and the level 1 cache is on chip
that's usually the only difference well
it's the same drill again here an LL
cache is smaller than l2 cache but it's
also much much faster than access a
general rule of thumb is that if
anything is on chip it's very fast if
there's option memory the processor
needs to go a special way to get to it
and it could be slow now above l1 caches
is a memory called registers and this is
the last level I'm going to talk about a
register is the smallest and B fastest
and piece of memory inside a computer
system and one cool thing to note here
is that the number of registers is
actually defined by the instruction set
architecture if you forget what that is
just watch my processor video again but
pretty much different instruction set
architectures kind of dictate how many
registers there have to be and then
different implementations will
accommodate for that all right so let's
just put up the hierarchy back up here
real quick on the bottom you have hard
drives with disk memories they're really
slow
above that is RAM which you need
electricity to work above ran is l2
cache that's the last level of often
chip memory after that we move to
on-chip memory which include l1 cache
and registers so that is a lot of
different computer memories kind of cool
right and right now I'm going to try to
put some of these speeds in perspective
so you guys can appreciate how fast and
how slow some of these memories are
remember what the computer processor
everything is measured in terms of
cycles per second so you have a 1
gigahertz processor it can do 1 billion
cycles per second for 10 I'm your chef
processor for today I am a pretty slow
processor so for simplicity that just
saying I can
one cycle every second so a register
which is the fastest times memory it
takes zero to one second to access so
that be like if I had a knife in my
chef's apron I just take it out it takes
me less than a second to get to it
super fast after registers we have the
l1 cache which is also an on-chip memory
and it's really really fast l1 cache
isn't as fast as registers it's still
almost instantaneous it's kind of like
if I'm a chef and there's an onion on
the table I just grab it and chop of the
onion it's really fast once we start
going into off-ship memories being start
getting kind of slow first let's put l2
cache into perspective say you need a
special Chinese spice so to go back to
the pantry and get that special Chinese
spice it's going to take you about ten
seconds that analogy is about equivalent
to an l2 cache access most l2 accesses
are about ten seconds which is ten times
four so slower than l1 or register
access
okay so now we're moving down the
hierarchy and after l2 cache memory is
Ram to use a spicy sauce you need to get
a live duck you need to get out of the
kitchen and kill your duck and bring it
back it's going to take you like two
minutes or so Ram is about a hundred
times slower than a register access all
right so you get your duck and
everything's good but then you forgot
that you left the pig out you need to
get a pig damage an access to disk
memory can be millions times slower than
register access if it takes you one
second to get out your chef knife that's
about eleven days to get this pig you
need to drive across China camp out a
little bit
you need to slay the pig then spend
three days doing nothing and then drive
back to your kitchen and then you have
your Pig the moral the story is is that
a computer processor never wants to
access anything this memory is usually
way too slow all right so hopefully you
guys have a little bit of a better
appreciation of how much faster some
memories can be than others inside one
computer system just remember the basics
of the memory hierarchy at the bottom we
have slow but very big memories and at
the top we have small but very fast
memories every level of memory on the
computer hierarchy is a catch for the
level below it in term caching is very
general computers are super complicated
things but they're really amazing it
still boggles my mind how they work they
just all work somehow
I hope you guys enjoyed the video and
got a better appreciation of the
different types of memory in a computer
system the memory hierarchy is a really
good foundation to know and hopefully
the knowledge is useful for you sometime
alright I hope you guys had some fun
learn something and make sure to check
out some of my other videos that you
haven't already so thanks for watching
and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
