doing really really well enjoying your
weekend I wanted to use this video talk
about another popular topic and that's
salary negotiations I have another video
I did a few months ago about my personal
salary progression you can watch that
before this you can watch that after
this it doesn't really matter but it's
tightly related so I'm gonna use this
video and just give my personal top
points best things to look out for my
take on salary negotiations alright
let's do it so I think the salary
negotiation falls under this big
umbrella category of Crucial
Conversations and I didn't make up that
phrase I actually copied that phrase is
from a book I'll have a link to the book
in my description but short story is a
crucial conversation is any conversation
that potentially affects your life so if
you think about a salary negotiation a
15-minute conversation could affect what
hits your bank account for at least the
whole year so it's serious and in the
context of software development this
could be salary negotiations that could
be your annual review cycle it could be
final rounds of interviews it could be
any number of these conversations and
they're all very important so I think
there's only two two major components to
any crucial conversation that you have
to really think about the first one is
gonna be what you want and the second
one is going to be what the other person
your counterparty wants so it sounds
very meta a really fluffy but I'm gonna
try to talk about it on a high level and
then give everyone some concrete
examples so you can actually be
practical about it but again those two
important things are gonna be what you
want and what other people want so let's
talk about both of them so the first one
what you want I've talked about this
before but this is just really
internalizing what you want at one point
in your life and remember it's always
going to be changing you always want
different things at different points in
your life your friends family I'll tell
your buddies they can be good resources
for you but the answer to this question
always comes from inside first so I
struggle with this it's always been
changing I know you struggle with this
but will struggle with it together
that's really what you
at the pin point first and you can
actually pinpoint that at least for one
moment in your life it's gonna change
but right now if you just think about
right now this moment you can either
write it down think about it but you can
put words to what you want so that's the
first thing to think about let me give
you a concrete example about this so
pretend you're at your software job you
don't like coding you're tired of the
code base and you're getting really
grumpy about your job right you just
ain't going to work you don't like
working on any of the tickets but
pretend your boss has noticed this and
he's scheduled this one-on-one
conversation to talk to you and you know
that conversation is going to be about
you know how you're feeling about work
how you're still being motivated but
that is going to be potentially a
crucial conversation and it's coming up
or so imagine if you went into that
conversation with no preparation of what
you wanted could you even articulate
what's bothering do you have any idea of
what you want to do next you even have
an idea of how to improve the situation
so those are kind of things in that
moment you have to internalize what you
want like why exactly are you the
motivated at that time because let me
tell you when that meeting comes when
you finally sit down with your boss once
a one if you haven't thought about any
of those questions of what you really
want at all that whole conversation is
going to be unproductive so you have to
think about those questions what do you
want and just constantly think about it
the second second this is the more
important part but the second part is
what the other person wants in that book
Crucial Conversations they call this
person your counterparty it sounds very
official but it's just the person
sitting across from you so what do they
want and for this point let's just jump
straight into an example so let's
pretend you're just your average
software developer and you what you want
you've already answered this question
but you decided what you want is some
number you want this salary number you
want to make this amount of money and I
think a lot of us can relate to this
right you just want to make some
arbitrary amount of money and that's
what you want you've prioritized it over
everything else bad commute you know
weird town like maybe weird interviewers
but all you want is this
number and that's what you've
internalized it's okay that's what
you've decided to but you've
internalized that all you want is this
one number all right so we've answered
question number one we've answered the
question I proposed in part one of what
you want and that's a number so that
parts done and now the next thing we
have to think about is well your
counterparty once so imagine the
situation but you're in the final rounds
of negotiating your salary with a tiny
tiny start-up and you know the
conversations gonna be hard because they
don't have many funds you know they
haven't raised hundreds of millions of
dollars and they're not really gonna be
able to meet the salary you want but you
really want to make that number so that
conversation is already gonna be
difficult and you can sense it
so you really have to start thinking
about what your counterparty wants let's
pretend it's a CEO of this small
start-up that you had to negotiate what
does he or she really want so pretend
just put yourself into the shoes of a
CEO and a tiny startup what does he or
she really want well they want a few
things right they want to get their
dream off the ground build their dream
they want to do it for as cheaply as
possible because they don't have any
money and they probably want to do it
really quickly right so imagine if you
just start off the salary negotiation
mentioning your number right well the
number one thing the tiny start-up CEO
doesn't want is to spend a huge amount
of money so if you if you say your
number if you just say $300,000 first
thing you're just gonna you're just
gonna block them up you're gonna put
them into the defense mode and they
won't have any open conversation with
you so in order to start that
conversation you always have to begin
begin with what they want so again what
is that tiny start-up CEO want they want
something to be built their dream to be
off the ground they want to do it for us
cheaply as possible and they probably
want to do it quickly so you have to
cater to them the thing about Crucial
Conversations that's really important is
that regardless regardless of the topic
you have to keep somebody
and once someone is open they're open to
talk about a variety of different topics
right but the moment you close someone's
mind any topic even if it's really
rational it's like actually a good idea
they'll be close to it if your mind is
closed so if you're negotiating for your
salary at this tiny startup
you can't just close off the CEOs mind
immediately by saying you're
astronomical number you have to approach
it a little differently you have to
approach it with what they want so
imagine if you said this you said hey I
really love the mission I could really
get behind the company and I can also
think I can build what you need to be
built in a year or less than a year and
within budget but I want to do this for
you consistently into the future I want
to do now and I'll do it for a long time
and I'll do it I'll do a really good job
at it but to do this and be comfortable
doing this I would need to have my
salary number raised so that was just a
pretend pitch but it wasn't the best
fish but my whole the whole point of
this is that well you have to do is
cater towards this small startup what
they really really want and what they
want is they just want their product
built cheaply and quickly and you have
to show that you provide that first you
are the engineer to help build get that
dream off the ground you're gonna do it
that's your first priority and at the
tail the tail end of the conversation
once you prove in all those points once
your counterparty is very comfortable
that oh this is the person that can
build my thing once you've proven all
those things at the tail tail end of the
conversation just be like to do this
comfortably I really need to have my
salary number raised and by that point
the CEO has already opened up to you and
they're gonna give you maybe now your
$300,000 a number but they're gonna be
much more open
to that salary negotiation so that was
point number two that's the most
important part about this video but too
often people just go straight into these
conversations without much preparation
they haven't really thought about the
other person too much they just they
just think about their number a lot and
they just want to hit this number they
saw on Glassdoor so really do just just
sit breathe and think about what you
want first and then what the other
person wants because you already know
what you want that's easy but you just
can't show many people what you want you
keep that to yourself but during a
crucial conversation you already know
what you want you want some number right
but you have to just understand what
they want so you go about it the right
way finally I want to give some last
last tips about this whole salary
negotiation thing crucial conversation
thing which are a little less
philosophical but tip number one is
remember that all these conversations
are going to be relative so keep that in
the back of your head it could be really
important to you but it could just be a
random meeting for your manager right
it's always relative a conversation
isn't important for every single party
present so just keep that in mind
important for you doesn't always mean
important for some VP you're fighting
for the salary with
- is that don't over represent yourself
I've seen too many engineers think they
deserve to make like this amount of
money because they see their friends
making that amount of money at some big
company right so don't over represent
yourself if you're just some entry-level
engineer you can't be making crazy
amounts of money so over representing
yourself is a really bad look okay last
third thing I want to say about salary
negotiations is that you should not
share too much information early on for
anyone that's been through the process
you already know the recruiters ask you
what are you making now what are you
expecting to make what's your range the
house it always ask you these questions
early to put you at a disadvantage and
there's actually laws now that they
can't really do that like you can keep
all that information secret you should
not tell people and you know it's hard
like I've definitely done it I've made
that mistake where I've told the
recruiter very early my range and I
think has put me at some kind of
disadvantage but you do not have to
share that information with anyone and
based on our conversation remember
that's the other negotiation always
happens that means you prove everything
first you prove your value you prove
your motivation you prove your alignment
with the goals whatever you just prove
all that stuff first and when all that
stuff is good you talk about salary way
at the end you don't give it away
earlier so those are three random points
I had all right guys I'm gonna sign off
now I hope this video was helpful just
my personal take on how to you know
approach the salary negotiations and
remember it's just one salary
negotiation is just one subset of
Crucial Conversations and you're gonna
have a lot of Crucial Conversations in
your life with your friends with your
husband wife girlfriend boyfriend
whatever but they're always really
important try to prepare for them think
about them and try to grow from them
