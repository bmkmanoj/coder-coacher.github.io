intimate video this week and I think
it's gonna be really helpful because I
was thinking about this a lot recently
but this is the fundamental cause the
root cause analysis of many problems
concerns and questions that many people
have so I will receive me a lot of
questions recently and on the surface
they're all very technical related to
the software related to programming but
the root cause like the fundamental core
reason is a mindset problem and that's
we're gonna fix today I'm gonna list off
a few questions I'm sure a lot of these
must sound familiar to many of you guys
but there's a theme to these questions
all right so what should I study
computer science software engineering
Computer Engineering is C++ better than
Java is Ruby better than Python Python
better than Ruby do I work here instead
of there do I follow this curriculum
instead of that curriculum so you guys
are getting the gist of those kind of
questions and it's unreasonable to
answer all of them individually that's
why I was spending some time to try to
break down the root cause of it so what
I think and this is completely natural
but many times when people ask these
questions it's because they're looking
for this magical 100% awesome solution
to their problem if I study computer
science it will enable me to do this if
I work in this industry over that
industry I'm gonna be happy so if this
is your mindset I'm gonna just be very
straight-up blunt with you but this is
not the right mindset to have alright
this mindset is gonna just frustrate you
and disappoint you for anything in life
not just programming software coding but
really for anything in life there's
going to be pros cons and perspectives
to everything just like the person you
marry isn't going to be the perfect
person they're gonna be annoying in the
daytime nice in the nighttime but it's
this thing with programming right people
fight over frameworks languages you know
design patterns all that stuff but there
is no silver bullet solution for
everything there is always just
perspective and that's the mindset that
we have to develop so again if it wasn't
clear already the first point that I
want to get across to everyone
is that if you're leaning towards this
mindset or you catch yourself trying to
think of one special solution and you
catch yourself trying to find a special
solution just kill that mindset all
right you're not gonna find the 100%
magical solution to anything not to
program me not to who you marry not to
anything in life and you'll just
disappoint yourself and frustrate
yourself if you're looking for that if
that was clear this is really hard if
that solution was clear to everyone
everyone would be using the same formula
and life would be easy right
so first piece of advice if you're
leaning towards that mindset or you have
an inkling of that mindset just kill it
right now get it out of your head the
second piece of advice to try to get
yourself in a better state of mind for
these kind of scenarios that just try to
gain as many perspectives and angles on
any situation to get the full picture of
things right there is no silver bullet
answer but let's just say you're
thinking about studying computer science
versus computer engineering alright
that's a common question what do I study
do I study this versus that so instead
of thinking to yourself I need to study
one or the other and they're just that's
it black and white it's more like if I
study computer science what does that
provide me and what do I lack if I study
that versus if I study computer
engineering what does that provide me
but also what do I lack in knowledge if
I go that route so it's not like one is
better than the other they're just
different all right in life nothing is
just straight-up better than the other
unless you're straight a better
programmer than your friend then you are
better but for everything else it's all
perspective right computer science isn't
better than computer engineering it's
just different so just the recap this is
the mindset I hope you guys are getting
where I'm coming from but this is the
mindset that I think everyone should
develop all right open yourself up to
new perspectives judge the pros and cons
for yourself look at different angles
and once you get that you just have a
much more general and like not so
narrow-minded picture of anything all
right there is no silver bullet just
keep
your mind open and that's the mindset
you need to just develop all right so
that's all I have to say try to improv
this video hopefully you went okay
and let me know if you think in the
comments all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
