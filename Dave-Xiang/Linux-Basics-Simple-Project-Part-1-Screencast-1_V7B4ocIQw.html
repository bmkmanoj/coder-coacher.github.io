week and hopefully it's going to be a
pretty cool screencast what I wanted to
go over were some linux basics and how
to build a really simple project in like
the Linux or UNIX
ecosystem so this is a little bit niche
but I think it's important to understand
we're just gonna start with this video
by go wearing some really really basic
fundamentals inside a Linux or UNIX
system if you don't know what these
words mean then this might not be a very
good first video for you to watch so if
that's the case I would just suggest
googling what this means first and then
coming back and checking out this video
if you're still interested and if you're
developer watching this video these
words should mean something to you at
least I hope they should mean something
to you alright so we're gonna first
start by taking a pretty quick example
of a basic basic executable application
that everyone uses on Linux and then
we're gonna talk about how we might
actually build that and organize it in a
project alright just do it if you guys
just look over to the left here on the
Left I have a really simple terminal
open up to a Linux computer that I own
or manage it's just like my website and
I'm just using it as an example for this
video to show you guys a really popular
executable so one of the most popular
executables out there is this thing
called LS list and there's no way you
can use this operating system without
knowing this command what this pretty
much does is just list your current
directory structure and files you can
pass it some options and make it do
different things it's really cool and
let's just take a deeper dive at what
this really means so if we type which LS
this is actually where LS is coming from
inside this directory slash bin slash LS
so if we go into bin we can actually see
where LS is coming from sorry
we can actually see that inside this
directory is where this executable lies
so there's also a lot of other stuff in
here I'm actually using LS to list the
binaries in this directory the actually
where is it
that's right here see LS among a lot of
other things what the green means is
that these files are actually executable
files and remember I'm not sure if you
guys had a chance to watch my other
video but remember an executable file is
something that we can actually execute
and run whereas a library file or a
library rather cannot be executed and
those are two fundamental really
different types of files you'll
encounter inside these systems you'll
encounter a lot of different libraries
and a lot of different executables which
are dependent on those libraries so LS
is an executable and what it does is
list the directory structure so I hope
that's pretty clear okay so whole
binaries are pretty clear and I just
want everyone to take a quick note at
these words really pay attention to this
word bi n does mean binary and
everything inside bin directories are
going to be binaries that you can
execute all right so I hope that's clear
and let's just talk quickly about
libraries now so there's a cool command
I'm going to show you guys right now
oops so ldd what this shows is libraries
that LS depends upon so remember I'm not
sure if you guys got a chance to watch
my static vs. shared libraries video and
definitely check that out if you didn't
this will make more sense but all
executables are dependent on various
libraries and this is a cool command
that lists out various libraries that LS
pretty much needs and I just want to
point out that check out there's a lot
of random stuff going on here but just
check out where these libraries exist
they all exist under this Li B or a
library directory and these are real
files like these exist somewhere there
they're pointing to real things so if
all executables live inside /bin you can
also say that all libraries are gonna
live under /li be directories okay so
this is a really important note and it's
going to be a theme in this video and
we're always going to distinguish
executable files versus library files
right and they always appear inside
these two separate directories and
obviously the naming is really Dilbert I
can't really talk about it much further
but let's just move on so this is a
really cool command ldd you guys have
some time just check it out okay so if
you check out a lot of different
binaries inside this directory LS is
just one of many and also my computer is
quite simple so this is a really really
small list of potential binaries that
living inside this system but remember
guys every single one of these
developers wrote them every single one
of these binaries date em k temp PWD
these are all binaries
written by people and they originated
from a project so everything came from
somewhere everything was built from a
project with source code and sorry I'll
fix this formatting but I probably hide
this video soon but I just want everyone
to remember that this all came from
somewhere and it all came from some
project at some point in time by some
developers and what we're gonna talk
about now now that we kind of understand
this thing on the left and we just did a
really quick overview of this and
there's much more to talk about but
let's just talk about what the project
might look like to even build something
like this like what would the project
even need inside it to create a LS for
example and that's we're gonna talk
about now alright so let's just do that
all right first question let's just say
let's build Ellis so we'll talk through
a simple example of what we might set up
to actually build Delos command list
command and first we have to ask
ourselves what exactly are we building
and is it a executable library or maybe
both so this is the first question you
have to ask ourselves really so inside
this ecosystem what do we want to build
do we want to build an executable like a
command here we want to build the
library which is purely maybe just a set
of cool functionality that other
developers might use like we don't even
have an executable we could also just
build the library that's totally doable
and finally you could do a combination
of the both so let's actually do a
combination let's just make a cool like
kind of LS project I'll call it LS
project and what this project is gonna
do it's gonna build an LS library as
well as the LS command and let's just
talk through what that means and how
we're gonna do it let me just move this
down a little bit okay so first I'll lay
out the rough big picture items inside
this project and then we'll break it
down one by one but I'm gonna list them
all down here first though this will be
a little quick but we'll come back to
each one of these so there's gonna be a
source source code directory there's
gonna be a testing directory there's
gonna be a build directory include
there's gonna be third party what else
is there's there's gonna be artifacts I
think that might do it okay let's just
go over these six first talk through
them and see where that gets us all
right so first thing remember we're
trying to build both we're gonna build
LS plus we're gonna build some kind of
LS libraries that people can use if you
don't know these extensions these are
library extensions but the product
self the purpose of our project in the
end when we do like something like build
this project it's gonna give us an
executable I would as well as two
libraries so I hope that's clear this is
the goal of this project and let's see
how we can just lay it out with this
kind of structure and what do these
funky words mean okay first thing of
course the most important thing is the
source code directory not much to say
here and we're just going to do a little
bit of name spacing we're gonna have
source code for our library as well as
source code for the actual executable
binary to write we're just kind of
separating it out it all falls under
score sewed but source code for library
voices versus a source code for binary
hope that's clear so the library will
just call the lib LS and this is like
all cool stuff LS core functions so
pretty much here the library of LS is
probably where the Ruby really core
functionality is going to lie and this
will hold all relevant source files
let's just assume this is a C++ project
it's gonna hold all relevant source
files to build this library alright so
now let's look at the binary and
obviously we already know what the
binary is gonna be called the binary
it's called LS like you guys know it yep
we always type LS so the binary is
called LS and this is gonna be a little
different than the library source files
remember binaries have to be executable
so they have to have a main function if
you don't know what a main function is
it's just like this is kind of like C or
C++ 101 but any type of executable needs
a main so pretty much the main is going
to be pretty simple here it's just going
to be maybe handles some basic
parameters like you know you can pass in
flags to LS takes in various flags hand
those basic parameters and calls into
the library because most of the goodies
are going to be up here in the core
library of LS
the executable itself is pretty much
just a little wrapper on top of this so
it might handle some basic user
parameters but in the end it just calls
into the library so all the guts in the
source code is going to be in this
directory let's move on okay so next
major part of any project is a test
directory of course you're gonna want to
test your code it's not only source
files it's also going to be some testing
files and normally you'd always
namespace this a little similarly you
don't have to do this but I usually like
doing this you namespace it a little
similarly to your source directory so
you actually know exactly what you're
gonna test and if the library is here
we're gonna have some tests for the
library down here and the test is also
gonna consist of various files here and
one important thing to know is that the
test itself is going to be an executable
file so there has to be a main
executable file along with these tests
because remember we actually have to run
the tests the tests eventually once this
thing is built it's gonna run and it's
gonna say good or bad the test is not a
library so the test itself is testing
the library up here but what you guys
have to realize as all unit tests that
you built or any test any system they're
all executable files and they need a
main ok so this project is pretty simple
we'll have a couple tests that's gonna
test our core library all these good LS
core functions and all that source code
for the tests is gonna need exist inside
this test directory alright hope that's
clear let's just keep moving on the next
directory that's this is actually a
temporary directory let's just talk
about it real quick this is the build
the directory and what the build
directory usually holds is temporary
building files and this is kind of
pervasive to any language but if you
guys have done C or C++ before you know
that all these source files will get
translated to object files so do
dot o or object files are an example of
temporary build files that you don't
write these are generated by the
compilation or the build system and
usually you want to place all temporary
build files inside a special directory
because you know they're temporary and
when people talk about clean when
someone cleans a build what that really
means is you kind of remove all
temporary files so for if we were to
clean this project in particular it
might just remove all files inside this
directory so you always need a directory
like this and it holds all the you know
intermittent files that are coming and
going getting auto-generated for you by
the system so that all goes under here
okay actually I want to talk about third
party first before I talk about include
directory because I think that ordering
makes more sense so we'll talk about
third party then include and then
artifacts I'm actually running out of
time I still have this 15 minute cap to
this video so I'm just gonna make a part
two while I'm at it and hopefully it's
not too destroyed but I'm gonna stop the
video now I'm gonna start afresh part
two of the same exact topic and I'll
finish up the discussion there alright
guys so I'll see you in that next video
if you're still sticking around alright
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
