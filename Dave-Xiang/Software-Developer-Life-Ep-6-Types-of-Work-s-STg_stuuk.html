everyone had a great week
haven't made one of these software
developer videos in a while so it's time
to do another one this video we're gonna
talk about what exactly you might work
on if you decide to go into software so
many of you watching may still be
involved in academics whether it's being
in school being prepared to go to school
or whatever it is or whatever stage
you're in but doing software in an
academic setting is very different from
writing software in a professional
setting so this video I'm just gonna go
through six six common areas that
software engineers might work on also
random note this is six in Chinese so if
you ever go to like a restaurant and you
want to seem super cool you can order
six dumplings like that alright just
random side note without further ado
let's just get into it okay first one
let's just do the easiest first and
number one is going to be bug fixes and
these are unavoidable something went
wrong in the code maybe you missed this
really really edge case this area pretty
self-explanatory one point I just want
to make is that no one and I mean no one
100% of software engineers no one writes
bug-free code there are bugs all the
time in every single software that we
use every day we just have to accept it
this is exactly why we have our packages
updated for Linux or we have Windows
updates or Mac updates everyone is
always improving and fixing bugs all the
time I think it's funny when people get
upset that oh there's this problem with
Twitter calm or Facebook calm is not
working we don't realize is that behind
facebook.com it's just another set of
developers just like you working on that
code and they're not gonna be writing
bug-free code so just give everyone a
break all right ideal way of fixing this
which is much easier said than done but
you should write a test which
demonstrates the bug and fails before
you fix the bug then you fix the code
test should pass you should be good to
go okay so that's just number one bug
fixing number two on this list is going
to be touch-ups or some people call it
polish which is another essential but
sometimes a little less sexy part of
development touch-ups usually don't
affect the raw functionality of your
software but it's just to make things
look good and give it that finishing
touch usually if you're working heavily
with product managers or you're working
heavily with designers they're gonna
want you to touch up all those visuals
really well the color is not right over
there or this animation speed is a
little bit off or our spacing just
doesn't quite look right so all in all
this is also pretty simple my message is
just the respect to your co-workers
respect to design their respective
product people let them do their job
they're trying to design the work and
you as an engineer have to be
responsible to do polish and do these
touch-ups when necessary do you guys
think Apple got to where they are today
by ignoring touch-ups touch-ups are
pervasive throughout everything okay
it's visual all the way down to hardware
so just touch up your work pay respect
to that okay well on to number three
which is new feature new features are
kind of cool because you're adding a new
functionality to an existing project it
can be really small or become really big
but it's usually a pretty fun thing to
work on features are usually done by a
single developer normally if something
takes more than one developer is usually
a much bigger scope than just a new
feature examples of this could be like
brand-new searching functionality on
your webpage or a cool new settings or
level in your game new features are
always required to make whatever you're
working on better make the software
better or make the product better but
just be very careful because adding new
features too quickly is the best way to
incur technical debt which leads us into
number four the fourth thing that
software engineers usually work on is
something called
factoring refactoring can really be a
hit or miss it could be pretty fun to
rework some of the code or you might
want to kill yourself with refactoring
on the outside from everyone else's
point of view not much changes but the
whole point of refactoring is that
internally you're making things a lot
better even if you can't see the results
on the outside
refactoring could come about for many
different reasons perhaps someone left
and left a large amount of code
unattended to which needs to be
refactored and understood or maybe the
software just went like down the tubes
and it just needs to be reworked the key
thing about refactoring is that it
should be a very iterative constant
process you don't want to build it up
and then have to refactor a huge chunk
of software that's always bad like
remember to be a good engineer or be a
good coder if you see something wrong
and just fix it right away we're
factoring and reworking is a constant
process and if you just let it pile up
it's gonna be a really bad time if some
software has gone really bad rewriting
it is 99% of the time not the right
choice you have to refactor and rework
it so just be cognizant of that and
remember that the first time you write
something it's not gonna be very good
even the first five times you write it
it might not be very good so this is
just the constant process and really
value it okay we're at category five now
and this is going to be performance and
optimization changes this type of work
is normally a little later stage or
late-game but if something's already
working but it's not quite performant
enough you might have to do some kind of
optimization work your task for this
type of work is just to improve the
performance of an existing feature or
application the key takeaway of this
part is not do it too early I'm sure
everyone has heard of pre optimization
and that's very bad the only thing that
makes optimization even possible is that
if you can measure what it was before
and compared to what it was after and if
you can't even measure it there's no
point in trying to
optimize it performance and optimization
changes are also very big in scope they
can be from very small and they can also
be very large changes it can be as small
as just adding a couple miss indices on
your database maybe you want to cache a
couple key calculations and it can go as
big as you maybe have to refactor a ton
of code to get the level of
optimizations you want all right last
one
number six number six and we saved the
best one for last but this is going to
be green field projects this means we're
starting a code base or new project
entirely from scratch and this is really
rare but also really fun this is a
really cool and exciting type of work
and it usually happens where this
technology doesn't even exist right now
and you've been tasked to just start it
fresh or green field even though this is
really exciting this type of work also
comes probably with the most
responsibility so if you're tasked with
this make sure to break it up set some
milestones make sure to talk with your
team right it's a it's a lot of fun but
it's also a lot of responsibility the
main reason why this is fun starting a
project from scratch is that you really
don't have any legacy code to worry
about everything you write is new it's
just really fun you make every single
decision you have no dependencies on
this old crappy code that's been sitting
there for a while all I would say is
that when you're doing something like
this if you're working on a greenfield
project just make sure to do as best job
you can because it's only a green field
once and the next person to come along
you don't want have to say oh my god
this code is so crappy because that's
gonna be your crappy code all right guys
that was the end of the video six basic
areas or topics that you might work in
or being involved with if you decide to
go into software this is not a
comprehensive list I just wanted to hit
six big categories and let's just recap
it really quickly first one is fixing
bugs this always happens there's always
going to be bugs so just accept it
you're always gonna be fixing bugs
touch-ups is sometimes a little more
relevant for consumer-facing
applications or people that write code
that is actually visual but just wanted
to put this on the list because you have
to pay respect to the touch-ups if you
want to build software that makes any
money so always respect this part if
you're working on it
third we had new features which is
always a lot of fun more fun than fixing
a bug probably just be very careful
about adding these too quickly because
it could incur a lot of debt
number four we talked about was
refactoring code this should always be
an iterative process that's happening
all the time if you see it just fix it
and don't let it pile up okay
refactoring number five was performance
or optimization changes these can be
pretty fun because it's kind of like
solving a puzzle to make something
perform better just make sure you
measure things well and don't try to
optimize things when you're not ready
for it last but not least we had
Greenfield or new projects these are the
most fun you don't have to deal with
anyone else's code just make sure if you
have the cool opportunity to work on one
of these projects just do the best job
you can and just communicate what you're
doing because people are gonna be
looking at your code for a long time
after you write it all right guys that's
the end of the video hoped you enjoyed
it gives a little bit of insight on what
you might potentially work on if you're
going to get into software please just
drop me a question if you have one
please hit the like button if you
enjoyed this video and subscribe for
more super cool videos or yeah you get
it alright see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
