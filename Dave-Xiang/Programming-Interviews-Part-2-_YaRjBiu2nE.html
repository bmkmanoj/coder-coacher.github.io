interview video this is just gonna be
talking about the interview if you're
coming straight to this part please
probably make more sense of you arch
watch part one first and if you just
came from part one yeah let's just
continue all right so you just executed
the interview search and hopefully at
this point the interview is landed to
some extent some kind of interview and
we're gonna just talk about in this
video a general but not specific flow to
what you can expect for this whole
process alright so let's just do it
the first one is going to be a screen on
the phone or a phone screen if you will
and this one's um usually pretty easy
and Misty usually conducted by HR or a
recruiter so a full screen is pretty
self-explanatory this is gonna be a
short fifteen to thirty minute call to
make sure you're not so this is pretty
self-explanatory just getting a feel for
what you're like as a person seeing what
you enjoy doing getting a feel for where
you've worked where you went to school
kind of things you're into you it's
gonna be a short 15 I mean a call but
it's just to make sure you're not you're
not a jerk alright so just be on your
best behavior do a little research about
the company itself and this this is the
easy part alright guys so let's just
move on to step two and get me past the
phone screen is not so bad unless you're
an incredible jerk in which case maybe
you have to work on that first alright
alright if the phone screen is all good
you'll be invited to have a technical
phone interview with probably another
engineer and first thing to know is this
is when the starts getting a little more
serious
so this is gonna probably be 45 to 60
minutes long conducted on Google Docs
versus coding you
and what is the purpose of a technical
phone review so pretty much this is the
first step the first step to really vet
you in your skills so many times as you
may know people tend to inflate
themselves on the resume or like talk up
a lot of game but maybe don't have the
skills to back it up so this is starting
to screen you based on everything you
said in your resume and making sure you
can do what you say you can do so this
is the companies filtering process to
make sure you're okay so this is the bet
you so this this is going to be pretty
serious and you should do a lot of prep
for these so prep I'm not going to get
into the details of the prep but
preparing for technical phone reviews
means practicing and like writing out
solutions to various problems in a kind
of stressful environment if you will and
making sure you're able to talk and work
through those problems and assess how
you're doing and how you can make your
solutions better so usually it could be
one big problem I know Google does like
one easy problem followed by one harder
problem so whatever they might do to vet
your skills as the developer this should
be taken very seriously so that's the
technical phone interview and let's move
on from there so if everything is good
from the phone screen and the technical
phone interview this is when you'll
probably be invited to an on-site
interview where they'll probably you
know - they'll probably fly you out to
some of their headquarters to conduct
real on-site interviews and meet real
people so this is the last but last but
also probably hardest part of getting
the job and most of the decisions based
on whether or not you get her or not
lives on step three okay so everything
that happens in this step is gonna
determine if you get it or not
so let's just kind of talk about what
this may or may not sorry entail you'll
probably go through four to five
interviews with various people on the
engineers so this will take either half
a day or a full day I've seen you know
maybe only three interviews that's on
the low side going up to like five six
interviews for the whole day and you'll
be meeting a lot of different people not
just engineers so just be prepared for
that and have a variety of questions
ready because you'll be discussing a
variety of topics so one important note
that I want to say here is that each
interview is culture fit so they're
trying to vet your skills still and make
sure you have all the programming
expertise you say you do but every
single interview is going to be
considering how you're gonna fit into
their work environment culture fit is a
kind of a weird word I think you guys
know that just a bit but treat every
interview as a culture fit so they were
gonna be considering you too so like
every interview whether it's coding or
not somebody's gonna be like okay this
guy is somebody I could or could not
work with so but let's just go into some
categories so let's just go into a
couple categories and these are little
genres or themes or various interviews
that you might go through on site so
first one straight-up more coding more
involved coding if you didn't do enough
coding on the technical phone interview
you're probably asked to do even more
coding on the on-site this could be
whiteboarding problems just writing on a
whiteboard with someone this could also
be real pair programming with a computer
and actually getting
things working so this must be kind of a
new thing
I interviewed a job not too long ago
maybe I forget what it was but we
actually did some real programming like
there's a computer there that had all
this stuff open you had to just sit I
had to sit with somebody right through
some code you know they were like oh I
what's the syntax for that just google
it it was almost like real-life
situation if you will like googling
force in tech C forget and actually
getting something really working on a
computer which is on like I don't when
you whiteboard you talk through a
solution and you don't really write like
optimal syntax if you will but sometimes
you do stuff like this where you gotta
get something actually practically
working which is cool so just be
prepared so you're gonna have more
coding interviews that tech doesn't stop
at the technical phone screen so be
prepared for additional coding so what's
next
there's also CS fundamentals which is
kind of like stuff from school this
might be a little less coding just
purely asking questions asking you to
explain words key concepts you know what
does this word mean so this is just
stuff you learn from school make sure
you're still sharp on any classes with
this because at any point in time
somebody can ask you some fundamental
questions all right
system architecture another common
category that let's talk about is um
aside from the nitty gritty details
there's also software design and my kind
of system level questions where an
interviewer will ask you hypothetical
questions of how to design maybe a
integrated system with many moving parts
like different features and dependencies
or requirements so this part is kind of
more of a design question and these are
a little fun this also this is not
coding probably more whiteboarding or
just discussion but this is designing a
whole system and see how well you fare
there it's kind of like taking a you
know
you'd solve the problems making sure you
can install problems with a general
mindset all right what else is there
there's usually a lunch or casual
interviews with non engineers and these
are the ones that are especially
important for a culture fit everything
is a culture fit but if you interview
anyone that is not an engineer they're
specifically trying to see what you're
kind of like as a person they might take
you out to lunch or what have you but
just be wary of that so even things like
happy hour I mean if you get invited to
happy hour or anything kind of social is
very good but you should still always
consider it as you're being interviewed
and they're still considering you for a
job so you could do everything well you
go to happy hour you have like three
beers and you just you know screw
yourself over it's totally possible so
just making note of that so those are a
couple quick categories of what you
might expect on the on-site interview so
just be prepared for these type of
themes and you know think of some
questions yourself revolving these
categories all right let's move on
another important point to note for the
on-site interviews vacant I've seen this
happen before it's kind of bad but
remember that no one's here to waste
anyone's time if you're invited to an
on-site interview and somehow they find
that you're not gonna be a fit after
interview 2 or 5 it's likely that the
interview process could terminate maybe
halfway in the middle or something like
this um I mean this is okay this just
decision was made that you wouldn't be a
good fit so just this this sucks I know
but sometimes this is gonna happen and
we'll just put that there so I touched
upon this briefly before but another
really important point that I want to
put down here is questions and compile a
good set of questions
the topics so questions question
questions are especially interim portent
for the interview process questions
about the company questions about their
technical capabilities and questions are
pretty much a two-way street
it's really a way they're interviewing
you obviously but questions are way for
you to interview the company which is
almost equally which is equally
important you want to know everything
you can about that company and you do
that through questions let me write down
a couple points here companies
appreciate good questions it shows that
you actually took time to think about
how you might fit in or you took time to
think about them as a company so just
take some time brainstorm some good
questions and just be prepared with
those before you go into the on-site the
last point is kind of just a little like
not really a trick but just just
something to watch out for if everything
goes well someone so this is kind of one
way to tell if everything is going well
but at the end of your interview if a
boss or decision maker or what-have-you
comes in to really try to sell you the
position again it means you've done
something if this is happening you've
done something good so at the end of the
whole process if there's someone trying
to sell you on the position or telling
you why it's so good to work here or
whatever whatever that means you did
something good if at the end of
interviews kind of ends maybe not so
good so if at the end of your five or
six interviews it kind of ends abruptly
and you just kind of maybe move on maybe
it's not so good it depends how much
they want to sell you so just be on the
lookout for this and if you see this
happening it just means you're in good
shape because they want to come they
want to do the best to convince you to
work here so I guess just watch out for
Point G but point H is a little sad so
alright guys um that's kind of all I had
for the actual interview process
themselves going from screen to
technical phone interview to on-site
interviews and kind of giving a rough
guideline of what an on-site interview
may be like once you actually get there
and what to expect there's other small
parts of this process including like
follow-up negotiation that you I think
you can do some more research about and
furthermore there's also a whole realm
of interview questions just like
preparing for them what type of
questions you should be prepared for and
practice on your own that's kind of work
that you should do on your own again I
would recommend this book which is a
great book for all this stuff we covered
plus practice stuff so yeah check out
this book if you're in this process
because if you're watching this video
and you're into software at all you will
go through this process many times over
and you think you'll just do it once and
get a job but the moment you know you
leave that job and you're trying to find
some other opportunities this whole
thing starts up again you know like
there's it all starts up again so just
pay attention to this because it's all
really important so I'll post up this
link in the YouTube video I hope this
video is helpful if for anyone going
through this process and see everyone
next time alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
