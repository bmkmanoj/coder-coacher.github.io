had a really really great week haven't
made one of these videos in a while but
I wanted to make a video on software
developer life and add to this series
the topic of this video is going to
revolve around getting on people's good
terms at the company and this is a
little cater towards bigger companies or
big corporations so what I'm gonna do in
this video is just for count or share an
experience that I had when I first
joined a company straight out of college
and one of the things I went through the
whole purpose of the video is gonna
revolve around that story so I'm gonna
share it first talk about it and
hopefully it's useful alright let's do
it
whenever we join something new it's
always a little bit stressful right
whenever we're starting something new
especially if you're starting at a
brand-new company the one thing on your
mind or the one thing that's always on
my mind is how can I add value or how
can I be not useless as fast as possible
so while those thoughts are on your mind
those are the same thoughts on everyone
else's mind around you right when you
start is when other people form their
opinions about you and they're thinking
hmm so how good is that guy really to
see useless is he smart people do not
value your work or people don't really
respect you upfront until you prove it
so going along those lines it's actually
really easy for people to dismiss you as
well the people closest to you like your
team member so your immediate team
member so they're gonna be really
helpful ramp you up but the people that
are a little further away in different
departments and different teams
altogether
they're actually gonna dismiss you when
you're the new guy all right so I think
you guys are getting the gist of what
I'm trying to say here for the rest of
the video I'm just gonna share one
experience I had had a company when I
was the new guy and how I was kind of
easily dismissed by other people and how
I kind of overcame that so now I'm just
gonna get into this story and hopefully
it's helpful so when I was first
starting my job I was an embedded
developer working on really really
low-level code but there was this really
there was a really really subtle bug
that was affecting my code or our team's
code and that bug was actually in
another team's code so it sounds like a
pretty simple solution right
go to the other team ask them to fix the
bug and everything's gonna be okay right
but it's not so simple so this bug was
really subtle it didn't happen all the
time and it wasn't one of those
deal-breaker hits the fan type of
bug it was kind of like it's okay we can
push that off till later so it wasn't
too serious of a bug and it could kind
of be fixed manually whenever it
happened so for a long long time we just
dealt with this bug whenever it came up
when it happened someone on the other
team would just come and fix it and be
like okay it's fixed this time but we
never really fixed the root cause of it
which is really annoying so I kind of
did what you're probably expecting what
is reasonable thing to do when the bug
first came up I went to the other team
and I was like hey guys there's this bug
in your code can you check it out real
quick the guy was like oh yeah yeah yeah
I know about that I'm gonna fix it I'll
fix it don't worry about it I'll get to
it so you can probably guess what
happened but the bug never actually got
fixed and it just kept popping up again
like every couple weeks or every couple
days it just popped up again and every
time I would ask the team to fix this
thing they would just give me the same
answer just like yeah I'll fix it I'll
get to it you know fix it sorry sorry I
forgot last time so there's kind of two
things at play going on here right first
it's just this bug and it's whatever
software bug it's not really a big deal
that happens all the time but the deeper
issue the real deeper issue that came
into this situation is choosing not to
fix the bug because I brought it up and
this is what's a little tricky maybe
it's cuz I was just the new guy and
whatever I said he just didn't really
take it too seriously so he didn't think
it was a problem
maybe the other guy had a lot of other
important things to work on and this was
the least of his worries so you can
imagine after a while I was getting a
little frustrated this other bug from
this other team which they've
acknowledged was affecting our code
every now and then I was just getting
annoyed it wasn't getting fixed every
time I asked those the same answer and
damn it finally after a couple months of
this and I just stopped asking to fix
this bug but there was a very specific a
really really explicit turning point
when kind of everything changed
there was a separate issue not related
to the bug at all but there's the thing
that my team needed to do to help out
the other team which that guy was on so
I'm gonna get a little technical here
just really quickly but there's a lot of
teams working on a lot of different sets
of code but when you compile all that
code comes together into one binary so
you can imagine six teams working on all
different parts of code when it all gets
compiled it turns into this one this one
file I was pretty familiar with our
compilation system and how things were
linked and compiled and all that stuff
so I wrote a script to actually kind of
deconstruct that file and give a good
report and good insight on what's
actually going on inside this file so my
script the thing that I wrote was
actually useful for a lot of different
teams so what I did was I knew this
script would be particularly
particularly useful for that guy with
the bug so I just I just gave him the
script I was like hey man I think this
would be useful for you
I wrote this script to deconstruct that
file check it out when you have a spare
time and let me know the guy actually
really really liked the script he said
it was really useful helped him out with
his day to day stuff and he was actually
really happy with what it did literally
less than a week probably one week or
less than a week less than a week after
I gave that guy this script that I wrote
to help him out that three month bug he
just fixed it in like a day and
furthermore after this time after I gave
him that script first anything that
would happen between our two teams or
anything that would affect our code
though was actually a bug in their code
he would fix it really fast all right
that's the that's the end of the story
but the major takeaway the one takeaway
I just want to give with this story and
about getting on people's good terms is
that you'd be surprised how much you can
gain if you just give a little first so
what actually happened here like I'm a
new engineer new guy I was just
bothering this person like hey Q fix the
bug hey Q fix the bug again hey Q fix
the bug but instead of just asking
something from it instead of just
expecting some
from him and expecting him to do this
for me what I did was I just gave him
something added some value to his day
which is completely unrelated and it
changed the whole dynamic of the
relationship maybe the guy was like oh
that new engineer is not useless like I
thought he was maybe he finally
respected me because I showed him that I
could actually write some code that
would help him out so whatever it might
be whatever kind of changed there's
definitely something that kind of
switched in his mind right he went from
kind of dismissing ignoring my request
to fixing things fast when I brought it
up to him and it was definitely that one
moment I can definitely trace that
moment back to me giving him that one
script where something switched in his
head all in all the main thing that I
learned from this experience is that you
can't just always expect someone to do
things for you even if it's their
problem what you should try to do is
just be really giving like do your thing
give value to other people and they're
gonna reciprocate it and if they don't
reciprocate anything then they're just
an asshole and you don't have to work
with them all right guys that's if today
hope you enjoy the video just a little
bit of a story and kind of a lesson this
was a really big turning point for me
and my software developer software
software engineer life or whatever but
this exact moment when I kind of figure
this out it definitely helped boost a
lot of my relationships so another
episode a software developer life if
you're the new person you will be
dismissed pretty often but you can get
over it and it's not going to be a
permanent thing all right if someone
permanently dismisses you there just
forget about that person but I hope you
enjoyed the video please like the video
leave me a comment subscribe all that
stuff and see everyone next week all
right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
