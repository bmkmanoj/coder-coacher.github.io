doing well today we're going to cover a
pretty big topic and that's
understanding programming languages a
little better all right so we're just
going to cover really really basic
fundamentals and things that we should
all understand about programming
languages all right
let's do it the first thing we're going
to do is we're just going to categorize
different programming languages and
we're going to start from the bottom and
go all the way to the top the lowest
lowest level of a language are machine
instructions and these are literally
ones and zeros that you're not supposed
to understand it would look like
gibberish if you ever looked at it but
these are purely instructions that a
computer understands if you looked at
this it would be like 1 0 0 1 0 0 and
what that means is add these two numbers
so these type of instructions or machine
level code is supposed to be interpreted
by a machine not a human ok so this is
the lowest lowest lowest level of a
language let's take it one step further
and mention assembly languages and what
assembly languages really are is just a
really really simple wrapper on top of
machine code so if you're working with
an assembly level language instead of
writing 1 0 0 1 0 0 you can really write
add 2 plus 3 and it'll translate it down
to machine instruction so assembly is
still really really low-level it's still
really primitive but it's still a
language and it's one level above
machine code alright so let's take our
languages and move it one step higher
and we're going to talk about system
languages how do we define exactly what
a system language is well a system
language is anything that we use to
program the actual computer system
itself which includes things like the
operating system or device drivers if
you're programming the actual computer
like how the actual computer works you
usually use system languages and one of
the most common system languages are C
and C++
ok so we're already at
last last level and this is the highest
level of programming language categories
and these are application languages or
high level languages so this category is
very very broad I've made it really
really general because many many
different programming languages kind of
fit into this category and these are
languages that you use to build consumer
facing applications usually like Excel
flappy bird Twitter examples of these
languages are usually Java Python or
Ruby but the major major takeaway that I
want us to understand from this point is
the fundamental difference between
system level languages and application
or high level languages system
programming and the languages that
usually tend to be used for system
programming like we mentioned C well
remember system programming is the act
of programming the computer itself and
how the computer system operates while
application level programming with
application like languages those are
used to build things that we use on a
day to day basis okay so what we just
covered is just a really really basic
categorization of languages when we
started from the bottom and now we went
all the way to the top we started that
machine level code that's interpreted
directly by the hardware all the way up
to high-level applications and
high-level programming each of these
categories has languages that lend
themselves to that category like for
systems programming you usually use C or
C++ for application programming you
usually use Python Ruby Java etc okay so
we've been really really general up to
this point and hopefully right now
you're getting a small intuition about
the different categories of languages
but we have to dive a little deeper and
talk about a really really really
important concept this is the concept of
compiled versus interpreted and it's
commonly misunderstood so we're just
going to clear it up right now with
compilation there's a very explicit step
called a compilation step in which your
source code gets translated to
gene code so if you wrote a program and
see usually you have to use a compiler
like GCC to translate all the text you
wrote into machine code that the
processor can execute the one major
takeaway of compiling is that there's an
explicit compilation step which
translates your source code into those
machine instructions ok so now what
exactly is interpretation or
interpreters well with interpreters
there's actually no explicit compilation
or translation step interpretation is
when another program commonly known as
an interpreter literally interprets your
program your source code line by line
and executes the right thing the major
difference actually the only difference
and most important thing you have to
realize is that for interpreted your
program never goes through a compilation
step so this ultimately leads us to like
one of the number-one points of
confusion between these two concepts and
that's that either languages can be
interpreted or compiled and this is like
a false notion remember that every
single programming language actually has
multiple implementations like if you
just take Ruby for example Ruby is a
programming language which means kind of
like it defines a nice grammar and
syntax for Ruby but actually there's
many many many different implementations
of Ruby if you just go on wiki and look
up Ruby implementations they'll be like
you know 20 30 40 maybe hundreds of
implementations this is analogous to
processor land if you guys remember that
a lot remember with processors we define
an instruction set architecture and
different processors implement the same
instruction set architecture so it's
very similar to how languages work in
that analogy okay so the number one
takeaway here is that a language itself
can't be defined as interpreted or
compiled it's the implementation of a
language that's interpreted or compiled
I know this sounds a little weird so
let's just take a couple examples and
hopefully clear things up if you're a
Python software developer the majority
of cases Python the implementations of
Python are interpreted you will write a
lot of Python source code and then
you'll usually run some Python
interpreter Python to Python 3 and
you'll just run your program and it will
do the right thing or spit out errors at
you well actually there's also
implementations which compile Python
code into machine code they're less
common than the interpreters but they do
exist so you could potentially use your
same Python code the same source code
that you wrote but you would use a
Python compiler which would compile
translate all that source code into
machine code so when that happens that
implementation is actually a compiled
version of Python alright guys so I hope
that that distinction was really clear
for everyone you cannot say a language
is either interpreted or compiled it's
the implementation of that language
that's either interpreted or compiled
and you know every language is really
different in each one means different
ways Python and Ruby are usually
interpreted and C and C++ are usually
compiled but it's not 100% of the time
also let's remember the different
categorizations of languages and we
started at the very bottom remember all
the way down at machine code or machine
instructions the system programming all
the way up to application programming
all right so we understand those basic
categories and now we understand
fundamentally what's the difference
between interpreted and compiled keep
the concepts of interpreted versus
compiled really really clearing your
head and it's going to make programming
much easier alright so yeah that's the
end of the video guys thanks for
watching hope you have a better
understanding and just intuition behind
what a programming language really is if
you liked the video just give me a like
down here or drop me a comment I hope
you guys have a great rest of the week
and I'll see you next time
alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
