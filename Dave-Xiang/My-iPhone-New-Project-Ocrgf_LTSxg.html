this week this is a really random video
I have another one that's processing so
stay tuned to this two things gonna talk
up I'm gonna talk about in this video
and just first show you guys my iPhone
and second talk about a new project I'm
working on which is probably much more
interesting than what's on my iPhone so
I'm gonna talk about the iPhone go
through this iPhone thing first cuz many
people have asked for some reason
they're interested to know what was on
my iPhone and then I also put a
timestamp for when I talk about this new
project so you can skip this nonsense if
you don't care anyway so I guess we can
go through this there's nothing crazy
there is nothing special about my iPhone
I'm just gonna run through this because
it was asked and uploaded for but let's
just do it so how do I even do this but
I guess we'll go from this is why I use
an iPhone this is iOS 10 if you're one
of those people that don't upgrade your
iOS ever I would suggest you upgrade
your software for anyone out there that
doesn't like upgrading software please
PLEASE upgrade it it's usually better
there's not some hidden agenda so let's
just go top to left and we'll just go
straight from the top to left left to
right and we'll go to the bottom I'll do
these two pages I only have two screens
and I'll just talk through some of these
apps and if anything is interesting I
will stop and talk about it a little bit
so App Store self-explanatory settings
self-explanatory you know my favorite
app is the settings no just just kidding
services let's see Shazam always useful
stocks always cool Amtrak Amtrak is like
the local I don't know if it's New
England or a lot but it's just like the
train service I use when I go back and
forth between New York and Boston Amtrak
is here buy tickets check status
I am DB and Fandango are just movie
services and I don't go out to see
movies very often so don't use these two
at all too much so entertainment
also some fun stuff we'll see I books I
do not use ebooks at all it's still in
here
Crossy Road is a pretty fun game which
is just Frogger so if you guys need to
kill some time
cross the road free endorsement zig zag
stack not as fun as cross the road but I
still have them coffee meets bagel
online dating app made by a couple or a
few really smart girls this app is
pretty good coffee meets bagel I've had
the most success with that one next one
tinder you guys all know what tinder is
no sucess with tender bumble no success
with bumble those are just the dating
apps can't open them
that'd be too crazy err console err
console is pretty fun err console is
this cool thing where you can use your
browser as a console and if you have air
console everyone can use their phones as
controllers and you can play with each
other and it's like a really cool party
game photos too personal calendar videos
notes I write a lot of notes I don't
know this is too personal so I don't
want to click on notes but I do write
and keep track of a lot of thoughts I
have and I usually put it in this notes
think of this syncs with my computer
YouTube cups cups also man more
endorsements but cups is a pretty cool
app where pretty much you can just
prepay for coffee and for select stores
like in the city at least in New York
and probably many other cities you can
just they support this prepaid thing so
if you buy some cups in this app you can
just take out use it as like coupons for
coffee when you go which is pretty fun
umm it's like cheaper than paying like
crazy New York City price for coffee
it's outrageous sometimes
Yelp is awesome I still use the app up
to this day if whoever is working behind
Yelp thank you for providing that
service for so many years it's still the
most consistent review system we have
whether Instagram selfie I don't use
Instagram Google Maps was super useful
facebook messenger music Pandora Spotify
nothing too interesting here whatsapp
use this with my friends for chat groups
WeChat is you know all the Chinese
people are WeChat so got to have that
slack is the professional version of
chat and medium medium is like for news
reading sites I used to use this a lot
more but I just recently haven't been
enjoying it too much because just all
the posts are very similar it's very
like techie Silicon Valley every like I
don't know this probably it knows to
give me these stories but all the
stories are like about startups about
tech stuff MacBook Pros just some kind
of nonsense of how I made 500 dollars
with a single medium post but to be
honest I haven't really had such a great
experience with like news apps on my
phones I I think Apple news is pretty
good but um even Apple news is like the
media just is not a good source
sometimes of news you have to actually
maybe dig and just go to publications
you actually care about but Apple news
is pretty good for iOS because Apple
makes it so obviously it's gonna look
pretty nice podcasts podcasts are
interesting so I can show you guys what
my podcasts I listened to are and you
know if you guys listen to podcast I
think it's an awesome way to just like
digest some info partially examine
philosophy podcasts they just it's a
bunch of people sitting roundtable and
they just talk about random
philosophical ideas it's interesting
sometimes revision is history some
Malcolm Gladwell's podcasts you know a
lot of people hate on the sky but I do
think some of this stuff is like pretty
interesting very different perspective
and like I respect him for having a very
different opinion but people hate this
guy for some reason art of charm 99%
invisible is an awesome podcast like if
there was one podcast in this list that
you guys should check out 99% invisible
is awesome planted money is also awesome
it's a little less awesome introvert
entrepreneur it's really good though a
lot of the content for this one is the
same for and I don't know it's very
similar content so I think it's gotten a
little worse stuff you should know
it's okay though some of the hosts are
very annoying on that podcast and This
American Life radio lab Freakonomics oh
this one is also awesome Ted Radio Hour
so what I guess the people at Ted did
was they pretty much condensed really
long TED Talks into podcasts so like
these are just short snippets of like
TED Talks and each one of these might be
like three TED Talks
into one podcast so and it's really
awesome it's like condensed summarized
and you don't have to watch like a
really really long TED talk to get that
information so Ted Radio Hour
really awesome okay social stuff I don't
use this at all
extras is nothing apples nothing
productivity is also nothing manual is
just like a custom camera app that lets
you use the more lens features what else
is I'm sorry guys this is really boring
Dunkin Donuts the only reason why I have
Dunkin Donuts app is that they give out
free coffee through this app when
football teams win so if like the
Patriots win a football game they give
you a free medium coffee through this
app which is you know it's free coffee
one password is the password management
tool I use so this is just one password
unlocks all my passwords I'm sure you
guys track so many different passwords
so this is just like a simple way to
just keep track of them I don't remember
hundreds of passwords I just remember
this one password but if that one's
compromised that I'm pretty screwed
FaceTime snapchat I don't use snapchat
very often I just watch my friends
stories but I never make stories lyft
uber venmo awesome apps I'm sure you
guys know what lyft and uber are just
like startups that really added real
value these are I really respect all
these apps here especially like
something like uber it's just an insane
operation to manage like not just the
software just the company itself and
managing something at that scale is just
crazy and you like very impressive so
venmo online payments NYC subway have to
have the subway updates in the map when
you need it
TaskRabbit is also an amazing app it's
kind of like if you want any random
thing done you can get it done in like
really a short amount of time handyman
30 minutes moving 30 minutes delivery or
whatever it's kind of like a curse of
New York City but a lot of people just
get all this stuff done for them but
TaskRabbit also is like a crazy
operation it's like on demand anything
others think about that and that's
really crazy forks over knives is like
healthy food recipes I never use that
because I don't cook rode recorder is a
just a recording tool that I used to
record our do you know I'm the little
Mike I have is like a road lavalier it's
not that good I need to research a
better one but it's the best I have
right now
SoundCloud sound cows okay they're app
crashes a lot I don't I just it crashes
a lot
Aaron B&amp;amp;B air B&amp;amp;B awesome app smart news
is another news thing that's not quite
as good Kakao Talk
to talk to Korean friends I've never
used the new Apple home stuff before but
I heard it could be pretty cool oh crap
and yeah and finally Facebook I don't
press Facebook that often just because I
can tote I you can tell when Facebook is
open because it drains so much battery
and it probably just uses so much
network probably caches so much stuff
probably I bet most of the memory on
this phone is just for Facebook doing
stuff and yeah that's a crazy yep and
what else is interesting I like Google
now if you guys don't use Google now I
think this is just such a convenient way
to search for anything so I don't try I
don't use Safari I don't use Chrome I
use Google now because it's just faster
to use on the phone anyways crap that's
already 11 minutes but it's okay for
this silly video all right so one more
interesting thing I want to
one more interesting thing I want to
talk about is uh this new project I'm
working on and why it's interesting is
because I think the direct audience for
this project is actually you guys or
anyone that might be interested or
thinks my content on YouTube is helpful
so what I'm trying to do is I'm working
on a book revolved around software
developer life so you can kind of
imagine it as that software developer
life series I've been making on YouTube
more of that altogether in a book one
thing that I'm also trying to doing
trying to do is that I'm interviewing a
lot of my friends in tech so a lot of
anyone I know at a tech company which is
almost any company these days I'm trying
to interview them and get their
perspective and hear what they have to
say like stuff they've been through
crazy things good things like just
getting a little bit into their life
about what it's been like and I'm taking
all that stuff plus my own stuff and I'm
taking all that stuff and I'm trying to
get the best like a highlight reel like
the best stuff into one book and the
audience for that book is um you know
you guys anyone that might be interested
in any of that stuff so that's been my
project recently and it should be
finished by 2017 it's a year but no I've
just been doing research gathering a
little bit of writing but I'm like just
trying to get us much good content
together as I can so that's like a new
project I'm working on like a lot of
people ask me what I work on on the side
I don't do any of that coding projects
anymore I used to do a lot more I just
don't code too much on the side as I
used to I still do a lot of coding and
work but on the side just not so much
but I'm really excited about this book
I'm working on and like I really think
it's gonna be helpful just because you
guys listen to me make these videos but
it's just my perspective like that's
just one out of so many perspectives and
like everyone has good advice to share
so this book hopefully is gonna tap into
like other people's things and I'm gonna
go I'm also gonna take the best stuff
that I managed to like accumulate over
time and all put it in there so more
updates on that
but 2017 I'm gonna let you guys know
when that's like coming out and that's
one of the projects I'm working on so
anyways
oh it's been a pretty long video I'm
working on another video it's actually
processing right now which is why I
decided to make this like silly video
but watch out for that next video is
probably coming out today or tomorrow
and see you guys alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
