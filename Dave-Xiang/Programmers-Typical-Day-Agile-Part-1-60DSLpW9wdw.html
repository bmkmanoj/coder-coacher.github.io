been doing well and you've had a great
week trying to talk about a pretty
common and frequent question I've been
asked recently which is about the day to
day or daily life of a code or program
or software engineer any of those words
so first before I say anything in this
video the first thing I just want to
mention is that answering this question
of what the typical day is like is super
dynamic and it's gonna change across any
person any engineer any team any company
so it's just something that's really
dynamic and whatever I say here it's not
going to be what's applicable to all
those situations alright so what I want
to do is just kind of give my reference
point of two years I've spent working on
this agile team and what that was like
and what I did on a typical day and
hopefully that's gonna be a good
baseline or reference for anyone that
might be interested in what daily life's
like alright so let's just get started
all right so first thing that we have to
talk about is this word agile agile
however you say it but it's a word it's
one of those software words that's
thrown around a lot and it carries a lot
of different meanings people interpret
it and implement it in very different
ways but what it pretty much is is just
a software development methodology if
you will it's kind of just one way to go
about implementing a software project
but it's not the only way it just
happens to be kind of popular it's a
little buzzy and this word that's thrown
around a lot so what it really means
it's pretty simple so what agile means
is that software has changed and
released pretty rapidly in either one
week or two weeks cycles so the software
is very flexible or agile because it's
changing very often and it's getting
released with new updates very often I
think back in the day maybe some years
ago the software process might have been
like new updates every three months
every six months and it was very slow so
the only thing about agile is its
so how is it exactly faster and what is
it really entail so we're just gonna go
through a couple points of what my team
at the time interpreted it to mean and
what we did so let's just get started
with a okay so the core one of the core
ideas behind agile is this idea of a
sprint which just represents a period in
time and for my team a sprint it was two
weeks and what exactly is a Sprint's
well I guess a sprint would be
considered like a raw development cycle
time and you would measure all your
development in respect to a sprint so
it's like oh I have a couple easy tasks
I can finish it in one sprint oh crap I
have something huge to do maybe this is
gonna take two or three Sprint's to do
so sprinting is just kind of like a
delineation or granularity level of
development and it's commonly two weeks
I've never seen it or I've never done it
when it's not two weeks so I'm putting
in two weeks here but just consider it
as a raw development cycle the next
important point of agile is the release
process so the release process actually
starts immediately after each sprint
completes so our release process was one
week to finish a release so what this
means is that immediately after a
sprints is complete a release process is
gonna start from that sprint which takes
one week and at the end of that week
we'll have an official release that's
out that encompasses all the features in
the sprint that we worked on right
before then so if you kind of got that
it's kind of like sprint development
then release sprint then release sprint
and release and it kind of just
alternates like that forever
almost all right so we'll talk more
about released later it was actually a
different team that handles the release
cycle versus a team s during the sprint
which is the more development but I'll
talk more about how different teams
handle the releases
soon so let's just keep going through
some of these points stand-up meetings
are also pretty common in this kind of
agile environment we had three stand-up
meetings a week Monday Wednesday Friday
right in the morning when we got in and
they were all about 15 to 20 minutes
long so what exactly is a stand-up
meeting well you physically stand up so
you're not really in a chair they make
you stand up around like a whiteboard
usually and you do like this sort of
like go around the circle and everyone
shares but the reason why it's so quick
is that everyone on the team only shares
like one or two minutes of what they've
been working on and what's blocking them
so the most important point of a
stand-up meeting is to make sure
everyone can continue their work and
they're not blocked by any way so you
know if I'm working along and it's like
oh crap
Joe didn't finish that feature he's
supposed to do and now I can't do my
work some urgent thing like that you
would probably bring it up at a stand-up
meeting and it's just like an easy way
for the whole team to sync up quickly in
the mornings all right so this happened
three times a week for us Monday
Wednesday Fridays and it was right in
the morning going off of that we also
had more more real standard meetings
like team meetings like weekly team
meetings where people would go more in
depth of exactly what they're working on
what they're gonna do for the next week
what they did in the previous week and
this is a like more of a standard
meeting if you will when everyone gets
around and talks in depth of what
they're doing so we had that once a week
anyways let's keep going
all right so let's just touch back on
this release cycle real quick so let's
just think about a development team
doing sprints all right so we're working
in these like two weeks two weeks two
weeks two weeks two weeks and for
developers
the Sprint's are back-to-back so when we
would finish a two-week sprint we would
start the next sprint and after that two
weeks we would start the other sprint
but like I said there's a different team
that handles releases right and those
releases start exactly after one of the
Sprint's ended so if F is the timeline
for developers the release team or we
called them the ops or QA team it would
be like a two-week sprint from dev and
then they would work one week to make
the release happen and so forth so there
would be another two weeks sprint sorry
this is just weird typing another sprint
from development and they would work the
week after for development so you might
be asking oh wait that cycle doesn't
work because they're actually chilling
for a whole week right because if you
check out this pattern if they only make
a release after our Sprint's they're
actually chilling for another week right
so are they actually chilling well no
they're not actually chilling because
how our team was actually structured
with how our team was structured was
that many many different teams were on
the sprint cycles but there was actually
one release team handling like five
different software projects so if you
imagine that one team is handling the
releases for five different software
projects and five software projects are
all on this sprinting schedule then
there's definitely no time to chill for
the release team so they're always
preparing testing and releasing updates
to the software and the developers
everyone's a developer but the people on
the Sprint's are always doing
back-to-back sprints so that's kind of
how we structured it so hopefully you
got that just said that the cycle is a
little weird but hopefully that made
sense the next thing I want to bring up
and we're going to talk more about it
down here is this concept of ticketing
which is also super important to agile
and it's one of the most like annoying
things any developer will say
but pretty much we use this system
called JIRA JIRA is a pretty popular one
is just one of many ticketing software
and what are tickets but tickets are
pretty much way to track your tasks in
progress so they can be called task
management systems ticketing systems but
pretty much it's just like a one-stop
shop way to track all your tasks and how
you've been progressing and working on
them so they track pretty much
everything they track like which tasks
have you not started which tasks have
you actually started which ones did you
reject which ones are you actually
working on which ones have you completed
which ones have you tested they track
these things in like crazy amounts of
detail and it gives you know everybody's
working on a bunch of tickets at the
same time so and once so many people are
working on so many different things you
do need some way to track at all and
usually you use some kind of software to
track it and we use this thing called
JIRA which is a little crappy I don't
use it anymore but yeah that's something
that's also essential for the system to
work and last but not least what I want
to mention is that everything I
mentioned here in the Sprint's this is
just one software team like we had four
developers going on one sprint sexual we
had four developers doing one schedule
of sprinting but there were five teams
of four developers each on their own
schedule so you can just multiply this
whole thing out X 5 X 10 and you can
imagine all the stuff that's going on so
that is some core agile stuff but I
think we talked about that enough and
let's just keep moving on to some other
daily activities ok so the next section
that I want to talk about is the ops
sometimes called DevOps
or QA this was all bundled under one
team that we called the release team
this is just the naming it's just how we
named it but obviously let me just talk
about what it encompassed first we
already talked about under the
a section that this team was responsible
for the release cycle of all our
software which is extremely important
like making sure all those releases are
well tested run well all that good stuff
so we already kind of talked about this
point but they test code at the end of
each sprint and prepare release so you
can imagine all these different software
teams are doing their sprints
week after week the leafs team has to
keep up and make sure they prepare the
official version updates for all these
teams like V One V one point one V one
point two and they're doing that all day
every day so that's part of their work I
just also want to talk about other
responsibilities this team had that were
really important to the overall software
project let's just go through them so
another thing they do is they do kind of
IT system work and what this means for
developers is that every single
developer especially when the project is
really big everyone has to work in the
same environment or all things get like
batshit crazy so everyone's computer has
to more or less be set this setup the
same to make development a lot easier
you can just imagine if like if there's
like 30 developers working on one
project and they just start customizing
their machines installing custom
software installing custom libraries and
just going you know getting really
custom with their environment some stuff
is gonna work on some computers some
stuffs not gonna work on other computers
and it's just gonna be like a
development nightmare so another thing
that this release team was responsible
for is making sure everyone's computer
or everyone's system was that was set up
the same so what that means was same
Linux same packages same libraries etc
every one we tried to this is easier
said than done but another thing that
did was try to make sure everybody was
working on the same playing field so
hope you got that
another thing we did we didn't really
use cloud services on this team so they
also managed a lot of computers and the
hardware and all the computer setup our
server room all that stuff like these
days you have Heroku or AWS which is
really easy but the team here they would
manage all our hardware - and you know
all the computers in the back room they
would have to like actually physically
go back there unplug them all that stuff
and finally they they and finally sorry
guys they managed the releases we
already talked about that but another
important thing they do is they handle
the deployment and integration of the
software so what this integration mean
well integration kind of means like the
seamless integration of software as
people develop it so once someone makes
an update to a code it has to go and get
pushed up to some kind of central
repository and become integrated and
that process of integrating is actually
very very tricky and there's a lot of
systems that help out with how easy that
integration becomes so another part of
this team's job was to help out with how
easily and how well software could be
deployed and integrated into the system
with like 50 people working on it at the
same time all right so that's about it
for that team that I want to talk about
that's gonna be part one of the video I
still have two big points that cover
ticketing and the typical day I'm gonna
put both of those points in part two of
this video which is gonna be immediately
after this so just stay in tune stay
tuned all right guys thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
