is doing really really well this is
probably one of the last videos I can
make outside just because it's getting a
little colder found this cool little
hallway the mall the restaurant hasn't
opened yet so I'm just sitting outside
on the patio but there's a lot of people
sound but I think there's not so much
wind sound so we should be okay for this
video a few months ago I made this video
about Google versus Amazon Facebook this
big company video where I compared to
contrast the you know the culture the
general persona of each of these
companies but somebody asked me in the
comment of that video and also I got a
couple emails asking
have I ever interviewed at those
companies and the answer is yes I have
so this video I'm gonna talk about a
very recent experience of me
interviewing and getting rejected by
Amazon just this past year in 2017 so no
serious lessons in this video just a
little bit of storytelling and hopefully
it's helpful before we get going on this
I need to give a little bit of a
backstory of why was I even looking for
a job was I in between what was
happening in 2017 well the start of 2017
I was still working at a startup and
obviously since then I've left and let's
just talk about the various reasons
somebody might leave a company so
there's a lot of reasons you might leave
a company one it's you're just upset
there's another opportunity maybe
there's reasons outside your control
maybe there's family reasons maybe you
have like personal reasons why you got
to leave a company but for whatever
reason you're never gonna stay at a
company forever right we are we already
talked about this people grow companies
grow and you're not gonna stay for too
long if you do congratulations
the thing that happened with the
start-up was they decided to actually
move their headquarters to a whole
different city and that's a really
serious decision for any company small
or big to make right think about if
you're working someplace and all of a
sudden they tell you you gotta move what
if you have like a family a mortgage
like a lot of roots in the city you live
and all of a sudden the company also
something very important to you ask you
to just move cities that's a pretty big
deal right so you guys have the picture
this is now like mid 2017 now the
company
working out has decided to move cities
huge decision and what am I gonna do I
decided to stay and look for new
opportunities in New York City so I want
to stay here for now and to live here
you do need some kind of income or else
you just can't survive in the city so I
decided to look for new opportunities in
New York City and at the time to be
perfectly honest with everyone I was a
little I wasn't burned out burned up per
se but I was a little tired from doing
the startup grind it's definitely a lot
of hours I was looking for something a
little more stable like a bigger more
well-established company and something
where I could just actually chill a
little bit more make a little more money
and like I'll have also have like a nice
name to it and what kind of fits those
categories but it's all the brand name
companies right so all this information
I'm gonna share about the Amazon
interview process what not that's all
public knowledge and I encourage
everyone to just go online Google for
this stuff and it's all there
one really helpful site is glassdoor.com
you can find real salary averages per
company per position reviews from ex
employees current employees and also
they give you like little hints of what
the interview process is like I'm not
gonna give any super details away in
case anybody watches this video and bans
me for life but you know everything we
talk about you can find it on the
internet before we get into Amazon I
can't talk about Google a little bit I
applied for Google two and a half times
I like to call it instead of three I
call it two and a half to make myself
feel a little better in college I
applied didn't even get an interview I
think maybe my resume wasn't good or did
they didn't like the way I looked or
something like that but College tried to
apply it did not even get recognized a
couple years of working I also tried to
apply for Google again they actually
called me back and I got a phone
interview with them didn't pass the
phone interview it's okay
and the most recent time was this 2017
just earlier this year when I was kind
of studying I also applied for Google
again they recognized me right away like
oh we seed you applied eight years ago
and then five years ago you're back so I
did one round of phone interviews and I
got a maybe and they
to do another one with me I got a second
second different person the phone
interview but after that just I guess I
got another no so it didn't even make it
to the on-site Google and you know
probably could have studied better but
that's my Google story but the topic of
this video is gonna be the Amazon story
so around the same time of failing at
Google I was still in the mode of study
for interviews everyone knows that study
mode right so studying for interviews
and also got called from Amazon did a
phone interview did pretty well on that
question I got invited for an on-site
interview at Amazon so I was pretty
stoked about that
at the time one thing that I can say
that stood out with Amazon from from
right off the bat is that their
recruiters were very very good
recruiters you can't say that about a
lot of companies I have reviewed for a
handful companies we're not gonna name
them here because you guys don't care
about them but one thing that you can
differentiate is how the recruiters
treat you do they treat you with respect
or they patient with you do they push
you all that stuff one example is I had
one really really terrible experience
with one recruiter and a different
company that completely took that
company off the list I got really really
far with the company even like verbal
offer level far but the recruiter was
just being a jerk to me like you know
you never answer the question of what is
your salary range but you know screw it
I answered the question like I'm
expecting a salary range between this
and this told the recruiter that the
first thing she told me right to my face
is like based on your skills you don't
deserve to be in that range and she said
it just like that I'm like done with
that company so anyways it's a bad story
it's not a story for this video but
Amazon got the on-site interview happy
and now it's time to prepare as best I
can for the interview so what did I do
to prepare you guys probably already
know this you're gonna have to prepare
and be ready to answer technical coding
questions in real time with someone else
right and personally I'm not so good at
those coding questions I think I'm
probably about a C or a C+ on average
but if I study really hard I kind of get
to like a b-minus or
a beer maybe even a b-plus some days I'm
on some days off but I'm not
particularly good and a lot of these
technical interview questions I get
nervous choked up a lot that's why I
kind of failed the Google's one but
failed the Google one but sometimes I'm
on and for those questions like that you
know you just have on and off days but
really it's a matter of preparation and
I was trying my best at a time to
prepare for the technical interview
questions but honestly I'm not too good
at the whiteboard and stuff the one
major thing that I've read about Amazon
and also what my friends told me about
the Amazon interview is that it's highly
highly behavioural which is very
different from your normal technical
interview so one thing that you guys
have probably heard about is that Amazon
has this thing called the 14 leadership
principles and my first interaction with
a recruiter they already introduced
these 14 leadership principles and
apparently it's like the Bible with
every single employee at the whole
company and the first thing she told me
to do to prepare not just a recruiter my
friends told me to do it
Glassdoor told me to do it but first
what you have to do is you have to
pretty much memorize all 14 of these
leadership principles and you have to
behave you have to prepare a lot for the
behavioral questions so what my friend
told me to do to prepare for them is you
list down and memorize all 14 of those
behavioral traits and for each one of
those traits you think of two examples
in your career or professional life that
can back up one of those leadership
principles so you pretty much out of all
your experiences you need to come up
with like 14 times to like 28 different
experiences to showcase how you match
these 14 leadership things so that was
pretty crazy I never heard of a company
you know focusing on behavioral stuff
that much usually when you're
interviewing for a software developer
job they just test you on your coding
make sure not an asshole and they'll be
set but I was kind of worried for Amazon
because I had to study both technical
stuff and a lot of these behavioral
questions so I was a little stressed I
was a little stressed about that so one
mistake I made when I was interviewing
for Amazon was that I spent a little too
much time I
focused on the behavioral stuff and I
kind of let my technical interviewing
skills like slip a little bit because I
was so focused on answering those
behavioral questions right trying to
showcase those principles that I kind of
didn't practice enough in like fine-tune
my code new skills when the on-site
interview came this was about the format
there was about five I think it was six
with a lunch interview or something but
the one different thing about the Amazon
on-site interview is that they spent
equal amount of times asking you
technical questions and behavioral
questions so for most engineers out
there if you interview you know that the
majority of you're introduced interviews
are going to be technical but for every
single on site Amazon interview each
interview is split exactly 50/50 between
coding technical and 50 with behavioral
stuff so when the on-site came all those
interviews a full day but I answered all
the leadership questions pretty well I
had great examples I memorized it I
recited it I spoke to myself in a mirror
for all those questions but the coding
once I really didn't do a really good
job with and I think that's why I didn't
get an offer because all the coding
questions they weren't too hard they're
pretty standard coding questions but
sometimes in the heat of the interview
you kind of like choked up and just
can't answer the questions like as if
you're doing it at home right so one
thing led to another
long story short was that I didn't get
the offer after the on-site interview
because I don't think I nailed the
coding questions well enough and to be
honest a lot of it is a preparation but
it was just an off day for me like I was
interviewing a lot at the at that time
and some days I felt really on like I
would like be on an on-site interview
I'll just like be nailing some of the
interview questions and the other day
some other days like this Amazon day I
was just off and it's not that the
questions are any harder they're just
like the same questions but sometimes
you just kind of think yourself to death
and you know you just have a bad day but
you know it is what it is when I got the
rejection from them on the phone I was
definitely a little upset because I'd
studied pretty pretty hard for those
interviews but what can you do right for
a company like Amazon Google Facebook
they can be so so selective with their
process because imagine how many
engineers want to work at those
companies they're like they must have a
backlog of highly highly qualified
engineers they can be they can afford to
be really really picky with who they
choose so you know I had a bad day maybe
like a worse engineer than me had a good
day and got in or maybe I'm just you
know not qualified to work there who
knows but last thing I want to talk
about regarding applying to these big
companies like Google Amazon Facebook is
the pedigree the brand the reputation
this is even more important to some
people that money sometimes because when
you say you've worked at some of these
big companies before and last with you
forever like recruiters will filter on
LinkedIn by people that have only worked
at Amazon people that have only worked
at Google and if you've worked at those
companies it automatically puts you a
little bit of a higher reputation level
than other developers all right guys are
gonna wrap up the video here don't
really have a moral the story for this
video if I could name a couple lessons
it's just relax when you interview a
little bit you're gonna have some good
days you're gonna have some bad days
maybe you have a badge of your maybe a
lot of things could just be outside your
control like I think back back when I
interviewed at Google when I long time
ago I think this is like 2012 or
something like five four or five years
ago but I had some like crazy Russian
guy give me this crazy algorithm problem
the phone I could barely understand him
I was trying to be polite and I just i
bombed that interview I know I bombed
that interview but some days you might
have a good day some days you have a bad
day just let them all slide and it's all
good so that's it for the video that's
the story of how I got interviewed how I
interviewed and got rejected by Amazon
just recently this year hopefully you
guys everyone watching you should also
try to apply it to all those big
companies just try it out you know it
doesn't hurt it's good experience
but what's the worst thing that can
happen worst thing that can happen is
just get rejected and you can come to
the rejection pile like the rest of us
but hopefully this experience this
experience sharing was helpful for
anyone if you have any specific
questions on what happened my thoughts
why I did it again just ask me in the
comments I'm happy to answer any of
those things and hopefully this story is
helpful all right like the video share
the video all the good stuff and hope
everyone has a great rest of the week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
