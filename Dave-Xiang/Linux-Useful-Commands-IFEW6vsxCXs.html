doing really really really well
topic of this video is gonna be Linux
basics and kind of a list of useful
commands and ways to get around the
terminal so quick up front first I'm not
actually using Linux I'm actually on a
Mac but some of the commands we're gonna
go through and kind of tools are so
basic that they kind of are applicable
to any Linux like environment including
Mac and other things alright second
thing to just mention is that this video
is geared towards anybody that's
interested in kind of navigating or
moving around the terminal and I know
that might not be everyone so that's
probably developers people who want to
maybe get into Linux a little bit more
so if you think this video could be
irrelevant for you just stop watching no
problem and I have a list here of some
of the things I just jotted down a
couple of things that I find
particularly useful and we're gonna run
through them pretty quickly all right
and this video it's going to be a little
fast so if anything doesn't make sense
just pause the video look up the command
read about something that I'm doing and
just kind of learn it the hard way and
I'm not gonna spoon feed you too much
stuff here we're just gonna run through
this list and hopefully it's helpful all
right so let's just get started all
right so what we're starting with is a
computed directly that I made here
called playground and it's just gonna be
our sandbox for doing some of the things
in this video
alright so first thing we're gonna do is
just create a really simple text file
called fubar and what I did here is just
write a really simple sentence the quick
brown fox jumped over the lazy dog into
fubar and it's one file inside our
directory so let's just look at it real
quick here it is last the file 45 bytes
something really simple alright the
first command that we have to introduce
real quickly is grep which is one of the
most basic commands in this whole system
and you have to understand how this
works to pretty much do anything so
let's just go through the basic syntax
of grep just you're just gonna grep some
word here some
anywhere you want in a particular file
and you can actually grep not only
inside a file but throughout a buffer
and it can be very flexible but let's
just try it first to search for some
words inside food bar so it's not gonna
find this inside food bar we actually
know we wrote Fox so it should find the
word Fox in there and yes it does
properly so pretty much we're using grep
to search for basic strings inside this
file alright and I encourage everyone to
read about more commands there's many
options you can pass into grep such as
case insensitivity but overall please
just read up learn and try it yourself
using this command and it's so useful
all right that's just basics next
command to just introduce is another
super basic command called fine that
everyone should understand so let's just
go through a quick example of fine so
what how it works is we're gonna find
inside some directory and dot is
actually a shortcut for current working
directory and I want to find a file
called foo so it actually doesn't find
anything because find it takes the exact
you have to match it with the pattern
here and we're not finding anything
called foo so what we can do is add some
wildcards and it finds foo bar because
foo bar has the word foo in it all right
so we can get make find a little more
complicated like find inside my
workspace this is where I keep a lot of
my code any file that has the word code
in its name and this is gonna probably
turn a bunch of stuff yes it does and
that's just a little more specific way
to use find now what I think is
particularly interesting is introducing
this concept of piping which is usually
used in conjunction with grep but it's
particularly useful so let's just say
that this is too much information to
handle finding every single file with
the word code in it and what if I want
to filter this out a little more well
there's a special command called the
pipe command which is this vertical line
in which you and
the output of one program into another
program so we're gonna inject the output
of this find integral and we're gonna
specifically look for some word and what
this does here is that it executes that
fine but then it injects its results
into grep which then searches for the
word grep and now we have all files in
my workspace with the word code in it as
well as inside this WIC project that I
have so this is a really good use case
of a pipe and usually you pipe things
into grep this is a very common so we're
gonna go through a lot of examples we're
gonna pipe stuff into grep just to kind
of filter it down more and find it's
just one example of something that you
might want to pipe to grep all right so
that's grep and find please do a little
more reading on these two basic commands
they're really useful and let's just
keep it going
one thing I also want to bring up here
is that you can make shortcuts for many
of these things so I actually shortcut
it find with FF and let's just see how
that works real quick if I look at my
bash RC file what I have here is a
couple of aliases which map FF to
actually a function which uses fine so I
encourage everyone to check this out to
make your typing a little simpler if you
want to type a little less characters so
instead of typing this you could just
type maybe FF to grab foo or something
and make life a little easier with some
aliases all right so everyone I
encourage everyone to try that out just
save yourself some typing all right next
super important thing we have to do that
you're going to do all the time is check
your processes and the main way to check
your processes is through PS wishlist
active processes and you can see them
all here that are running it's too much
to digest at this moment but it pretty
much will list everything that's running
on your computer and you can just see
that it's a ton of stuff alright so
as always like we mentioned before we
can use the pipe command to make this
list a little more manageable so I want
to list all the processes that have the
word Safari in it alright so actually
this only gives me five back I have five
processes that are safari related so
whatever the Safe Browsing is whatever
these services are safari history all
this random stuff so let's just do a
quick example of it let's just actually
open up Safari that's open let me just
run that again you can see now that we
have there was five running up here now
we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 additional
processes running just because I started
the application alright so another
command that's particularly useful that
I just want to introduce is how to kill
a command so kill you'll kill any
process bias ID let's just look up the
ID which is this column and that's gonna
close Safari and it's closed killing it
here on the command line is just
equivalent as clicking the X button on
the Safari list alright
so super convenient command you're gonna
have to list processes all the time if
you want to kill processes you can kill
- 9 it and that's another basic thing to
do alright ok next super useful command
that we're gonna introduce is listing
the ports on your computer that are
actually open or listening and if you're
a developer you'll probably always be
curious about which ports are open which
ones have connections established to
them if you have no idea what a port is
I encourage everyone to go read about
what that means but this command right
here will list all ports that are
currently listening on your system so
here we just have a couple ports that
are open you think Spotify has some
whatever this is
Ruby has some so what these are actually
I have a couple of projects in Ruby that
are listening that are web applications
that listen on these ports or have
have one or three thousand one in seven
thousand one or nine thousand and all
these are are these are actually web
applications because I know I'm running
them again with a command like this if
you want to find all listening ports
that are Ruby process-related
you could grep for Ruby and have oh I
have for Ruby processes listening on
these four things all right another cool
thing to do is that by default this
command will return all processes that
are listening that I own if you want to
do it for all processes on the system
you'll have to do a pseudo front here
let's just look at that a little more
clearly but now we're listing all
processes that not only I'm running but
other users in the system are running so
Postgres which is a database is actually
has a listening open on 5432 which is
the default
Postgres port if you guys have ever used
this database so if you want to look for
listening ports from the whole computer
just stick a pseudo in front of this
commit alright super useful command and
especially for development purposes we
want to see what kind of applications
you have running which ports are kind of
being used you can use this and it's
incredibly helpful all right okay let's
just go back to our file real quick if
you guys remembered earlier we created
this file of foo bar which is hat which
has our sentence in there so let's just
go back to that real quick you can
actually call LS on a specific file so
if I call Alice that LS dash out on foo
bar what's particularly useful is that a
list additional information including
the size of this file which just happens
to be 45 bytes and let me just prove
that that's the actual size of the file
so I'm gonna write some extra crap in to
fubar and you should see that this file
size does increase a little bit just
because I wrote a bunch of this stuff
all right so particularly useful to just
get a quick look at the size of any file
on your system all right
another particularly useful command is
d-u which is disk usage you can do this
usage on any directory inside your
system and let's just call this usage on
our current working directory and it
shows that hey for this directory we
have four kilobytes of disks of this
space used for fubar alright so I guess
one thing that's a little strange is
that when we LS dot l fubar we see that
it only takes a hundred bytes so why
does it take 400 kilobytes on disk well
this is actually a subtle point that we
can talk about real quickly but a files
this space usage is different than the
size that it actually takes up alright
so if we just check out fubar real quick
we'll see that it takes up four
kilobytes on disk but it's actually only
100 bytes big so this is actually just a
major difference for kilobytes on this
is kind of like the minimum chunk or
block size for the file system so at the
very minimum any single file that's
created on our system inside our file
system is going to be at least four
kilobytes and inside those four
kilobytes only 100 bytes are used all
right so that's a subtle difference
between the size that is actually being
used in the file and the amount of space
is taking up on this so if you guys ever
encounter this size on disk versus size
you know how it's different all right so
let's just do a quick test here to see
if we can actually make this a little
bigger right now it's four kilobytes and
let's just see if we can make it more
than four kilobytes so how are we gonna
do this let's just do it a very manual
way so you're gonna take this just copy
these lines just keep copying a lot of
lines this is the simplest way to make a
huge file guys so this file should be
significantly bigger now if we look at
our list we can see
oh wow now it's 142 kilobytes almost
right so it's now since the file is
actually this bigger this much bigger we
should see the disk usage increase
appropriately so let's just call D u
again they say yes it does actually
increase now it's a hundred and forty
hundred and forty kilobytes on disk and
the byte size is a hundred forty two
thousand nine hundred fifty two bytes
all right so disk usage really useful to
get directory file size usage and also
LS l really useful to get the size of
any particular file
alright so that's about it let's see
what else do I have on this list I have
a few more things on the list but I
actually only have one minute left in
this video as these screencasts are
always 15 minutes long so I'll do a
quick recap we went through quickly what
grep is what is fine
we searched we talked about a way to
check your processes and kill processes
we checked we talked about a way to list
your ports listen list your open courts
sorry and finally we talked about a way
to check file sizes so these are all
really really basic commands and like
minimum table steak stuff everyone
should know to get around Linux
hopefully it's helpful I encourage
everyone just to read more about it
maybe we watch this video I'm not even
sure if this was helpful we did we did
go through things very fast but I hope
it was so thanks guys and I'll see
everyone next time alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
