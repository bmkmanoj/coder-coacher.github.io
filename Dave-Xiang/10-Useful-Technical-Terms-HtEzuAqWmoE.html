think I'm going to make it my 2015
resolution to make more videos on
YouTube and get a selfie stick how's
that for an opening joke to the video
nothing too crazy going on today but I'm
going to spend this time to talk about
10 kind of technical terms that I think
are really good to know alright just to
get started let's list off all 10 mbps
client/server proxy api sdk cache linux
compiling embedded devices and RTFM the
first term is Mbps and a stands for
megabits per second what this is is a
data transfer rate and intuitively it's
just measuring how fast data flows you
probably hear this term use a lot by
Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T bragging about how fast
their download or upload speeds are if
you're used to megabytes one really
important thing to remember is that when
they give you this number always make
sure to divide it by 8 if Verizon tells
you that you can download at 16 Mbps
that means you should be able to
download at 2 megabytes a second even
though you probably still can't Mbps as
a data transfer rate isn't particular
only to cell phone data you can copy a
movie from your thumb drive to a
computer and you can also potentially
measure that in Mbps if you wanted to
improve pay the second thing I want to
talk about is this thing called
client-server model and it's an
extremely extremely general concept in
engineering and life Klein is anyone
that makes them any sort of request and
the server is anyone who responds to
that request when you go into your
browser and you go to google.com you
search for the lyrics to your favorite
song the star-spangled banner' and you
make a request as a user you are client
the really big and powerful google
computers sitting out of space are
acting like a server and they're going
to respond to you once you hit enter on
that search I think it's really good if
you just think of client and server in
this really really simple terms you go
to a restaurant your client and the
waiter is a server the next term that I
want to introduce that fits right along
with client-server is this thing called
a proxy all the proxy is is someone else
that makes a request on behalf of you
real life example you and your friend
Bob go to a restaurant or some steaks
but you're crazy crazy hung over you
can't really talk so you just have to
Bob order steak for you Bob is your
proxy in networking proxies are usually
used for security and optimize
performance in real life you can use a
proxy if you're scaredy cat you know the
next term that is really common is good
to know is an API which stands for
application programmer interface my
definition of an API is anything that
allows two pieces of software to talk to
each other they usually have a basic
theme to them
one example that is good I think would
be the Google Maps API you could use it
to get your location get the coordinates
of your favorite restaurant get
directions to your mom's house or
Cooper's do some spying another really
important thing to remember is that API
s are always a software to software type
of interactions one of my friends asked
me if when they open up their web
browser or the computer are they using
any ap is when they're accessing the web
sites when you're just sitting at home
by yourself
serving the internet you might access a
website but you're not directly using
any API as a user that website might be
using API to do a lot of magical things
to give you really nice services but you
as a user aren't using them directly
okay now the next term is an S
okay and now that you understand what an
API is SDK is really easy to understand
SDKs stands for software development kit
and all it is is a huge collection of
APD is API is usually have a pretty
narrow and distinct theme to each one
whereas an SDK is usually very general
purpose one example is if you want to
build an Android app you need to use the
Android SDK to get that done based on
whatever application you decide to build
for Android you're going to use a small
subset of api's under the big umbrella
SDK that is going to make your app
happen let's just wrap up SDK real quick
two things you have to know extremely
general-purpose and created from a large
set of api's okay the next time I want
introduces a cache also pronounced cache
cache the cache is literally just a
quicker more efficient way to access
something else my cell phone full of my
clothes is a cache for my closet my
pantry in the kitchen is also cache for
the grocery store the programs that are
currently running on my computer are
cache for all the big files that I've
saved on a hard drive all the big files
that I've saved that my hard drive is a
cache from all the crazy stuff I've
saved up on the cloud so hopefully got
the basic gist of the cache based on
those analogies if you have any other
questions watch my memory hierarchy
video for some more details on that next
term I want to introduce is Linux Linux
is an open-source operating system open
source meeting that is completely free
to anyone and everyone can contribute to
it and I can't really talk about
operating systems right now because a
dominum time pretty much anything
besides your personal computer is
probably running Linux 15 second history
lesson back in the day there is this
operating system called Unix with a u
that was extremely extremely
Linux was originally inspired by Unix
with the sole purpose of being free so
one of the reasons why Linux is so good
and so widespread is really because it's
open source and so many people can use
it and change it I I definitely didn't
do Linux enough justice in here so maybe
I'll make a video on that later we're on
the NEET term and this is the concept of
compiling code so in software engineers
write code on their computers they use a
variety of different languages to create
these programs the thing you have to
remember about these programming
languages is that they're not designed
to be read by computers they are
designed to be read by humans even
though they can look a little messy
humans are supposed to read on stuff
the act of transforming what you type
into the computer into those ones and
zeros I'm going to group that all into
this umbrella term of compiling these
days compiling is so powerful a lot of
the times developers aren't even aware
when it's happening but at some point in
time it has to happen all right guys I'm
almost done this is the second to last
thing I want to talk about and hopefully
you have fall asleep yet my definition
of an embedded device is any kind of
electronics that's kind of embedded or
inside something else all those buttons
you press on your market wave setting
the timer setting it's of frozen setting
it's a nuke those are all handled by an
embedded device you should just think
small inside something and with a
specific purpose so your laptop isn't
really an embedded device but you're
cool nest thermostat that you bought
that's a pretty cool bit of device okay
last term and it's my favorite the last
term is RTFM usually you hear this when
you ask someone a question too many
times they tell you to RTFM when you're
picking up something new for the first
time I think it's always better to at
least read the manual a little bit
before you really go and ask your friend
about it it's never good to ask too many
questions too quickly without doing a
little bit of home
mark if someone asks you a question and
you know they didn't read the manual you
don't have to be nice about it just tell
them to RTFM and life is gonna be a lot
better I think you know what it stands
for but I'm not going to say it it's too
scared okay that's it that was the last
term and now we're at the end of the
video I'm still going to try to make a
lot of videos in 2015 I'm going to buy
my selfie stick so if you like this
video please you know give me a like or
drop me a comment if anything you can
private message me with any questions
and hope you enjoyed it alright take it
