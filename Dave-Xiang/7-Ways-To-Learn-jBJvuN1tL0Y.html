really really well enjoying their
summers it's a really really hot day
here today I think I've been reading a
little too many articles about climate
change and every time it gets really hot
I think the world is going to end soon
and I'm freaking myself out but that's a
topic for another day anyways so for
this video I wanted to break out another
very abstract concept the concept of
learning we all know that learning is
good you should be doing it all the time
24/7 but I just wanted to break it down
a little further and be more specific
with it and I think most people can
relate to the word learning but I think
for this video and some of the stuff
we're going to talk about a more
accurate word is growing so you can grow
academically you can grow socially you
could grow spiritually and there's
always more than one way to do that so
for this video I brainstormed seven
seven different ways of learning or
seven different ways of growing and
we're just going to talk straight
through them all right so without
further ado let's do it first and
easiest most intuitive straightforward
and simple way of learning that we're
going to talk about real quickly is
learning by doing not going to spend so
much time here but this is the core of
usually everything in the most effective
way for 99% of people to learn and grow
in different ways you just got to do it
right so you have to that's taking the
new projects and in school or doing that
new project at work or doing that side
project learning that new framework like
following that online course and just
doing it right so this is what's most
relatable easiest if you do it you will
learn it all right so that's point
number one let's just get that out of
the way okay so the second second really
important and close compliment to point
number one is learning by research and
this is really really really important
the reason why this is so important is
because you cannot put too much
blind-date and just doing it and having
that be the most effective way because
if you just pound it out you just try to
do everything like if you're trying to
learn web development you made a list of
100
you just want to do everything that's
not going to be a very effective way of
learning because you have no context
what I mean by context in this case is
that when you decide that you want to
learn something or you want to grow in a
specific area you have to understand the
surrounding pros and cons about that the
history about it and just the overall
general context big picture review of
what you're trying to do so for example
if you're kind of become a web developer
you should understand what that means
understand the internet understand where
web browsers come from understand like
kind of the evolution of JavaScript
whatever just get a little more like
research oriented concepts of what's
surrounding and don't just jump into
learning like the latest and greatest
framework so this is equally important
because it's going to really supplement
your doing part and direct you in the
right way so with that said I want to
talk about two two major types of
research material and when I say
research material what I really mean is
just reading stuff all this comes down
to it's just actually reading and I have
two major categories two broad
categories of reading material the first
category is reference style and I have
an example here but this is going to be
a little dry but it's still really
important you always need reference
style books like big old books like this
you could use Google's when you it's
just like reference material I'm trying
to learn Java so I picked up this big
ass Java book but those type of books
are a little more binary it's just like
here the features of the language here's
how the language evolved it's just like
boom boom boom boom boom reference the
second type of reading which is equally
important and a little more fun to read
is the highly opinionated and subjective
stuff so those are like people's blogs
people hating on stuff people loving
stuff like I love reactor I hate rails
like those subjective readings are also
really important because you can get
what people think like people have
really strong opinions that you can get
you know someone that loves rails or
someone's that hates rails and just read
their blog posts to see what they think
so
I think aside that type of reading is a
good complement to reference style
reading but you should have both so
that's learning by research or learning
by reading and always do that for
supplement your number one learning by
doing all right let's keep it going
the third point is going to be learning
by motivation this one is really really
important the only thing I want to say
up front is that you got to do number
three in small doses
you can't overdo this when I say
motivation in this context is what
people commonly you know refer to as
self-help and it's when you hear those
big motivational speeches by Tony
Robbins or you read those like crazy
books like help yourself work four hours
a week those are just like motivational
things by external parties so all of us
need that I need a lot of that every now
and then you probably need a lot of that
every now and then we only have so much
self motivation but every now and then
it's good to have some external
motivation you watch an inspirational
talk wanna watch like a motivational
video it does help sometimes you can't
rely on that 100% of the time the one
thing that you should be very careful of
so let's just take an example you love
Tony Robbins so you watch a lot of Tony
Robbins videos on YouTube where he's
pumping you up giving you motivation
telling you how to live your life but
the one thing that to be careful of with
all those motivational self-help videos
is that it's very premeditated by the
external party when I say premeditated
all those motivational videos you might
be watching of Tony Robbins that's
actually him specifically crafting some
form of content to motivate you because
that's his job that's actually not the
natural Tony Robbins so that's the most
kind of danger point not really a danger
point but just something you have to
watch out for use learning by motivation
is a good thing we all need doses of
that every now and then but just
remember it's premeditated it's not
exactly natural but it's still helpful
number four I think this one is one of
my most favorite ways of kind of picking
up stuff and I call this learning by
empathy
so the whole point of learning by
empathy is you want to kind of get into
someone else's head and figure out how
they feel right when I'm making this
video to you it's not actually my
natural state it's more like number
three everything I wrote here is kind of
premeditated and it's not my natural
state it's not how I interact with the
database stuff around one really cool
way to do number four is actually
watching interviews or like watch candid
videos and people you respect a lot like
your role models because just an
interview for example when someone's
interviewing Elon Musk he probably knows
the questions beforehand but the
interview is interesting because it
interviews more of like a personal
interaction between two parties and it
gets more deep into like what that
person is actually thinking how they're
wired how their brain works in they have
less time to premeditate things so it's
really interesting to see how people you
respect a lot like Elon Musk or Bill
Gates not how they you know premeditate
a speech but watching them interact with
an interviewer is especially interesting
because it gets you a little insight
into their brain one thing that I cited
I thought is really cool from YouTube is
that on YouTube there's a couple candid
videos like old school videos of like
interactions very natural interactions
there's one video Steve Jobs conducting
and meeting back in the day we use that
next and it's really interesting to
watch him just like actually conducted
meeting rather than him present at an
Apple conference there's also this
really cool motivational not really
motivational but there's this old day on
YouTube of Jack Ma kind of pumping up
his company when they're first starting
Alibaba like back when they were like
less than ten people and he's just
talking about like what he expects for
the future what's the future of Alibaba
going to be and it's just like one of
his employees like taking a candid video
of him making the speech to his company
so he's not directed at you he's
directed at the company and it's
completely candid but why that video why
I like that video so much is because you
to see jakmob behave and is completely
natural state that's how he is as a
person and you can use that to be like
okay that's kind of how he operates and
that's really cool number five number
five is going to be pretty simple this
is going to be learning by discussion or
sharing this is a lot of peer-to-peer
communication which is already really
helpful so this is like study groups
talking about your project with your
friend is supposed to be very
collaborative you go in there with a
mindset of getting some feedback talking
about how you implemented something and
having just like that honest discussion
and sharing environment in I think this
one is always really good because
whenever you do this with another party
new issues always come up that you
didn't realize first so this one's
pretty easy another good way of learning
is just sharing what you've learned to
uncover hidden stuff six way of learning
is learning by teaching and you might
think this is a little similar to
learning by sharing but you it's
actually really different because your
mindset is going to be different if you
try to learn by teaching so learning by
teaching your mindset is you have to
take what you know and Transplant it
into someone else who has no idea on the
topic so your expectation or your
mindset is going to be one of teaching
not sharing it's slightly different
teaching reinforces learning a lot
because it just passed your
understanding of stuff one good test is
if you have a blank piece of paper try
to write down a comment that you think
you understand if you can't write down
anything on a piece of paper you
probably don't understand it really well
if you come write down a good outline
and flow then you probably understand it
really well but one thing that's really
nice is learning by teaching so one good
example of this is that I was a TA in
college one tonight actually was a
little hesitant to be a TA because I
didn't really think I understood the
material a lot but then after a lot of
office hours helping kids with helping
students with their homework and just
doing that stuff over and over again and
like learning it by teaching it it
actually reinforced it a lot better so
learning by teaching it is another good
way to do it and you can
desaad your siblings your friends your
parents you know anyone last point I
want to make about another method of
learning is learning by mentorship so
this one is actually a luxury that many
of us don't have I don't have a personal
mentor or any kind of sure you don't
have a personal mentor of any kind
somebody might claim to be one but that
title of mentor is a very kind of
special title and if you really have a
mentor you're probably in the 1% you're
really lucky if you have that but for
most of us you don't have a mentor but
we don't really need a person all the
time to get that same effect
so because mentorship is the most rare
in my opinion I put it last but it's
also really important the core idea in
my opinion the core idea behind
mentorship is that the way you learn
through mentorship is heavily catered
towards your specific problems
everything else we talked about is very
general right just general ways of
learning anything but mentorship is
different because mentorship is the
whole premise of it is that it's catered
towards you as a person it's like you
have gone through this you've learned
that you have all this other stuff going
on your life all this very personal
stuff what you personally do personally
do to level up so in my opinion that's
the core concept of mentorship is that
it's catered towards the individual the
best thing we can do is that if that if
there's no real-life person to be that
mentor you have to find that somewhere
else usually if they just go on the
internet and look for resources so the
best way I think is that if you need
very personalized advice for whatever
you're going into you have to find
someone else that has also gone through
something similar so they can give you
the most probably helpful things to
think about right if you if somebody is
trying to mentor you it has no
experience about what you've gone
through is probably not going to be very
helpful but you can still find tons of
those resources online like read
people's biographies maybe somebody may
be a very successful person had the
exact same you know upbringing as you
did find that person see what they did
like their progression and see if they
have any public material out there for
you and if they do then it's really
awesome so I don't want to talk too much
about mentorship but the whole premise
again I'll just repeat it one more time
is but this is getting support or advice
or help for some stuff that's very
individual for what you're going through
in if that's from a person you're really
lucky if you don't have the person you
got to dig for that stuff and the best
way I can
maybe recommend you doing that it's find
other people either through your network
or just cold email people whatever it is
but try to find people that are similar
have similar backgrounds view so they
can help you through whatever you're
going through but 99.9 percent of the
time you're not going to find that
person so you got to dig in public
records pretty much you got to dig on
the internet for that stuff but you
can't find it dude it's possible to find
mentorship in a book in a youtube video
but you just got to look for it more
specifically alright guys those are the
seven points that I had about different
ways of learning or growing hopefully it
wasn't too abstract and try to be as
concrete as possible but how let's end
with how best to use all this
information so everyone's going to be
more inclined to do one of these things
a little differently you might be more
inclined to just do everything by doing
maybe you like doing a ton of research
and not so much doing but whatever it is
I don't think you can really get to the
next level with just one or two of these
things so if you're only just doing one
of these things I would highly consider
or recommend just trying to do many of
these things and see where it gets you
so
you just have to not that you have to do
it it's just you have to diversify the
different medians of how you approach
learning it's not just going to be one
thing like of course you always learn by
doing but if you really want to get to
maybe the next level of whatever it is
you got to consider a lot of
possibilities
next thing also is that it depends on
the level of which you want to learn
something right so if you're a software
developer and software is your craft
that's like what you want to be that's
like your soul or something like that
you might want to do all seven
techniques and even more techniques like
every possible technique to be a
software developer read a ton of books
learn the kind of things
watch software developer people talk go
to software developer meetups teach
about it just do everything you can but
that's if you're that interested in
software development right if you're
trying to just pick up something on the
side like say you're just a software
developer you want to learn basic
accounting on the side if you just want
to learn an extension of what you
already know you don't have to dive so
deep to all these different mediums you
could just if you want to learn basic
accounting you could just do a side
course on it or just talk to your
friends about it a little bit so the
level of which you attack or use all
these different strategies for learning
depends on the level of which you want
to learn something right so it's either
a side thing or your main thing but use
that to gauge yourself last thing I want
to leave everyone off with is that even
though all this stuff is really good all
this learning stuff is really good don't
be too eager with it so I think this is
really important but never think or
expect that you shall learn everything
you should never feel like you have to
spend 24 hours a day just learning
learning learning we all know that
learning and growing is good but there
should be no expectation that you should
spend every waking moment trying to
learn as much as you can
there has to be just like with
everything there has to be a balance so
even after all this stuff I said you
know seven different ways of learning
learn anything you want in the world you
shouldn't ever think that you have to
learn 24/7 if your mind is telling you
to chill then just go chill on a beach
you have to be content with doing
nothing so that you can do the stuff you
care about for long periods of time all
right guys that's it for the video if
you enjoy this video please press like
if you have any comments questions
please post a comment respond let's have
a discussion about it this stuff is all
really abstract but hopefully these
points are going to be helpful for
whatever you're trying to pursue all
right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
