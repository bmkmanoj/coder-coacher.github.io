doing really well my sd card is broken
or my SD card reader actually is broken
right now so I can't use my DSLR so just
making a screencast this week and
hopefully it's still good alright
software team organization is the topic
of this week's video short answer to
this question is that there are billion
different ways that software teams are
organized longer answer is watch this
video so there's gonna be a lot of text
in this video but as always for these
screencasts just follow my voice don't
read ahead and I'll just talk about
everything I wrote down hopefully very
clearly with everyone because I spent
some time thinking about these notes
let's start with a couple disclaimers so
this video focuses on larger
organizations and how they organize
hundreds of developers I'm not an expert
on this by any means I'm not an expert
on this I've never had the
responsibility of doing this myself as
like a director VP of engineering for
hundreds of developers that's a very big
task my experience what I'm gonna talk
about in this video is I've what my
experience has been being involved in
this process as a developer and also the
experiences that my friends have had
because I have a lot of developer
friends we've worked at different
companies been through many different
team organizations and this is just a
summary of that so with that being said
just follow my voice I hope this video
is helpful sorry it's not a real video
but screencast will do so before we get
deep into it let's just talk about what
about smaller organisations we just said
we're gonna focus on the larger ones but
I want to mention smaller organisations
really quickly for smaller groups of
coders think less than five people less
than 10 people and think startups right
things tend to be a little more ad hoc
and what I mean by that is that there
are fewer people which means that each
person does more things and more diverse
things so fewer people doing more
diverse things one example of this one
person if you're working at at less than
five person start-up there could really
one person handling infrastructure
DevOps back-end services client-side
code user fronts and applications and
everything in between all right so
that's kind of the gist of the smaller
organizations but with that being said
we want to focus about how our bigger
organizations split up and organize for
software development and that's for the
rest of this video so let's get straight
into it but I want to break this into
three general categories first you can
think of these as umbrella categories
and you can also think of this as a
spectrum which will describe so on the
left side of the spectrum we have big
monolithic software development and this
is the slowest type of development on
the very right we're gonna have very
siloed development where things move
very very fast in small groups some
people call these squads but this just
means small groups so on the Left
monolithic just think huge and slow on
the right we have small and fast and
three I'm calling this hybrid but it's
everything in between
all right so nothing is better than the
other everything comes with pros and
cons pros and cons for this pros and
cons for this now we're gonna walk
through it so we're gonna talk about all
three of these categories hope everyone
was still following so let's talk about
big monolithic development first and
this is usually the slowest kind of
development and I have a lot of
first-hand experience with this myself
this is kind of like the environment I
was used to when working with like
hundreds or 50-plus developers the gist
of this is that there are 50 hundreds 50
developers working to deliver a single
product major benefits of a system like
this is that it highly encourages code
reuse you can reuse software much easier
it creates a very consistent user
experience for the end user the system
is usually integrated better when
everything is
you know to get when everything is close
by or monolithic usually the system is
actually integrated better and it's
easier to test cons of this obviously we
talked about this already but the
development is just slower because
there's lots of blocking you know other
teams will block your development
sometimes where some people are taking
longer than the others it's a very
strict environment and sometimes it can
be less fun so I was thinking of one way
to describe this environment as best I
could and the best word I could think of
is this concept of lock step so in a big
monolithic environment everyone works
and locks that mode and what does that
mean so if you're working on a new
software release let's just for example
your workout you're working on a big
team and you're working to release
version 1.1 from version 1.0 for that to
happen everyone has to come together and
prepare their changes to get ready for V
1.1 right if one team is not ready with
their 1.1 changes the whole release is
blocked for everyone because the nature
of this product being that it's all
inclusive everything has to come
together to move it forward that's what
I mean by lockstep so every team
contributes their changes everything is
tested everything is q8 and finally
everything is released together and this
is big huge software and obviously it
moves very slowly so hopefully you're
getting a feel for this style of
environment you can imagine this is
pretty tough to do with 50 to a hundred
or more developers and you have to be
very very strict with the rules here you
have to be very strict with when to cut
off code MIT code commits when to cut
off people making changes and how to
formalize the release schedules so in
the end even though it's a very strict
one of the pros as we discusses it's
integrated well and it's usually tested
better so even though it's strict it
does come with its pros of you know
being probably a little more robust than
well tested now let's look at the other
side of the spectrum so this is going to
be I call this siloed
this is the fastest kind of development
when teams are very siloed and I haven't
been involved in this too often but I
have a handful of friends who work in
this style of environment so the gist of
this environment is that you maintain
small teams five to ten people but your
team does everything and the pros for
this development it's faster less
blocking you know less people means us
people could be blocking you this more
fun it could feel like a startup in a
big company and you can make flexible
technical decisions cons the bad parts
of this system is that it's minimum code
reuse because it's very siloed it can
create inconsistent user experience and
the system is harder to test and it's
not very well integrated
alright so almost the exact foot block
of what we just talked about best thing
to do is just take an example I'm gonna
walk you through pretty much my friends
work environment which is structured
just like this so I have a friend who
works in a large engineering
organization hundreds of developers
maybe probably not over a thousand but
definitely in the hundreds so it's
pretty significant team of developers
but how they split up their organization
is that there's teams they call them
squads which is this weird word it
sounds really cool but their whole team
of hundreds of developers split up into
different squads of five to ten people
so and each squad is responsible
everything all the way from the
computers all the way to the front-end
so those five to ten people are really
responsible for everything so and it's a
super broad category so what really
happens is my friends squad I think they
have seven people they get a real budget
they just get cash from the umbrella
company think of there think of it as
their parent they just get a budget they
get some cash and they have to deliver
an application so the squad does
everything they set up all the computer
hosting themselves all the backend
services persistance stores databases
are set up by them and only used by them
all customer applications are made by
them then
and it's like it feels like its own
little mini startup company inside a big
organization company so what this allows
them to do is that they can pump out
iterate on their applications very fast
since they just work in this little five
person squad they're never blocked by
any other team like they're never
blocked if do you have a team of 50
people somebody will be blocking you if
your team has only five people there's
much much less blockage so it feels like
a small company even though he works at
a huge corporation with hundreds of
developers before we move on let's just
consider the bad parts of having things
so siloed one part is that there's
really really little code reuse since
things are so separated between the
different squads they pretty much
implement everything themselves even
though it's a very similar
implementation or it solves a very
similar problem because things are so
siloed it's very difficult to reuse
software libraries and various modules
the other thing that this leads to is
that it leads to a very inconsistent
experience for the users across their
applications even though it's the same
company and I think this is one of the
parts that they struggle with the most
they move very fast but you can tell
that within one company there's you can
tell that different people created that
application even though it's the same
umbrella company so this is more this
affects development less but you know it
looks kind of funny when you're the same
entity you deliver all these different
experiences
finally let's just talk about hybrid
apps and this is the medium between the
two extremes but what this really means
is that you're trying to get all the
good parts from either monolithic or
silo you're taking all the good parts so
let's just take an example of this
imagine that there's one team for the
whole company there's one team that's
dedicated to infrastructure and computer
hosting so there's only one team for
that then they're individual teams that
are responsible for their own back-end
services and their own client facing
applications
but they must use that one singular team
to get their applications hosted on
computers so that creates a choke point
on the infrastructure team right but at
least the infrastructure team is shared
it's not split up a co-op across these
squads you can also take this one step
further and this is also a very common
set up that my friends have been a part
of but there can be one team dedicated
to infrastructure one team dedicated to
back-end services that powers all the
clients but then there could be ten
teams dedicated to client facing
applications so let's say let's take all
three as an example let's say you're a
developer working on the client facing
the client facing application your team
will be choke pointed by the back-end
team and they will be choke pointed by
the infrastructure team let's say you're
working on the back-end team all right
so let's say you work on the solo
backing team you have to write the code
that supports a ton of different
applications pretty much if you're here
you're working on code that powers 10
client applications major benefit of
this is you probably get to reuse a lot
of the software you've written for many
different use cases and finally let's
say you're working on the infrastructure
team doing DevOps setting and computers
but you'll be responsible for hosting
budgeting for every single application
in the entire company all right so
that's kind of like a hybrid between the
two finally let's just conclude this
video whoops
so major conclusion of this video is
that it's just a little bit of a taste
of how software teams are organized in a
very large corporations and gives you a
little bit of extremes between huge
versus very siloed but in the end of the
day just remember that there's an
unlimited variation of this and just
think of this as a spectrum okay look
monolithic developers working on a solo
project or very small siloed squads and
every company any process every company
every process will be different all
right and
table top this off I just want to show
you two examples which probably are at
different ends of the spectrum one is it
Atlassian I'm sure you know elasti and I
think they went public recently and this
is a pretty famous software company
they've been around for a long time but
you can see that they provide many
different software services they have
JIRA bitbucket confluence Trello source
tree like they have tons of different
applications and I bet each one of these
nine or more things has different squads
or developers behind them for it last
year all right so that's just their
style of company here's another example
Circle CI this is a really good software
service to do continuous integration I
use this at work and I really like
circle CI but you can tell that their
whole company their whole company is
this one product they don't do anything
else they're literally probably just
this section of bitbucket they're
probably just this part but they are
dedicated for it so this is probably an
example of maybe their software
organization is a little more monolithic
because everything they develop goes
into this service alright so obviously
those are just two companies but this is
different
across all companies alright guys that's
it for the video hopefully it was a
little bit of a cool introduction or
taste of what software team organization
is like but as always I can't tell you
too much you just have to go into some
companies and figure out how they do
things right everyone's going to be
different all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
