doing well as usual got a pretty nice
pretty good question
privately recently from someone named
Amir thank you very much Amir but these
questions they're very general they're
not like crazy personal questions but
their general enough that I thought it
would make for a pretty nice video and
all of these questions are related to
working so Amir asked five questions and
before we get started let's just I'm
going to read off these questions first
so we have some context first question
what changes do you see for this line of
work what are some major problems
working in this field what are your
responsibilities as a programmer what do
you like most about your job and finally
what is the most challenging part of
your job so those questions even though
they seem a little jumbled they all have
a common theme and it's all related to
working and the tricky part of those
five questions is that you could answer
those five questions completely
differently with just two different jobs
there are so many permutations right
different companies start up versus big
company different business model
different industry different languages
use there's so many ways to kind of cut
that data that you could really answer
just those five questions completely
differently with just two side-by-side
jobs so what I'm going to do in this
video is I'm going to try my best to
answer those five questions that Amir
asked Thank You Amir I'm going to try to
answer those questions with the context
of my first job out of college my first
job that I got straight out of school
was at Qualcomm in San Diego and the
position was for embedded software
development and my official my official
title on paper was engineer one word so
I graduated 2009 I started this job
early 2010 spent two years at this
position and I'm going to try my best to
answer these five questions all right
let's do it first question is what
changes do you see for this line of work
before we get too deep into this is that
embedded software embedded software is
not
going anywhere in my opinion so normally
the trend is if you're very low in the
stack you need fewer people to do those
jobs and once you get higher in the
stack you need more and more people so
it's kind of directly correlated so
let's just take one example say you're a
hardware design engineer that's pretty
low in the stack right designing some of
the chips well there are few people
there not too many people that have that
skill set so there's not too many
hardware designers you won't encounter
them too often so again once we get
higher in the stack if hardware is down
here is kind of like hardware embedded
software and then finally at the very
top is kind of like application level
code that's why most people do
application code most people are at the
top of the stack and fewer and fewer
people are at lower levels of the stack
I don't want to say that software
developers are very displaced but if you
had to displace some of them it would be
higher in the stack where there's more
people so one example of this is if
you're a photographer you're looking to
make a quick blog for yourself you could
have two options right one option is you
hire a freelance software developer to
help you make your blog or you just sign
up for a Foursquare or or sorry you sign
up for Squarespace or WordPress so back
to this position I had it was embedded
software and that's still pretty niche
in the software realm so I don't think
those jobs are really going anywhere
question number two is what are some
major problems working in this field for
me personally this is actually more of a
personal thing but when you're an
embedded software developer you don't
really see the fruits of your labor -
well like it's not a very sexy type of
development so let's just take an
application developer for example right
if you're working on the game or you're
working on your new website you actually
see the results of that immediately
right if you work on a new homepage or a
new level in your game you see that very
quickly you build the level and you can
physically play it for me
the entire manifestation of all my work
was that the phone turns on that was it
so for this position that I held the
code the code that I worked on was code
that was actually executed before the
operating system was
loaded so it's before you even see the
Apple logo pop up on your screen and no
one you can't really show your friend
that right your friend can be like hey
man let me see what you've been working
on at work and I'll just be like oh your
your phone powers on when you're working
on such a low level like this your work
is almost kind of binary right you're
working hard just to get it to work so
what am I really getting at here but you
know some people wouldn't really mind
this some people do like working on
really really low-level stuff they don't
care about putting an app to Android or
the App Store they don't care about
getting like millions of installs they
just want to work on this cool low-level
stuff but if your mindset is a little
more product focused you want to work on
something really a cool product or
service for people you want something a
little tangible then doing some really
low-level work like this might not be
very fun for you furthermore this
software the embedded software I was
writing at the time it's a little dry
like there's slow development cycles
it's a lot of reading it's a lot of
testing it's not agile by any means so
if you're really looking for
boom-boom-boom like fast paced changing
code pushing code every single day
embedded developing is probably not for
you third question was what are your
responsibilities as a programmer so just
touched upon this a little bit but kind
of responsible for some of the core
level device drivers and Qualcomm's
mobile chipsets so that's code that kind
of interfaces with the hardware and make
sure the hardware is working really well
and provides a good interface for other
software responsibilities again is that
the phone just works you know we're not
building a product we're just making the
thing work you don't really do agile at
this level right our actual cycles of
development we're actually dependent on
Hardware cycles right if the hardware
doesn't change we don't actually have to
do anything but once new hardware comes
out new hardware gets released we have
to update our software to accommodate
for that hardware it's not really like
application programming where you can
just release software every two weeks
iterated on it really fast
embedded developing is much more slow
paced get things working and you're kind
of depend
on how the hardware changes so during
that time we had weekly meetings I got
like a one-page presentation of what I
did for the week like a one-pager and we
would all present it at a weekly team
meeting
but overall the features in the projects
they're very they're very long like
multiple weeks sometimes even months and
just a lot of testing and it's not fast
at all so I think you guys got the feel
for that the thing is when you write
device drivers this low-level code it
actually shouldn't change very fast
right application level code deserves to
be iterated on very fast and match like
a product or match the consumer needs
for embedded level software your judged
by its working so once it's working you
don't want to touch it too much unless
it's really not working so some things I
did wrote a ton of C code wrote some
assembly code for highly optimized stuff
read a lot of hardware manuals did a lot
of testing and I was very slow slow code
review so that suggests of embedded
engineering fourth question is what did
you like most about this job
so the best thing that I got out of this
job this embedded job is that it really
forced me to understand how computers
work when you're writing software that's
so low level like this when you write
software that interacts with hardware
you need actually a very firm grasp on
the whole hardware the hardware systems
and also different hardware components
and how they interact with each other I
didn't design the hardware by any means
but you had to at least know enough
about the hardware system and how the
other people put it together to write
some good software for it another thing
that I kind of liked about this job was
that it really forced me to pay
attention to details because the
software really just has to work you
have to test it and look at it very very
thoroughly so just a couple examples of
some cool projects I worked on while I
was there one of them was we wrote this
highly optimized mem copy function in
assembly like not even see it was pretty
crazy we wrote this thing in assembly so
it could perform really fast because
actually the function we wrote and see
when it was compiled down it actually
wasn't as fast as it could be another
crazy kind of hardware software thing we
did was that we took one of the caches
on one of the processors and we locked
it down so usually when you use a cache
you store data in there like data that
you want to retrieve very fast well we
did this cool thing where we kind of
locked down the cache and we put some
executable code in the cache so actually
you could actually run code in the cache
which isn't very conventional but we did
this cool thing where we prevented cache
evictions loaded up some actual runtime
executable code in there and made a run
really fast
all right fifth and last question to
address but what was the most
challenging part of your job the most by
far the most challenging part of this
whole position wasn't the software at
all it was actually managing office
politics and bureaucracy so this was a
really big company like Qualcomm the
team at Qualcomm that handles the mobile
chips is a huge team and there's so many
people doing so many different things
there's a lot of office politics stuff
going around I'm better at this kind of
stuff now I don't particularly like it
but you can imagine straight out of
college not too much work experience
you're thrown into this whole kind of
political system with all these other
engineers and it's kind of hard to
navigate so because this position was
very corporate my kind of big company I
think the most challenging part of that
was just managing people right working
with other people and you're not going
to get along with all everyone right you
might think you can but you really can't
so that was probably the toughest part
of that job all right guys that's the
end of the video and a mere thank you
again if you're watching this thank you
for asking me those five questions
they're very thoughtful insightful
questions and I could apply them to many
different things but like I said earlier
these five questions you could answer
these completely differently for another
job like for some of the other positions
I had I could answer these questions
completely differently and maybe I'll do
that in a separate video but what we
just talked about here was my best shot
at
answering those questions with the
context of being an embedded software
engineer at Qualcomm straight out of
school right so it's a very particular
circumstance all right guys that's it
for the video
probably a long video this week didn't
do too much editing but hope you enjoyed
it hope it was helpful take you again
for the questions and hit me up in the
comments if you have any questions if
you ask me something and I really don't
respond I think email I read the email
address very often so I'm going to put
the email again in the description and
if you have like a personal question or
something it's better to just email me
and I'll try to answer all right take
