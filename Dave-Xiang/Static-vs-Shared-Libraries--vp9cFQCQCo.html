today and we're going to talk about the
difference between static and shared
libraries a lot of the tech videos that
I've been making don't do quite as well
as some of the advice or how to do this
style videos that I've been making but
just to stay true to the channel and
hopefully teach everyone basic concepts
I still want to make tech videos so this
is one of them
all right so static versus shared
libraries if you use C or C++ you have
to understand this if you use any other
language you can probably get by without
really understanding how these things
work but it's still really good to have
a basic feel of what it means the
concept of libraries program linking and
how your applications use libraries is
really really core to how everything
runs and how pretty much how your
computer operates so it's just good for
us all to understand how it works all
right let's get started so as you know
right now there's just a ton of stuff
running on your computer as you watch
this video you might have Safari or
Chrome open up that's a process you have
other os-level processes that are
running some are small some are big some
are resource intensive some are really
simple
they come in all flavors so naturally
many of these processes share and
utilize very similar routines let's just
pick a routine that's really simple or a
piece of code that's highly used and one
good example this is just printing
something on standard out or printing
something to the terminal if almost
every program needs to utilize printing
something to the screen do you think
every single developer writes their own
version of the print function actually
every developer could write their own
version of print to screen but it
wouldn't really be a good use of their
time right
no one's here to reinvent the wheel when
a lot of applications use common
functionality like this and in this
example our common functionality is just
printing something to the screen well
when this happens a lot of that common
foe
Action ality and common code is packaged
up into what we call the library so what
exactly is a library first thing is that
a library itself is just a file nothing
more nothing less it's just a file
persisted on your computer and consists
of ones and zeros like every other file
the major difference
the major separating factor that we have
to understand between the library and
every other application is that you
cannot execute a library if you open up
your task manager or you press ctrl Alt
Delete there are no libraries that are
currently running everything that's
currently running is a process those are
applications those aren't libraries so
what we have to understand is that
libraries don't actually execute
applications execute but they utilize
libraries okay so this is the main
distinguishing factor and we have to be
crystal clear on that first okay so now
we pretty much have a good idea of why
we need libraries right if you all
understand why we need them let's go
into how they really work all right in
this video we're going to just talk
through two basic basic ways of how
libraries work one is called shared
libraries and the other are called
static libraries shared libraries if you
use Linux these are the dot Esso files
if you use Windows these are dot dll
files and if you use Mac these are dot
dy l IB files static files if you see
them they'll be dot a files and on
Windows they're actually dot L IB files
so different extensions across different
platforms but actually it's either a
static library or a shared library so
they'll take many shapes and forms but
the basic ideas are the same so every
single application is going to want to
use different libraries at different
points in times so let's just talk
through how an application uses a static
library versus how they use a shared
library okay so now we're going to start
breaking down the major difference
between how we use these libraries and
just try to follow with me here all
right we're going to talk about shared
libraries first
if our application utilizes a shared
library our application is going to
reference that library exactly when it
needs to reference that library when
it's running so let's just take an
example of this when our application
needs to print something to the screen
it's going to reference another shared
library on the computer that knows how
to print something to the screen and let
that handle it and none of that code
that's doing the printing actually lives
in our application it lives in that
shared library all we have to do is
reference that library when we need to
print something in that other library is
just going to handle it all right so no
code that does any kind of printing is
even included in our application so
what's the one major contingency for
using the shared library well in order
for our application to run it pretty
much means that the shared library has
to be available right because if we
don't have that around we're not going
to know what to reference or how to
print anything so when using a shared
library in order for our application to
even run we need two things we need to
pass somebody the application itself and
we need to give them the shared library
because the both of them have to work
together our application is actually
just going to straight up crash if the
shared library isn't available so this
is creating a really tight dependency
between the two things now let's just
shift gears really quickly and talk
about static libraries which is almost
the complete opposite of a shared
library and let's just talk through it
the first thing video to understand is
that our program is going to utilize a
static library at compile time and
remember compile time is before run time
something has to be compiled before you
can even run it alright
so utilizing a static library comes at
compile time we take exactly what we
need from the static library and we
literally copy all the code we need and
move it into our application so our
application has it now we take the
library that does knows how to print
something we take the function and we
take the code that we need and we move
that into our application it's just like
a copy and paste
okay so what's the major difference in
this flow versus using a shared library
remember in the shared library the
program references the library when it
runs so for your program to work you
have to have the library and the
application at the same time or
nothing's going to work okay so for a
static library
remember we kind of did a copy and paste
of exactly the code we needed and moved
it into our application so after we did
that copy and pasting we don't even need
the library anymore we can just toss it
we can just use our application because
we literally copied everything we need
into it so we just covered the main
differentiator between static and shared
libraries and let's talk about one more
big pro and con imagine if you're
dependent on 100 static libraries then
at compile time you're literally copy
and pasting code from 100 libraries into
your application this can make your
application get really really big really
fast right
the major pro with the shared library is
that since you don't do this copy and
pasting all you do is reference the
libraries when you need it it keeps your
application really really small because
they don't copy any code into it all you
have to do is reference the shared
libraries exactly when you need it so if
your application uses shared libraries
it's really small usually so major
takeaway for this point is that whether
or not you choose to use a shared or
it's static library it affects your
application size a lot and that's
something to consider when you're
developing when your dependencies get
that crazy static libraries actually are
little convenient because all those
dependencies are already compiled into
your program at compile time so when you
give your program to your customer you
just say here you go here's the
application and that's all you need to
run it on the other hand if your
application utilizes a lot of shared
libraries say you're dependent on 100
shared libraries that means your program
is going to call 100 different shared
libraries when it's running well when
you give someone your program you're
going to have to be like hey here's my
program and here you have to install 100
ly
just to use it and that's kind of crazy
I remember when I was a kid one of the
times I specifically pretty much bricked
or broke my computer is when I messed
with some of the DLL files on the
Windows computer and once I messed with
those files that pretty much just
destroyed my whole computer I didn't
understand why at the time until I
understand how libraries worked but yeah
those are really really important files
all right guys that's the end of the
video hopefully you have a basic
intuition behind how libraries are
utilized in your system it's pretty much
the core of how programs are executed
how programs are compiled everything
uses libraries alright no one writes
anything from scratch or no one writes
everything from scratch that's just
ridiculous alright guys so if you want
to take your understanding to the next
level I would also Google how linking
works which is pretty much what we
talked about is just on a really really
basic level of these libraries static
4shared but fundamentally if you
understand linking symbols and how
symbols are resolved they'll really push
your understanding to the next level so
I would recommend everyone do that if
you have some spare time alright guys
thanks for watching this tech video I
know not as many people watch these tech
videos as some of my other videos but I
still really think that these tech
videos when I go over these core tech
concepts these are really the good stuff
like this is the cool stuff you can
always Google how to become a programmer
or you can ask my advice and I made
those videos because I thought my advice
might be helpful but I really think that
a lot of the core meat
you know the guts of all this stuff
isn't a tech you got to understand the
tech foremost before you get all this
crazy advice on how to become an
engineer because this is the good stuff
alright so hope you enjoy the video
please leave me a comment or drop me a
like please subscribe if you haven't
subscribed already and I'll catch every
one next week all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
