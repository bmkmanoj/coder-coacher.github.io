weekend today we're going to be talking
web frameworks a web framework is
anything that lets you build a web
application what is a web application
web application is anything you can
access on the internet and what is the
Internet well the Internet is a series
of pipes and tubes okay
web frameworks let's get started
everyone and their mother wants to be on
the Internet and for good reason right
so if you want to be on the Internet or
build anything that goes online we have
to understand what a web application is
and how to use a web framework every
single popular programming language has
a bunch of web frameworks that you can
use Ruby the language has Ruby on Rails
or rails as a really popular framework
Python has Django and the list just
continues in this video we're talking
about four four basic things that web
frameworks provide that you have to
understand the only reason a web
framework exists is so you as a
developer do not have to reinvent the
wheel many people have been working on
the internet for a while now and you do
not have to write a lot of things from
scratch point number one is URL routing
when you're building a complicated
website or web application you're going
to support many different URLs besides
your home page what happens when we go
to this URL now again what happens when
we go to that URL you already know what
a URL is but when you build your web
application you define exactly what URLs
you're going to support so how do you
define good patterns to use when you're
organizing all these URLs how do you
define which code gets hit when a
particular URL gets hit URL routing
facilitates this it's a basic feature
provided in many web frameworks and it
just dispatches every single request
second point is database manipulation
every single web application if it's
smart at all will store some amount of
data in a database
it could be user accounts silly comments
on the forms you read and even this
video that we're watching right now is
stored in a database somewhere web
frameworks allow us to manipulate and
design these databases how do you
structure your tables and models how are
different things related to each other
how do you write to stuff and read
different entries in your database it's
all bundled up nicely for you so you
don't really have to get into the
nitty-gritty details of the database all
you have to do is use some of the
features in the web framework and you
can do probably 80 to 90% of what you
really need to do third point is
templating what do we mean by templating
well templating is simply organizing the
data that your web application returns
every single web application must return
data of some kind the most popular being
probably HTML for all the web sites you
go through in your browser but web apps
could also return data like JSON or raw
XML imagine all the HTML all the
variations in HTML that one web
application has the return
besides google.com which is super simple
this kind of data output can get really
really really hairy really fast
templating it's simply the ability to
let you organize this data output better
it allows you to separate out components
reuse different modules here's my header
of the web page here's my footer of the
web page here's the body of the web page
it could structure that HTML output for
you and remember the data that your web
application returns doesn't necessarily
have to be HTML that's just one type of
data forth
and last point about web frameworks is
that they provide basic security putting
stuff on Internet
we know is really dangerous there are
some mean people out there trying to
steal your credit cards or steal your
family photos not only people sitting
there hacking your computer but these
guys write programs to automatically try
to infiltrate crawl the web and hack
into your computers chances are you're
not really a security expert and you
probably don't want to become a security
expert so if you put something on the
internet you'll get a basic level of
security if you use a web framework
security is one of those really really
important things that nobody wants to
work on because they think it's silly
until the application gets hacked then
it's if you are a software developer and
you're watching this video I think
there's a high chance that you might
want to build something that goes on the
Internet to do this well we have to
understand what the internet is first of
all I have a video on that so you can
check that out later but we also must
understand what a web application is and
what web frameworks provide us every
single web framework out there and there
are tons of them for every single
language you can think of they all
provide these basic characteristics some
are good some are bad some have these
features some don't have those features
the whole point of this video was to
give you a basic introduction and
understanding of web frameworks and what
they provide for you let's just recap
them really quick one is URL routing
where the hell do all these URLs go and
what code gets hit second is database
manipulation don't worry about the
details just save stuff third is
templating organizing and putting
patterns through all that data you
return whether that be HTML or raw data
and fourth is basic security
measurements you're not a security
expert so use a web framework and get
some level of say
if you haven't checked out my how the
internet works video please check that
out as well if you have any questions
just leave me a comment down here please
thumbs up the video if you liked it
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
week with some more knowledge all right
take care and have a great week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
