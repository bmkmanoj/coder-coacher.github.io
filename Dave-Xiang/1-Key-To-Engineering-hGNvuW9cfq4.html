a good week I just decided to switch it
up a little bit this weekend instead of
talking like pure engineering or
programming concepts I'm just gonna try
to give a little bit of advice abstract
type stuff sorry I'm slightly congested
maybe you guys can tell about my voice
but I think we can get through this
video regardless this title is probably
like the number one most click Beatty
title I've ever created but I really
think what we're gonna talk about in
this video is probably the number one
most important part of becoming an
engineer I'm not gonna give it away
right away let's just do like a proper
introduction and we can build up to this
concept all right let's do it so they
say there are no really stupid questions
but I actually beg to differ because I
sometimes think there are some stupid
questions stupid is a pretty strong word
but there's actually a really big
spectrum of how good your question is so
at the very end of the spectrum you
could have a really like trivial
question where the person didn't really
do a lot of research or you could tell
they're just being a little lazy or you
could have a really insightful
thoughtful question that like progresses
the conversation okay so even though
there are no stupid questions I would
encourage everyone to try to ask really
thoughtful questions just pretend you
have like a finite set of questions you
can't really ask them willy-nilly and
you really have to prepare each question
very well because just think about what
you're really asking for every time we
ask a question we ask someone else to
give up a little bit of their time to
help us out some of the questions I've
received through comments or emails are
how do I learn programming what classes
do I take how do I get about doing X Y &amp;amp;
Z okay so while I'm really happy to
receive and answer these type of
questions I just have to say that
they're not the most thoughtful type of
questions and I want to just use this
video to explain that a little bit
further the key point pretty much the
number one thing I personally think
for being a really effective engineer is
to be really comfortable being
uncomfortable so let me just say that
again being really comfortable being
uncomfortable so this actually isn't
really natural for many people like
we're not born in a state of confusion
like no one likes being confused we
naturally want to ask other people
questions and get out of the confused
state I remember when I took my first
programming course ever I think in Si
and I was just confused all the time so
I just asked a lot of questions like how
do I do this what does this mean how do
I do that and I asked so many questions
that I really didn't learn or
internalize it myself
so one of the key turning points in my
learning was when I kind of figured out
that when I was really confused and in
the dark I couldn't resort to just
asking people but I would just you know
struggle and figure it out and kind of
like embrace this confusion and when I
started doing that I really started to
like learn and pick up stuff a lot
faster okay so my main point I'm trying
to make here is that if you're an
engineer we have to fully embrace the
confusion it's not natural but we just
have to embrace it it's okay that I'm
confused I can figure this out it's this
is normal
I should be confused say you want to ask
a question how do I learn programming
well first you could just do some basic
googling or YouTube and watch some
videos on how to learn programming so
you watch a bunch of videos maybe you
don't really agree with them a lot so
maybe you google and read a bunch of
blogs about how to learn programming so
at this point you've already formed a
couple opinions about yourself because
you've read different opinions on how to
learn programming so let's say you
really want to ask me like what do I
think how do I go about learning
programming well first you maybe could
check did I make a video before oh yeah
I did maybe you should just check out
that video did I happen to answer the
question in the comments already maybe
just scroll through and double check
that maybe someone else asked that same
question if you're still confused on how
to learn programming at this point
you've done so much research that you
can really ask
much more thoughtful question than just
how do I learn programming and I
guarantee that the more thoughtful
question you ask the more thoughtful
answer you'll receive this is also why a
lot of engineering curriculums kind of
forced you to be confused they're like
really hard and really difficult for a
reason all the tests all the homeworks
all the labs they're purposefully really
difficult to make you get used to being
confused so pretty much that's why
engineering is engineering right it's
not really a cakewalk and you're really
supposed to be trained mentally to
embrace this confusion once you start
embracing this and being able to you
know like dig yourself out of this
confusion darkness it actually starts to
get a lot more fun you enjoy being
confused you enjoy the process of
digging yourself out of the confusion
you enjoy what you learned out of it and
that's really like the key mindset to
becoming an engineer alright guys so I
just wanted to dedicate this video to
this one major point and hopefully it
you know rings true to you I hope this
was helpful and if you're an aspiring
engineer just try to ask the most you
know insightful thoughtful questions
that you can and I really force you to
think a little more which is fun right
thanks for watching just leave me a
comment click like if you liked the
video and as always please subscribe to
the channel if you've been enjoying
these videos I would greatly appreciate
it
alright take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
