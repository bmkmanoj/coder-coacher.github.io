really well
welcome to 2017 I hope you celebrated
the New Year as well with friends and
family I hope you bought yourself some
nice stuff besides alcohol made some new
year's resolutions and we're all going
to try to make this year better than the
last year all right for this video I was
trying to think of something different
to talk about and I thought it'd be
pretty cool if we took an example
company and tried to break down what
kind of technology and applications they
build to make their company run and the
first company I picked is gonna be
goober so in this video we're gonna take
over as an example and talk through all
like major parts of what their business
is and what each different part does and
also talk about what kind of technology
they build to help those parts alright
so without further ado let's just jump
right into it alright first let's just
give a brief introduction about uber and
what this is if you're from the states
I'm sure you've heard of this company a
drive sharing company if you're not from
the states there might be an equivalent
uber like company in your country but
here it's almost pervasive now you know
everyone uses it it's in almost every
single probably it's in every single
major city and it'll let people get
rights alright so what they do that's a
little different from the conventional I
guess big companies that drove people
around or drove things around is that
uber uses this model called the shared
asset model when uber all they do is
they hook up drivers with customers
people that need rides but they don't
own any of the actual cars right the
cars are owned by those drivers other
companies like FedEx or UPS they
actually own all their trucks that
they're using to move stuff around
uber has this shared thing going on
where the drivers on the cars they just
drive people around and uber facilitates
the whole operation so these days people
just call it uber for this
for that uber for this uber for food but
that's actually the more kind of more
official term for it all right shared
asset shared economy but that's what
they do
giving people rides all right so what I
did in this video I just kind of I broke
down six major parts of their company
and for each part we're going to talk
about how tech plays a role in that part
all right so I have six categories here
we're going to go through them one at a
time I'm going to keep it up here
the major list and let's just get
started all right guys the first
category that we're going to talk about
is a CRM which is a customer
relationship management tool this is
actually not particular just the uber
this is pervasive across every single
company every single business in the
world needs this and it's really
important so we still have to talk about
it but what a customer relationship
management tool CRM what this does is
everything and anything related to
getting new customers and getting new
businesses and this is really important
because you always need new customers to
pavéd
or else you die right so every single
company in the world does devote some
resources to CRM or customer
relationships if you heard of a company
called Salesforce they actually provide
CRM tools as a service for other
companies like uber for example right
they want to devote as much brainpower
and development power into their raw
operation of driving people around they
want to focus probably at least they're
not in the business of writing CRM
software that's why they probably use
another service like Salesforce for
those tools so I have a couple examples
here of what those tools really are it's
organizing all contacts anyone you talk
with any phone call you make like
different stages in the pipeline of what
you're doing with customers like
we talked to Bob one time oh we talked
to Sally twice oh we booked a meeting
with Jane so managing all of that stuff
it's automatic marketing tools automatic
outreach tools prospecting getting new
customers generating new leads so
anything related to getting new
customers and this is always important
because customers they pay you is the
lifeline of the business and everyone
devotes resources into this the other
kind of interesting reason why this is
so important and I wanted to bring it up
is that I've seen job titles or they're
there are job titles where it's actually
like sales engineer or sales force
engineer and pretty much what that means
is companies hire developers with the
sole purpose of enhancing their customer
relationship whether that be integrating
with sales force better you know running
their own analytics finding out ways to
get new business getting new customers
but this is so important because it
makes money this is really the place
where you make money in sales that all
these companies uber is just one of them
but they will probably probably have a
team a team of engineers devoted just
for getting new business so that's why a
Syrah is really important that's why
we're talking about it first and that's
that all right so the second category we
have is another very general term and
this is called business logic or biz
logic but all this really means is that
every single company has their own
little nuances and complexities to their
business right company a is going to be
completely different from Company B like
Apple is really different from
Salesforce they all have their own
little business logic and how like the
whole system operates so so the first
part of business logic that any company
would have to do is track data that's
relevant to their company so what kind
of data might be relevant to a bur but
just a couple quick examples of uber has
to track their vendors and their
customers right vendors being who they
pay all the people are driving and
customers being who pays them all of us
everyone that uses the app for blooper
right so for drivers what's their
profile what's their driving record do
they have any accidents what are their
documents what's their history of
driving what's their driver of rating do
they have four stars five stars all that
stuff this data that can be tracked
they're also tracking the profiles of
all their customers or us you know how
many times have we used uber what sort
of profile was our demographic all that
stuff is being tracked as well so what
does this all mean from the developers
perspective all right we just talked
through a bunch of examples of types of
data that uber would want to track but
how would we implement something like
this and it's not so crazy so for the
data part is obviously ubers maintaining
a ton of different databases this is
probably probably like Postgres or
sequel but just to store the data they
have to organize it askew ties it you
know design the tables how the tables
are related so they have to design that
system and put it somewhere so all the
data has to go somewhere probably in
standard databases I wouldn't be
surprised that they use like Postgres or
all that stuff but that's the data part
so on top of the data part they have to
make it actually usable for the company
so they've probably also developed many
many internal tools on top of that data
like internal dashboards internal
websites for all the Hoover employees
but this is not that crazy right you
have a layer of data here and to manage
all this data inside the company you
probably just have different web
applications that are touching and
hitting this data so I think I have one
friend that works there he says they're
really Python heavy so it wouldn't be
surprised if they used django sequel
alchemy but they used a lot of Python
there and they definitely also use a
probably some cool front-end frameworks
to build those web apps so just the
recap business logic is another really
general term
but it's pretty simplistic it's all the
business specific data that you want to
track organize and persist in your
system and then it's a layer of
applications on top of that data so your
company can use it all right so that's
part number two which is just business
logic still very general sorry guys you
spilled some water on my shirt it's
really hot in my apartment and I'm
sweating bullets when it's winter here
my apartment just has two settings for
the heat it's either off or it's
extremely hot and it's extremely hot
right now so all right the third major
part of uber is probably one of the more
cooler parts of their whole system but
I'm labeling this as science and I'm
putting a lot of stuff into this
category but it's anything a little more
technical that's related to uber and
we're gonna talk through a couple
examples I'm sure what uber was first
starting they probably used a lot of
third-party services to do this now that
they're so big I'm almost positive they
do all this stuff in the house because a
lot of this stuff is some of the secret
sauce the core stuff behind their whole
company so I wouldn't be surprised if
they do all of this themselves the first
is probably anything related to
directions I think uber probably used
Google Maps when they're first starting
but I'm sure they do all this stuff now
so this is directions maintaining Maps
turn-by-turn directions getting ETS for
all their different drivers like your
drivers coming in five minutes that's
all very science it's not really science
but you know for this purposes it's
science another example I have here is a
cougar pool which is a cool feature
where you can actually like carpool with
different people that need rights so you
can imagine that the base case problem
is pretty simple right you need to get
picked up driver has to go from point A
to point B now when you have carpooling
it could be like four passengers one
or like five passengers to drivers but
then the system gets or the problem gets
much more complex and someone has to
solve that so uber pool there's probably
a science II problem another one is
smart pricing based on demand if you
ever use uber you know that there's
surge pricing when there's a high demand
in rides the prices go up so you have to
pay a lot more right if you go out on a
Saturday night everyone's been drinking
everyone needs to ride home so the
prices skyrocket but there's systems
behind that too right it's not just
arbitrary plus fifty percent all that
surge pricing there's like a very
logical system behind that so Lubert
probably maximizes their profits the
last part of this science that I just
wanted to mention is that some of this
stuff is more synchronous like more
real-time like the turn-by-turn the
directions but there's also a lot of
stuff happening async or in the
background right you can imagine all the
data that uber is collecting like every
time we use it just imagine all the data
they're collecting there's also probably
a lot of you know machine learning data
science happening in the background
which is collecting all that data
forming patterns making predictions and
they're definitely there's definitely
some engineers working on that oh yeah
and one last thing
obviously I forgot to mention I was
going to say that uber doesn't have the
most cutting-edge technologies but if
you didn't know Hoover's also investing
Rd and self-driving cars which is that's
probably the most technical thing
they're actually really doing just
getting people driven is it all that
technical but self-driving cars is
probably pretty technical so all this
stuff I bucketed under science and it's
a big part of their business alright
guys that was the halfway point we're on
to number four the fourth category for
ubers business is going to be client
applications and this is how we
interface with the company so client
application is what I mean is anything
we use in our phone right this is the
uber app that you log onto to get a ride
somewhere
those are client applications because
we're the clients you know iOS
they probably have location services
there's probably systems in place for
all the notifications you know you get
nice push notifications your uber is
here all that stuff have systems behind
it and there's also different client
applications between a driver and a
rider right the application we use to
get a ride is very different than the
application that the driver uses to
drive people around so when I say client
it just means anyone external - ooh BRR
and there's a lot of applications built
for those people all right fifth is
going to be dispatching in operations
and client applications is actually a
good segue into this topic all right so
uber has all these cars going around
obviously they need to build a lot of
systems for dispatching and operation
and that's going to be more of an
internal internal system dispatching is
probably all the smart logic all the
smart business logic that's actually
powering the client application right
you know you click request right and
then some kind of real-time system kicks
in to match you with an uber driver
that's kind of visible by the
dispatching system they've built so I'm
positive that tons of engineering
resources have probably went into
designing the dispatch an operating
system behind uber they probably have
huge dashboards of blinking dots of
where all the cars are where they're
going what's a traffic light what's the
demand like was to supply like anything
related to the whole operation their
software and applications written and
for that live updates tracking a ton of
logging even more logging of what's
happening and all that logging stuff is
probably fed into the science system and
all of this stuff all the stuff is
internal tools again so there's probably
more engineers I would imagine there's
more engineers dedicated to internal
tooling in uber than there are in any of
the external applications there's
probably like two engineers working on
that app and then like a hundred
engineers working on all the dispatching
systems another thing to note
developers perspective is that since a
lot of this stuff is real-time they
probably use a little faster
technologies or some caching techniques
to make this real-time stuff possible
they probably use Redis or memcache you
know fast techniques to track and have
real-time dashboards about all this
stuff so it's still gonna be web
applications for probably a little more
fine-tuned for like speed and stuff but
not that crazy so that was the fifth
part dispatcher all right guys we're at
the end of the video almost at the end
of the video but this is the last major
category behind uber and that's another
very general one but this is going to be
financials so we talked about talked
about customers internal tooling
business logic we talked about science
we talked about client facing
applications like your iOS app and we
also talked about dispatching and
operations but the last major entity for
any business is going to be financials
and handling all the resources behind
your company for this section I'm just
gonna run through a couple examples to
give you a sense of what kind of stuff
goes into financial planning you know
there could be many things the first
being there's obviously payment
processing that has to happen uber
probably uses a third-party service to
do this payment possible payment
processing through banks hooking up your
credit card doing automatic payments all
that stuff they're definitely tracking
financial performance very well there's
definitely developers devoted to
tracking the performance of a company
because that's an insanely important
metric it's like how much did we pay
this driver how much did the customer
pay us if we pay the driver less than
the cup customer pays us we make money
right so that's probably the most
simplistic way to look at it but it's
probably much more complex than that
another thing finance has to do is track
all assets of your company so for uber
it's a little simple right like they
don't all of the cars the driver almost
the cars but that's just one ask that
there's probably many other assets to be
tracked the stuff they own and it's kind
of like a big inventory system right it
might not be that crazy for uber but
it's probably insane for Amazon so
there's a lot of systems in place to
track all your assets your inventory all
that stuff so all this stuff we're
talking about is actually encapsulated
in another kind of service which is
called an ERP this is a enterprise
resource planning but this is also
another pervasive part of every business
every company is going to have an ERP
system just like every company is going
to have a CRM system all right so
resource planning it's all the assets
inventory we just talked about it's all
your finances your margin your revenue
you're costing it's like how much cash
you have in the bank are we doing well
are we doing bad it's planning all the
resources from now and in the future so
erps do that and it's another kind of
every single company has born from ubers
perspective they're definitely not in
the business of designing and ERP
solution right Oracle does that just
like uber is not in the business of
designing a CRM solution they probably
use Salesforce I probably a hundred
percent sure or 99% sure that uber is
probably using a third-party service and
do all their resource planning Oracle is
a big one and there's many others all
right so I just wanted to put this out
there as the last one because even
though this is not particular to Lewbert
it's still like common for every single
company all right guys that's the end of
the video it's kind of a long one I hope
that made a little bit of sense there's
definitely a lot of stuff going around
half of this stuff is very like just
general business stuff like customers
crms Europe ease resource planning those
are all in general very general for any
this and then also we talked about a
couple more specific things like
business logic you know science
dispatching client applications but for
every single company in the whole world
they always have like a general lair of
that kind of cookie cutter stuff the
cookie cutter stuff being like CRM ERP
tracking finances that's kind of like
table steak stuff and then on top of
that you have business logic like stuff
that's particular to uber like
dispatching science algorithms
turn-by-turn directions and all that
stuff needs to be wrapped up with nice
applications so that's pretty much it
for uber not so much detailed from the
technical perspective but hopefully it
gives you a sense of all the different
applications that are being built for
the whole company and I guarantee you
that for all these categories up here
for everything we talked about there's
some software developer working on that
stuff we guarantee you alright guys hope
you enjoyed this video
tried to fit a lot of information in one
place hope it made sense if you have any
questions just leave me a comment or
write me email please give me a thumbs
up if you enjoy the video and I'll see
you next week all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
