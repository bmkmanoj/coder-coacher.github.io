going to talk about some really cool
topics so let's start by getting excited
excited in april of this year just a few
months ago obama announces new project
called the brain project but what this
is is a multi-billion dollar project
that's going to last 10 or more years
whose goal is to study and understand
how the brain works brain stands for
brain research through advancing
innovative neurotechnologies and i'll
just add a link here if you want to
check it out or maybe you can google it
and find out more if you're interested
if you've heard about the human genome
project this is really similar to that
but instead of DNA we're dealing with
brains this could potentially be into
some crazy advances in science we could
cure Alzheimer's or we could create
Terminator robots so before I go any
further into this vlog I just want to
say that I'm not a neuroscientist I'm
just an engineering I'm an engineer that
happens to be working on the team that's
contributing to this effort so I just
know a little bit about it and I wanted
to share it with you guys first let's
just go over why it would be
mind-blowing if we could replicate how
the brain processes information a
computer processor and a brain are both
processing units in a sense but they're
good and bad and different things a
computer will always be able to solve
10,000 math problems faster than you'll
ever be able to but you could probably
recognize your mom's face more
accurately than any computer could a
robot could remember more essays and you
could ever remember but if a robot
tripped on a staircase they'd probably
crash and burn while you would
compensate in check your step unless
you're a super clumsy person that you
would also crash and burn also try to
fathom just how our memory works
everything you know everything you've
experienced through your whole life is
somehow stored in these neurological
connections between neurons inside your
brain is that mind-blowing I don't know
how it works I'm not sure many people in
the world really know how that works
exactly but
sounds a little more elegant and having
big ass servers sitting somewhere that
hold all your facebook and twitter
updates wouldn't it be cool if we could
figure out how brain memory works or
actually we're going to be even cooler
if we could figure out how the brain
works in general memory is just one part
of what the brain does brain does motor
control and processes all your sensory
input doesn't kind of stuff I'm going to
sidetrack a little bit and talk about
processors just a little bit so inside
your cell phone or your computer you
have many different processors most
people are usually aware about their
systems general purpose processor it's
usually the one running the operating
system and probably majority of
applications those processors are crazy
powerful they can do a ton of stuff but
they're actually kind of general there's
a lot of other more specialized
processors that run site or cell phone
so one example is the graphical
processing unit also known as the GPU
the GPU will speak a completely
different processor instruction set than
your Pentium 10 will your general
purpose processor might speak
instructions like add or multiply what
your GPU might speak in the structure
like draw polygon that was a really
crude example I just want to convey the
point that different processors are
specialized to do different things your
general purpose processor could do all
the work that your GPU does but it just
do it much much slower for all you
gamers out there have you ever tried
running some crazy 3d game without
hardware acceleration it's just horrible
and terribly slow besides graphics
there's also processors which specialize
in air interface protocols aka when you
make phone calls on your cell phone so
when you call your mom on the phone on
the weekend there's specialized
processors that's not the general
purpose processor that talks to the
local cell base station and lets you
talk with your palm the general purpose
one might barely be involved well you
have one big system either your computer
your cell phone it could have a variety
of different processors doing different
things it's not just one so they all
work together and how
different applications behind them all
right so how does this relate back to
Obama on the brain project and all that
neural network stuff well what if you
had a processor that was specialized in
a neuro instruction set architecture
instead of instructions like add or
multiply a neural processor could have
instructions like update neuron
potential that would be one instruction
there are a lot of universities and
research institutions that study these
neural networks they design these big
models of how they think the brain
should work and they try to simulate it
on the computers to check if it's doing
anything intelligent but this is the
average professors computer have a neuro
specialized processor in it nope it
doesn't right they just have normal
petty intense or some AMD processor
inside their computer it's not
specialized for any kind of neural
computations because of this when neuro
scientists try to simulate their neural
models it runs really slow on these
computers this would be analogous to you
trying to run call of duty without a
graphics card it'd take like five days
to like load your gun so I work at the
R&amp;amp;D division of Qualcomm Incorporated
and we're trying to contribute or help
out with this whole brain project thing
if you don't know Qualcomm is known for
building processors and usually those
processors are inside your cell phone
and since I've been talking about all
this you can probably take a guess about
what our R&amp;amp;D team is trying to do for
this great project remember hardware and
software are equally important in any
system you can't have hardware without a
software you can't write software on top
of nothing it's like if you erase your
hard drive to try to turn on your
computer your computer is as useful as a
brick probably maybe less useful than a
brick if there was some crazy magical
neuro optimized processor but there's
not the right narrow software it's going
to be useless to before we build
terminators we really have to understand
and how the brain actually works so we
could potentially write software to
replicate that once we have the hardware
and the software in place we can
potentially program the learning neural
network that can go in Arnold
Schwarzenegger's head right and once we
program the learning neural network we
can have judgement day and it's going to
get crazy anyways that pretty much sums
up the video I just wanted to introduce
this whole initiative to you guys so at
least you're aware not many people
follow what Obama does for like the
scientific community the whole thing
seems really daunting and ridiculous at
first how are you going to map out and
understand the whole brain but if you
look back on it I'm pretty sure the
Human Genome Project and mapping out the
DNA sequence was also a crazy idea when
they first introduced it and they
completed it so maybe this could
potentially be completed you know 10 or
20 years or something I hope you liked
the video just drop me a comment if you
have any questions or anything and I'll
try to answer as best I can I'll catch
you guys next time alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
