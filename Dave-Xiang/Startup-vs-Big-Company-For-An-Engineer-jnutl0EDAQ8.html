just want to address one of the most
popular questions I've been asked
regarding startups and big companies
today I'm going to be discussing
everything from an employee's
perspective so it's not really the
perspective if you're trying to start
your own company for example so in this
video I'm just going to over by three
most important differences between the
two let's do it
okay so compensation and we got to talk
about this and I'm just going to talk
about it first so the thing that you
have to realize is that the cold hard
cash that you take home is always going
to be greater at a big company we have
to just accept this for now actually
just accept it when you're at a
well-funded startup you'll definitely
get a good probably market rate salary
but the thing that you have to consider
with a large corporate company is that
they have a lot of other forms of
compensation
there's stock purchasing plans there's
retirement matching there's maybe more
bonuses so when you add all this stuff
up together the hard cash that you get
it's just larger at a big company one of
the major parts of your total
compensation package when you're
considering working at a start-up is
equity and I'm sure you all know this
concept but it's pretty much you owning
a little piece of the company the most
important thing I would consider when
regarding equity is that you cannot
consider it as cold hard cash you can do
all the math what if the startup gets
bought for two billion dollars all have
so much money but actually never do that
kind of math it'll probably make you
overthink things and when you get your
equity it's more of a goodwill for you
to do a good job but do not consider it
as cash all right last point I want to
make here regarding compensation is that
you have to consider this along with
your personal life and that's really
really really really important if you
have a lot of responsibilities in your
life you might have a family you have
medical expenses you've got to help out
your parents then you probably need cold
hard cash today and a start-up might not
be the best choice for you
this first difference in compensation
has to always be considered really
really really closely with your personal
life as well okay so that's the last
point I wanted to make about that all
right
point number two that I want to make is
the difference in choice that you have
the major point I want to make here is
that you really have a choice of what
you want to work on and who you want to
work with if you choose a start-up of
course big companies are very different
some might be more flexible than others
but since they're so big more often than
not that just choosing whatever you want
to work on or choosing the people that
you want to work with it's pretty
difficult so are you really interested
in healthcare well you can find a
perfect startup that's doing health care
in exactly the area you care about do
you like working with fradi guys I drink
a lot of beer all day well then you
could find a healthcare start-up filled
with Friday guys I go to happy hour
every day you just don't have choices
like that at a big company for me
personally I think having the choice of
the people I work with is probably the
biggest benefit and luxury and there's
something I just value a lot eventually
though as a company grows naturally the
people increase you can never really get
along with 100% of the people you work
with it's just impossible okay so the
last third and final point I want to
make is regarding responsibilities and
condensed experience so at a start-up
it's almost guaranteed that you're going
to take on more responsibility since
there's fewer people naturally it means
that more is riding on you so maybe
you're at a big company and you're
coding away all day but maybe your code
never sees the light of day because the
products just get thrown out well if you
want to join an environment where your
code doesn't get thrown out you don't
feel like a little cog in the big
machine then a start-up might be for you
on the other hand if you just want to
chill out relax you don't really want
too much responsibilities and you just
want to collect that paycheck then a big
company's probably for you
so inherently with this increased level
of responsibility at a startup and
naturally leads to you getting more
experience in a shorter amount of time
this is another cool part of startups
which is the career experience aspect
but sometimes things that might take ten
years add a big company you could maybe
get that same level of experience that
maybe one or two years out of startup
since your responsibilities inherently
go up it just means you do more things
you manage more people you do more
planning you write more code you just do
more things and you experience a lot
more alright guys so those were three
major differences and one of the most
important points that I thought of when
comparing startups to big companies
whether you're considering to work for
either or or maybe you're at a big
company and you just want to make the
switch there's obviously a lot more
differences out there that you can do
your own research on but these are just
my top three and with any decision you
make with your career just do as much
much much research as possible because
this stuff is you know it's affecting
your life so it's really important so I
hope these points helped you and
hopefully you can make an informed
decision if you're thinking about this
and as always just do what you really
want to do alright so see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
