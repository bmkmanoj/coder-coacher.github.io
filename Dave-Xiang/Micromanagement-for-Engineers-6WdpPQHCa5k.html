all doing well it is insanely cold in
New York City right now and it's
uncomfortable to go outside so just
chilly here making a video not like I
would be doing anything else anyway one
of the most common topics that people
have been asking about is more about the
work life issues and complications
obstacles that an engineer might go
through so I wanted to dedicate this
video actually to talk about this thing
called micro managing if you haven't
been through this I'm 100% sure you'll
go through it or become a micro manager
sometime in your life it's pretty
self-explanatory and I'm pretty sure you
already know what it kind of means so
I'm not going to try to define it with
regards to engineering micromanaging can
sometimes feel like you're really
implementing someone else's thoughts and
it's not a really good feeling in this
video I want to share my experience
personally with being micromanage what I
did pretty poorly what I could have done
better and just some insights I've
gained about what it was like and how to
deal with it a little better so without
further ado let's just start the video
and I think this one's going to be
pretty long so hope you enjoy it so
during my first position out of school
in California I actually switched teams
after my first year and at the start of
my second year I was actually a part of
this brand new team the tricky thing
about this situation was those actually
my new managers first time managing
someone that would be me
so it was very new for both of us it was
her first time managing someone and
those I was new anyway and I was just
thrown under a new team at the time when
you're so new working at this big
company you kind of overlook the whole
management politics side of the company
and all you care about is kind of
working on cool things making a mark for
yourself pic stature etc you kind of
overlooked management well at least I
overlooked me this was when I really
the impression that management was more
or less at or for a lot of people
I remember my original manager when we
first talked he was like yeah we'll have
status updates every month we'll catch
up talk about your problems
I literally talked with him one time the
whole year when I had my first
performance review so not exactly every
single month right
long story short before we get into a
lot of the details but under this new
manager during my second year I just
felt heavily heavily micromanaged as an
engineer micromanagement in engineering
can take many forms
your manager could email you almost
every day asking for status updates he
or she could review every single line of
code you write there's so many examples
of micromanaging but I think the core
issue at hand is just an inherent
distrust between two people asked with
many other things in life if you have an
internal gut feeling of this mistrust
and you have a gut feeling of being
somewhat micromanaged
you are being micromanage too so you'll
feel it when it happens the first thing
that I wanted to do in this video is
first empathize and put ourselves in the
managers shoes a little bit because we
can't just off the bat and say that oh
that was a shitty manager we have to
first understand where they're coming
from before we can really understand how
this is working
everyone has a different circumstance
that you have to consider the first
almost most common reason of a
micromanager is that remember everyone
answers to someone your manager answers
to someone else and the chain just keeps
going up all the way to you know God
your manager wants to look good for
their superiors and your work reflects
on them
so obviously whatever you do is a
reflection on them so that leads to a
lot of that control and micromanaging
sometimes everyone answers to someone
everyone ok everyone
another really common form of
micromanaging especially in the
engineering realm is when you have an
engineering manager who is particularly
stubborn or has a really big ego this is
kind of like the second most common use
case when you find yourself implementing
work and you know or you feel like you
didn't think about it yourself then you
might be getting micromanage to the last
point for empathizing and putting
ourselves in the managers shoes is you
have to take into consideration the
mindset of your manager maybe it's their
personality maybe they're not really
used to letting go or maybe they're
actually control freaks
you can't attribute good engineering to
control freaks right actually paying
attention to detail is usually a good
attribute of an engineer but sometimes
that kind of backfires when your manager
so if someone is naturally a control
freak many people actually are a control
freak I think we're all guilty of being
that but that can actually easily lead
to like kind of symptoms and traits of
micromanaging and it has nothing to do
or reflects your engineering skills at
all it's just your previous mindset and
habits so that's my last point about
kind of putting ourselves in the point
of view of the managers remember that
there are people too they're trying to
learn too and they're not going to be
doing their job perfectly so before we
make any rash assumptions on crap that's
a crappy micromanager just make sure to
take a step back and really think about
what they're going through and their
circumstances that's the baseline what
we have to do
okay so we've just put ourselves into
the managers shoes a little bit to
empathize a little bit with them what
I'm going to do in this part is go
through three basic steps in order about
potentially what an engineer could do if
you're being micromanaged the first
thing the very first thing we should do
is first ask ourselves do a little bit
of that introspection and just ask
is there a real reason that I'm being
micromanaged do you not listen to
instructions at all are you terribly
inconsistent with your work I hope to
answer to these questions are no but if
the answer to those questions are uh
maybe then you already stopped there
maybe you should be micromanaged if
you're not pulling your own weight
overall this should be a really easy gut
call you'll know yourself if you're
doing a good job or you're kind of
slacking and I hope you're not slack
consider your work very truthfully and
maybe it's the root cause of all this
that's the first step and make sure do
that step first all these steps are
gonna go in order second like I said
before you'll kind of know it in your
gut if you're being micromanaged and if
you know also your gut that you're
producing your work well then maybe
there's another more deeper issue at
hand my first advice for this is to
openly talk with your manager about it
and this is probably the most difficult
thing to do and one of the things I did
a really terrible job with when I was my
second year of working I remember
specifically during that time my manager
actually came out and asked me directly
herself she asked me hey can we talk a
little bit just about our work our
process
how are you liking things there was so
much going on at my mind at the time but
I remember I kind of dismissed it and I
didn't really address any of the real
issues and it just there's a lot fizzled
out so all those problems just kept
going if we don't acknowledge or have
open dialogues with our manager these
things don't change right if we don't
acknowledge anything nothing can change
overall speaking about issues like these
with people they're hard conversations
and they're very hard to start usually
as a manager you don't have to bring it
up first but if you have the luxury of
your manager bringing up I would highly
recommend you take advantage of that
my advice for having these open
dialogues with your manager really go
back to my first point about really
yourselves in the shoes of your manager
and empathizing with them don't make any
quick assumptions just try to take time
and put yourselves in their shoes and
understand their perspective and it'll
put your assumptions in a much different
light when you have an open dialogue
with your manager we're still on point -
but first you have to be very honest
with how you're feeling and remember
it's how you're feeling
first before accusing them of doing
anything you have to first start it off
with how you've been feeling recently
yourself tell them straight up how
you're feeling you have a brief overview
of what's been on your mind
and lastly probably one of the most
important things is that you have to
give a very very specific example of a
time when you felt micromanage at this
point they've already know what's on
your mind they're already kind of
worried because they're managee is
complaining and now you really have to
give a concrete example to solidify this
because they kind of know how you're
feeling it's still a little wishy-washy
but once you lay down one or two
concrete situations they'll really sink
in for both of you guys all right so
here's an example one time we were
having a code review and you really
really pushed your point of view during
that code review you really didn't like
any of the things I implemented why
exactly it was your methodology better
than mine how come you didn't ask any
questions about how I implemented it huh
why did you why were you so aggressive
with your thoughts be as specific as
possible name the exact code review or
name the exact feature that this
happened okay so now we're finally on
the third and last point of the sequence
number three is kind of when an open
dialogue isn't really working maybe your
manager is not receptive of this maybe
he or she is really really maybe they
really have a big ego and none of this
is just sinking in and you've already
you know stepped out of your comfort
zone and brought all this stuff up and
nothing's changing when this happens
it's really time to move on and you have
to bring in a
party this is gonna be different between
company and company and how they've run
their management but bringing in a third
party means you have to discuss this
issue with someone else maybe this is
your boss's boss maybe you have to go to
him or her directly maybe this is HR to
start I promise you there will be
someone to go to that isn't your direct
manager there will always be someone
else that you can talk with first my one
most important piece of advice for this
last step is that nothing will be the
same if you take this step what do I
mean by this well if you bring in a
third party to discuss this issue with
you and your manager you have to realize
that the relationship between you and
your manager will really never be the
same after that point things got so bad
you couldn't resolve it that you really
had to ask a third party so please you
have to take really really good care if
things get to this level personally my
biggest mistake was doing step 1 and
jumping too quickly to step 3 without
having enough open dialogue with my
manager at the time I kind of jumped the
step 3 probably a little or a lot more
quickly than I really should have the
moment I went to a third party to start
resolving this issue of micromanaging I
had with the person overseeing my work
it forever changed our relationship and
I eventually left the team because of
that the new team I joined it was like a
much more badass team which I was really
excited to join but I can't deny the
fact that part of the reason I was even
looking to join something else was that
I had this internal thing going on with
my manager this micromanagement thing I
just want to reiterate this point again
because I feel it's very important but
if you've done steps 1 &amp;amp; 2 with your
manager and you feel this situation
still isn't resolved
step 3 is really a relationship
disrupting changing step so my number
one piece of advice from me going
through this situation and for everyone
out there who might be going through
something similar
that really really take great care and
put your own effort into part to the
open dialogues I jumped from step one to
step three a little too quickly without
putting enough of sincere effort in part
two and it's probably one of my biggest
regrets for my early professional career
overall you know what's done is done
this whole thing that I went through
maybe lasted about half a year or so it
was a great learning experience for me
and hindsight I can reflect a little bit
and talk about it now but it really
sucked at the time and I didn't really
go about it the right way so I hope if
anyone's going through this this advice
is helpful and you know you deal with it
well alright guys that's the end of the
video and let's just do a quick recap a
bit to summarize the first thing you
have to do is remember introspect
yourself and make sure there's no reason
that you should be micromanaged if
you're slacking not responsible not
delivering then you can't even have this
conversation step two is remember have a
sincere open dialogue with your manager
where you really try to empathize first
and see where they're coming from see
yourself in your managers shoes don't
make any rash assumptions finally step
three is only used when open dialogue
really isn't working or improving the
situation you have to bring in third
parties to help you deal with this
situation and remember step three if you
get to this point it's really gonna
disrupt the relationship after that
alright guys hope you enjoyed this video
it was kind of just the reflection on
some of the stuff I went through nothing
too technical here but I hope my
experience and my thoughts around this
might be helpful for anyone out there
that's been thinking about this stuff
