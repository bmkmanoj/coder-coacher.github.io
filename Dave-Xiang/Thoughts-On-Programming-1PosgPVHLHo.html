doing really really well making a
screencast video this week even though
there's no reason for this video to be a
screencast I just didn't have a lot of
time this weekend to properly film edit
and do the production stuff for a
regular video video actually yesterday I
turned 29 so that's my age today I spent
a lot of time resting because a lot of
festivities yesterday but anyways still
want to get the weekly content out and
talk about some random thoughts on my
mind there's no real concrete topic for
this video but the theme is just random
thoughts I had regarding programming and
hopefully it addresses still a lot of
recurring questions that have been asked
so I take notes for a lot of these
things for videos every time you guys
ask questions actually keep notes for
ideas but there's still a bunch of
recurring questions that I want to
address in this video and it's gonna be
a little bit of a kitchen sink but I
like making these screencasts every now
and then because it tests my speaking
actually I don't have the luxury of
doing the production editing so I'm
trying to do this in one cut which is
actually a little difficult so anyways
hopefully turns out smooth and let's
just start with the stuff so I had two
major thoughts in this video and the
first thought is just regarding words
and I feel like some people are caught
up in words often and the the to long
don't read of this whole thing is I
wouldn't dwell too much about words but
if I really had to answer how to use
words properly in this whole programming
tech industry type of thing this is what
I think alright so programming or coding
is a skill that's what you should
consider it as it's purely just a skill
while something like software developer
or software engineering or software
engineer as a title alright so one
distinction that I think is really good
to make is always distinguish a title
from a skill and finally words like
computer
science computer engineering information
systems these are fields of study all
right so these are what majors are like
maybe a whole class is gonna be labeled
something like this but anyways I
thought first I just wanted to group
these words together all right because
still the number one question people ask
is like what's what's a software
developer versus a software engineer or
all these small differences and four
just like that question software
developer software engineer I think it's
the same all right just to be clear so
let me just give a few examples of this
um there are many different types of
software developers I made a video on
this where I tried I made like 13
different types of software developers
from what I've seen so far there's
probably many many more but there are
many types of software developers and
they might actually have different
titles too but they they're all software
developers and each different type
requires different backgrounds alright
so just a quick example an embedded
software developer needs them to
understand computer systems and hardware
versus a web application software
developer needs to understand HTTP and
the Internet
alright so many different software
developers each of them requires
different background knowledge so
hopefully that's clear lastly regarding
programming or coding like the you're
not a programmer or coder that's not
really a real job title all right you
can't people that say they're like a
coder it's just it's not really a good
description of what you actually do
people with these different titles they
can use coding on their job right but
that's not the only skill they have
coding is a skill and it's just like one
of many skills you're gonna have one
thing I thought of was just a software
developer will always need to know how
to code but maybe a biology scientist
might also use coding to help analyze
their experimental data or something so
coding is a skill like a scientist could
know
how to code just like a software
developer also knows how to code but
obviously the software developers gonna
do it a little better but long story
short is I wouldn't think too hard about
these things
I still think so many people ask about
the the subtleties or whatever the the
little differences with all these words
but there's not too much to think about
all right it's just try to keep it
simple with that said I still want to
touch briefly on thought like my
thoughts on how to learn how to program
and this is still another really popular
question that's asked it's kind of like
hey what book should I get what's the
best program to use or what are the best
courses to take how do i best learn how
to go about programming and there's so
many different ways I think maybe
there's maybe a small fear of learning
how to do this the right way because
they're these these are so many ways to
learn how to program but in the end just
like anything I would say you just do it
and I feel a lot of people might be
slightly frozen because they're trying
to learn the fastest way possible the
best way possible the the right way
possible but they end up just being a
little like frozen and not learning how
to progress because there's so many
options of progressing so um my two
cents on this is actually just do it
because even if you pick a not-so-good
way you just figure out that's not the
best way for you to learn programming
and then you can move on to a different
method that might suit you better
because there's so many different ways
not every way or every medium of
learning is gonna work for you so you
have to also spend some time and figure
out what's gonna work for you I just put
down a few things here I've talked about
this before but still there's so many
ways to learn the skill of programming
but these are just like seven potential
ways you could go about learning alright
and it's just seven straight things I'm
not gonna spoon-feed anything I'm not
gonna give links any books I'm not gonna
give links to any programs these are
just like
different ways and hopefully after
hearing this you do the research
yourself to figure out how to best go
about it so a one thing before we get
into this is that I know some of these
are a little different some people might
have the luxury of having money or going
to a school so I want to give a full
spectrum of how they're different also
from a monetary perspective because I
know you know people don't have access
to all these things in all this
different situations so first it's just
going to be online courses and some of
these are cost money but the majority of
these online courses are free and they
just take some time and self-discipline
to complete so if you don't have the
luxury of maybe going into an accredited
programming I still think the online
courses are good because they are
structured and especially when you're
first learning I personally think that
when you're first starting out you do
need a little bit of structure or else
you're just gonna be everywhere you're
not gonna know what's the best thing to
learn so I'm not going to tell you what
online courses to use I would say first
try the ones that come out of the best
schools like try Harvard's online
courses or try mi t--'s Harbor mi t--'s
courses so these are available to a
certain extent from some top
institutions and just check those out
too alright let's keep going
self-directed projects is just getting
as hands-on as possible and getting some
practice doing projects on your own a
good way to actually do this especially
for web programming I would go to the
websites of many boot camps like I know
there's one boot camp it's called App
Academy and they always do like the same
two or three projects all the time and
you can take some of those projects and
just try it yourself like try to
recreate a simple version of Twitter or
try to recreate a simple blog or
recreate a dating application a lot of
the projects or that could be
self-directed all you have to do when
you're doing this it's more of a
portfolio learning thing so just take
something that exists it may
your own version of it like if you were
gonna make Twitter on yours by yourself
with your current skill set just make
Twitter so that's kind of a
self-directed project the third thing I
have is more of this is learning kind of
forcing yourself to learn the
foundations of computer science and
computers a cool way of preparing for it
as if you're doing an interview so one
really good interview and thing to
search for is how to prepare for
interview at Google and this is so
popular because Google probably gets the
most software applicants in the whole
world but there's so many notes and
resources specifically around how to
prepare for an interview at Google like
what are the questions they asked what
are the topics they go over like what do
you have to know it talks about just it
goes into those computer science
theories and like you might not think
this is like this is probably not
equivalent to you know getting the whole
foundation from a school but if you
force yourself to prepare for a
programming or Tech interview you will
get a good level of foundation so just
even if you're not interviewing like
pretend you have an interview with
Google and do whatever you need to
prepare for it and that's another cool
way of learning fourth I would say
scrape the internet and what I mean by
scraped Internet is kind of what you're
doing right now just use whatever
resource you have as possible like I
hope that like my videos for example are
a good resource for many people trying
to find holes in their knowledge or
trying to just get into this but that's
just my videos and my take on things so
ever there's so many people out there
with their opinions on how to learn but
just this is a personal thing scrape the
internet and find out where you have
holes in your knowledge and just dig
yourself you know the Internet is the
Internet
and it's there for you all the time
unless the world explodes finally
numbers five six seven are little I
guess more serious and it takes some
life consideration to like you have to
take more things into consideration when
you think about these but five is
potentially try to get a position near
software developers like one of my
previous jobs we had a bunch of analysts
I guess who weren't really software
developers but they're actually like
students not from an engineering
background go who are still really
interested in software and a lot of
companies still need like analysts or
data entry level people but those are
some open opportunities to work near
software developers or working inside
tech so if you're just trying to be like
an entry-level software developer but
maybe that's that you have the chicken
and egg problem if you can't get in
before you have the experience there's
actually a lot of positions out there
where you can get close to or near
software developers and that could be a
good opportunity for you number six I
would say talked about this so many
times but just if you have the money to
go into a boot camp or the accelerator
program that gives you the real hands-on
knowledge of programming in the real
world that's what they try to do i the
story of I know somebody who knows
somebody did a four-month boot camp and
works as a software developer in uber so
that's an extreme case I don't know if
you can work at uber after spending four
months of coding but just letting you
know it's it's possible finally last but
not least this is personally the route I
went and I'm lucky enough to have gone
on this route and I think it worked well
but if you can this is gonna take time
and money but just getting into a four
year program or even like maybe a
shorter program a two-year program but
getting into a program it's always a
solid consistent way of learning how to
program because not only does it force
you to do it like if you're fronting a
lot of money or taking out a lot of
loans to do a program that's where
you're gonna be doing it right this
stuff one through four is like self
motivation you have to be very
disciplined to do this yourself versus
if you're going to school for
engineering you're going to school and
you have no choice alright so obviously
this takes a lot of you have to consider
your situation
for number seven but this might be the
most consistent way to learn how to code
but not the only way so with that said
the long story short is that so many
people ask about how to learn
programming and you just have to start
doing it but don't be afraid to do it
the wrong way because you'll just learn
what doesn't work for you like maybe you
try to do mock interviews to prepare for
an interview but if that just doesn't
work just stop doing it and pick another
way to learn how to program alright so I
just feel like a lot of people have
emailed me and they're just like frozen
because they don't they want to do it
the best way but they're so caught up in
that that they aren't progressing at all
so those are my thoughts on that anyways
guys that's the video kind of freestyled
this video hope it turned out ok
know again is practice for me to try to
like execute or portray my thoughts as
clearly as possible without the
scripting or cutting I usually actually
cut my videos and do a lot of retakes
because I mess up the words so actually
I need to practice speaking more clearly
and not f up too many times so hopefully
this quick video was helpful and just my
opinion over some of the most common
questions I've been asked and hope you
enjoy it alright so I'll catch everyone
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
