players let's first talk about the
companies that want to make smartphones
Apple Samsung LG Huawei Steve Jobs just
decides that one day he wants an iPhone
these are my steve job glasses first
thing to note is that Apple alone
doesn't have all the expertise to make
this happen the genesis of the idea
starts with Apple but they get a lot of
help from a lot of different people to
make it happen the first thing that
Apple needs is to get a lot of core
hardware components together from
different vendors Apple is really good
at Apple things but do you think they
have crazy knowledge in LTE cellular or
networks no probably not there are other
companies that specialize in LTE and
cellular networks I used to work at one
Qualcomm alright so one thing that
Qualcomm designs is high-performance
modem chips what our modem chips those
things are pretty much what gives you
your LTE in your iPhone and lets you
call and sms your friends
the modem gives you those signal bars a
modem is just one important piece in the
whole phone when you're playing all your
games snapchatting your friends or just
using iOS you're actually using a
different application processor in terms
of core hardware there are a lot of
different components each with their own
responsibilities Apple make some of them
and different companies like Qualcomm
make the others oh crap we need LTE and
our phones and we don't have any idea
how that works
Qualcomm is making some LTE enabled
modems so let's just buy some from them
when you hear the words a5 a6 a7 a8
those are Apple processors remember that
each processor is part of a larger hole
that we're going to talk about
there's graphics processors different
modems application processors resource
management a lot of different things
when you hear about in the news
obviously you only hear about the Apple
stuff two players so far companies I
want to make phones Apple specialized
companies which produce hardware to
build the phone most of these companies
that design the chips Qualcomm for
example only do the design they don't
actually physically produce any of the
chips they need Asia and the 1 billion
Chinese to do that sorry bad joke but
you know kind of true call comes sends a
blueprint or designs of the chip to Asia
and what they get back are thousands and
thousands thousands of small chips that
they can sell Qualcomm is gonna sell
those LTE enabled modems the companies
like Apple or Samsung remember Qualcomm
is in the business of selling these
chips apples in the business of selling
phones cheap manufacturers don't care
what an iPhone looks like ok so Apple
aggregates a lot of core hardware
components together some they design
some other companies design and they
really have the guts to the smartphone
once Apple has the guts to their system
they're gonna start thinking about the
form factor this is where a lot of
design comes into play also remember
when we talk form factor it's a little
level above core hardware components but
it's still provided by many other
vendors this super awesome screen that
you can touch probably comes from a
different company the cool sensor for
your thumb probably another company
camera lens you know you get the picture
you can imagine how hard it is to get
all these different parts coming from
different sources all to work together
alright let's talk about the third major
player which are the network providers
like Verizon
those jerks these are companies to have
huge networks that span across the world
all network providers want a variety of
cool smart phones so they can give to
their users for them to use on their
networks
once Apple's done with their iPhones
they make deals with different network
providers AT&amp;amp;T Verizon so their users
can start buying iPhones and using that
network distribution the network
providers like Verizon are the companies
that you and me talk with to get that
iPhone we have to assign our life away
on that piece of paper we pay them a
large amount of money but I guess we
really have to otherwise the phone would
be pretty useless we couldn't call
anyone there's a huge infrastructure
behind all these cellular knowers so we
have three companies so far companies
that want to build phones other
companies that provide important parts
and network providers which distribute
the phones I want an iPhone I want an
iPhone wrapping it up there for the
major players and in the next videos
we're gonna dive deeper into how the
hardware works and slowly move our way
also into software and what that's all
about hope here - and blone quite yet
but it will be so stay tuned and we'll
talk soon all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
