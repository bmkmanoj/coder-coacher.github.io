doing really really well you all had
great weeks ate a lot of pizza drank a
lot of coke this week's video all I want
to do is sharing so last week I read
this article and I think it linked to
this other article that linked to this
page and that's something I just want to
share with everyone today because I
think what this person has put together
here is amazing it's going to be super
helpful it's already helped me a lot and
I just wanted to spread the word all
right so someone here Cameron
Ahmed I'm going to link to this page in
the description but what he's put
together here is a quote unquote web
developer roadmap for 2017 it's pretty
up-to-date it goes into a lot of detail
and you can definitely tell he spent a
lot of time putting this together which
is actually just a blessing for us
because this took a lot of effort to do
and not many people will take time to do
this and share it with everyone so
that's why I wanted to let everyone know
about this book so the other reason why
I thought this was just really important
is because this is exactly what everyone
asks for right
we asked for this is essentially the
path to get to some abstract place right
the path to become a web developer it's
so abstract we asked about it a lot but
this is it in a real content so first
that's the only thing I want to get
across in this video if you can stop
watching this video now go to this link
look at this document I and I will have
done my job so I just want to give
another shout out to Cameron this
document that you've made here is
amazing I'm totally piggybacking off it
I guess you can stop watching the video
but for the rest of the video I'm just
going to go through a really high level
of what this document is pretty
outlining for you and how you can
potentially use it and why it's so
useful alright so in a nutshell this is
just the intro of it but Cameron he just
he crapped and put together a flow like
a flow path of exactly what you need to
learn how you can like you know align
yourself with becoming a web developer
with a lot of recent technologies which
is cool so web developer in 2017 sounds
super sexy and it is and you know he
divides it into three major tracks
front-end back-end and DevOps so it's
kind of two and a half tracks where
DevOps is an offshoot at back-end but if
I were you I would take time and look
through every single path you know
looking through these like trees has
like shown me a lot of things I don't
know stuff I have to look into there's
just a ton of stuff to know and it'll
show you like oh are you on the right
way like are you learning things that
are relevant to what you want to learn
but don't think of these as three
mutually exclusive paths or I just
learned everything in all these paths he
also color codes it which is awesome so
yellow is like recommended and these
other colors are exploratory check these
out so front and back in DevOps and
there's a couple all these good
terminologies in here that's almost a
good quiz for yourself to be like oh do
you know what that is do you know what
that is
you know what basic terminal usage is do
you know what characters and codings
character encodings mean so that's
another reason why these are so useful
because as you look through these
documents some words are going to be you
know familiar to you in other words are
not going to be familiar to you and
that's places that go into and learn
further so you know this is all linked
to all this stuff but this is way too
much stuff to go over in any video but
it's me trying to share share about this
so that was the intro and then there's
three roadmaps that he's drawn one is a
front-end roadmap one is a back-end
roadmap and the final one is a DevOps
roadmap I would suggest everyone look
through every single roadmap and it will
just it's actually really intuitive and
if you just follow these arrows you'll
understand if you know something at a
very high level or you know something
really deep so just one quick example
front end you go down three basic things
you have to understand to read any code
that gets interpreted by a browser
JavaScript CSS HTML and then he breaks
down all
all those three categories keeper
alright so this is exactly the path that
a lot of people have been asking for and
it's almost coincidence because everyone
was asking for this I was thinking of
how to even articulate so much info but
he's done it and he's done it so
intuitively so like that's the overview
check out the diagram for front-end
check out the diagram for background
back an overview he first splits it up
into languages or I would say
environments because there's a lot of
vacuum things in different environments
right there's a very Ruby esque
environment Python environment people
like to work with nodes javascript in
the back or PHP and then there's all a
lot of new things going on with like you
know pure JavaScript or go or the
Microsoft style c-sharp besides like the
language and environmental setup he goes
through a bunch of different just
methodologies and just different
patterns that you know usually you
interpret you like incorporate a lot of
these things when you're doing back-end
development so DevOps always useful no
matter what software category you're in
if you just understand DevOps or how
computers operate how computers run how
you know they could deployed this is
always good for every single software
developer to know about devolves at a
basic understanding and I'm still trying
to push up my knowledge of this I'm
pretty weak here but a lot of this stuff
is super important particularly for web
applications so that's it for this video
today I'm not going to even try to
attempt to talk to every single point
and walk through this diagram I think
this is a luxury already as is so he's
essentially laid out the path for you so
this video again completely a sharing
video I just wanted to share this
document give a hammer on here shout out
I'll try to tweet Adam see if you
respond to me but you know this is me
just doing my best to try to share some
good work because it's always awesome
when other people like put in time
organize their thoughts and give it to
the
of us alright and that's I really like
it when people do that so I had to share
this clip that's a guy's short video
just want to share this document working
on another video right now also I have a
cool announcement to make
I'll do that in another video but for
now I'll just sign off and I'll talk
with everyone later all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
