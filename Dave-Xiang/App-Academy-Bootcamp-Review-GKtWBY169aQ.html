doing really really well enjoy the
weekend it's very sunny but it's cold
brisk it's nice to be outside video for
today I want to talk about App Academy
it's a coding bootcamp and I'm going to
endorse it so before we get into this
video I just want to say I'm not being
paid to do this video it's not sponsored
but based on my personal experience this
bootcamp versus other ones I think it's
actually the best one I'm gonna
personally endorse it so a few topics
we're gonna hang out and talk about in
this video it's why you should go to a
boot camp should you go there are two
different things why versus should and
finally just talk about some details
about their curriculum their program and
why I think personally it's a good one
for some people so without further ado
let's get straight into the video oh
yeah one thing I forgot to mention is
that App Academy is actually gonna
raffle off to two access passes to some
of their online bootcamp prep material
usually they sell this for over $1000 so
it's pretty expensive but I took a look
through it and it's actually pretty
thorough for the beginners it guides you
through a lot of really important
concepts and it's quite long and it's
really expensive but you have a chance
to just get this for free and it takes
like three to five seconds to just put
your email in the little box and hit
enter and why not
alright so we're ready to get into the
meat of the video again I broke it up
into three three different parts I was
doing there three because it's short
easy to remember the first one is gonna
be why anybody should go to boot camp
second one is should anybody go to boot
camp and finally I'm going to talk about
my personal opinions about why I think
app Academy is a good option if you
choose to go to one of these coding boot
camps so again everything I talk about
in this video is my personal opinion I
feel a little weary when I talk about
this kind of stuff because it affects
people's lives careers and it's a
delicate subject sometimes I'm not a
career counselor professional so just
take my opinions just take them digest
them and make your own decisions all
right all right let's get the easiest
one out of the way first the why why
would anybody go to
a Cody bootcamp but let's just be
perfectly honest let's not sugarcoat it
is just the fastest most convenient way
to get a high-paying developer job
that's it right that's why everybody
goes to these things the fastest way to
potentially make six figures or some
nice number and there's some other
reasons that are worth mentioning I've
heard of people going to boot camp some
business people who just want to
prototype their idea or also maybe some
product managers who just want to step
into the shoes of a developer and those
are side reasons maybe that's like 2/3
percent of the applicants but the vast
vast majority of the why it's just to
get a high paying job as fast as
possible so that's the easiest one to
get out of the way first
one final thing I want to tell everybody
about this why is that you're probably
going to be advertised all the success
stories like one of my friends went from
or one of my friend's friend went from
nothing to boot camp to uber developer
and that's probably the perfect scenario
that's everyone's dream right just do
something for six months and get into
the hottest tech company in the world or
whatever but you all you're always gonna
hear about the success stories and
there's gonna be equal if not more
amount of failure stories so remember
don't compare yourself to those one-off
success stories it's not good to compare
yourself to other people's situation you
can't compare yourself to Bill Gates but
you can just look at him for motivation
so look at those success stories there's
a little bit of you know inspiration
motivation potential but don't compare
yourself to that if it doesn't happen to
you all right so that's always the
caveat with these inspirational whys
next thing we should talk about is these
should so this is my opinion now should
you should you go to one of these boot
camps and this is very different than
the why cuz the yzz just make money fast
as possible but should should it's a
little more nuanced in detail than we
can break it down a little bit so for
anyone that hasn't seen some of my
previous videos or knows my history but
I'm very classically trained I went to
Carnegie Mellon did for four and a half
years got my bachelor's master's there
and then went off to do
the career thing but that's the very
classical approach that's what everyone
is used to that's what everyone did to
get into engineering and development
before all these boot camps came around
and I still I still endorse the
classical approach because I'm biased I
came from that but I still endorsed that
approach if it's the right situation so
what is the situation but I think the
situation is very personal and I want to
speak for anyone but I think it highly
highly depends on the level of
responsibilities you have in your life
so for the classical approach if you can
afford to just spend four or five years
of your life being a full-time student
this is usually people who are young
have few responsibilities and if you
want to do software in the long long
term I would suggest a classical
approach again I'm biased but you have
to very really consider your life I
can't I'll just make up another
situation for you so if you have some
dependents maybe you have a child and
you have crazy medical bills that you
can't really pay off well with their
current job and you're considering
moving into software to get a little bit
more salary so you have a lot of
responsibilities you have some financial
pressure you can't just put your life on
a four-year hold to be you know a
computer science student somewhere then
I think a boot camp is a viable option
because it allows you to have a cheaper
a cheaper alternative to get access to
potentially a higher paying job quicker
and for those of you that have a lot of
responsibilities you can't just stop
your life for four years it could be a
viable option so again this should this
should you go to a boot camp it's a very
personal decision in any video that you
watch that tells you should you go or
should you not go it has to be personal
for you so I think classical again I'll
just reiterate but classical is really
for young people who have a green slate
they don't have a lot of debt no
financial pressures they don't have kids
or something they don't have a crazy
medical situation but if you have a very
low responsibility low responsibility
level I would suggest classical approach
and if you're lucky enough just take
advantage of that if
if your life has a ton of stuff going on
and you know I can't stay what's going
on in your life but if that's the case
you might consider a faster potential
approach to becoming a developer if
that's what you want to do
all right last part of the video but
finally we're gonna talk about some of
the details behind App Academy and why
I'm endorsing and why I think it's a
better option and a lot of other boot
camps so first first and foremost that
I've had personal experience with a
handful of boot camps through recruiting
hiring all these things and I can still
say that App Academy has produced the
best candidates that I have seen at
least in New York City so my previous
job I was lucky enough to interview a
lot of app economy candidates and we
also hired somebody she had a math
background and she came in and killed it
she did a really good job strong
developer and came came really from
almost no coding experience to being
highly highly productive in a
professional setting so just for my
personal experience I interviewed a lot
of people from general assembly from
flat iron and other boot camps in this
area and the people that came out of App
Academy the best all right so from a
hiring perspective I still stand by that
the last thing I want to mention is that
app Academy is very expensive all these
boot camps are very expensive but the
reason why I think app Academy is a
little better is because their most
popular payment plan is this deferred
deferred payment plan I'll send a link
in the description but pretty much what
it means is that you owe them nothing if
you don't get a job but once you do get
a job you owe them $28,000 u.s. dollars
so it's a lot of money but you got to
give somebody $28,000 that's like over a
semester that's a lot of money but they
are incentivized to get you that job
because if you don't get that job they
also don't get paid so I think that's
their most popular plan they have
another one which is upfront cash you
could pay them seventeen less than 28
you could pay them $17,000 cash up front
and then you owe them nothing
later so they got a lot of good pricing
options it's not cheap I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it it's not gonna be cheap but
I think the real the reason why it's
nice is that it incentivizes them
heavily to get you a job one another
thing I want to note is that I have I
have an acquaintance not really my
friend but he just started this boot
camp I forgot that name of the boot camp
somewhere in San Francisco the one thing
that he complains about is that he
doesn't think the people that started
that boot camp really have a strong
Network to potential employers and
companies after they're done because the
whole point is that if you join a boot
camp you also as you also have access to
a potential network of different
employers to work at later right and he
said for them they really can't attract
any employers which really sucks one
thing that I think epic aadmi does
really well is that they actually
provide you provide you a foot in the
door automatically with a lot of really
really good employers they have demo
days they have you know showcases when
you're done with your projects a lot of
employers come and you can like sit with
them and check out what they've worked
on I think at the end at the end of
their cohorts that's what they call
their graduating classes but at the end
of the graduations they have a really
big demo day I went to go check it out
there was other hiring people there from
big companies like Google and Facebook
but they went in checked out all the
students projects people handed out
resumes and it was a really really nice
way to find candidates so I think that
network is really really strong for
abracada me because I have friends in
San Francisco and they complain about it
he literally said out there is that the
people that started this boot camp can't
give me a job so it's a deal-breaker
right all right let's wrap up the video
it's getting really long my voice is
getting tired you're probably tired of
hearing me talk but again wrap up the
video why the Y is really easy it's the
fastest way to potentially make more
money easy
right should-should is very personal
just take inventory of your
responsibilities and make your own
personal decision about should but you
already heard my thoughts and finally if
you're gonna choose a bootcamp
if you've made all those why all those
should decision and you finally get to
the point where like alright I'm just
going to try this bootcamp thing I would
HIGHLY highly recommend app Academy
because I think what they provide is
really nice so if you liked the video
