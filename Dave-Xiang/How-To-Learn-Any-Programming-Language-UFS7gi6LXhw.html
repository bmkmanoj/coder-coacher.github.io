video is going to be a screencast so
hopefully you can get into a little more
details because it can be a little
longer than the regular videos last time
we did a screencast those about how to
become a programmer so I thought this
week would be pretty cool if we talked
about how to learn a programming
language and this we can get a little
more detailed with how to learn a
language because we can actually go
through a few step-by-step things of
exactly what you really need to know to
get you know pretty familiar with any
language so let's just title this how to
learn programming language and I'll try
to make sure to copy and share these
notes last time I lost them so I
couldn't post them anywhere but this
time I'll save them and just put it in
the description so I think the steps
that I compiled here should be pretty
helpful or hopefully helpful to any
language or any popular language
obviously every language is different it
has their own like little caveats and
differences in complexities but the
steps we'll go through here are some
pretty general steps of what we can do
to just familiarize ourselves with
almost any language so let's just get
started okay first thing is pretty basic
is learn the language basics and what do
we mean by language basics this is going
to be like variable types operators
basic input and output how to prompt
someone to do something and how to print
it out back how to print something this
is pretty common every language is going
to want to print something on standard
out we're going to this is also basic
program structure how are the file
structure basic things to the language
like extensions
these are all really basic things you'll
probably learn this like the first week
you dive into any language so this is
just number one I'm just going to list
ABCDE it's pretty simple here but learn
the language basics just so you can get
around alright
let's go to step two okay step two is
going to be learning about basic data
structures or
containers to use and these are going to
be pretty similar across every single
language let's just list them out
dictionary set list array and that's
about it I think you know we can get a
little crazy here but I would say almost
eighty ninety percent of the things you
need to do on a daily basis for most use
cases these four things are going to get
it done so if you don't know what these
are
let's just do a basic rundown dictionary
is enabling you to do pretty fast look
ups using unique keys just fast lookup
storing of any data structure so set is
a convenient data structure to ensure
uniqueness for like a group of objects
if you want to make sure there's no
duplicates list if you have a dynamic
list of things that changes in size so
if you guys seeing things like lists you
can add it to the front add something to
the back add something in the middle so
it's like a very dynamic changing type
of container a race I hope everyone
knows about arrays these are kind of
when you know the size of something
they're very fast to index
they are usually continuous in memory so
they have that's the basic about array
so anyways these all have their special
purposes but any language will have
various implementations to get these
things done and it's almost all you need
pretty much like for a day-to-day stuff
these four will get get you by alright
so let's just move on to number three
and sorry let's review number two learn
the basic containers how the language
provides them and how to use them so
that's about it third point I'm going to
make is learning about basic file
input/output I'm just going to
abbreviate IO so this is really the
basics of interacting with any files and
files are everywhere it's pretty much
how we persist data and they're very
pervasive you know if we didn't have
files everything would have to exist in
memory right which is pretty much
impossible because that's very limited
so
this is going to be how to read a file
in how to write a file out and there's
going to be a crazy mileage for this
basic concept you know and what I mean
by mileage I mean like you can get
really really simple with file output
sorry with file i/o and you can get
really really complicated with file i/o
so this goes from simple reading of a
text file to databases so if you just
think about a file either file i/o you
could just read in a really simple text
file of numbers to do your homework or
you could really be interacting with a
really advanced database like post grass
or MongoDB right like what exactly is a
database so a database it's nothing it's
nothing more than just a really really
complicated file that you're reading and
writing to and having connections open
with so when you think about it if
they're definitely really really
complicated beasts but if you look under
the hood of a database all it is is
really just a file and you're just
interacting with it in a really you know
performance optimized and complicated
way so I mean I don't want to take
anything away from these things but in
the end all this stuff is rooted in
basic file file i/o so this is the other
basic and third thing that you must
understand when you're using any
language so that's step three let's go
on to step four okay step four for
learning any language is you have to
learn some basic networking using the
language and this is another super
common thing almost 100 percent of the
time you're going to have to do some
basic networking no matter what language
you're using so let's just write down a
couple key points of basic networking
making basic HTTP requests is almost a
prerequisite learn how to get posed
delete etc requests overall you'll have
is really good to understand how this
works understand what this protocol
means but there will be libraries to
help you get this thing done and just
learn the basics of how to do this how
to set your quests properly how to
handle responses so networking is so
pervasive right now you know if you're
not using the internet you are if you're
watching this video you're using the
internet so it's just a silly question
and you have to know how this stuff
works and this is probably the most
basic way of learning basic networking
with any language and I would say almost
any modern language has this stuff
almost built-in so you're going to come
across a sooner rather than later if you
want to take this a step further you can
also learn some basic socket programming
with your language and if you learn some
basic soccer programming this is taking
HTTP HTTP one step further because as
you know this protocol is built on
sockets and if you learn basic soccer
programming how to connect listen bind
on a socket that will just be even
better it will give you a deeper
understanding of how this works so basic
networking I would say at the very least
you learn how to do this part part a if
you want to take it to the next level
you can learn part B - but overall I
also want to say that there are
libraries out there to help you do this
so don't try to reinvent the wheel here
all these things basic networking it's
done
tested and highly used by so many people
there are many libraries out there to
let you do that
alright so that's that's just step for
learning some basic networking and you
have to do this for any language that
you're picking up alright let's go to
step five all right we're on step five I
don't even know how many this is pretty
impromptu so I'm just going with the
flow but I think step five for this is
how to build your project and language
so every language is going to be very
different you'll be using a compiled
implementation of a language or perhaps
it's interpreted but overall whatever
you're using you need to kind of learn
the project structure and how to just
organize everything so let me just give
an example of what I really mean by this
so let's say you're using C++ as your
language okay so you'll have to learn
how to build static libraries share
libraries how to link your applications
properly all this stuff goes into the
realm of C++ if you're a C++ developer
you'll know this means but what this
means generally is that whatever you're
using you have to learn how to build it
and actually make sure your code is used
so C++ will be building various
libraries static or shared you'll be
building various executables from
application executables to testing
executables and it all has to be done
properly so let's just take another
example if you're Python developer
you'll have to figure out like how to
separate out your module as well so if
you're a Python developer you know some
modules are distinct in that they're
more execution style versus import style
so if you define a few important classes
and these modules how exactly do you
import them and reuse them in other
files if your module is more of an
execution thing and it just has to be
run when you want it to be run how do
you structure that kind of module and
how does this all play into this this
all fit into sorry guys so like
developing a Python project obviously is
super different from developing a C++
project long story short is that
whatever language you're using you need
to know you know house all organized
house all working just so your code can
execute right so there's going to be
different things per language and you
have to be responsible you'll pick up
obviously just how to do this and it's
another basic prerequisite all right so
let's just move on
okay skating pretty long but we're all
on to step 6
alright let's say step 6 for learning a
language is we have to learn
oo or functional programming paradigm
tools so what do I mean by this so as
you know object-oriented / functional
programming are probably the two most
popular programming paradigms there's
probably more but we don't have time to
go into it but to get any of these
things done you have to learn the tools
or the constructs of what makes this
possible so 400 you need to learn how to
use classes how to use inheritance how
to use polymorphism like these words
should sound familiar to you if you've
learned about object-oriented
programming but obviously if you don't
know how to use a class in your language
you're not be able to do anything
object-oriented so it's just basics
there right so similarly if you're using
functional stuff you'll have to learn
how your language uses blocks or lambdas
how function pointers or callbacks work
so if the language you're using is
highly functional there's going to be a
lot of constructs like passing and
functions or various blocks to various
things and each language will have
subtleties of how this works so if
you're doing very functional things this
is going to be a prerequisite for you so
either way whatever whatever programming
paradigm you choose to use obviously you
have to learn the tools to get it done
so that's step 6
all right guys I'm kind of running out
of time actually I just realized that
these videos are capped at 15 minutes
which I'll fix for next time but this is
going to be my last point and point
number seven for learning a programming
language is learning the extra goodies
in any language and what I mean by extra
goodies is obviously every language
Python people think they're the best
Ruby language developers think they're
the best but every language has its own
bag of tricks or goodies that you can
use to make it better so
at this point if you learn one through
six very well you can come back to here
and learn the subtleties and nice things
nice stuff of a new language so this is
all going to be very different and some
of you may like the goodies in one
language but not the others let me just
give you an example before we stop here
like Ruby itself if you guys are a ruby
developer you know that they have a lot
of cool methods on enumerable types
which makes some very common programming
techniques extremely extremely
convenient I've been using Ruby a lot
recently and they have so many cool
methods on the numerals enumerable types
that it just makes some stuff really
simple so that's just an example of one
of the goodies and every language comes
with their own set of them so that's my
final step and if you've done one
through six very well you can move on to
seven alright guys if you're still
watching at this point I have 30 seconds
left in this video so I'm just going to
conclude it here what I'm going to do is
I'll take the notes and I'll just put
them in the description so you can
review them now but I don't have time to
do a full summary of the video let me
just recap what this video is about if
you were to learn any language or pick
up any new language these would be seven
basic things that you have to understand
so I hope this would be a good guide to
anyone learning a new language and I
hope it's general enough to help anyone
so that's about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
