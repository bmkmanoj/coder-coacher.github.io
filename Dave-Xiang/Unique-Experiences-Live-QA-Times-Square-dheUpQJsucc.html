stimulus for everyone on a deadtime this
is a dead final time square but random
weekday filled event has to come kazoo
police crowded but there's too much
stimulus for me and it should be enough
stimulus for you so that's the first
part of my video out of three and we're
going to go to parts two or three right
now all right so I lied actually a
little too crazy I want to get closer to
the center of it but there's still way
too many people so just walking in a
different direction now
for the first thing I just wanted to say
was doing something a little different
next week what I'm trying to do is I'm
doing a live webinar this upcoming
Saturday with a Facebook collaboration
group which I've never done something
like this before but with this Facebook
group called I love programming I'm
going to have a link down in my
description but pretty much what he
offered it I'm doing it via his group
which has a lot more followers than I do
but we're going to do a webinar hour
hour-and-a-half try to answer some
questions and it's going to be live so
first time I'm doing that it's this
upcoming Saturday I want to have a link
to it and hope people can tune in but
it's terrible for us time it's really
bad for us times but I think for
European times will be pretty good so
that's coming up that's new and that
should be fun all right all right now
for the announcement I do have some
questions that I want the answer
something that it was a pretty good
question if someone message me about not
talk more about it but for now I just
need to get a little bit further away
from Times Square and find a quiet spot
because I thought to be dead but that's
not that I underestimated tourism so
good to find another strong
so one random side point you see there's
a ton of garbage on the tree like this
and I guess the way New York City was
built originally with that they didn't
build it alleyways where you normally
store dumpsters and trash they just
throw trash on the sidewalk like this
and it's really dirty but I guess there
was reason for it it's like extra
efficient or something so when people
walk into your city and they haven't
been you before they're surprised at how
good it is because literally we just
throw trash exactly where people walk so
there's this trash everywhere sorry it's
really dark all right guys finally found
a nice place to sit and just sitting on
Rockefeller Center
finally can think and fit I think that
was enough stimulus sometimes too much
stimulus but I want to talk about some
real stuff so there's actually some
value in this video I got a really good
question the other day just be a private
share but it was revolving around what
experienced pursuit immediately after
college related to software so there's
this kind of a false dichotomy there's
much there's many more than two options
but one of the two major options you
could take is joining a large corporate
software company or maybe a smaller
startup things which is pretty like you
know in fashion it's pretty hype right
now but the question was would it be the
right choice to work at a large
corporate company straight out of school
get some good experience there and then
move on to a startup experience and I
guess the question was phrased that
right as right or wrong but actually
it's better because that brought up a
more important topic of having a dynamic
set of experiences which is what I want
to talk about in this video
one thing that's helped me a lot just is
having a unique set a unique is kind of
the important word but unique and
dynamic set of experiences because every
single experience even though you might
think it's bad or it's not a good fit
it's always somewhat of a learning
experience right so I think you guys
know my story I worked in like big
corporate software or whatever a big
company tens of thousands of people for
four years and then I tried the startup
thing but I want to share something
that's actually just from the others
perspective so I have one friend that
did the opposite he went from a lot of
startups tons of startups a lot of sales
startups and then he moved into
something a little more established the
exact flip-flop of what I did and then
he also for him that was a crazy change
but it was a really good change so
there's no right or wrong because at the
time it's like we went in different
paths after school I went to this big
corporate life and I thought that would
be good and then he went to this like
startup crap I'm going to do my own
thing
type of life so we completely diverged
after school only to kind of switch
places after you know four or five years
but for him the experience was I want to
describe his experience more because
it's more unique I think everyone's
familiar with my experience but for him
right after school he went straight into
a startup straight into chaos doing like
a ton of stuff pumping out tons of code
like I probably wrote like 500 lines of
code in like three years
I barely wrote any code I just tested
heavily he right after school he went
straight at the startup world worked at
like with tons of different people like
pumped out probably thousands thousands
of lines of code every month and it was
crazy all right so what eventually
happened with him was kind of the
opposite of me right I was corporate for
like four years and then I wanted to see
what his garbage was like my friend who
was working startup life for like four
or five years to getting four
from that and he actually wanted to go
to something a little more stable little
something more professional where I was
just a low left chaos he was kind of
tired of that experience right so when
he went from chaos start up to corporate
experience actually changed this
software development skills along all of
a sudden he couldn't just pump out code
all the time he told me that when he
first joined she joined Spotify so it's
a big company and its first code review
his first poll quest he said he got
destroyed he said the other engineers
like ripped his code apart and he kind
of just felt like a new after a while
because he was so used to like pumping
out code just not not much reviewer I
just getting a lot of code into the
system and all of a sudden he's in this
established structure where they go
through crazy code review crazy process
you have to follow strict standards
strict testing so for him there was a
complete 180 change of experience but
actually he liked it a lot just because
it was so different talking too much but
the moral of the story is like your life
is going to be pretty long your career
will be long like I'm just getting
started I still don't know really what I
want and a lot of people I know that are
washing are really young and have zero
idea of what they want to do but the one
thing that's really helpful is just keep
your mind open for a diverse set of
experiences because even if you don't
think it's the perfect one even if it's
not you're not going to find the perfect
experience all right you just you're not
going to find it but everyone you take
on will be a learning experience and
just try to make your experiences
distinct so if you don't start ups for
like four or five years try something
else go to like a big company or vice
versa if you did a big company for four
or five years go to a startup and see
how that is I think the worst thing you
can do is just stay in the same
experience for too long because that
turns into all you know about so it's
not really a matter of what exactly you
pick it's just figuring out how to make
it different
after a while and I think the diversity
is really what makes you grow a lot so I
want to worry too much about trying to
pick the perfect one like if you pick a
startup or you pick a big corporate job
after school that is the right decision
because that's one experience and that's
just one of many unique ones you'll have
and then once you accumulate more and
more diverse experiences you just
understand more you get more
self-awareness of what clicks for you so
I think that's a good way to think about
it and you know life is long you're
going to have a ton of different types
of experiences and we're just getting
started right I'm still figuring out
what I want my friend still figuring out
what he wants a lot of stuff we do we
don't really know if it's long term or
not long term but as long as it's
different different is what ends up
pushing us right so I think that's a
good strategy to have just like change
it up over time and you know things are
getting too easy for you you know time
to make a change alright so that's all
have to say for today it's a pretty big
view I got to edit this video a lot
because there's a lot of
footage taking but might feel a little
more scenic stuff and then we'll wrap it
up alright guys so just going to show
you Rockefeller Center where they have a
huge Christmas tree and ice skating rink
obviously not right now because it's not
winter but I'll still show you around
all right
so this is a main center and in winter
this is where they set up City rink but
it's just a phase
I guess now in the spring or summer time
but this transit for that game is the
ice skating rink and then there's the
tree which usually is like right here
imagine a nice Christmas tree right here
it's not here yet
in a place
alright guys that gets owned forever
there's a lot of stimulus here just
there's cool stuff to film more of that
later but I'm just going to wrap with
the video check the link description
again this Saturday have a live webinar
which I'm trying to do for the first
time with I love programming I'll give a
link but for everyone that's in the u.s.
it's had a really really terrible United
States time but anyway if I'll do more
of these later but for the first one
we'll see how it goes
all right guys I'm just going to sign up
whoops can't film can't film other
people back to just going to sign up now
guys then I'll see everyone soon all
right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
