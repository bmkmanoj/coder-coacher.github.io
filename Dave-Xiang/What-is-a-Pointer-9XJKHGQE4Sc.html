everyone had a fantastic week this video
concept video this week and we're gonna
talk about some basic intuition behind
pointers if you're using or learning C
or C++ you have to punch % have to
understand how pointers work but it's
not so much a deal-breaker if you're
using some other languages where they do
a lot of stuff for you but I would
recommend that if you really want to
understand some of the subtleties and
some of the nuances behind how things
work you do have to understand pointers
and memory alright with that said I know
a lot of people that are watching have a
wide range of backgrounds in this stuff
so I'm not going to go over nitty gritty
details not gonna go over any coding
syntax in this video about pointers it's
gonna be an intuition video and
hopefully by the end of it we'll have a
better understanding of what they are
and why would need them
alright so basic overview intuition
hope you guys like it and let's get
started really quickly just a really
really fast recap on RAM random access
memory we know that all our digital
devices rely on this your phone has some
memory right your computer has some
memory when you're not using a lot of it
things are going really smoothly when
you've used a lot of your RAM that's
when hits the fan and stuff just
doesn't work anyways a lot of the things
we use is very memory centric and if you
need a refresher just watch my ram video
from like 3 a long time ago I look a lot
younger this video but check out the RAM
video for a refresher if you just want a
refresher on what memory is or what Ram
is and let's just move on from there to
start off I just think that we need to
conceptualize what memory really is like
when you see memory you just see like 4
gigabytes free but what does that really
mean all right so we kind of need this
like mental picture of what memory kind
of looks like and once we have this
mental picture we're gonna start working
on top of that
if you imagine that we just landed on
earth and we discovered this huge space
of land it's just a huge open space of
land and this is gonna represent our
memory all right and what are we gonna
do with this space the first thing we're
gonna do is divide it up evenly so
everything is fair and we're gonna
divide it by these one foot by one foot
chunks so somebody takes a piece of
chalk and we're gonna divide the whole
piece of land this huge space by one
square foot chunks just to make
everything even so the size doesn't
matter as much right there's no real
reason I just picked one foot by one
foot completely arbitrarily what's most
important is that we divide up this land
equally all right so it's not important
that it's one square foot what's
actually more important is that whatever
we divide it up as its equal so we have
this huge piece of land it's stretching
beyond what the eyes can see and I'm
gonna take this piece of chalk and just
divide it up one square foot at a time
the next thing we have to do is that
once every single little space is
divided up in our big stretch of land
we're gonna label it from 0 to 1 million
we're just gonna label them I just
picked 1 million randomly but what we've
done so far is we started with a huge
piece of land we divided each space
equally and I took my chalk and I
labeled it from 0 to 1 million why
exactly do we have to assign numbers to
all these spaces like why do we have to
label it 0 to 1 million is that why do
we even need to do that well let's just
think about it for example like how
would you direct me to a space somewhere
would you say something like hey go over
to that space on the left and then go up
a little bit or would you just say go to
space 9 thousand the number 9,000 in
this example is actually called a memory
address this number 9,000 is the address
of one little square in our piece of
land all right the number 9,000 is not a
pointer yet all right we're gonna get
the pointers later but this number 9,000
is just a memory
a dress and a pointer is gonna store
memory addresses but more on that coming
up okay so we're gonna use this land for
whatever we want okay if I want to store
like my t-shirt somewhere I might use
one little space of the land if I want
to build a shack I'll use a thousand
spaces if I want to build a house I'll
use 10,000 spaces if my friend comes
along and he wants to build his own
house we'll let him build it somewhere
else and give him 10,000 spaces but we
have a million right so there's a lot of
them whatever we end up putting in this
space whether it's a t-shirt
it's a shack it's a house it's a mansion
it all has to go somewhere right it all
has to have a special address so I'm
gonna put my house at space 9,000
because I like the number 9,000 and I'm
gonna take up space there and 9,000 if
my friend comes along and he wants to
build his own house I'm gonna tell him
you'd do that at space 500,000 all right
so my house is over here his house is
over there they both take up a lot of
space but they occupy different
addresses what's gonna happen now is
that I need to remember where my
friend's house is all right if that
address 500,000 or whatever but I need a
way to remember this because I'm gonna
forget what I'm gonna do in this
scenario is that I'm gonna take a small
piece of paper and write 500,000 on it
which is actually the value the address
of my friend's house right but I'm just
gonna write it on this small piece of
paper and I'm gonna put it somewhere
else on the land I'm just gonna put it
at another address let's say 1,000 that
piece of paper is essentially what a
pointer is the formal definition of a
pointer is a variable that stores the
memory address of another variable
so this variable the pointer is my piece
of paper and it's storing the address of
another variable which is my friend's
house at 500,000 so one of the trickiest
parts that I think people have a tough
time grasping is that a pointer itself
is a variable alright and you have to
kind of do couple that idea from memory
addressing all right a pointer is a
variable just like your house is a
variable a pointer is just really small
and that house is probably really big
all right so these are the kind of
things that you have to keep really
straight in your head all right every
single variable in all of computing has
two things every single variable has a
value and an address all right you have
to keep those two things really clear
every variable has a value and an
address like we discussed before a
pointer itself is a variable right its
value is actually 500,000 which is the
address of something else but the
pointer itself is still a variable right
in the hatas own address we put it at
1000 I could also take 1000 and write
that on a separate piece of paper and
put it somewhere else in which case I
would actually have a pointer to a
pointer so every single pointer is a
variable and every variable has an
address that's why you can do crazy
things like a pointer to a pointer to a
pointer to a pointer and the chain can
be actually infinite if you really want
it to be alright guys so after writing
the script and doing this video I
realized that even trying to
conceptualize the pointers and all this
stuff with this whole land it's a little
difficult to do so what I also decided
to do is that I'm just gonna leave you
guys with three questions that are kind
of hopefully if you think about these
questions you'll kind of get a better
understanding of why we need pointers
all right first question what if you
just come to me and you're like Dave I
want to build a house how am I gonna
respond to that I could either say okay
Joe just go in the back and back over to
the right a little bit and you can use
like a medium size space of land
that's kind of a answer right
the real answer I would respond with is
probably like okay Joe you can go to
address five thousand and you got ten
thousand spaces to use second question
what if I had one thousand spaces of
really really valuable information that
a lot of people wanted let's just say
let's just say I stored the answers to
the SATs at 1,000 spaces all right and
hundreds of people are asking me for
these answers all right I'm going to be
like for every single one of those
people I'm going to be the all right
question one answers a question to
answer is beep question three answer is
I don't know that would be pretty
outrageous right I wouldn't list off the
answers to the SAT questions for every
single person that asked me I would just
be like for anyone that asked me I'm
just gonna give them a little piece of
paper with the address to all those
answers and they can go look it up
themselves and I'm not going to tell
them the answers to 1000 questions for
1000 people
all right last question to think about
imagine you're just a painter and you're
gonna paint 500 houses or I'm gonna ask
you to paint 500 houses how would you
best like to receive that information
all right guys that's the end of the
video I would say the most important
thing to remember to try to keep this
idea straight is that a pointer itself
is still a variable all right a pointer
is still a variable and you have to
really know how to distinguish what's a
variable versus what's a memory address
every single variable has its own
address including pointers another thing
I would want to say is that even if
you're learning a language that doesn't
require you to understand pointers I
would still take some time read about it
and understand how pointers memory and
references really work so it'll help you
understand how whatever language you're
using behaves all right guys that's the
end of the video I hope you enjoyed it a
little simplistic over a very
complicated idea but at the very least
maybe it just made you understand these
concepts a little better please leave me
a comment if you have any more detailed
questions and like the video as always
thank you very much and I'll see
everyone next time
all right see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
