object-oriented programming and it's
kind of a separate concept so I just
wanted to dedicate a quick video to this
but this is the idea of encapsulation as
always this is like a fancy word that's
floated around everywhere and you
probably can't grasp its full meaning by
reading like a Wikipedia webpage so
we're just gonna go over some examples
behind what this technique really means
let's just take a hypothetical class
called the kitchen class instance an
object of our kitchen class and we tell
it I want a steak I just sat down at the
table I told my kitchen that I want a
steak I don't care how it's made I don't
really care how its prepared I just want
to order it and get it so I can eat it
we don't care how the order was written
down we don't care who prep the steak we
don't care who season the steak or who
like ordered all the prime Kutz ok so
this idea of hiding all the details I
want to stake I get a steak when we hide
the details like this this is the basic
concept of encapsulation it's a really
simple but very powerful and important
concept when you're creating your
classes if you're designing an
object-oriented system you want to
really hide away the details so people
using your class can't really mess with
the details like I don't want to mess
with the details of the kitchen this
idea of encapsulation also leads us to
this concept of a public interface and
this might be another word you've seen
floating around public interface a
public interface is pretty much how you
expose your class to the outside world
and for a kitchen that public interface
is the menu each item on the menu that
you can order from the kitchen could be
a public interface I could order a
salmon I could order sushi I could order
a steak you don't care about how those
things are made all you have to do is
look at this nice menu that the chef
probably took hours to create this nice
menu for you which is literally the
public interface of the kitchen you just
order stuff off that menu and you'll get
it so just like a kitchen
which exposes its public interface in
the menu when you're designing your
classes and you're encapsulating away
the details you also take a lot of time
to carefully you know come up with the
perfect public interface to use your
class so these two ideas of
encapsulation and designing well defined
public interfaces are another two
important concepts of object-oriented
programming
it sounds so like intuitive and simple
right but I'm sure you'll find that once
it comes down to it and once you start
trying to do some code it's much much
easier said than done
the major takeaway from this video is
that when you're programming with the
object-oriented paradigm make sure you
capsulate well that is hide the details
well I don't care about how the kitchen
works and also design your public
interface well design a really good menu
alright guys hope this video was helpful
just leave me a comment if you have any
questions these are very broad
techniques and obviously once you get
into the nitty gritty details of it
things are gonna get much more
complicated alright so have a great rest
of the week and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
