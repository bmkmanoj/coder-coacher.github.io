doing really well a little bit of a
different video this week but I'm not
going to talk or present about any
specific topic but i'm just going to
show you guys this little mini project i
was working on so saturday yesterday is
usually the day i work on the video I'll
write it film it edit it uploaded all in
a day but I just spend yesterday
actually working on this new kind of
mini project so a couple weeks ago
someone made a really good suggestion
about starting a community didn't really
know what this meant but I thought about
it more and i just made a lot of sense
and i wanted to kind of start with your
help of course but building a community
around software development and it would
be a really nice extension to this
channel and i don't think we really get
that community vibe just from huge
youtube comments right those are just
like an abyss of stuff so right now I'm
calling it softer development software
development because a lot of the videos
that resonate with people talk about the
softer side of software development I
know we always talked about the more
techie side as well and will always talk
about that stuff but the analytics
always say that all that software stuff
does better and you know connect with
people a little more so and I also take
this word because every single domain I
checked but every single domain with the
word software or SW in it is taken but
no one has softer so that's also why I
picked it so I found a really cool
application called discourse and I just
wanted to introduce it to you guys and
explain it a little bit so what is this
course first it's a completely free
which is open source it's an open source
free self hosted discussion style
application and it also looks pretty
cool and i'll show you guys what it
looks like pretty soon but first what a
self-hosted means what a self-hosted
mean it just means that i'm paying for
the domain name i pay for the server
hosting and the email servers you pay
for the hosting but you don't pay for
the code which is the
valuable part all the code is open
source so the people at this course have
their code open source and they have
nice scripts to help you set up their
application on your server so it's
really nice open source stuff is awesome
so so now following this I was kind of
asking around but why did I choose this
discourse thing over some other options
like slack subreddit facebook group and
I want to explain that a little more so
Facebook group everyone has facebook
that's always nice but it just didn't
seem like the right platform for this
subreddit subreddit was a potential the
one thing I didn't really like about the
subreddit was that the main experiences
the main experience is always going to
be a feed all right so searching for
older historical content and sometimes a
pain and the UI doesn't really follow
any categories or hierarchy the UI
revolves around the feed and then if you
want to get to like especially special
categories or tags you got to search for
it and most people might not be
comfortable posting to reddit or
subreddit and I don't really like a UI
the comments so didn't want to do a
subreddit a lot of people suggested
slack so I use slack a ton and my past
two jobs is definitely awesome slack is
the new thing slack if you guys haven't
heard of it it's kind of like IRC on
steroids like tons of different channels
tons of stuff happening a lot of people
talking it's very real time like very
real time so when I thought about this I
thought it could have been good but I
didn't think the community should be
really a real time kind of thing I don't
want to be like a chat kind of
experience I want it to be more of like
a asynchronous discussion style
experience right because people won't
always be a SAP available to answer your
questions so you can like throw a
question out there and they'll be
discussed over the span of like a week
or something so that leaves discourse
first I mentioned that it's free which
is nice didn't have to like code
anything so there's definitely an old
school kind of forum feel and it has a
newer look too
it the UI is dedicated to kind of follow
and categorize things which is nice it
still has a feed you'll see soon that
the UI still has a feed like you I but
there's definitely different sections
different categories and you can search
for historical things pretty easily
another thing that's nice for now is
that it's high loaded safe i'm posting
this on some server i bought so i can
administer it like fully for the time
being and it's not real time so actually
i think it's nice that it's not real
time because you can take your time ask
a thoughtful question you'll get a
thoughtful answer from someone else or
me and then the content lives on forever
for everyone else to read and benefit
from all right so with that said going
to need a little bit of help to see this
thing through and I I know we're kind of
piloting it but I'll see how this does
in the next couple months and if there's
traction I'll keep it going but if
people don't like using your don't use
it we'll see what happens but until the
end of the month like jan 31st i'm going
to be really really diligent about
answering questions that people post on
software development so please ask a lot
and i'll answer them thoroughly quickly
as often as i can and it'll just try to
build the content because there's no
content right now which kind of sucks
right so after that I will of course
Phil answer questions after the 31st but
maybe not as fast I just want to
dedicate like this chunk of time where
I'm building a lot of content on that
forum so many people have all also email
me questions direct so I think those
questions thanks for emailing me but
those questions they can be answered by
me many other people and there can be
discussions around a lot of those
questions because i find myself i'll get
an email i'll answer it but it's just
like a one on one type of thing and that
could have been a useful like piece of
information for somebody else that just
didn't happen to ask it or is planning
to ask it in the future so i want like
interactions like that to like be saved
her forever and not just between me but
between like everyone else like you guys
washing would be great so you can always
answer other people's questions so let's
just see how this goes so I made this
site I made this site a little bit
restricted all right so you have to log
in to see anything and I did that on
purpose because I just didn't want
people coming by to just check out and
post up I want like anyone who is
actually active in the community to
actually you know want to be active in
the community and like create an account
in everything so if you sign up I hooked
up Google Facebook Twitter hopefully
that's enough platforms to make new
accounts so you don't have to if you
don't want to make it an account with
any of these three I would recommend
doing all this stuff because it's oh off
but if you do this there's also an
account if you just want to make it
directly on this website so if you're
just log in with facebook so right now
you can see it's really sad it's oh it's
so empty a little bit of a welcome thing
here and this is the main page we'll
just see the latest feed like categories
new topics this is kind of like the
default feel of discourse I think it's
really clean it's really cool one thing
that I set up to start off or some
categories that we can use to just
initially like organize our thoughts one
is going to be like academics you know a
lot of questions about school anything
about school academics college if you're
in high school what classes you can take
another category is career so that's
anything career-related like internships
jobs interviews start of salaries
positions bosses you know where you're
going to work what kind of title you're
going to have all that stuff another
category is software developer life
which is just daily life stuff anything
that happens to you on the daily what do
you deal with on a daily basis of course
it wouldn't be a software discussion
without the raw coding so i made a
category about coding and projects so
you can talk about like coding design
patterns languages frameworks the newest
latest and greatest thing you're working
on or maybe just like talk about a side
project you're working on and get some
like feedback on a side project last but
not least have this one called learning
which is just kind of like knowledge you
know like not necessarily academic but
just anything about sharing knowledge
and learning new things so that could be
books online courses today I learned
different people lessons and just like
anything you want to learn and share
about that it can go right here all
right so these categories can grow I
just thought there could be initial set
to seed this kind of form and please
like use them and post into them
accordingly I've never administered or
moderated a discussion thing before so I
really have no idea how this goes one
thing that I ask is that minimize the
trolling like I don't want this should
be helpful for everyone I don't want
people to like be this would be a scary
environment or whatever you should i
come on here be comfortable asking a
question and get thoughtful responses
you're not this is not reddit for
trolling and like messing with people
and I guess if that happens I'll just
like band people alright so we'll see
how this goes kind of pilot it for like
let's just say I mean it's not that
expensive i can just keep it up but all
kind of focus all my attention here for
the time being to answer stuff so if you
were planning to email me posted here
and i'll answer it much better much
faster and if you want to like have a
discussion on the comments don't do it
on the comments come here and talk about
it alright so with that said let's see
how this goes thanks to your time
definitely not a normal video but after
next week it's back to the normal
broadcast and we'll see how this thing
is doing alright guys take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
