really well had a great week learned a
ton of new stuff read encyclopedia this
week we're going to talk a little bit
more about companies all right so
companies just like people they are all
different they have crazy personalities
there's a lot of differences going on up
here
but they're all very nuanced all right
so we're taking four big companies that
you all know about I think it's Google
Amazon Apple and Facebook and we're
going to compare them in a very
particular perspective alright so the
topic of this video is going to be a
company breakdown from a programmers
perspective what exactly is a company
just the review but a company is nothing
more than a group of people that provide
one or two things all right every single
company provides a product or service or
both of them so if you go into adidas
store you can buy a hoodie this is a
product right or you can every month you
pay your internet bill and that internet
is a service you pay for or you could
buy a Kindle and once you buy your
Kindle you can go to the Amazon book
store that's a product and service so
every single company provides either a
product or service or both of them so
the company is we're going to dissect
today our Google Amazon Apple Facebook
these are all huge tech companies that
you all know about but these same exact
patterns can be used to probably analyze
the personalities of other companies all
right furthermore there's a lot of
different perspectives to be in when
considering these companies right for
this video we're going to all be from
the developer or the programmers
perspective but you can also be in like
a consumer perspective right what if
you're just an average Joe using
Facebook or Google or it could even be
from the small business or other
business perspective you could be
another business using Amazon to ship
your products right so there's a lot of
different perspectives and relationships
between outside parties and those
companies for this video is going to be
developer 2
company's all right let's get straight
into it and start analyzing these
companies are the first company on our
list is going to be Google's and first
thing to note is that whatever you're
feeling or seeing from the outside it's
always amplified a lot on the inside if
you're a developer out there and you've
ever used Google API as before I'm sure
we have the same sentiment but Google
has a shit ton of API hundreds hundreds
and hundreds of API is like a huge
hodgepodge of different things you can
use overall if you've ever used a Google
API so it's not it doesn't feel very
cohesive there's just an API for all
sorts of things I like to call it
cherry-picking you just kind of
cherry-pick exactly what you need and
they have a lot of different stuff so
the examples are they have a login API
to log in via Google they have a map API
to get coordinates they have an
analytics API to get clicks on your
website all sorts of stuff for whatever
you need when you use all these
different API and SDKs from Google
they're all very very useful in their
own right but they're not very cohesive
all right and that actually says
something about the company what I think
my opinion
remember guys my opinion what I think
this says that the company is that they
don't really value the interworking of
all their services very well all right
and we'll see how this compares with
other companies but you can tell that
the mentality of Google is a very kind
of like pet project mentality like tons
of different teams working on tons of
different stuff and they all have their
own api's right the Maps team gives the
Maps API Swallow developers but multiply
that by 100
all right so even internally I don't
think there's a lot of cohesion with all
the different services at Google and it
definitely reflects all the way up to
the developer level and we the
developers when we see all those scatter
scatter brain api's it's definitely a
clear sign of kind of how the inker
workings of the company actually
are alright the next company up on the
list is going to be Amazon and if you're
developer you've probably used Amazon
Web Services before but when you look at
it it's not like the sexiest thing it
doesn't look very cool but it's a beast
alright so Amazon Web Services is kind
of the de facto standard though it goes
in standard of how you host applications
on the Internet all right they do it the
best and no one can argue that huge
services huge companies even are all
built on top of Amazon Web Services
Heroku itself is built on top of Amazon
and they just have everything you could
possibly need to host a website so what
does this actually say how does this
reflect your company when I use Amazon
Web Services and see how crazy of a
platform it is I really think it
reflects how Amazon values raw operation
so for you out there the developer who
is like looking to host a website on the
internet or do anything how some
pictures maybe like set up some
databases but Amazon is going to give
you everything you need for web services
alright and it's all very cohesive
they understood everything that a
developer would possibly need to host a
website and they give it to you all in
one package so again let's just compare
that back with how Google tests up their
API is all right so Google API is tons
of them but they're all very scattered
and used to get you cherry pick them all
right versus Amazon's
developers perspective but what Amazon
does is they give you a huge suite of
services that you use for one specific
purpose which is hosting web
applications all right and both of these
things reflect how the companies are
actually thinking it reflects how Google
is a very pet project tons of stuff
going on in parallel and it also
reflects how Amazon is not a pet project
mentality there like an operational
business mentality they know what you
need to get your job done and they're
going to give you all that stuff third
one third company on our list is going
to be Apple you guys all know about this
company
people either love them
love them to death they wait in typhoons
and blizzards and wait in line to get
the iPhone 8 or they just hate them
alright but it's better to be loved and
hated rather than somewhere in-between
what Apple did for developers was in my
opinion something that no company has
ever done for a developer community
before all right and a lot of people
hate on this but Apple really leveled up
what it meant to provide like an
ecosystem or platform for developers I
wouldn't say I love it I wouldn't say I
hate it but I do respect the shit out of
it alright that's my opinion okay guys
don't know or haven't developed an apple
before or anything
output related is they have a very tight
ecosystem of how you can develop alright
first you need a Mac if you want to
develop anything onto an Apple device
you need to have a Mac yourself after
you get a Mac you have to use their text
editor which is Xcode alright only can
you use Xcode to edit anything after use
Xcode you can only deploy your
applications of course to the specified
Apple devices iPads and iPhones so
you've probably guessed it but what I'm
trying to get across here is that
there's really very little flexibility
when you're developing in the Apple
ecosystem and that's on purpose what
does this reflect about Apple again so
like this is us coming from the
developers perspective but what does
this reflect about apples values well
obviously one thing they value is really
tight control they want tight control of
everything before it gets to their
customers right they have tight control
over the hardware they have tight
control over the software and they
really have tight control about their
developer ecosystem all right they
control every single step some might
think it's a little crazy but it
actually proves to be quite a different
and nice experience sometimes so this
tight ecosystem just reflects the
control that Apple wants on its products
pretty much what they want they want the
utmost control of everything before it
touches their customer all right you can
definitely see that in their products
you know Apple is definitely maybe
before more so than now but they've had
the products with the mode
consistent experience out of probably
any tech product and that's exactly why
it's there controlling mindset alright
so let's talk about Facebook now which
is our last company and their developer
tools have definitely changed a lot over
time I remember when I first set up like
Facebook logged in when it was first
available it was so simple it was just
like the blue login with Facebook button
and you could just login via Facebook it
was all I use there is more stuff but
back then knows more or less a pretty
simple API so Facebook goal is actually
very lofty ambitious goal I respect it
as well but their core goal their core
value is that they want to connect
everyone in the world alright and that's
pretty crazy if you think about oh right
we have the Internet but just having the
Internet is a network of computers right
it's not really a network of people so
Facebook is trying to create that scale
of a network via the internet but they
want to create an insane global six
billion person network and they're
almost getting there which is crazy so
with that said that's Facebook core
value right so their API isn't really a
core tech product in itself right it's
just a gateway into that network if you
use the Facebook API is going to get you
access into that insane human Network
also think about Facebook games
alright so Facebook doesn't have an
insane gamer presence like if you're an
insane week of Legends play you're not
going to be on Facebook so there are
kind of games are simple games right
farmville if you guys are played
farmville it was like a crazy game where
you just take care of cows but it was so
so popular and what made that game so
popular was a social aspect right that
game itself was a social type of thing
where you like interact with other
farmers but you play that game on
Facebook you lever Facebook's insane
global network alright so as you can see
API games all this stuff outside
Facebook it's just complimenting their
core mission which is the people
connecting but a lot of things can
benefit from
people connecting right so imagine
you're a developer you watching this
video imagine you're just developing
your next cool application or idea you
had
but maybe it's social in nature right
you're developing a social application
you would be pretty stupid to not
leverage the Facebook platform at this
point for your game this is Facebook's
way of just being nice to you right Joe
you want to develop a social game here's
access to our social graph with our API
and that's just like a nice gesture from
Facebook but it's still an afterthought
of their API all right their core value
is still the network all right guys
that's going to be it for today what we
did here was we just took four companies
these four big companies Google Amazon
Apple Facebook and we just kind of
dissected them or analyzed them from the
programmers perspective one thing that I
just want to reiterate is that we only
took one perspective on this the coders
or whatever the developers perspective
but there are many other perspectives
when working or having a relationship
with these big companies right you can
be just a consumer or average Joe like
you and me we're just the average Joe
consumers of YouTube via this video you
could be like a small business using
Amazon so maybe in a different video we
can brainstorm what it's like from a
different perspective looking at these
same companies alright so actually I
could challenge you guys to do that
right all of you guys
I bet 99.9% of people watching are the
average Joe consumers including me we
are the average Joe consumers of Google
Amazon Apple and Facebook so what does
our experience as an average Joe really
say about their company's values and if
you think hard about it I bet you could
come up with a good list I even have a
better idea for this I'm going to take
that topic that I just you know propose
to everyone I'm going to put it up on
the discussion board the discourse forms
off I'll put a link somewhere on this
video but if you haven't seen the those
forms yet there are really nice forms a
lot of good
and I think anyone that's watching
before you ask whatever question you're
about to ask in the comments that go
there first and see if the question has
already been asked right do your
homework so I'm going to actually start
a thread based on this video and we can
all talk in there about what we think
about this so I'll do that hope you guys
enjoyed the video please give me a like
thumbs up share whatever really
appreciate your time as always and
subscribe if you haven't and I'll see
everyone next week all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
