everyone had a nice holiday and you all
brought in the New Year well we're all
looking forward to 2013 let's do it so
in this video on a talk a little bit
about RAM memory I know everyone's aware
of what's RAM but I feel like not
everyone has a deep understanding of how
it works or how it really affects all
the digital devices that people use oh I
have like one gig of ram in my old
computer but my macbook pro us like a
gigs of ram so why is it better to have
more ram well with more RAM your
computers and smartphones can do more
things and run more programs at the same
time right yes you are right most people
can't really explain Ram to beyond that
point so that's where I'm going to try
to help out a little bit lesson number
one is pretty simple we're just going to
divide memory into two categories the
first category is memory that can hold
on to its data when there's no
electricity running through it and it's
not plugged into anything so this
includes your thumb drives hard drives
different type of flash drives you can
carry it around unplug it from a
computer and it still holds all your
data the second type of memory is memory
that loses all its data when there's no
power attached to it but memory commonly
known to everyone as RAM is that type of
memory and when there's no electricity
there's nothing in it so when you first
power up your smart phone the RAM this
container is completely empty on the
other hand your smartphone is hard drive
or flash memory has all this stuff and
it's still there even with no
electricity
this harddrive is going to have your
Android or your iOS it has Angry Birds
and all that good stuff waiting to be
run plus your smartphone power zone
let's talk briefly about a computer
processor or sometimes known as the
brain of the computer it's doing all the
processing and it's running all the
software and programs that are running
on your smartphone or your laptop in
order for the computer processor to run
any type of program the program has to
exist
in this memory when your phone boots up
and this memory is empty how does the
processor run anything okay so I lied a
little bit the computer processor can
run a little bit of simple software that
doesn't have to be in here right when
your smartphone boots up it looks in its
big memory for the operating system it's
able to take out the operating system
Android and it's going to blow that into
the memory so the processor can running
the photo started up and we load the
operating system into the memory and now
the processor you can run it remember
the processor can only run software
that's existing in this memory now that
this is done we start loading all our
smart phone apps like Angry Birds and
Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff
but we have to first go to our flash
memory and get a lot stuff and put it in
here so I'm going to load Facebook into
memory I can load Angry Birds into
memory I can load the orange application
into memory now we have all these
different programs also known as a
process which exists in the RAM and can
be run by the computer's processing so
remember this Ram is finite you know one
gigs two gigs
four gigs or eight gigs so what happens
when you want to run this garage opener
application but there's no more room
left in the memory to put it your smart
phone doesn't just blow up and deny you
the ability to run this is garage opener
it has to move programs in the rim
backing the disk to make room for this
guy if we want to make room for this
we're going to take out the orange
application and move it back to the
other memory and now we have room for
this to run but what if we want to go
back and use the orange application we
have to move something else out of the
way and put the orange one back in so
this is why having a larger Ram is
better you can fit more software that
can be run by the processor and you
don't have to go back to your slow hard
drive or flash memory to get any of your
programs the process I was showing you
where you move programs in and out
memory and slow hard drive stuff that
process is known as paging and it's
really slow there's too many apps
running too much paging going on so when
you run control delete or Android pass
killer what you're really doing is just
taking programs that aren't being run by
the processor from here and just taking
them out of your memory your freedom all
right so that's the end of the video I
could talk for days about this stuff
actually but I just want to share a
little bit about RAM and what it means I
hope if you watch this you learn
something ah you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
