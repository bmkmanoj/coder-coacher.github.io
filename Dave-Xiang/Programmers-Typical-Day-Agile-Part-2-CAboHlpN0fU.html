two of this day-to-day or daily life of
a software developer in the agile
setting agile setting if you just came
from part one we're gonna start talking
about these next two points ticketing
and a typical day if you're coming here
and you haven't seen part one please
just go back and watch it and this video
will make a lot more sense alright
so that's your intro we already kind of
talked about ticketing and I mentioned
we use this system called JIRA but I
just want to talk about it a little more
in depth here and just go over what it
really means and how crappy and how
important it is at the same time so
pretty much as a developer you're kind
of living inside this ticketing system
for most of your day because it's
tracking everything you're doing it
should be tracking everything you're
doing and if it's not then it's not a
very good ticketing system or it's not
being used well but pretty much you're
living inside this thing every day and
it's keeping up with all your progress
so it's pretty important and if it's
used well it can it's definitely a
requirement so but as we said every
Sprint's as a developer you'll have a
set of tickets representing what you're
working on so you'll have a queue of
tickets like all this big list of work
that you have to do and every sprint
maybe your team lead or you you'll pick
different types of tickets to work on
and that's pretty much your day-to-day
job like there's a huge backlog of
tickets people have filed them they're
like this doesn't work fix it and
that turns into a ticket and pretty much
what your job to do is to take all those
tickets figure out what you can do what
other people will do divide it up
between a bunch of sprints and just get
it done so yeah a lot of people are
living inside the system and my last
point about ticketing is that most
managers or people who aren't really on
the ground floor or coding they only
look at the ticketing system to kind of
what's happening with the project so you
can imagine like the leads with the
managers or PMS that have to keep track
of how the project is doing they're not
looking at the code like they don't know
yeah this guy add to 2,000 lines today
or that guy added 50 lines today
sucks sorry but everything like the
managers will look at the ticketing
system and how the tickets are
progressing to see how the team is doing
because remember the tickets track
literally everything like open closed
tickets rejected tickets in progress
completed verified all this all these
crazy states and statuses you can
anything under the Sun that you can
think of this system is going to track
it so I just want to it sounds really
crappy and most developers just hate the
system but this undeniably really
important when the team gets really big
so that's why I just wanted to give it a
little bit talking point here so I think
that's enough about ticketing it's not
that sexy now alright so this is I guess
what it can finally calm in a to which
is maybe having a typical day discussion
now that we kind of went through three
major points in the agile for agile
development we can kind of go through
what a typical day was like for any
developers so like what I kind of have
here is my typical day more or less kind
of generalized wake up go to work always
drink coffee usually if it's Monday
Wednesday or Friday we would do our
stand-up meeting which would be those
remembered those short two to
three-minute everyone talks about two to
three minutes and syncs up in the
morning and just make sure everyone is
on the same page and nobody has any
blocking issues so and then when the day
starts there's pretty much three big
categories of what I could potentially
do I made another video called types of
work
and I would sit that's also like a
really relevant to this point so if you
haven't seen that go check that out in
my channel it's kind of like different
types of work you might do as it relates
to coding so check it out later if you
haven't so so let's just talk about de
and F as they're really kind of broad
categories so the first category is
coding time so this is the first because
this by default what everybody assumes
they're gonna do as a software developer
you know wake up drink coffee start
coding it's probably the most basic and
most common thing you'll do and what
code time means this is not really a
phrase I just made it up this is pretty
much when your heads down coding just to
get features done you got a ton of
tickets you have like a hundred tickets
to do because your boss is super
aggressive or something and you're just
you have the blinders on and it's raw
development time and you're just coding
so it's actually pretty easy sometimes
this is actually a luxury if you can
have some coding time because you can
just sit by yourself get some stuff done
and you know coding can be fun contrary
to popular belief okay so besides coding
time there's also sometimes design time
and sometimes we can get caught up in
doing a lot of design work and what is
design well this is stuff that's not
really coding it's anything but coding
so this involves software design going
to meetings talking with people this is
planning out different things to do
before you start coding doing code
reviews designing your milestones so
this is pretty much just organizing and
planning the attack because remember you
can't just jump into code time right
away if you're not synched up with your
peers if you haven't designed the system
well if you go straight to code time too
quickly you're just gonna f up the
system so there's also a good amount of
time spending on this
work and pretty much when I say design
time ins anything that's not coding but
still helping out the system so all this
stuff is really important last big
category that I put here is firefighting
which is another common thing that
developers do this is just when
hits the fan this is how you handle it I
wouldn't really consider it feature
development but this is when something
big is happening and we have to scramble
to get it done
so like fixing urgent issues or
preparing for big releases I put under
this category as like firefighting
because it's like there's a fire and you
have to put it out like something really
important has just happened and
everybody is on like red alert to fix it
so this is also you know more common
than you think like Co time is really
calm time this is also pretty calm but
you know every now and then you know F F
happens the fires and that could be part
of your day as well so yeah those are
three general categories and there's
probably so many more than this but you
know these are like three big ones that
you might just do on your typical day G
you know there's always going to be
meetings meetings meetings and more
meetings hopefully if did the team is
like you know organized well there's not
going to be too many of these meetings
than they're actually useful it's pretty
easy to get caught up in some like
useless meetings you hear the same thing
like over and over again but you know it
happens and it's just part of your day
so I'm putting it here because it's
definitely a part of the typical day
obviously you got to take some breaks
like drink more coffee or something but
yep I don't even know if this is
relevant but please take breaks and
after you take breaks you just rinse and
repeat from A to G and that's about it
and then once you rinse and repeat long
enough you just go home for the day
so that I didn't realize how this would
sound after I said it but it sounds a
little silly but I have been asked many
times what the typical day is like and I
guess this is my best shot
at explaining what it was like during
this time period when I was working on
this ad inside this agile environment so
yeah that's about it guys so I guess
final takeaways from this video is that
I worked on a few teams so far like I'm
still like as you guys know I'm very
early in the software career but these
two years was just a part of my career
where I was under this agile thing but
it hasn't been the only software
methodology that I've been you know a
part of before 2012 I was working in
embedded software which was like slow
slow slow development and it wasn't
agile at all
and that type of development was
actually much much different than
everything I laid out here but I think
agile is actually probably the most
common way software is developed these
days now you know in 2016 and beyond so
I thought this these points would
probably be the most relevant yeah ok so
just finally to also wrap the video if
anybody is offended or disagrees with
any thing here I just want to reiterate
that this is just one example out of
many of one of the ways that a team
could run their software development
like even within the world of agile you
could do this like a thousand different
ways so none of this that we talked
about a set in stone at all so it's all
really really subjective but hopefully
just you know hopefully I'm hoping that
after you guys watch me talk through all
this stuff it just gives you a rough
baseline of what a typical day might be
like for a software developer that's
involved in this and you know I hope
it's helpful so it's just little insight
of what I went through for two years you
know
I went through pretty much did all this
crap not crap sorry but all this stuff
for a good two years or is about 20
months but yeah that's a good time so oh
all right so I hope you guys enjoyed
both these videos part 1 and part 2
please give me a like if you enjoyed it
obviously I don't have my equipment and
that's why I'm on my screencast again
but if you have any comments just leave
me a comment or drop me an email if you
want to just contact me directly and
I'll respond but again hope this video
was helpful hope everyone has a great
week
and take care alright see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
