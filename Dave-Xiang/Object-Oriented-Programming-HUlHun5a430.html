going to talk about one of the most
hardest things to explain
object-oriented programming I was
brainstorming how to best approach this
video and I'm not even going to try to
define this concept but we're going to
go over a couple really common
techniques that people use when doing
this style of programming these
Universal techniques are really really
important to grasping what
object-oriented programming really is
and that's going to be the subject of
this video all right another important
thing to note is that these techniques
we're going to talk about are universal
across all languages each language will
have their own little form of how they
get this done the technique though is
really what's important to understand
and once you get that all you have to do
is Google for the right thing depending
on whatever language you're using all
right
let's get started with this for this
video we're going to explain everything
through simple sentences very simple
sentences that look like this and every
single technique that we're going to
cover three techniques they're all going
to be associated with sentence something
on the left something on the right we're
going to fill in all these points so the
first sentence we're going to talk about
is the is a sentence it looks like this
and it's basically something is a
something else
you've probably heard these analogies
before let's just take a couple examples
a cook is a person or a bar stool is a
chair this concept and this sentence
refers to the overall technique of
inheritance inheritance is probably one
of the most basic one of the most
universal concepts of object-oriented
programming and that's why we're talking
about it first
inheritance is pretty much when a
subclass inherits everything from
in class that subclass is everything the
parent classes plus some more a cook is
everything a person is a person has two
eyes two arms two legs one head a cook
also has two eyes two arms two legs one
head if we're creating this big system
and we use a lot of persons to do it
hypothetically we could replace all
those persons with cooks and the whole
system would still work because by
definition a cook is a person it seems
so simple right but pretty much
everything lies with this one sentence
and we're going to keep referring back
to it all right so if you're designing
your system or you're coding up a
project and you're using inheritance for
whatever reason always kind of refer
back to the sentence and just make sure
it sounds right in your head we're going
to come back to inheritance more in this
video but let's just quickly move on to
the next and second technique okay so
the second technique revolves around
this sentence behaves like up something
behaves like something else I usually
call these things rolls many people call
them many different things and they're
implemented many different ways across
different languages but first let's just
understand really what it means
this technique defines exactly how
something behaves its behavior we're
just going to take an example roll right
now and we're going to call it the
dishwasher roll and what this pretty
much means is that you can behave like a
dishwasher if you can wash dishes that's
easy enough to understand if you can
perform one function the wash dishes
function then you behave like a
dishwasher let's just relate this back
to our sentence real quick so a chef
behaves like a dishwasher because he can
wash dishes a pastry chef can also wash
dishes so a pastry chef also behaves
like a dishwasher actually we could take
like a
and if we train the cat how to wash
dishes and the cat could actually wash
dishes the cat could also behave like a
dishwasher so this is kind of where
we're going to tie it back to
inheritance a little bit so just check
this out a chef behaves like a
dishwasher and a chef is also a person
right well we took our cat and we
trained our cat to wash dishes so the
cat behaves like a dishwasher but a cat
is not a person you kind of see that
difference there let's just drive that
point home before we move on you can
take on many different behaviors
regardless of your class okay so one
last example for this let's just go back
to the chef a chef is a person so the
chef inherits from the person class a
chef can also wash the dishes right so
the chef behaves like a dishwasher so
the ship we can say the chef kind of
fulfills the dishwasher role now let's
take a baby a little baby technically a
baby is a person so the baby class
inherits from the person class right a
baby has two arms two legs one head
hopefully so the baby is a person now
let's just look at the baby the baby has
like groovy short arms so the baby can't
really wash dishes so he doesn't fulfill
the dishwasher role the concept of roles
is really like orthogonal or exclusive
to someone's class you could be a part
of one class but fulfilled many many
different types of roles or behaviors
okay so I've probably repeated myself a
lot but I just want to really bring this
point home is that there's a major
difference between deep behaves like a
relationship versus B is a relationship
the concept of the role revolves around
this behavior or the behaves like a
sentence while the concept of
inheritance really revolves around B is
a sentence so I think that's probably
the most important concept I'll talk
about in this video okay last but not
least we have our third and last
technique
and the sentence for this is has
something has a something else a kitchen
has a pastry chef a kitchen has a sous
chef a kitchen has a sink a kitchen has
a fridge this sentence with the Hazza
this is the basic technique of
composition a kitchen is composed of
many different things this is a really
common thing that happens in programming
but you just pretty much take different
objects or different classes that are
really different and you combine them in
such a way that they together form
something really cool so if you had to
implement this crazy kitchen class in
programming you would actually compose
it of many different subclasses you
would have a chef class a sink class
maybe a refrigerator class and the whole
kitchen class would be composed of all
these different components so this is
the basic idea of composition all right
guys let's just put up the three
sentences back up here for review and
just go over them real quick the three
programming techniques that we talked
about in this video we're inheritance
rolls and composition and these are the
sentences that correspond to them
inheritance is the is a relationship a
baby is a person second roles revolve
around behavior and remember our
sentence was behaves like a so like a
pastry chef behaves like a dishwasher
and last but not least we have the
technique of composition which revolves
around the has a sentence a kitchen has
a sink so these three techniques
inheritance roles and composition these
are not all but some of the most
important techniques in object-oriented
programming remember these techniques
spanned across languages and each
language you are using C C++ Java Ruby
Python they're all going to use these
techniques in different ways and have
different functionality to implement
all right so last takeaway from this
video is just to get a really really
good grasp on these techniques before
you dive into object-oriented
programming because these techniques
really are universal across everything
alright guys hope you enjoyed the video
and added something a little bit to your
tech toolkit object-oriented programming
is just one paradigm of programming it's
not the only one there's definitely many
others but within oo these three
concepts that we talked about in this
video are definitely super important to
understand alright see you guys next
