had a really really great week gonna do
a screencast video this week and it's
gonna be based on building a mobile app
and this one's gonna be a little
different I used to just type in my
screencast but in this one I actually
wrote everything out so don't read any
of this first but I just wrote it out
first and we're gonna just talk through
it so I don't have to type because
typing and explaining is actually kind
of difficult so anyways let's just get
going so I hear this statement a lot so
it's kind of like I want to build a
mobile app but I feel like many people
underestimate what it takes to build one
of these things and I think building a
mobile app is really good for anyone
who's learning how to program or
anything like that but the whole point
of this video is to kind of die or at
least introduce the tip of the iceberg
of what it takes to build one of these
things and it might be a little more
than you expect so I want to build a
mobile app a lot of people say this but
how okay but how so no typing this video
just follow my voice I have everything
written out here and we're just gonna go
through it one step at a time
alright first I have this section called
pre building and before you even start
building a mobile app just make sure you
ask ourselves what exactly are you doing
this for so one it just could be purely
an exercise to learn programming that's
totally cool you could be building a
mobile app as a fun side project you
know this is just another thing you
wanted to pick up finally you could be
building one for someone or for some
money aka it's a job so just based on
these you might have different
expectations or what you want to get out
of building this thing alright so just
keep a couple of these things in mind
first next I just want to talk through a
couple quick misconceptions that many
people might have or maybe beginners
might have but it takes more than just
knowing a singular framework to build a
mobile app I find some engineers think
that oh if I just learn iOS or Android I
can build like a snapchat level mobile
app and you probably can't do that so it
takes a lot of different types of
engineers working together to make a
high-quality app
you can still put something out there if
you only know like iOS for example but
it's gonna be a pretty simple and pretty
probably a crappy probably a pretty
crappy one so if you want to build like
a high fidelity mobile app that you know
is fancy that you you probably are the
ones that are using everyday you just
kind of take a lot of engineer's all
right so just make sure you have that
expectation you're not gonna be building
snapchat by yourself all right so first
thing I just want to break apart the
building blocks of a mobile app in
between the front end and the back end
first all right so we're just gonna
tackle front end first and then we're
gonna go on to back-end and for each
section there are a couple key points
that we're just gonna talk over so front
tent first alright guys so front end
pretty self-explanatory purpose the
purpose is just going to be you're
implementing the design and the vision
of the product so this is just basic
table steak stuff but pretty much at the
core you're building the UI of this
product so so any front-end product or
front-end engineer you're always judged
your work is judged you are judged
you're just you're judged as a person
and your engineering chops but actually
it's pretty much you're judged on how
well the application looks and behaves
so all the details count right like it's
easier said than done to make something
smooth scroll smoothly so if you use an
app every day and it's super smooth to
use don't discount all the work it took
to making that happen
all right so table stakes stuff is just
the UI another thing front-end
engineering has to work on is the basic
navigation of the app so pushing and
popping out of different flows keeping
parallel user States in the app in tach
so if you just go to your phone right
now if you just open your phone go to
any app that you use any day and just
ask yourself how would you design it
implement the navigation in this app so
every app has a different navigation and
different navigations work better for
different use cases but if you just sat
there and thought
yourself how would I implement the
navigation how would you do it how would
you draw it out what like code would you
use what data structures would you use
etc so this is also non-trivial another
front-end point that we can't deny is
performance and any good front-end
application or any good mobile
application will be very performant so
just a couple quick points here is you
don't to kill people's battery life like
if you look on the phones you know which
apps kill a lot of batteries and you
don't want that to be your app so just a
couple examples network performance
don't download huge things
don't use huge bandwidth if you're not
on Wi-Fi don't request from the server
too often you can cache local copies
around so you download an image once you
cash a copy of it and you just keep it
around there's no point in downloading
the same image multiple times and
there's also besides network performance
there's also graphics performance to
consider right you might want to chill
on the animations and again if it's
getting a little out of hand so there's
a lot that goes under performance
network graphics etc but this is also
super important all right a couple more
front-end features just to hit on
quickly
offline don't underestimate this if
you're using an application and you
don't have internet and it's working a
lot of work went into this so offline
mode super important
another one is UX which is slightly
different than UI so UI is kind of like
how nice does this menu look does it
have like the right color of gray but UX
is kind of like how intuitive is it to
sign up so pretty much this might be the
job of a designer to think about but
also it takes a lot of work to implement
this well not only to implement the
button making this button look super
effing perfect or also making like the
onboarding flow work really well so
takes a lot of work just to do this and
don't underestimate this part all right
so that's about it I had for front-end
let's keep moving all right so let's
move on to the backend
are equally important part of any mobile
application major purpose of the backend
is pretty much to power that's the kind
of loose turn but you guys know what I
mean it kind of powers the mobile
front-end it organized this persist that
returns any relevant data that the
application or client might need all
right so this is some people call this
the server the backend whatever but
front-end vs. back-end I hope that that
separation is clear all right so let's
just talk her through talk through some
basic components of the backend and
these are just a couple top ones that
that I thought about all right so first
the backend serves as a major resource
and what is it what do I mean by
resource but pretty much all front-end
apps will request data over some kind of
protocol usually HTTP or the Internet to
the back end and the back end will
respond with some data if you guys ever
see this word floating around it's a
very common like crud create read update
destroy it just means that as the
backend provides different resources you
should have the ability to probably
create new things read things update
things and destroy things all right so a
universe or type of logic also as a
resource that back-end does any type of
business logic that might be required so
you know a lot of like heavy duty things
it might be the responsibility of the
back of to do that rather than having
all this business logic in the front end
so at its core it's a basically a
resource for any client all right
another thing it does is we kind of
talked about this but backends usually
organize the data well the they're
usually the ones that interface with
some kind of database and to find some
kind of database schema so a couple big
themes for data you could have user data
any data specific to a user password
login your favorites your favorite
cooking recipes whatever and beside user
data there kind of is global data this
is a little weird of a word to use but
pretty much what I made here is any data
that it's needed to power the
application itself so
one example of this could be twitter
twitter tracks trending data across
various topics this is not relevant to
any specific user but Twitter can track
various trends and then present certain
trends to users that might be interested
all right so any data that's not really
user specific that powers the
application the back end will also do
anything that's remotely smart so what I
mean by this if you have some kind of
smart recommendation engine or something
heavy-duty some heavy-duty technical
feature that will probably be
implemented on the back end you're not
gonna be implementing some crazy machine
learning algorithm on iOS that's going
to be done by a server somewhere so the
front end usually just taps into the
smarts with an interface but heavy-duty
technical features are almost always
going to be done by the back end all
right what do we have next
this is a lot crap notifications I'm
sure you guys are used to many
notifications that happen all the time
your friend like your photo
John poked you five times but pretty
much all logic for notifications is also
handled by the backend or the server
what triggers one what goes into one who
gets sent one what does it say all that
stuff all right so all those
notifications that pop up on your phone
there's business logic powering and
triggering those backends are usually
multi-service so the best way to
describe this is just think about Amazon
and a lot goes into powering Amazon so
you go to amazon.com we all go to
amazon.com and we interact with one
website and we click like this big buy
button like all we do is go onto Amazon
we click buy and we get like a bunch of
granola bars right but if you ask
yourself what actually happened
technically once you hit by there's so
many systems multiple systems that come
into play like maybe the Amazon
inventory system was updated maybe the
payment service got initiated maybe
Amazon's recommendation system got all
your transaction details and updates
it's modeling so the user all you
click bye but behind the scenes there's
a ton of stuff that might happen across
a variety of services all right so don't
discount stuff like this when someone
says back-end a lot of stuff is going on
next I wrote down scaling how would your
app potentially handle snapchat level
users if you have this problem it's
actually a really good problem because
people are actually using your app so if
you have scaling problems it actually is
a good sign because you know people are
actually using your thing if people are
not using it you'll never have to worry
about scaling this is a pretty
complicated topic but the one thing I
want to just point out is that this
takes collaboration of many engineers
back in collab with DevOps
collabs with front-end to change how
scaling works so this is an effort by
everyone all right not just back in
engineers finally this is the last one
guys promise I actually wrote a lot of
points here but there's also third-party
backends that you can use that you don't
exactly have to write alright so if you
want to add analytics or maybe logging
to your app if you want to answer
questions like how long does this user
stay on the home page you could plug
into maybe some google analytics or some
third party back in to help you do this
all right so when I say back in it
doesn't mean that you have to write
every single one but you could use other
backends that people provide as a
service to help you out and usually
people will plug into some third party
back in to help them with logging for
example so this is another example right
you don't have to write every single
back-end or server logic from scratch
all right so that's enough of that back
end let's just keep moving I want to
touch a little bit more about design and
a lot of engineers overlook designed
because you know whatever engineering is
the best but that's a little naive so
remember the purpose of design if you're
looking to build a mobile app you're
building a mobile app to be put into a
consumers hand right you're not you're
not building like a coding library
you're building an app which somebody
has to download and if someone's gonna
download it they better be designed well
or nobody
gonna use it despite how well it's
implemented all right so don't neglect
the design actually so final thing here
I just want to have this little section
called food for thought and it might be
just a good exercise for any engineers
out there to just think about how mobile
features are implemented so one example
I just wanted to put here it's like
Instagram image loading so many of you
have used Instagram I'm sure many of you
know about Instagram but like if we
broke down how they load images how
would we break it down and how would we
implement something like this because
the images load really well on Instagram
right on a good connection we rarely see
anything that's loading images are
loaded right when they scroll they
appear with that we're offline how does
that even happen your camera takes
pictures and high-res do you think
Instagram keeps the pics around in
high-res or does it do some kind of
post-processing on the pictures so one
thing that's a good exercise for any
engineer is that go open the popular
apps and try to break down how they
implement their features like break down
how Instagram does their image loading
and it would be a good exercise for any
engineer to try to design how that
happens all right guys crap okay I have
15 seconds left a lot of information in
this video I'll share the doc but
hopefully this was a good breakdown of
what it takes to build a mobile app it's
definitely a lot of work besides just
learning iOS alright guys hope it was
