doing really really well as normal
trying to hit another popular question
that I've been asked recently so this
video I'm gonna try to do my best and
make a practical basic video on computer
security first and foremost I'm by no
means really no means a master or even
intermediate level at any of these
complex security topics I'm just gonna
try to talk about it from a very
practical and really introductory level
and just hopefully make it as useful as
possible so I'm not gonna do any
detailed lecturing during school I took
one no I think I think I took two
graduate level courses in computer
security and just to be completely
honest they're really really dry and
that's just my opinion but one of the
courses was actually taught remotely so
when we went to lecture the professor
was talking to us from a camera like we
looked at him through a screen and now
many people went to lectures and most
people fell asleep I personally never
really met anyone who's really really
into computer security most people just
know about it can kind of talk through
it but no one I've met at least is
really into it but if you want to be
into that and you have that mindset of
hacking computers designing the perfect
secure systems then all the power to you
so in this video I'm gonna talk about
basic computer security from a very
practical perspective not gonna do any
kind of lecturing I just have four
points to talk about and let's do it
first and foremost we have to understand
what really basic computer security
words mean initially I thought this
video could maybe be like 10 common
security words you should know but I
looked it up on YouTube and there's
already a lot of videos like that
that already exist there are two really
good I didn't want to just replicate
that what do I mean by basic words but
you should understand basic words and
how they apply to computer security so
authorization versus authentication what
is the symmetric cryptographic protocol
what is a symmetric mean what is SSL
stand for what does it provide
these are just kind of basic cause
that you should look up on your own and
it's not gonna be covered in this video
at all so for point number one I'm just
gonna assume that everyone's gonna get a
decent foundation for these words on
their own time my suggestion for this is
what I actually did was just take some
time like thirty two minutes to an hour
watch one of those lectures on YouTube
about basic computer security
once something comes up they don't
understand just positive research it
understand what it kind of means and go
back to the video all right and do that
first and that's point number one point
number two is actually really really
simple I just want to say everyone
should be a good consumer of security
and technology and what do I mean by
that large companies
well actually any company baseman a lot
of time managing and configuring their
security system and US consumer if
you're using them you should take
advantage of whatever they provide for
example if Google login requires
two-factor authentication with a phone
and you have a phone you should use
two-factor authentication they're making
that feature available for your benefit
as a consumer if you have a tough time
remembering all your passwords all those
secret questions all your credit card
numbers just get a simple password
management software there are a lot of
them I use one password it's simple it
works it's not the greatest but it
manages all my info so I never have to
remember any password so point number
two is just be a good consumer of
technology and security so that's what
you can do to keep yourself safe all
right all right third third and maybe
most important point that I want to make
in this whole video is how computer
security applies to you if you're an
application developer or software
developer 99% of the time actually may
be 99.9 percent of the time you are not
going to become a computer security
expert I am no computer security expert
by any means and I don't think most
people are at all
so first understand that and you're not
going to be inventing the next security
countermeasure
there are already a lot of people that
think and develop stuff for computer
security and you're not going to do it
better than them so what's the next best
thing to do but as an application
developer you have to introduce and put
security measures into your application
as best as you can with that said I hope
I don't want to discourage anyone right
if you really want to get into security
as an engineer that interest you totally
go do that you probably need to get a
PhD and really advanced stuff to really
push the envelope in security but if
that's what you want to do definitely go
do that but for the 99.9% of application
developers the rest of us we just have
to use the best security measures my one
advice for this is that if you're an
application developer use what's
available to you and understand why you
should be using it and how it kind of
works so for example for web application
development the popular web frameworks
jangle rails they already have a lot of
security things built inside that
framework for you so as an application
developer and you just have to be
cognizant of it and use it all right
let's see most popular web frameworks
one thing they do for you is they put
special tokens in all your web forms to
prevent cross-site forgery and they just
do that for you you don't have to think
about it
most frameworks can handle proper SSL
redirecting and enabling of Secure
Sockets Layer x' with just one line of
code web application frameworks also
help manage many server-side secrets for
you to help you kind of hide sensitive
information for all the back-end
developers out there I know many of you
guys who work in the backend or write
server-side code for web applications
you're probably designing API is a lot
making restful resources and doing all
that stuff while you're probably using a
framework to help you do that those
frameworks probably provide default
header token authorization techniques
for you they probably provide default
throttling techniques for you so a user
can't just hit your website 1,000 times
a minute all those kind of things
done-for-you already and you just use it
so it's literally one line of code user
a can only access my API 60 times a
minute and you just do one line and
someone else's code will do more of the
logic for you
point number three point number three I
just want to say the major the major
point in this whole thing is that when
you use different frameworks to help you
design your applications there's already
a lot of work already a lot of legwork
done for you in the ground with security
and just use what's already available
and don't try to reinvent the wheel and
trying to do your own prevention of
cross-site scripting all right so just
use what's available for you and that's
the best thing you can do as an
application developer 99% of the time
the fourth point I want to make is that
what do we just cover we covered
securing your application as an
application developer and you always
have to do that well the fourth point I
want to make is that you also have to
secure the computers that your
applications are running on usually
there might be a dedicated like network
security or system administrator person
to help do this to set up the computers
as securely as possible but if you're
just working on an application by
yourself your one or two programmers
you'll probably have to do both secure
the application and secure the computer
so again let's just do the same thing
run through a bunch of examples of what
securing a computer really means one
example could be installing SSL
certificates on the computer so
different apps running on the computer
can always reference those certificates
you could also set up private networks
to kind of hide your computers away from
the big back Internet another form is
setting up the right firewall so the
ports aren't all opened and may be
installing antivirus software so these
are all points to secure the computer
itself and it's kind of in parallel with
securing the application so that was
actually a really important point I'm
just gonna say it again to try to drive
at home but point number four is that
you should spend some time to secure the
computer that you're using and remember
to point number three is securing the
application
that are running on that computer
alright guys that's the end of the video
let's just do a really quick recap of
all of these four major points so first
one is just understand the basic words
don't be completely clueless about what
basic security words means like what is
RSA number two is remember be a good
consumer of securities so that's using
the security features of other
applications to just protect yourself
third was as an application developer
used all the security features made
available for you
don't reinvent the wheel just use them
in your application and last but not
least remember to secure the computer
itself last point I want to make is that
if you want to really get into the
detailed detailed details of computer
security like how the real cryptographic
algorithms work I am not the right
person to go to for that if you really
want to understand like how like RSA
works how a EES works like the history
behind it how those things have evolved
but you should look up other resources
to get that information because I'm not
the right person to provide or lecture
about that at all all right
this whole video is just me trying to
speak to it practically for the 99% and
hope was helpful
alright please like the video again
subscribe please if you have any
questions comments concerns even in the
comments and I'll try to respond as soon
as as soon as I can alright guys take
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
