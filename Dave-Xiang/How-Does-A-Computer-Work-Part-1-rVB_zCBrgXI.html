really really well and you had a great
week this week's video is going to be a
two-part kind of big picture video and
it's going to be on the technical side
all right so I wanted to make this video
for a long time so I have a lot of
different videos about computers and
stuff on various topics like bits and
pieces of stuff but I haven't really
made something that ties a lot of those
things together so that's kind of the
purpose of this video the question I
want to answer is how does computer work
and the purpose of this video is just
tie together some fundamental concepts
of a computer system and give an
overview about how computer works
alright so I know many of us software
developers a lot of people watching our
software up-and-coming software
developers and this kind of stuff
doesn't really matter and you can
definitely get by without having to know
a lot of this stuff but in my opinion it
doesn't hurt to I need at least know
about it alright so not really pertinent
to the day-to-day stuff but still kind
of good to know and also it's just good
to have a big picture idea of some of
this stuff alright so today we're going
to talk about one computer and one
computer is pretty cool and next time we
can talk about a lot of computers so how
do computers communicate with each other
over a network to do cool things so
that's next week's video but for today
this week we're just going to do
fundamental concepts of one computer
running all right so just get into it
as I said this video is going to be a
little technical I'm going to definitely
make some assumptions on how much you
know
so all these words should mean something
to you I cover most of these things in
my playlist called computer systems so
if anything you should wash all of these
videos if you can before even listening
to this and if you're coming really
fresh I don't think this video is going
to make a lot of sense all right if
you're too fresh so just everything in
this list should at least mean something
to you Ram hierarchy dis Ram caches
registers CPU instructions set
architecture Hardware threading
multi-core instruction level parallelism
basic operating system stuff like
processes versus threads virtual memory
static for shared libraries and some
basic networking alright so if that if
any of that is too foreign to you
maybe should touch up on that stuff
first before moving on alright so let's
just get started so first thing I want
to talk about a lot of text here but as
always just follow my voice and I've
hopefully organized this in a cohesive
way but first thing you do is you just
turn your computer on okay and this is
only really relevant for desktop
computers like the one you're using
right now a server is always on like
those computers in the server farm
they're always on and they only really
turn off when there's a fire or
something bad happens so you turn your
computer on and as you know the RAM
starts off empty so your persistent
storage like your hard drives are flash
they have all the stuff that you need to
boot up that computer so when the
computer first turns on it executes that
basic firmware code that basic BIOS
setup you see that all the basic stuff
that happens before the OS is loaded and
firmware is code that can kind of
execute from a persistent storage and it
loads the operating system into RAM
alright and for the rest of the video I
might use ram and memory interchangeably
but when you hear me say memory it by
default means ram alright so as many of
you guys know the OS operating system is
like the most important the craziest and
most important software that is running
on your computer and it's the first
thing that gets loaded
so once the OS is loaded into memory it
kind of takes control and what does it
mean to like take control but it kind of
means to take control of the hardware so
the firmware code is telling the CPU
what to do for like a split second or a
few seconds when you're booting up but
after the OS is loaded the OS is telling
the CPU what to do as long as the
computers on all right so this is like
99.9999% of the time and this is like
for a split second
but there's a difference so so pretty
much once the OS is loaded and kind of
activated quote-unquote it enables a lot
of cool stuff so basic operating system
features like virtual memory process
scheduling dynamic memory allocation
other cool features are all activated
and that's when all these cool processes
start all right and that's going to be
the main focus of this video but before
we get really deep into that let's just
take a step back and talk about basic
concepts idea all right so what is a
computer and if someone asks you what is
computer you could give them a really
technical answer or really like silly
answer all right it's like it's the Dell
tower you're using to play
counter-strike but the really primitive
concept behind a computer I think this
is the most basic way you can put it is
that think of your computer as just a
bunch of software telling a bunch of
hardware what to do
alright that's essentially all it is
your hardware is useless without the
software and the software needs to run
on something right so a computer is just
a bunch of software on a bunch of
hardware alright that's that's pretty
much it but we can do better than that
so like a more precise concept is that
think of your computer and it's only
really practical with an operating
system like your computer would not be
practical without an OS but thinking for
your computer that's just a set of
processes getting scheduled and executed
by the OS to do whatever you want with a
limited set of resources all right and
just say that again because the whole
video is premise is based on this idea
your computer is just a set of processes
getting scheduled by the OS to do
whatever you want with a limited set of
resources all right so first thing we
have to do is before we get too into
software we have to make the hardware
connection so the hardware connectionism
remember that the CPU is a hardware it's
really dumb but it's really powerful if
the CPU didn't have any software to run
it just be like a brick
right but a really powerful brick so the
hardware connection is that the CPU
always has to be told what to do by some
software and that's usually the OS the
OS is telling the processor what to do
and at any point in time the OS is
telling to CPU exactly the instruction
that it has to execute and how does it
do that all right so who tells the CPU
what to do now we know the OS but how
does it interpret things so remember
guys that like CPU can only understand
machine instructions read only
understand some machine instructions a
CPU will not understand code like the
stuff we write that stuff is all
translated down to machine instruction
so one zero zero one zero one zero one
zero one zero one
that translates to like add these two
numbers so what the CPU essentially does
is it reads instructions from arbitrary
address in RAM and it executes that
instruction and the OS is always
pointing to the right instruction and
right address to use right so all the
CPU does is read instructions and
execute them that's all it does and OS
is pointing the CPU to do the right
thing so might have drilled that down to
hard but let's just like go through a
train of thought all right try to follow
this train of thought but a CPU must
execute instructions from memory who
controls what goes into the RAM since
the OS is telling the CPU what to do it
controls what's going to the RAM right
that should make sense the OS controls
what gets put into RAM or memory so what
exactly is the OS putting into RAM well
the OS puts the processes that you want
to run into Ram so these processes get
allocated into RAM for this all to be
processor to for this to be possible for
you like the you the user of the
computer is telling which processes that
you want to run that's essentially what
happens when you double click on
something once you double click on that
icon you're telling the OS to run a
process
so how do all these active processes get
put into RAM well each active process
like all the stuff you double-click on
is intelligently allocated into RAM and
managed by the OS and virtual memory
alright and what kind of stuff does one
process need but it gets really really
complicated but you can always distill
it down to two main categories so every
single process just needs two categories
they just need either data or
instructions instructions is like the
code relevant to that process and the
data is actually like the raw data
arrays numbers raw data that a process
needs right you just need these two
things so anything a process needs can
be put into one of these buckets all
right this is the stuff you write in
code this is all those random memory
addresses you need to store data so how
does the CPU actually do this so so as
you know the CPU is dumb but it's really
powerful all the CPU sees is an endless
list of instructions to execute and the
OS is pointing it to the right list but
it's endless it's just like infinity
instructions that the processor has to
execute so once the processor knows the
instructions to execute it's up to the
hardware's job to do it as efficiently
as possible right that's hard ROS job
remember that all CPUs are created
differently they have different cores
they have different gigahertz all those
different features like a CPU today it's
much more powerful than a CPU 10 years
ago so you could have the exact same
instructions to execute but a CPU in the
modern day would do it much faster than
a CPU like even last year right not all
processors are created equal so CPU
efficiency is controlled by two things
right two things the first is the raw
hardware and how much stuff it can
physically handle like if you want to
add two things at the same time you have
to have two Hardware pieces to add
things at the same time right I hope
that makes sense like if you don't have
the raw Hardware not know parallelism
nothing is possible you can't add two
things at the same
time if you don't have two adders so
that's the raw hardware and the other
thing is the raw software so the
optimization levels of instructions and
the code this is the kind of like a
compilers job but software also
determines how efficiently a CPU can run
so just for example if your compiler is
a shitty shitty compiler and it spits
out code that can't be parallelized and
the CPU can't do anything even if it's
really powerful right like you could
write code that is so bad and the
compiler could be so bad that it just
spits out a really really inefficient
sequence of instructions and even if the
CPU is like a Pentium 30 it won't be
able to do it well so those are the two
bottlenecks raw Hardware raw software
and last but not least this is a really
good thing everyone should remember
every software developer should remember
this but whatever you do in code
whatever you do in code it all funnels
down to the cpu in terms of machine
instructions all right anything you type
in the end it funnels down to a machine
instruction so if you have a large C++
project that gets compiled down to a
binary that binary is full of machine
instructions right or you could write a
bunch of Python code and your Python
code is interpreted by like a Python 3
executable and the code you write is
actually interpreted by something else
and that still gets put into machine
instructions or you could write java
code your java code could be compiled to
Java and translating it out to machine
instructions so the gist of this is that
everything everything everything that
you potentially do as a programmer in
the end all it is all it does is get
translated to machine instructions like
it executed by the processor all right
never forget that
all right no matter how complicated or
how different the software you write and
there's so many variations as you know
like there's infinity variations of
software in the end it all gets
translated
down into machine instructions so that's
going to be the end of part 1 and now
like we're going to think of everything
in terms of a process so stick with me
into part 2 hopefully that was a nice
intro but in part 2 we're going to talk
about how what the OS is actually doing
with all these different processes
alright so part 2 next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
