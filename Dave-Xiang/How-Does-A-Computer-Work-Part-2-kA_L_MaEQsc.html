how does a computer work you have to
watch part one or else none of this is
going to make sense all right so just
starting off this video and let's go
back to our basic premise of what a
computer is all right think of your
computer only practically useful with an
OS as just a set of processes getting
scheduled to do whatever you want with a
limited set of resources alright so
that's the basic premise of what a
computer was we made the hardware
connection here we talked about what a
CPU does how the OS tells the CPU what
to do and how well the CPU does it
alright so that was the hardware
connection and now we're gonna talk more
in terms of software and what the
operating system is doing alright so
hopefully you guys have grasped how the
CPU is connected in all of this and now
let's just talk about what the OS is
doing to get all these processes
scheduled and executed so scheduling
let's talk about scheduling first at any
one specific point in time you're gonna
have hundreds hundreds of processes
running on your computer any computer is
gonna have tons of stuff running on it
you could have stuff running on it from
the system
like the computer has its own processes
running on one computer you have
processes running on that computer if
your friend logs into that computer from
a wrote remote location he or she could
also have their own processes running on
that computer you could have a lot of
things running
all right--so process again a process is
literally anything
it's literally anything it's the small
script you're running to crawl the web
it's the crazy video game you're playing
it's Chrome in YouTube as you watch this
video it's a background kernel process
doing whatever they need to do so
everything everything is a process from
the perspective of the operating system
so for the rest of this video we're
really gonna put this kind of being this
kind of mindset like think of everything
in terms of a process so for scheduling
the process needs to get executed right
to even function the CPU needs to
execute the process
and it's the OSS job to schedule all the
active processes to get their fair share
of time on the processor so this is
essentially this is the essence of
scheduling and we can't get into the
super details of how scheduling works it
gets pretty crazy but it's like the OS
pretty much tells the processor
okay let's spend some cycles on process
a ok let's switch over to process B we
need to spend some cycles over there ok
let's go back to process a ok process a
is done let's switch to process C all
right so tons of scheduling going on by
the OS for hundreds of processes running
on your computer
alright that's the main essence of
scheduling so the other thing to
remember is why do things break alright
we're all used to like our computers
crashing you got a blue screen of death
something froze so like why does stuff
break and this caught me up over a long
period of time but like you know things
always break you do control-alt-delete
you swipe up on your iphone you do
android task killer what you're
essentially doing when you you force
quit all these applications you're
killing the processes right processes
can f up and then you gotta end them you
got to forcefully quit out of them so
why do these things break it's like why
do these things break and why do
computers crash like when I was growing
up I was so upset when my computer
crashed and I didn't understand why I
was crashing so pretty much processes
break because of software problems
alright it's always software problem
because inherently software created that
process so if that process misbehaves
there's a problem in the software
computers and hardware are not built to
crash alright they only crash because
the software running on them destroy
stuff this is a really important point
all right so I'll say it again computers
and hardware are not built to crash they
only crash because software on them just
messes up so processes can break for a
variety of reasons it could be misusing
resources like
four processes using way too much memory
in the computer it could just end up not
working if it just uses way too much RAM
it could be a straight-up software bug
you could have written a software bug
that just is not good right you could
have written an infinite loop and your
program is stalling we could have shared
we access the bad part of memory it
could just be a straight-up
software bug and another thing remember
there's limited resources so other
processes might be messing up so some
other processes using all the RAM and
now our process is screwed alright and
this happens sometimes to to cause
breakage always remember there's limited
resources in the computer right you only
have so much RAM and in the rare case
this is a rare case I just wanted to put
out there but that the software that
controls hardware can also have bugs
right if the software controlling your
hardware messes up or FS up then your
physical hardware could be misbehaving
and that's when you really have to
restart your computer all right so again
think of your computer is just a set of
processes getting scheduled by the OS to
do whatever you want with a limited set
of resources so one thing that's just
crazy if you take a step back and think
about what's happening here it's really
a little bit of magic right how is all
this stuff
working together and I just like to call
it operating system magic all right and
we just said let's just sit here and
like realize and appreciate everything
that's doing so for example if one
process goes down it's usually fine your
operating system is not going to explode
or go down right if your video game
stalls out you usually just force quit
the game and restart it and it doesn't
go it's not gonna break your whole
computer right if you're using Microsoft
Word my Microsoft Word crashes all the
time I just save a lot and I just quit
and reopen it so why the computer really
needs this magical protection alright
the OS is doing some really magical
stuff and the computer needs it because
all the code that you
me right they have bugs in it and
they're gonna break so you're gonna
write your own programs and you're gonna
execute your noose like fancy shiny
program on the computer but of course
it's gonna have bugs and it's gonna miss
use resources on all that stuff right
every single software has bugs it
doesn't matter if we write it or Google
writes that or Facebook writes that
every single software has bugs in it and
the operating system protects the
computer from those bugs so you can't
misbehave and just ruin everyone's day
all right so and this is all done by
create all this all the features we kind
of talked about like virtual memory
scheduling but the OS really is a little
magical in this sense all right so this
section is more of like a let's take a
step back and appreciate how well the OS
is managing all the hundreds of
processes running on one computer at a
given time so the last section of this
video I just want to talk about some of
the magic stuff that you can do right so
you're protected right we just talked
about how you're protected the OS has a
certain level of abstraction for all
these processes but what kind of stuff
can we do as programmers to do cool
things I have three things here one is
multi-threaded programming which is cool
stuff and also very hard and nuanced has
its own complexities of doing
multi-threaded programming but what are
some cool use cases if you want to use
multi-threaded code right what if you
have a lot of computation that doesn't
depend on each other and it can all be
done in parallel with some parallel
processors so you might opt to do some
multi-threaded code so if you have tons
of computation to do that don't rely on
each other you could execute them on
different threads and the processor
could run all of them simultaneously
another good use case of multi-threaded
programming is you can avoid states
where you're blocking some important
functionality so one example is if your
if your program you wrote is writing to
disk a lot like maybe you're right into
a database often you're right into some
big files that can be a very slow
process
so you might want to offload all the
disk writing to a separate thread 2/3 up
the main one all right remember that all
processes have at least one main thread
and maybe more
so besides multi-threaded programming
you can also you can also do multi
process programming which is also pretty
crazy but processes can create other
processes and there's this a well known
command but one prossies process can
make and track another process which
gets pretty crazy right because where
does it end it could one you can make
one process each one of those makes more
they make more they make more and that's
when the system kind of breaks so one
good example of this is that there's
many web servers if you guys read about
read up on how web servers work what web
servers can execute many processes at
the same time and there's usually like a
master one that manages other processes
so that's also a very cool thing you can
do last but not least there's also
processes that can communicate with each
other this is called inter process
communication or IPC so processes can
communicate with each other even though
the OS kind of puts walls and
encapsulates around it so the most basic
way you can think of is a file write a
file you can actually use a file to do
inter process communication process a
writes some info to a file process B
reads the info from the file and
essentially you do have some level of
communication there so that's probably
the most primitive way of inter process
communication and there's many many
others all right and networked inter
process communication this is kind of
the stuff we're going to talk about next
time but when you do inter process
communication across computers on a
network that's like the backbone of the
Internet all right and this is where it
gets even more crazy so that's it for
this video so just to summarize we spend
a lot of time talking about one computer
and next time we'll spend we'll spend
time talking about many
Computers which is a whole different
level of complexity but we have some
time here so I just want to recap what
we did because it was a lot so the whole
purpose of this video was really to
understand how a computer works and tie
together some fundamental concepts
definitely set a lot of words maybe I
don't remember everything I said but if
anything I said doesn't make sense or if
any of this list of words is too
unfamiliar to you just go back watch
some of my videos maybe read a book or
just google and search about what these
things mean because there's so many
different parts there's like hundreds of
different parts and it all comes
together to make a computer it's crazy
right so remember from the moment your
computer turns on it activates the
operating system and loads it into
memory right the operating systems job
is just to schedule on execute processes
and tell the CPU what to do we talked
about the hardware connection about who
tells the CPU what to do remember it's
always the OS there's always that
hardware connection between hardware and
software which is really important and
it's also really important to understand
how the CPU does it all right not all
CPUs are the same and some are just
going to be better and do things more
efficiently than the other ones so so
after we talked about the hardware
connection we talked about process the
actual operating system and processes we
talked about scheduling why do things
break and we talked about this OS
magical protection that's provided for
all the processes so when one fails not
everything fails and then we talked
about some magical stuff you can do with
one computer and next time we can talk
about magical stuff you can do with many
computers which is like how the internet
works so I guess just to give a little
bit of taste for that video is kind of
like using one computer it's pretty
simple but there's only so much one
computer can physically do right think
about Facebook or Google getting hit
like millions of times a second or
whatever but
there's resources right you can't build
a computer the size of a town but a
computer has limited resources and
that's why you need many many different
computers working together to make crazy
services possible like Facebook probably
started as one computer but now it's
probably you know ten thousands tens of
thousands computers in a warehouse
powering that service so that's when
things start getting really crazy
because you can even see how one
computer is a little crazy right just
think about that multiplied by n
computers and how they can all
communicate with each other to do insane
things so yeah it's crazy when you think
about it but at it's very core you still
have to understand how one computer
works so hopefully this video shine some
light on one computer and if you really
understand what's going on for one
computer you'll understand how networks
of computers are working so hopefully
this video is helpful hope you enjoyed
it hope it was enlightening in some way
and I'll see everyone next time all
right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
