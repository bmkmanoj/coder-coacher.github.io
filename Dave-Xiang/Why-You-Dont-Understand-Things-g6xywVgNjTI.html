endless amount of things to learn
obviously we have an endless amount of
things that we don't understand this
video is geared mainly towards people
that have asked me why they don't
understand your homework or programming
assignments I just I just don't get it
this makes no sense this idea that I'm
going to go over here doesn't apply just
for homework okay it could apply for all
of life life this has happened to me a
lot in the past and still happens to me
every day I'll get a homework assignment
for homework number three I'll just take
a look at the homework and I'll be like
what the f does this mean even the
question itself will make no sense to me
and I won't even know where to start if
this sounds familiar to you at all don't
worry because 100 percent of people in
this world go through the same exact
thing we blame it on the teacher
speaking too quietly speaking too
quickly we blame it on bad lecture notes
we blame it on confusing assignments or
lazy TAS but in the end the only person
to blame is ourselves the whole point
I'm trying to make boils down to this
really simple concept and it's captured
in this quote very well if you can't
solve a problem there is an easier
problem that you can't solve find me if
you encounter something that you don't
understand or you don't know how to
start there's something even more
fundamental that you don't understand
the tricky thing here is that it's your
responsibility to find the more
fundamental thing if you can't figure
out homework number three you better go
back to homework number one and two and
figure out exactly what you missed
if you got a 50% f- on your test you
better make sure you can get a hundred
percent on that test before you even
think about going to the assignments
that come after if you don't understand
something or you don't understand a
fundamental and you move on too fast you
actually only have yourself to blame no
teachers the one thing that separates
the experts from the news is really
really understanding the foundation and
the fundamentals an expert really
understands homework 1 and 2 before they
start homework 3
everyone in different fields and
different industries at the highest
level they don't always float at the
highest level they're always really
grounded and they always reference the
fundamentals very often it's just that
the expert has a really really good
grasp on the foundation whereas the
beginner doesn't understand it yet ok so
this is pretty much all I have to say
about this question
just keep that quote in mind if you're
ever hopelessly lost on an assignment
you can rest assured that everyone in
this world is actually hopelessly lost
just that some people are better at
finding the thing that's more
fundamental to learn first so make sure
you find one it's your responsibility to
find the easier problem solve it and
move on
alright that's all I have to say see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
