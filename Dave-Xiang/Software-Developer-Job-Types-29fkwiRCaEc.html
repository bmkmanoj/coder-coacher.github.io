really really well
topic for this week's video is going to
be software developer job touch and it's
a slightly different than types of
software developers which I made a video
on but this is actually focused on where
you can potentially work and there are a
lot of different places all right so
let's get straight into it so first I'm
going to steal this idea from a
world-renowned author Robert Greene
definitely check him out if you haven't
ever heard of that name but he had this
really basic idea that there's only
three periods of learning and everyone's
like alright so the first period of
learning is what your parents teach you
the second period of learning is what an
institution or your school teaches you
and the final period of learning is real
life and sometimes what real life
teaches you is totally different from
the first two so I brainstormed a bunch
of different types of jobs like
different job types where you could
potentially find yourself and my goal
for this video to just let you guys know
that this is what's out there
so it's not saying that this is what you
could potentially do but at least I want
to show you guys what options you might
have what you actually want to do is
obviously your internal introspection
stuff I talked about that a lot of times
what you want to do is totally up to you
and it's tough to find out but what I
want to do in this video is just
showcase what's the possibility all
right and I have I think eight or nine
or ten things listed down here we're
going to run through them pretty quick
and I'm hope it's going to be helpful
someone else on an old video commented
that when I talk you always put the
YouTube at 1.5 and I didn't think I
talked that slow but maybe I do talk a
little slow so for this video I'm just
going to try to get the content out
there quickly consistently and clearly
and hopefully you don't to watch my
video at 1.5 X because it's a little
weird before we get into the software
developer stuff one clarification that I
just want to get out there is a
difference between IP and software
development and this is pretty confusing
it was highly confusing for me for a
while so I just want to talk
that difference up front real quick and
then we'll get into the job cut okay so
the main difference between IT and
software development is pretty simple I
think this is the best way to think
about it every single company every
single company in the whole world needs
an IT department but not every single
company is a software development
department in our kind of modern age or
the modern world every single company
needs a computer and if you need a
computer which is almost every single
entity then you're probably going to
need an IT department so high schools
nursing homes manufacturing plants like
a construction company even any company
that is not a technical company they
still need IT they still need computers
they still have information the track so
when you hear IT making the context of
infrastructure and like raw operation
just so this company can use computers
so what did they do they set up
computers for everyone like the hardware
the physical computer for everyone they
set up the internal networks they set up
pupils profiles and logins they set up
like how software is deployed on two
different computers they set up how data
is organized like even a nursing home
needs some kind of data right
now don't get me wrong IT and whole IT
department they still write a ton of
software but you always have to think
about it and explain these different
contexts right the software they're
writing and the work the IT department
is really doing is setting up the core
infrastructure of the company and how
all the data is organized and how people
just use computers so with that being in
mind I hope it's clear that every single
company whether it's a high school or
just like a simple like nursing home or
a small mom-and-pop pizza shop every
single company if they want to use
computers they need a little bit of IT
hope that's clear now the major
difference the major difference between
the IQ department we just talked about
and a software development department is
the context again so if you have a
software development apart
or team they're actually using software
for the actual product or service for
the company right it's in the
application context what they're
building
what kind of the software they're
writing and the code they're all pumping
out it's all for something it's all for
products it's not just for the
infrastructure for example Google kind
of software development teams each
different team is working on core
applications and products of Google
there's a software team for Google Drive
Google clouds like Google Plus all those
different things but they still have an
IT team which manages all the
information technologies in the company
whereas if you take nursing home a
nursing home doesn't really have a
software development team but they
definitely have an IT department all
right so that's the major difference IT
and software development it's all a
matter of context
all right ok so I hope the difference
between IT and software development is
very clear now for the rest of the video
we're going to put on our software
developer hat all right so everything
I'm going to present for the rest of the
video as always in the context of
software development not IT alright so I
have a list here of all the possible job
types not all of them just like the top
ones that I could think of obviously
there's so so many I'm not going to
cover them all in this video but these
are kind of my top types my top
categories for software development jobs
first one you already know this one we
talked about a lot I'm going to put it
out there first because it's simplest
but it started all right and I think
there's only three categories of
startups that you could potentially do
alright the first category is you start
your own startup you just make it
yourself the second category is you join
a start-up with less than 10 people the
final category is you join a growing
startup usually with 50 or more people
and they're growing
there's only those three types starting
your own obviously that's pretty cool
we're not going to get into the
nitty-gritty details all these different
three types if you start something
yourself obviously you get paid the
least amount of money but you have the
high
stake in the company all right the
second category when you join a startup
with less than ten people this is
actually the category that you have to
be most careful with if you're a
software developer because this category
of less than 10 people like super small
company it has the highest risk for you
as a developer you have the least stake
in the company you didn't make it but
you're still a really early employee
you're probably going to work a lot and
you don't know if the company is going
to be successful all right so that
category startups with less than ten
people is take most precaution when
thinking about that as a job opportunity
the final category of startups which is
growing or 50 or more people but I think
this one is a little more safe a little
more kind of consistent a little more
stable to join this means a start-up has
established themselves they figured out
something that works which enables them
to grow all right
they're not like struggling with their
heads cut off like a chicken with less
than ten people they've established
something something is working and now
they're in a growing space so that's a
much more stable decision so make your
own company less than ten people be
super careful with lessons and people
and then 50 or more people all right
that's the only three categories for
startups next major category I want to
talk about our private companies and
there are a lot of different varieties
of private companies
all right so private companies are what
startups try to inspire to eventually a
startup just kind of turned into a
private company like you consider uber
or snapchat like I don't consider
Bluebird as a startups anymore right
they're way past that
uber is just like a private company
operating around the world and their
past the start of things so I think the
range for this is probably the hundreds
and up maybe a hundred to the thousands
but if you're a private company you've
already been established you're out of
the startup phase and now you just are
either going about your day and there's
a lot of different flavors of private
companies
if you guys heard the recent news
snapchat clouds for an IPO they used to
be a start-up they grew out of it and
now they've been operating as like a
private company for a while and they've
recently made the decision that they
want to go public so the reason to go
public could be different for any kind
of company could be the founders want to
get rich maybe it's a financial reason
maybe they need to go public to raise
more money but a private company could
choose to go public or they could just
stay private like there are a lot of
companies out there that just enjoy
being a private company like if you guys
heard of a company called Patagonia it's
a really successful clothing like
mountain clothing company in the state
but they stay private for so many years
and they're successful and they have no
intention of going public so when you're
a private company you can kind of you
can be a private company trying to get
even bigger and become Google where it
can just be this self-sufficient private
company doing your own things from the
perspective of the software developer so
you if you're going to consider it
joining a private company one thing
that's a plus is that except we more
stable obviously it's not a start-up
they've grown to a certain size and they
know what their business is so it's
definitely a little stable you're going
to be paid a decent amount of money and
you can probably pick something that
really like matches you if if you like
culturally so you have a little bit of
choice here instability which is nice
for a private company all right so let's
keep moving next category want to talk
about this is obviously one of the more
sexy places to work what this is I'm
calling this like big tech companies
Google Amazon Facebook all the companies
that we all know about huge tech
companies they're public companies and
they have a crazy international presence
so there's definitely a lot of upsides
to work on these big tech companies like
this I think they call them the big four
or the big five but you're working on
like cutting-edge stuff you're
surrounded by super smart people
everything you touch is going to be like
the best way to do something everything
is very stable
just a good place to work you'll make a
lot of money you like get bonuses
they'll get all these cool perks
like at Facebook they have a cart that
they push around with pastries on it my
friend showed me a picture of like the
Facebook pastry card it's absurd it's
crazy the lips they literally push a
cart around with pie and stuff on and
you can just take it and eat it if
you're if you want pie from the
engineer's perspective you're definitely
going to be a cog in the machine and
that's not always a bad connotation
right you're still a cog in this big
machine but it's a really good machine
next category a place that you could
potentially work as a developer is at a
consulting company
some people consider this a little
 and don't get me wrong many of
the times it is rather but
there's a certain nature to a consulting
company that you should be aware of so
for a consulting company
you're always handling clients right
clients come to you to get help on stuff
and you're some kind of experts and
you're able to help them so from what
I've seen talking to friends are kind of
two styles of consulting companies one
you give technical expertise and just
purely consult and the other type is you
actually implement stuff for your
clients and implement new stuff can
actually be kind of fun like you'll get
this big client asking you to do some
like crazy project you'll actually code
implement interact with the client to
build something and then eventually in a
year or something you ship whatever you
build for the client and you go on and
work for the next project so consulting
it's pretty cool one awesome part about
consulting is they like copy you and
they pay for everything when you travel
so when I meet my friends that are in
consulting they always pay for my lunch
which is awesome
the next category I have on this list is
actually very very similar to consulting
but not quite the same alright and this
is working at an agency so for an agency
it's always execution focused you're not
really consulting you're not like yes
you should do this if you're working at
an agency expect to always be executing
something and clients come to you to
work on a very specific project one
example of this is that think about
websites or mobile apps all right there
could be some agency let's pick an
example agency called huge but they
specialize in building websites and
mobile apps for their clients all right
their clients could be coca-cola
coca-cola wants a new website for their
blog they don't want to do this
themselves so they're going to hire a
bunch of agencies to do it for them and
actually big companies like coca-cola
Walmart they actually utilize a lot of
industries begin as a lot of options so
my friend actually was working at an
agency and they were building one mobile
app for coca-cola but coca-cola actually
hired like 20 agencies so they could get
20 variations on mobile apps and make up
pick the best one that they liked
because they can do that because their
coca-cola so if you're working at an
agency expect to do a lot of coding a
lot of implementation for a variety of
clients I have one friend that works at
a pretty popular mobile agency they
specialize in developing mobile apps for
clients but like he made one for ESPN
mobile app for Coke mobile app for like
Walmart all these like really big names
and you're working on some pretty cool
projects that have like big players
behind them alright but it's always
executions real fast he's like three
months on this project three months on a
different project three months on a
different project it's a very fast-paced
a little bit stressful kind of
environment alright getting a little
long but I have a couple last important
points that I still want to get to that
are important all right so the next
category I have for any potential
software developer is working for the
government or government related work
there's two kind of potential
possibilities for working for the
government all right
you can work directly for the government
which is like you could directly work
for the FBI or the NSA or you could work
for other companies that just get
government contracts so those are like
Raytheon Lockheed Martin bone
working on the government is probably
really crazy if you work for the NSA I
bet you can't even talk about what
you're working on I remember going
through a job fair when I was 17 and
there was a booth there was like FBI USA
FBI was recruiting developers and to
apply for that position they asked you
for 10 year
background checks and I was only 18 at
the time so I would have to fill out
what I did when I was 8 years old
pretty crazy book you could work for the
government probably doing security
things maybe developing the
infrastructure internal to the
government lots of stuff you can imagine
everything the NSA does you could
potentially work on that stuff there's
also a lot of companies that have
contracts with the government alright so
the US government is kind of like I want
to jet I want a radar I want a missile I
want two missiles they're actually going
to go to different companies like Boeing
and Raytheon and contract them to build
those crazy technology so if you work at
a company like Raytheon you might be
working on this huge government contract
to build the next generation fighter jet
alright so this is actually quite a huge
engineering breakdown not many people
are aware of this because it's not in
the news but there's tons of engineering
resources going into these government
related projects alright so that's
another category of things you could
potentially work on last thing I want to
say about government related work you're
definitely working on the cutting edge
of technical stuff but it doesn't move
all that fast and there's not too many
young people in that field alright I
think I spoke to one person who works in
kind of a government contracting type of
positions it's definitely much slower of
a pace I mean he's still working on
software for a missile which is crazy
but it's much slower you know they like
take your time eight nine hour days it's
very it's very chill so if that's kind
of the atmosphere of that style of work
and you can choose if that fits you or
not okay the next job type that I want
to bring up that's also very very big
category in the software development
world is the academic /rd
type of jobs and if you're working in
this kind of style there's kind of two
places you could potentially work you
could work if you're highly academically
you could work at a university working
on insane projects that are pushing the
boundaries of like physics or you can
work an R&amp;amp;D department inside a big
company so all big companies if really
big companies they all have R&amp;amp;D
departments like Google has Google X and
probably tons of other research things
Apple probably has their own research
things the main context of working this
kind of academic or research type of
environment is that you're not working
on specific stuff that's going to sell
right away you're working on the future
stuff you're working off things that
could exist or hypothetically exist so
it's a really different feel of your
work you're not working on insane
deadlines you're just kind of working on
what if oh that's cool that's work on
back so if you're into that if you kind
of work if you like working on like the
next-generation stuff and you don't know
if it's actually needed to be used a lot
it's just working on like cool gadgets
and toys R&amp;amp;D might be addicted for you
all right and there's a lot of places to
work for R&amp;amp;D either universities or in
like R&amp;amp;D departments at private
companies all right I'm running out of
time here but we're at the last final
point of job types and now for these
last ones I'm going to just get a little
bit industry specific all right and
there's too many industries to talk
about but I just want to touch upon
three really positive industries that
employ software developers so those are
finance gaming and healthcare if you're
interested in finance as well as
software I would encourage you to work
for finance but that's obviously right
you should work for finance if your
interest in a finance but for any
software developer that's not
particularly interested in the finance
realm if you decide to go work at a
financial company the one thing that you
always have to remember is by default
usually financial companies don't value
software developers like a text
company's values
for developers the important people at
these finance companies are the people
that make money usually traders or other
people that are like managing a lot of
assets but the software developers are
usually a complementary role at these
sign-in companies they put a lot more
value that people that make them money
and a software developer is not going to
really make the raw cash for these
finance companies so you can still work
for them as long as you remember that
little point Gaming is also a huge
industry there's like small boutique
gaming shops if you want to make your
own game there's also huge gaming
companies like Blizzard making World of
Warcraft or Electronic Arts but gaming
obviously that's a huge huge industry
and they employ a ton of software
developers if you work at one of the
bigger gaming companies like Blizzard or
EA your products can be working in a
very very very little part of the game
you might be working on like the right
arm of the main character so it's very
different from working on a small
boutique gaming shop but in the end if
you're really into gaming and I know a
lot of people out there are hardcore
into gaming if you have gaming and you
like software working the gaming
industry might be for you all right so
that's another industry that has so many
developers in it the last one I want to
touch upon is just healthcare and
healthcare is a really big industry and
it's a little behind in software I only
put it on my list because there's
actually a lot of like kind of buzz and
that's trending that a lot of tech is
trying to get injected into healthcare
there's a lot of startups that are
trying to do healthcare related things
but this is a crazy industry like all
the hospitals are pharmaceutical
companies around the world they do need
some kind of software help right and
software can probably help you know
create technology to create like the
next heart or something so
Healthcare is also crazy industry
there's so many industries like most of
this video what we talked about it's
like industry agnostic right they're
just kind of different flavors but if
you break down different industries they
all could potentially use software
developers so education weddings when a
real estate shoes clothing clubbing
partying traveling infinity types of
industries and they could all
potentially use developers the one point
to consider for this last part is that
if you're really passionate about
something else that's not development
this could be a good mix for you right
because software development is so
flexible you can apply it to many
different industries if you have
something else that you really love it
could be a good match potentially so
what if you what if you really like
shoes like you're a shoe person you love
shoes you have 10,000 shoes
I'm sure I'm positive there's a shoe
company out there that could use some
help from a software developer you just
have to figure out how to marry the two
so if you're into something else that's
not pure software if you're a developer
who's learning it for the first time but
you really love shoes you could just
kind of check out what kind of shoe
companies are out there and how could
they use a software developers so I
encourage everyone to check out all
these different types of industries
because there's luther's infinity type
of industries for anything you can
possibly imagine
alright guys that's it for the video
very long video but hopefully it was
helpful I just want to give a little
taste of what's potentially out there
all right so I know many of you are
still kind of in like the second phase
of your life where there's maybe an
institution giving you knowledge or your
parents are giving you knowledge but
once you get kind of I get to the real
world or the final phase of learning
there's just kind of option overload
there's like too many options coming
into you you just have to be aware that
you have to choose what's going to fit
you with that alright so hopefully this
video was helpful gave you a little
taste of what's possible or what you can
look out for and what it's still up to
you to make the final
all right so please give me a like
please give me a comment please thumb up
or like the video like it again and
subscribe to the channel all right take
care enough see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
