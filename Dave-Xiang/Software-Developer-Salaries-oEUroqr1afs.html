doing really really well we finally
finally have the first snowfall of 2017
in the Northeast it's a little late but
better late than never and the earth is
still working kind of straight to the
video today this week I want to talk
about software developer salaries it's a
little taboo at least in US culture not
many people like talking about it it's
really it's a personal thing for a lot
of people but it's still a very
important thing so might as well talk
about it so what we're gonna do in this
video is I'm gonna break it up into two
major parts first half first half of the
video I just want to talk about major
points to consider for salary
compensation all that stuff right no
details yet first half is just major
points important stuff second half of
this video I'm gonna walk everyone
through my personal salary progression
from end of college like right around
the end of 2009 up until early to mid
2017 and my most recent job not my
current job of my most recent job and
I'm gonna walk everyone through exactly
my salary progression right it's really
personal but who cares and I think at
the very least it's gonna help you
alright so if everyone's ready let's
just get straight into the video and
start with these important points about
software salaries so first major point
first thing that I want to tell everyone
is that do not read all those salary
averages Quora like people talking about
all their salaries online there's so
many different websites documenting the
average pay of junior developers senior
developer San Francisco New York those
websites they're all okay that
is probably the last resort you should
not use those websites as resources to
judge your compensation so the only true
the only true my opinion but the real
most helpful way to judge your personal
compensation is to ask a friend in a
similar context what do I mean by
context but context is pretty much your
background right you can't compare
yourself with somebody that's totally
different from you with
totally different circumstance
background upbringing earn anything
right so for me personally I'm lucky
enough to be pretty privileged I got to
go to a really good school I didn't have
to take up too many loans to go to that
school and that school enabled me to get
access to a lot of good jobs right and
that's for me personally like for you
that circumstance is different so it
might not be hundred percent accurate
for you to compare your context with my
context but there are people out there
that you can compare context with you
can find them and you can just ask them
how much do you make personal story is
that when I first moved to New York I
didn't have too much awareness of the
salaries in New York City for my level
all that stuff
the most useful thing I did was ask my
friend that went to the same school as
me one of my good buddies that lives
here but I just asked him how much money
he was making what'd he make it his last
job how did he progress and when he just
told me his numbers it made me just
realize where I stood right so and we
have a very very similar context we grew
up in the suburbs we went to the same
College
same program very similar right so it
was a good that was a good reference
point again don't read all that online
survey pace a salary average it's all
 all right it's just people at
Google complaining about their absurdly
high salaries you cannot just go to the
internet to find out this information
you have to ask a friend or find someone
second point second point I want to talk
about is that the conversation that will
happen to judge your compensation is
going to happen really really fast and
it might throw you off guard there has
been many times in my history or my
career where that conversation happens
so fast and it throws you off guard
because imagine it right usually that
conversation with your boss a recruiting
manager or hiring manager or whatever
you might have a 10-15 minute
conversation maybe a five-minute
conversation but that one conversation
is going to affect how much money hits
your bank account for at least a year
right just think about that such a quick
interaction will judge such a long part
of your life so that particular
conversation regarding compensation is
really really crucial you have to be
ready for it and just you know just be
ready for the last point I want to talk
about is going to be the culture of
asking alright so for many of you out
there actually the Asian people that
they are watching I'm Asian I was born
in the US actually but my parents came
from China a while ago you know they
swam across the ocean did crazy stuff
and they were able to come here luckily
in Hackney and I'm was able I guess luck
or not lucky but to be born in the u.s.
so the one thing that's very different
is the Asian culture versus the more
Western us European culture right and
what Asian culture kind of lacks it's
not as aggressive and you don't ask for
too much stuff right Asian people are a
little more timid reserved shy and
that's rooted deep into thousands of
years of culture right in history maybe
that's changing because things are more
Western capitalistic global istic but
for Asians the general culture is you
don't ask for too much right you you
give a little bit you take whatever
you're given and you just appreciate it
very much right and that's kind of in
the Asian culture for a long time it's
not really a big culture on asking and
asking for a lot of stuff now if you
compare that with Western culture white
culture whatever you want to call it but
here it's pretty much if you don't ask
for it you're not gonna get it right I
think people have taught you that you
know that little phrase or that little
idiom before but if you don't ask you're
not gonna get it somebody else that's
gonna ask for it it's gonna get it right
so when I was growing up a little bit
asking for stuff asking me for more like
asking for more food on my plate at
lunch that wasn't really a value that
Asian parents teach us right
the culture of asking but when it comes
to salary talk you have to ask if you
don't ask no one's gonna give it to you
right maybe in different countries
non-us countries there's no negotiations
you just take whatever you're given but
here if you don't ask for it no one's
gonna give you that extra $20,000 on
your salary right no one's gonna give
that to you so here the culture of
asking it's a u.s. thing you have
to develop it for all the Asian people
watching I had to learn it it wasn't
natural for me it wasn't even natural
for my parents but if you're an Asian
person or you're a timid or shy person
you have to ask all right all right all
right that's enough of the important
topics now to the nitty-gritty details
remember those important points we just
talked about because I think those are
actually more important in all of these
details these details are just gonna
give you some real-life data points so
for me
let me just paint my context again
remember don't compare context if it's
drastically different but pretty
privileged upbringing went to Carnegie
Mellon pretty good school for
engineering took out minimum loans
probably a little less than $20,000 of
loans so was it crazy in debt after
school and I got a master's in
Electrical and Computer Engineering at
the end of the masters I got three job
offers one job offer was in Boston for
seventy two thousand dollars a year one
job offer was in San Diego for $82,000 a
year and one job offer was in New York
City for like 60 $60,000 we're mainly
gonna talk about base salary but
remember salary is just one part of your
compensation right you could have
bonuses benefits retirement stuff stock
options all that different stuff it all
counts towards your total compensation
many people make a majority of their
money and not even in their salaries
through bonuses or stocks and all that
stuff but for every one washing salary
is the most relatable right so those
three job offers I took the one in San
Diego California it was starting at
eighty two thousand dollars a year this
was 2009 I was twenty two out of college
at that time I was working at a pretty
big company in 2009 2010 2011 in San
Diego so that $82,000 I got a little bit
of an inflation bump every year and
there were some bonuses and some stock
stuff so overall I probably took home
around $100,000 pre-tax every year back
then but moving on working two to three
years there and I got a title change
promotion whatever I was called a senior
engineer at that company and they bumped
up my base salary to 105 everything else
stays
the same and I think my total take-home
pre-tax was about maybe 130 135 around
then and this is still San Diego around
2013-2014 so that salary is actually
very very good very comfortable for San
Diego because the cost of living isn't
too crazy it's not a major tech hub and
you know that employer was one of like
the top employers of that area so I was
really lucky but you know in 2014 I
moved across the country from San Diego
back to the East Coast where I moved to
New York City because I wanted to try
some startup stuff right I wanted to dip
my toes into what that startup thing all
meant but when I went there I took a
really really big pay cut to go to a New
York City startup job and I took a pay
cut all the way down to ninety five
thousand dollars a year and I couldn't
even negotiate that very much because I
didn't have any leverage at all and I
just didn't know what I was doing but I
just took a huge pay cut just to come
here just to come to New York City and
try to work at a startup so I'm not
really complaining right ninety five
thousand dollars a year that's
definitely that's not poverty that's
still really good but during that time I
was moving to New York and it was a
little bit of an unknown for me I didn't
know where i stacked amongst a lot of
other people and believe it or not
that's when I was most like kind of
stressed out about compensation and
stuff but at that point that's when I
started to ask my friends my peers
people I went to school with whatever
they at and a lot of them were making a
lot more money than me some of them were
making a little more money than me but
everybody was different right but that
was the time right when I moved to the
city where there was a lot of unknowns
it was less established this whole
random startup thing in New York City
but I didn't know where I stood but
after talking with a lot of friends I
got a better picture of that so $95,000
in New York City it's not poverty but
it's well below my level that's why I
decided so at that startup job I worked
one year there and during my one year
review they did they offered to bump me
up to 115 $20,000 is not so bad I asked
for 145 and eventually we got down to
135 so this was like a year in so maybe
this is 2015 and now I'm making 135 Bay
in New York City so it's roughly
equivalent to my pre-tax money that I
was making in San Diego alright next job
after that I believe after one startup I
actually tried to go to another startup
which was a whole different industry a
whole different thing but they were
actually much much smaller and during
that time I had a better sense of equity
compensation I had a more sense of what
the startup environment really meant but
to go work at that second startup I took
a pay cut again so yeah that sucks but
it's always up and down right so I was
at 135 but then I took a pay cut down to
105 base but I got a lot of equity so
it's a little bit of a trade-off like
you value equity very differently you
value equity more if you believe in the
company the second startup I had a
little more like you know I felt it I
felt it a lot better I still have stock
in that company I love those guys but
for them I took another pay cut down to
105 but I took a lot more stock options
which may or may not mean anything
so that pay cut actually I took it with
a little more forethought but that
startup company I joined was very early
and they just couldn't afford paying me
like 135 thousand dollars a year so what
I got in my offer was that the moment
that startup company would raise another
round of funding and get more capital
and pay people a lot more money I got a
written in my offer that I get bumped up
back to my market rates because 105 was
low so we worked for a while we thought
the fund raise was gonna happen in six
months so I thought I would get bumped
up really fast but six months turned
into one year one year turned into even
longer and I think maybe about I don't
know like a year and change in we
finally the company finally was able to
raise the money and pay people their
market rates right so I was at 105 we
decided there was another round of
negotiation that happened they offered
140 I asked for 170 and then we came
down to 155 salary so actually that's
the end of my journey you know it's a
little bit of an up and down so the 155
was the amount I was making early 2017
and my most recent job I'm not going to
share what I make right now because I
care about the employer I don't want to
bad to happen if I share salary
information but my most recent job which
was just this year because I switched
jobs this year but I was at $155,000
base salary at that most recent job this
year I turned 30 so you know my age you
know my background
that's my context right so just a little
bit a little bit of a story a timeline
of data points for you I think hopefully
this is helpful coming from me even
though the context is different but
don't read any of that online stuff
alright if you just read online stuff
you're gonna see these insane salary
ranges people in San Francisco making
absurd amounts of money
I just heard recently that people at a
school out of some of the top tech
schools they're getting offers like 120
plus straight out of school these are
like 21 year olds so the range is really
high sometimes now but remember always
context always back route or else the
comparison doesn't make any sense
alright guys that's the end of the video
hopefully the story was helpful but I
think the most significant most
important part to remember of this video
is everything we talked about in the
first half alright the first half my
numbers really don't mean anything they
could mean nothing to you it's just as a
reference but the most important points
of this video is all the stuff we talked
about in the first half so if you're
going to rewatch it just rewatch the
first half of it and hopefully that
content is helpful so like the video
give me a comment ask me any questions
send me an email
share the video all that stuff hope you
enjoyed it and enjoy the rest of your
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
