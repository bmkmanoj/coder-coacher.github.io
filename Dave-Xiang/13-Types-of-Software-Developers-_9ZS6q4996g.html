doing well I've received a handful of
questions asking what it's like to be a
software engineer for software it's
pretty hard to provide a typical day by
day it really depends on where you work
who you're working with and what you're
working on in this video I'm going to go
through 13 types of software engineers
first and foremost this video is highly
opinionated there's no rules for these
types I just went with what I felt good
with before we start this video and the
hating starts I just want everyone to
know out of all these types that we're
going to cover none is worse or better
than the other there's some pretty bad
jokes out there like these types of
software engineers aren't real engineers
you'll find that people who usually
believe things like that are usually
beginners aren't very high level or
they're just assholes everyone likes to
hate on things that they don't
understand and usually people think what
they do is the best thing remember to do
any of these things at a high level it
takes training and discipline and
nothing can be discounted alright 13
types let's do it all right first up is
front-end software developers who
specialized in the code that runs inside
your web browser these guys know about
the latest and greatest JavaScript
frameworks and they write the code that
powers all those favorite websites you
go to everyday front-end software guys
worked really closely with designers and
they really make those web pages really
responsive for second type mobile
engineers mobile engineers are the
developers that write games like flappy
bird or snapchat that you use on your
phone every day mobile engineers also
work very closely with designers they
care about every single little pixel and
they usually specialize across different
platforms like Android or iOS
is Game Developers these guys write the
code for the games that you play most
game developers specialize in the
specific gaming framework different
gaming frameworks lets you create games
onto different platforms if you want to
create some desktop or mobile games
there might be a framework for that if
you want to create console games there's
another framework to let you do that
most game developers really like playing
games themselves and they also get into
crazy drawing and 3d graphic type of
programming with OpenGL and using the
graphics processor alright next up we
have back-end and system developers
these guys really do the behind the
scenes type of work these developers are
writing the code that usually powers the
webpage or powers the mobile app this is
the code that powers different api's
power to different SDKs manipulates
databases back-end or system guys write
code that's really meant to be used by
other developers not humans all
developers are humans to remember that
we're at number five now application
developers alright this is a super loose
term application development but what I
think it really means is any kind of
software that's being developed to be
used by a consumer or person front-end
or mobile software developers which we
just talked about our type of
application developer application
developers could create internal tools
to be used by big enterprises or they
could just make that cool desktop
program that you use everyday PowerPoint
keynote you know number six number six
is going to be data science and this is
a super trendy and really loose term
that's just come up in popularity
recently sometimes these are software
guys other times data scientists
actually don't have any software
background a data scientist or data
science engineer is anyone who wants to
look through data analyze it and maybe
come up with any patterns the skill
level is crazy for data scientists it
could be some really beginners all the
way to PhD machine learning experts
super-trendy term but probably won't be
trendy forever
right next up we have one of our most
underrated software developers which is
QA and test these software developers
are super super super important and they
develop software that tests other code
QA and test developers are usually a
little less sexy than the other types
but anyone who knows anything will
recognize that these guys are really
really really important software
engineers that don't know how to test
their code are usually beginners and I'm
sure you'll realize that testing is what
makes development faster we're at number
eight and this is algorithms and science
software development this is probably
the most academic of the types and these
guys read a lot of papers and turn
really academic concepts and theories
into real-life solutions
think of the guys that wrote Google Maps
getting you from point A to point B in
the shortest time possible algorithms
engineering lots of numbers going on
here lots of fine-tuning and
optimizations knife type of software
developer is the embedded systems
developer these guys write the really
low low low level code that powers a lot
of the hardware you use every day this
is code that potentially can run before
an operating system even loads and this
is the code that the actual hardware
needs to actually function properly
embedded developers usually work really
closely with hardware engineers because
there's the ones writing the device
drivers this is the software that's
making your keyboard or your mouse your
camera work right now next up we have
Linux kernel and OS developers this is a
small group of people that develop the
operating software that all our programs
and processes run on how exactly are
different processes scheduled how
exactly do you switch between two
processes how exactly do you manage all
the files in your operating system a lot
of engineers look past the operating
system but it's really really important
and it's also super super niche we need
the operating system to run any type of
process to run
program on our computers entry level
into this software engineering is pretty
high and I'm not gonna lie it's super
complicated all right we're at number 11
now almost done
this one is DevOps or developer
operations this type of software
engineer used to be kind of called the
network or system administrator but I
think DevOps is a new cool word what do
these guys do well they pretty much
handle the whole infrastructure and all
the engineering needs behind any company
what type of computers do we need how
many computers in the cloud do we have
to start how do we fix this latest
security bug how do we back up the
database every day so all our
information isn't lost
DevOps engineers also manage a lot of
different engineering workflow and
processes to make the developers life
really easy usually you start requiring
a DevOps engineer when your system gets
really really really big then you need
someone just to manage the system itself
twelve type of software engineer is the
full stack developer I really don't like
this term too much but it's like a
really common term used mainly by
startups to describe a certain type of
software engineer this is a huge
umbrella-like term again and it could
mean a lot of things but when people say
full stack developer what they usually
mean is someone who can know basics of a
web application framework knows how to
manipulate a database a little bit and
can write a little bit of front-end code
full stack developer doesn't really
represent a particular skill set it just
represents this idea of you can get
things done okay so don't read into this
a little too much full stack developer
what this really means is that you can
just do a little bit between different
types of software engineering last type
of software engineering which I think
are the coolest type of developers but
these are the compiler and language guys
the majority of software engineers
probably you or me we use languages to
create applications on the flip side of
that though there are certain set of
people that specialize and create the
actual language itself someone created
see someone created C++ someone use C++
to create Python there are tons of
different languages out there and
between one language there's also
multiple ways of implementing one
language you probably use Python or Ruby
but do you know what implementation of
Python or Ruby you're using these type
of engineers really study the
fundamentals and organization of how
computer language is actually structured
it's pretty crazy stuff I'm also
grouping the compiler people into this
whole group for compiler and language
developers but those guys are writing
the compilers that really turn all these
cool languages down to machine code that
your computer can run that's all I had
for today which was 13 types of
different software engineers there is
probably a lot more types if you can
think of any more types just let me know
these are just thirteen that I came up
with this morning as you guys go about
learning new things learning new
frameworks learning new languages I
think everyone just gravitates towards a
certain type don't feel like you have to
be locked in into just one type of
software engineering there are so many
types and you really can choose what you
think is most fun or what you think is
most rewarding all right so I hope this
video was useful it's a little hard to
give the day by day but now that you
know the different types of software
engineering maybe it answers some
questions on what you might be
interested in so hope you enjoyed the
video again just give me a like if you
liked it give me a comment if you have
any questions and please subscribe to my
channel for hopefully super helpful
videos alright catch you guys next time
and take it easy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
