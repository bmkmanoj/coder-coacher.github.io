with another video and in this video we
are talking about comparative
programming or programming competition
whatever you want to say that this has
been like really the most asked question
probably one of the most asked question
on this channel and a lot of you wanted
to know all about programming
competitions so recently I have been a
judge for a variety of programming
competitions so I know a little bit
about them not much but yes I have a
decent position to talk about them being
it jazz in many of them so let's talk
about how you can prepare for them what
are the advantages of competitive
programming's what are the pros and cons
of it how you can prepare for them and
how much time you should spend on there
so this video is going to be your
walkthrough guide for competitive
programming everything that you want to
know about them let's get started
so before we even go ahead and do our
regular stuff about the computer
programming let me walk you through what
happened today and this is the sole
reason why I wanted to talk about
computer programming today so today
almost in the afternoon each time
somebody messaged me on Facebook and he
asked me a question that here is a
problem statement it's a competitive
programming and here is a problem
statement that we have to solve in case
you don't know in the computer
programming you get a problem statement
probably an app idea probably a website
idea and you have to solve that using
your unique ways or how much you can be
efficient in memory management or
Storage Management or how cool you can
be in coming up with the idea or
handling the situation coming back again
so this this guy gave me a simple
screenshot that this is the problem
statement and we have to bring up an app
for that and n droid app now I don't
want to name any competition or
programming or anybody here but let me
give you the problem statement in a
simple words it was a simple problem in
which you have to use a certain API so
you will be having a string you have to
parse that string and have to call an
API you will get some API a response
from it and you have to filter out a
request from all of that so you have to
filter out the string and have to
display that yes as as simple as it
sounds it's just the way how you can
handle your API and that's it it was
really simple so I was little bit
confused that why is even that is a big
problem I think you should nail it down
and after a little bit of the discussion
because I was not able to understand it
I asked in that hey can you send me and
I get her profile where you have handle
any kind of api's or something and this
guy said hey I have never worked on API
that much and I was a little bit
surprised I think there is a little bit
more information that I need to give you
so that you can be better at programming
so moving back on to the part where I
was discussing about competitive
programming so obvious question is what
is competitive programming first of all
and how you can prepare for them the
second thing is how much time you should
spend in this competition
and what you'll be gaining with that
okay let's answer one of one-by-one so
first and foremost computer programming
or programming competition are a simple
way of making programming fun I don't
know how they are doing it but
programming is already fun so it is a
way of making programming much more fun
as just like a sports so they give you a
problem statement in that it's fairly
complex and you have to come up with a
brilliant or innovative idea to prepare
an app for that or website or something
like that so that is your programming
competition now the best advantage that
you get by taking part in this
programming competition is you simply
learn how to handle the problems as well
as come up with the solutions with them
as well as you also compete with some of
the finest brains that are taking part
in that competition which brings us to
the next question how you can prepare
for them now here comes the main part
which is who should take part in
computer programming now let me say it
out loud a lot of people might get
really offended with that but computer
programming or these programming
competitions are not at all for
beginners no not at all now I'm not
talking about any problem statement that
is given on the website and you have to
write a solution for them I'm talking
about big events like hackathons or
maybe a Google seventh or Facebook's
event these events or any kind of big
like recently there was the dev space in
vit which was amazing and these events
are not at all for big nurse because let
me just give you a simple reason here
you will be given a statement that hey
we have this idea this concept come up
with an Android app which has the
brilliant UI or just just this to this
competition or this particular problem
statement come up with an app with that
now do you really think that anybody who
has absolutely no idea how to make an
Android app or a iOS app or a website
can take part in that competition I
don't think so because these
competitions are for somebody who can
actually write code and can present some
things it is not just for a concept guys
yes you learn a lot of them in them but
it's not for a big nerd that you can
just come up and can say I have an idea
no it's not for ideas guys it for it is
for showing up your coding skills as
fast
as you can and as innovative as you can
so the big question or the big answer
that you get here is first of all
prepare yourself for such kind of
competition so how you can prepare for
them so there are really two easy step
to prepare for any kind of competitive
programming first of all is its first is
actually part 1 and part 2 first of all
is I just understand whatever you want
to learn maybe you want to learn Android
so go ahead buy a good book or buy a
couple of good courses and master
whatever the Android things are usually
and then also make some project so part
one is learning that and part two is
making a lot of project now since in
just the previous a couple of minutes
ago I told you that somebody who is not
even able to manage how the API works is
probably not good fit for programming he
can surely in the future but as of now
he's not at all a good fit so first of
all learn that concept and the second
thing is make enough portfolio projects
again portfolios are super important now
once you are able to understand all
these things
the part two is to move into data
structures and algorithms because in
these competitive programming the major
focus or emphasis is given on how well
you are writing the code how much you
know about saving mammaries even if they
are just saving it's simple memory by
declaring one less variable that can
mean a lot and that can be your deciding
point about you gonna win the
competition or not so they focus a lot
on how well manage you are having
understanding about the algorithms big
O's and these memory management and
space management and all of that so
that's your step number two now once you
have a combination of these kinds of
things you know what you can do you can
either handle a lot of clients project
now or can take part in the competition
now this is the reason why don't you see
a big big companies and people who are
actually working in the big companies or
are managing the client they don't show
up into these competition reason being
now they are skilled enough that they
can either handle the clients project
which can earn some money or they just
can take part of the competition and
probably can get a certificate that hey
I want that
competition so the whole story short
about so part so much part of the video
is make sure you have enough amount of
knowledge enough amount of projects
first of all then move on to your data
structure and algorithm knowledge and
then you are only ready to take part in
such competitions now okay as simple as
that
have a knowledge make some projects and
then take part in competitions now comes
of the big question how much time you
should spend in competitive programming
or should you always be doing it or when
you can do it when you should not be
doing it I have a strong opinion about
them so let's talk also about it
competitive programming's
are addictive and we all know that
although personally we don't like to
have challenges in life but at one point
of time you'll find that our brain
actually loves to have these kinds of
challenges and competitive programming
gives this sense this feeling of having
competition so it's easy to get addicted
with them and just taking part in
competition after competition after
competition or maybe hanging around on a
good website where you have a problem
statement you keep on submitting your
solution and keep on ranking on that now
I'm not at all against any one of them
even in the free time sometimes I even
do that but here is my point
staying with these competitions for too
much of the long time is not at all much
fruitful once you have understood the
knowledge about making projects probably
have played like one or two competitions
may have one may not have one it doesn't
really matter much there but you have
taken a part of them have got a feel
now I highly recommend to move on that's
a good thing for your life for your
career
now programming you are learning
programming obviously to make your life
better you want to earn some money with
that and I'm totally ok if somebody
wants to earn money with that obviously
you're not learning programming for a
charity you are learning programming to
get better life to get better job and
just by taking part in these competition
is not gonna do that you need to learn
how to handle the clients and how to do
the projects because in the competitive
programming your problem statement
remains just the same but when you do
with the client work your problem
statement keep on changing and becomes
more challenging and challenging and
challenging so it's rather to build up
something like real
application than taking part in the
competition now on to a very side note
if you are looking for word that hey I'm
not getting a job or anything then
sometimes these competitions can be a
good place to show off your skill and
just come up with an innovative solution
and can immediately get hired in even in
big companies but that happens too
rarely and these competitions are
extremely tough even cracking a couple
of rounds into them is extremely
extremely challenging and even if you
have that kind of skills it is rather
far more easier to just directly apply
into the companies and get hired and I
have seen that in fast as well so whole
story short competitive programming is
amazing if you want to take part in them
first of all prepare yourself it's
something like playing an IPL I hope
many of you are aware about Indian
Premier League a big cricket festival
just like in the u.s. they have big
baseball kind of things or NBA if you
want to play in such games it's not like
you can just show up and can say I'm
gonna play the competition it's not it's
the challenge we are finest and finest
of the brain are gonna show up so you
want to spend a good amount of time in
preparing for about it so make sure
first of all you learn the topic really
spend a good amount of time in that and
prepare at least good amount of projects
with that I would say at least 10 of
them not the 10 that you have learned in
some of my courses for the Android pen
of your own as well the most important
part is for any programming any project
or any competition you should absolutely
be comfortable in handling any kind of
api's they are the heart and the soul of
most of the applications that anybody is
building up once you have that then grab
good amount of knowledge about data
structures and memory management and
space management and all of that and
then you can jump into that now probably
in the future if you'll request me I can
talk a little bit more about applying
for or preparing for them and probably
can suggest you some good books on that
let me know in the comment section as
well ok so this was quite a long talk
about computer programming now just onto
a side note here coming back that's off
topic a little bit but now I have
decided that all in all of my videos I
will be featuring some of your comments
as well so at the
end of the video along with some good
music you're gonna see like two or three
of the comments being featured so make
sure you know you post down some of your
comments below and I will be selecting
some of them and we'll be featuring them
I think it's a good idea to interact as
well as make you a big part of this
community as well so that's it for this
video I hope you have enjoyed this video
and have learned something amazing in
this video and in case you have enjoyed
it give it a thumbs up hit that share
button and of course don't forget to hit
that subscribe button it's important
it's super important just like
programming this one is also important
so that's it and I'm gonna surely catch
you up in the next video
