with another video and in today's video
we are going to address another big
issue that everybody is facing while
learning programming and whether it's
about mobile app development or web apps
development it's pretty much everything
and moreover dedicated towards the
bigness who are learning the programming
are facing two big issues so we are
going to discuss what these issues are
and we are going to try to solve them
now first of all you need to understand
what are those issues as I always face
in order to solve the problem first you
need to recognize that data is one so
let's discuss about them in this video
in this channel we talk about
programming mobile apps web apps and
pretty much everything related to
technology so in case you are new here
consider subscribing
now let's discuss about what are these
two big issues that everybody is facing
right now who are trying to learn
programming and these two big issues are
lack of projects and lack of patience
again both started with the piece of
projects and patience are the two big
issues that I have seen now I teach a
lot and all over the globe I have taught
almost more than 60,000 students
registered and paying students and as
well as in India has taken a lot of
workshops and webinars and offline
seminars as well so I have seen this
quite a common pattern and that pattern
has evolved with a lack of something in
our education system now you go to any
any state there and you'll find at the
universities you'll find the curriculum
that simply says hey you have to learn
things like data science or data
structure and you have to just clear up
the exam and that's it and the people
are not making enough projects to
understand what is the essence of that
subject or why that subject is actually
necessary for example people are
learning thermodynamics but have never
understood where the thermodynamics need
to be applied coming back on to the
programming scenario same thing happens
when you learn about the data structure
C C++ or anything everybody just says
it's being used everywhere but nobody
exactly tells you that what kind of
application you're going to build up by
the end of this semester so that is
really something wrong going on and with
this when people learn something like
HTML or PHP they are not having any idea
what kind of good project they can build
up because the mentor is actually not
taking them or driving through them
completely with the scenario of
designing a project of course this
doesn't happen in the online or offline
boot camps but mature of majority of the
people are not taking boot camps they
are just learning on their own or maybe
learning by the University so what I
would say in here is go for the project
so you are learning C you are learning
C++ until and unless
you do some kind of professional grade
projects now I'm not talking about these
dumb projects like library management
system or all these I'm talking about
something rigorous and that takes some
times and team management as well like
for example let me give you a quick few
examples let's just say when I teach
students about in our mobile design
course iOS application I like to teach
them something like a clone of snapchat
or a clone of very famous the James Bond
app that I do in every seminar or every
every offline workshop or online
workshop that I do or something like
clone of a snapchat or maybe whatsapp
chat or maybe a goober clone so these
are some good projects that you need to
implement if you're going on to the
web-based project again I would
recommend to clone something big like a
Yelp clone would be good or maybe a
Airbnb clone would be good or Zomato
clone these clones needs to be there now
I'm not taking so that you can take over
those business I'm simply saying while
learning something about cloning the
websites of those in business you will
realize how complex things can go on
well designing the project so my number
one tip would be to go for the project's
have some good idea there are lots of
apps on your mobile phone snapchat me
chat what's app uber Yelp other such
things so make sure you go for that
approach so once this is being solved
with the next problem that I see
everywhere this is coming everywhere not
just at one place all over the globe is
the level of patience now everybody when
somebody learns the PhD he wants to
create a Facebook or when somebody
learns in iOS he wants to create a game
like a flappy bird game or maybe other
such famous game now what I think is
these games are not being done just by
one person and obviously these games
were not meant to be created in just one
day they took a whole amount of time
there and rigorous process is being made
so you have learned the PHP just maybe
last within a week or maybe a month and
you want to create a Facebook there it's
not going to be possible let's just be
honest here yes it's a good idea to get
them and clue
then learn some of the basics there
that's a completely good approach
neither I am demotivating anyone that
you cannot create a big scale project
that's not the motor all I'm saying is
you should have patience within a week
or within a month you cannot just
complete a good scale project so what
I've seen is people are missing at the
patience level when you design a proper
website when you design a proper app
with just one app it takes months and
you should be ready for that now I never
say that I'm going to be doing a magic
in my courses or any other people we
just don't say that we are going to do a
magic and within one month or two months
you will be able to write a full-fledged
scale yes you would definitely be able
to understand the syntax and some good
processes and good best practices there
but again this doesn't mean you will be
proved so next step that you should have
developed a lot of patience and with lot
I am saying a lot of patience you will
be sent spending maybe three months or
six months or maybe a year to just
design one simple product but trust me
then you will be able to do that
particular project is going to be your
lifetime earning trust me on that
whether that project may be getting good
hype or maybe that get failed but the
knowledge that you will be getting while
designing that project is going to be
super remarkable so these are my two
tips let me quickly summarize that first
go with the project-based learning
approach and not just the dummy project
that everybody has been doing for over
the past 10 years go with the modern
error try to design modern apps and
after that have some level of patience
within a month there is no magic that's
going to happen stay in the true-life
and go with the developers rigorous
process and spend some time with that
language it's not a matter of just
couple of months to understand properly
the syntax of programming language and
everything it takes years and that's the
truth now in case you think that this
video can be helpful for somebody that
make sure you share it with your friends
and I'll shortly catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
