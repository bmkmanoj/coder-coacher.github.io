learn code online dot n make sure you
visit our website for another amazing
trainings we have plethora of videos of
learned code online taught in and all
are amazing so let's get started and
continue with our JavaScript training
now in this video I want to talk about a
subject which I have been avoiding for a
little bit while because it's little bit
intimidating for new users but now
you're at a position that you can
totally understand that and can relate
with me and this is a very important
concept in JavaScript known as scope now
for a long time JavaScript has been like
not-so-favorite language for a variety
of programmers because of this scope
problem and you need to just get it
clear right now right here so let's talk
about that and before we even do that
and talk about all of that
I have made some customization to this
vs code for example when I type log and
hit tab it just completes a console dot
log saves me a little bit one second so
that I don't have to type that again and
again now I have also customized a
little bit of my terminal and it looks a
little bit easier for teaching purposes
now you don't need to do all of this
trainings and all of these settings if
you can just go ahead do that that's
also fine if you want me to make another
video on that that's also fine I can do
that not a big deal I just wanted to
mention them ok so now let's talk about
this subject which is scope and probably
will have two or three videos on this
curve a depends on how much we can
explain in one video so sometimes you
might have noticed that I have told you
that we are gonna be using two key words
here the lit for declaring our variables
and a Const for declaring our constant
but you might have noticed deliberately
I have some places I have used war here
so war you might have already guessed is
used for declaring available so what is
actually the difference between this let
and war and what is this concept whole
about this local scope and global scope
so let's discuss that first of all let's
discuss a variable or let's declare a
variable and that's gonna be called as I
am global to make sure that it just
shouts out that yes I am a global
variable so let's assign some value into
this global variable some value
literally and now understand so far we
have been declaring all of our
at the top of the file and that's not
usually always the case sometimes you
declare your available on the go and
that's also totally fine so let's just
have a true statement let's have an if
statement here and obviously it's
mentioned as true so definitely we are
gonna go inside this if statement and
here let's just say we want to print our
sum I am global here I am global there
we go
so what do you think what's going to
happen now let's just run this file
we're gonna say node and global I have
to go inside this zero to basics its
scope okay so node scoped rjs and there
we go we got some value so this is okay
this is fine we have no problem at all
but what happens when we have something
like this we say something like this let
and a V are gonna say I am local and we
get some more value into it okay now
let's just try to print that here and we
are gonna say I am local okay what is
going to happen now let's just run this
file and let's see that so we got some
value and some more value
okay completely acceptable we have no
problem at all so far now the problem
actually starts so when you write some
more code which is outside now notice I
mentioned that there is a block of code
and this is your block of code and this
is actually your scope now any variable
which is declared inside of this in
theories it should have only scope
inside this one so this means simply
when I try to access this variable on
local notice here this is not defined at
the top of the file or globally this
means that this is declared inside the
scope or this block of code so it's a
life period or its visibility is only
inside this block of code if I'm trying
to get here and try to have a log of
this I am local it should not be
accessible okay this is just to protect
some of the data because you have
declared it inside this block of code it
should only only remain there let's try
that and
what are the problems we are getting so
there we go we get an error that's good
because I am local and local is not
defined and that is absolutely fine this
is what we are expecting okay so far so
good
now what happens if outside this scope
I'm trying to access this on global no
problem since it's a global variable it
should be accessible anywhere inside the
scope and outside the scope as well
let's try that and we're gonna say I am
global there we go save that and let's
try to run that open the terminal clear
everything and run that again and notice
we still have a problem I am local so
what we need to do is we can comment
that out save that and can run our file
again there we go no problem at all
okay that is all good we have learned
and understood that yes there is a scope
here okay now comes up the tricky part
which is oops let me just uncomment that
now comes the tricky part what happens
if I read Eclair this variable I am
global here or try to reassign some
values here so let's just say instead of
this thing I'm gonna just put a comment
there and instead of that I am looking
for this global one or let me do it this
way let's just say this is being
declared and there is another I am
global and I reassign it to something
like Superman now what do you expect
what is going to happen okay and let me
show you this tricky part here we are
going to clear the screen we are going
to run that and notice that still I am
local is not defined so we we understand
that so let's just comment that save
that clear the screen and run that again
and there we go notice here we have got
first
I am global here so it is saying
Superman now now yes you'd completely do
understand that inside the scope you
have changed the global value so it's
completely accessible that means it's
changeable as well so you have changed
the value to Superman and you try to
print it out here okay you got your
Superman that's our line one here then
we are trying to print the local which
has a value of some more value so it has
got printed here but
since from the from the local scope or
global scope wherever you are changing
the value the change effects in
everywhere okay
and that is why when you try to access
this global outside the scope still the
value is changed very important concept
and everybody should pay really good
attention there okay that is all good
now things actually change a little bit
here okay now let me show you a couple
of interesting stuff non-load notice so
far you have tried to access this I am
local and without any doubt you always
have got an error and you have
understood the concept that yes when we
are trying to access anything which is
locally in the scope it is not allowed
it gives us an error and this is now the
version of the JavaScript that we are
learning has its facility here now
notice something strange here when I
change this let to war something
incredible and absolutely bad is going
to happen which is one of the reason why
some people used to hate JavaScript so
let's just say I have declared this
variable I am local I am expecting that
this is going to run only inside this
part and no matter what happens I should
not be able to get this value outside
but notice what happens when I use the
war keyword let's open this up and clear
everything we are expecting an error but
notice something strange happened so far
we have been getting error on this now
we are not getting error we are getting
actually the value so in this case
notice on the line number 3 we are
trying to access it so some more value
is being printed this shouldn't happen
but still this is happening this is one
of the leaked cases of the variables
which made JavaScript so much hateful
for a variety of programmers still there
are obviously workarounds to deal with
that but in the newer versions of
JavaScript it is really recommended that
you don't declare your variables using
war until unless you want to make them
completely global you should not be
doing it so in case you want to make it
like globally accessible from inside the
scope as well you can use war but it's a
better approach that you declare it
outside here in the global and global
space but if
you want something to be restrained to
your scope only then use the lat
so I hope you have got the clear-cut
concept that why we are using let and
not the war in case we use the war what
are the problems that can occur okay so
this is all about your basic
understanding of your scope but there is
a little bit more concept about variable
leaking and stuff like that so there is
a little bit more that we need to
discuss about the parent-child
relationship of these Global's and the
local scope so that is all clear and in
the next video we are going to be
exploring this parent-child relationship
and these global and local environment
and things will get more clearer as we
move forward in this series so that's it
for this video and I'm gonna catch you
up in the next one for sure and of
course don't forget to visit learn code
