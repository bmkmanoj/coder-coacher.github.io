online and of course your YouTube
programming friend so in this video
we're gonna be keeping the camera in
here my screens are actually here yes
you are noticing what there is my
youtube super play button
I'm still looking forward that when I'll
be actually saying oh we're having an
unboxing video for that but anyways
let's get started back onto our
JavaScript sometime it's really good to
talk to you guys like that so what we'll
be doing in this series we will be
getting started and talking about the
Trello so the previous Trello what we
designed was pretty bad and it's just
like version 1 it's always gonna be bad
so what we'll be doing in this video is
we'll be updating our Trello so that it
can maintain kind of a meeting schedules
for us and you'll be learning some of
the very important concepts in this
video especially sometimes the logical
flow and I'm pretty sure only a few of
you are going to be able to catch that
flow so there's gonna be a mistake
that's gonna come up in here and I am
gonna give you some time to figure that
out so rest of you follow up your code
editor and let's write some awesome code
here so we will be using all of our
knowledge what we have gained so far in
the course starting with the object so
this time Trello is gonna be held in 3
things for me first is day the second is
one how many meetings I have today and
how many meetings I have done already
ok so let's just start that and what
should I call this as I'm gonna call
this as my two dues that's nice and
there we go so first and foremost it's
gonna hold a day for me should I use
caps maybe not
day and then we are gonna have a day
let's start with the bad day which is
Monday I don't like them and then we are
gonna have something like meetings or
meetings is fine
meetings is zero and let's call this as
me done and me done is also gonna get
started with zero and of course don't
forget the comment here now sometimes
people like to have a carmine here as
well that's by the way totally fine if
you don't put it at the last it's
completely okay I usually prefer to have
a last one because sometimes you go
ahead edit some stuff so it's good for
housekeeping purposes not compulsory
okay
now let's just have how we can have like
couple of functions which can help us to
add some meetings in here
all of that so the first function we are
gonna be creating is to add a meeting so
we're gonna be calling it as add meeting
and yeah that's fine
so function come on I can write function
and there we go so this is our basic
function here and all it does it's take
two parameter your object as a meeting
so let's just call this as simply to do
and a number it through which you can
add a meeting so we're gonna call this
as simply meet and it's gonna have a
zero initial value remember at the time
when I talked to you about how we can
have default parameters so if anybody
just fails to pass on anything it's
gonna get a zero here okay that's fine
and now what we can do is we can add
these things it doesn't have to return
anything it just needs to update our
object which is my to-do and that's
exactly what we'll be doing so we're
gonna be saying to this guy hey what you
can do is you can use your to do
whatever is being passed to you access a
method in that that says meetings and
what we'll be doing is to do dot
meetings and we'll be adding this meet
in here there we go now here's a quick
thing that you should always and always
keep in mind let's just say I access
this function and I just say add meeting
and I just pass on it to do here which
is my two dues and I get a number like
probably two meetings just like that now
one thing that you should keep in mind
always is whenever you're calling any
object a copy of object is not being
passed that's the most important thing
you should always keep in mind so when
you're saying that hey this might reduce
you're passing it through a function
you're actually passing this to do
you're not passing a copy of it you're
actually passing it itself so whatever
the changes you're gonna be making it's
gonna be done in the actual object not a
copy of it there are ways through which
you can handle and that is the reason
why we have a thing in an react that
says never mutate that state our Redux
are there so this is this can be a
common problem this can be a problem
good thing depends on your situation but
again you just wanted to make sure you
understand that whatever you're passing
in here you are actually passing it it's
not a copy being given okay so that is
being clear let's delete that
okay so a dove meeting is done so we're
gonna have something known as add
meeting is done the next thing that
we'll be doing is meeting done so let's
call it as me done and we are gonna have
a simple function come on simple
function obviously it's gonna take two
parameter which is gonna be to do and
then also meet and that's gonna have a
zero initial value there we go now
obviously what we want to do is to do
dot meet done there we go and that we're
gonna do is meeting is gonna keep track
of how many meetings are there and me
done is how many I have done so
obviously it makes sense if I just say
something like to do dot meet done and I
need to subtract my meet here that's
that's good meet okay so the two
functions are defined I also need a
reset once so I'm gonna say reset day
and that is also gonna have function it
doesn't need to take anything I guess it
can just take it to do and just reset
everything based on to do dot meeting
meetings come on meetings there we go
and set it to zero since we are
manipulating the direct object that's
fine and we can also say to do dot meet
done that is also going to be 0 so reset
is fine and now the last thing we need
to do is get a summary of the whole day
so we're gonna say lit get summary off
day something like that and we're gonna
have a function and that function is
gonna take obviously a to do we don't
need to pass on anything else I guess
and we are gonna simply return now
before returning we want to do
calculation that how many meetings are
still left for you so obviously it makes
sense here that you do something like
meetings and me done some operations
with that so what we'll be doing is
we're gonna be saying let meet meet left
meet left it doesn't sound really good
names here I'm using but anyways meet
left is going to be equal to obviously
it says
meetings - how many meets I have done so
to do dot meetings is gonna be simply -
but to do dot meet done done there we go
so I think that's good and we're gonna
be simply return simple take coats and
the statement exactly what we are with
leaving is your you have - number of
meetings for today so you have and then
how many numbers of meetings today and
an exclamation sign is fine okay and
what we need to pass on here is meet
left okay so there we go here is our
function and just to remind you quickly
we have already done a mistake that I
was asking you to find it out I'm gonna
run it will walk you through with that
exact mistake and you have to catch it
up apart from any typos that I've made
that mistake is already being done
deliberately
of course so what we'll be doing is now
you can simply call up this object
through like add meetings so let's just
do that we're gonna call this as add
meeting it requires two parameter to be
passed on will be saying my two dues and
let's just say I have I'm gonna start
with four meetings okay and then
probably and meeting one more time I got
new meetings I always get these meetings
a lot so my to do is and let's just say
I got three more I actually made it to
here too
that's fine and now I have done some
other meeting so I'm gonna say meet done
it requires two parameters again which
is my two dues and let's just say I have
done five meeting that's a good number
and finally I want to get a summary of
the entire day so we're gonna call this
as get summary of day it requires my two
dues okay now when another when we are
gonna run this function you're gonna see
couple of things which are not expected
let me show you why is that so when I
run something like this node Trello
version two nothing is printed that was
not expected because I didn't logged out
anything so I'm gonna say something like
this I'm gonna say log and I'm gonna
move it here cut that paste it in here
save that I'm expecting results at this
time so there we go it's a is 11 meeting
today so where is the problem and this
is a common problem which a lot of time
new programmers fell into so we are
doing a minus here from the meeting why
is it not getting - here now the problem
here is not a programming problem it's a
logical flow problem and I think
everybody should be aware of these kinds
of problems so that is why I am
discussing them here I felt a scenario
like this so I think you should discuss
that now the problem is we are having a
meeting so we are having a petting a
meeting notice here we got started from
zero here from the meeting so it got me
meeting here and that number is
increasing that's fine now in here when
we are saying me done we are updating a
variable which is me done and the meet
done right now is at a position zero so
when we are subtracting the meet done is
actually at a negative number okay and I
can verify that simply by logging this
before we get a summary of that let's
have the object itself which is my two
do's save that and now let me clear the
screen and run that notice we have
Monday meeting C 6 but the me done is at
minus 5 okay so what we need to do when
we are calculating this summary here we
were actually subtracting it me done
which is common for most of the
programmers but what we are actually
doing is we are starting both from 0 1
is going on to totally negative side
because this is how we have designed the
program and 1 is going to Italy on the
positive side so although this approach
is totally fine all we need to do while
the end of the day when we are
calculating this summary we need to do
is an addition of it because negative
positive you got the point so this is
now a logical flow here and when now we
are gonna get the summary of this we are
gonna get like we have one meeting so
this is common problem a logical issue
which everybody phase there is nothing
to be shy about it
programmers learn by their mistakes
giggle flow sometimes you'll have
logical problems sometimes like your
code might have some errors and all of
that by the way I do have some time
habit of putting these semicolons you
don't need them if you put them that's
fine too later on we're gonna figure it
out that how you can work on strict
modes and all of that but again
everything will come eventually so I
hope you have enjoyed this Trello
version too as we will be progressing in
this course the Strela will becoming
keep becoming advanced in advance like
that so that's it for this video and I
hope you are enjoying this series if yes
