cryptography course and as promised I
will walk you through very gradual level
in this cryptography course so let's get
started before getting into the
definitions of theoretical or Wikipedia
definition of waters cryptography let's
try to understand what is the importance
of cryptography what are the keywords
that we are going to explore in this
course and some other things so first of
all let us try to answer the very simple
question what is cryptography so let's
get started so cryptography is really
very interesting science of information
security the word cryptography is
derived from the Greek word cryptos
meaning hidden cryptography is not alone
world or one world for all related
information security science words like
crypt analysis cipher cryptology or
maybe cybersecurity are always included
in this science cryptography includes
techniques such as micro dots merging
words with images and other ways to hide
information in storage or maybe in
transit however in today's computer
centric world cryptography is most often
associated with the plaintext which is
just an ordinary text sometime referred
to as clear text also so we want to
convert this plaintext into the
ciphertext and then back again into the
plaintext now the process by which we
create the scrambled text or not
readable text from the plaintext is
known as the encryption and the reverse
process is known as the decryptions
individuals who practice this fields are
known as cryptographers there is also a
word crypto systems which you'll see
quite a lot in this video course
so procedures in protocols that are used
in cryptography makes up a system that
is known as crypto system crypto system
are mostly referred as computer programs
or protocols but I would like to extend
it to a much much wider plot
in the later videos of course it also
include human behaviors such as social
engineering which is still one of the
fastest technique to compromise a system
or application things like choosing
typical password logging of a new system
protecting sensitive files also plays a
vital role in the cryptography because
it's all about security although it is
considered that first use of modern
cryptography was made by Julian Caesar
who actually did not trusted his
messenger when communicating with the
governor's but personally I think the
need of encryption came in high demand
after the invention of radio as one can
tune into your frequency range and
intercept your message but if the
transmission is encrypted then things
will get changed in recent time
cryptography has turned into a
battleground of world's best
mathematician and computer scientist the
ability to securely store and transfer
sensitive information has proved a
critical factor in success in war and of
course nowadays war is known as business
to understand more about cryptography
let's call our friend Alison Bob who are
going to remain with us in the entire
series now Alice wants to transfer some
information to Bob but wants to do it
securely Alice decided that instead of
transferring information in clear text
form I'll encrypt this information with
some algorithm and key and later all
I'll discuss what does algorithm what is
key and all those factors you don't have
to worry Don have to worry about that so
let's take a simple example that how the
Alice wants to do work and how the Bob
want to do it the work so let's say we
have got our friend Alice here so this
is our friend Alice and this is our
friend Bob here now Alice has the piece
of text which she wants to transfer and
let's say the text is ABC so she decided
that I won't be transferring the plain
text to the Bob because if anyones drops
into
the network here which is going to be
Eve which stands for the East dropping
if someone gets the East dropping then
entire text is going to be readable
instead she decided that I'm going to
encrypt the text with applying some
encryption and using the key I'll denote
the key with the K and encryption with
the E and let's say the text obtained is
some in the form of zero one zero one
one zero one zero maybe a nothing like
that and then this text is being
transferred to it and now Bob can read
this text again but there are a few
conditions which you should take care of
it now the condition is Bob should have
the decryption algorithm which is just
reverse of the encryption also Bob
should have the same key or some
considerable key which can decrypt the
message back and these are the must
condition for the cryptography to happen
and in the later phase I will discuss
more about what are the keys what are
the encryption techniques what are the
possible flaws that can be created into
the these things so the two major
problem are secure transfer of key and
knowledge about algorithm things like
degree of complexity of algorithm and
its randomness also plays a vital role
in cryptography so this course is going
to be detailed overview of all such
things that can possibly happen in the
cryptography so that's all for this
video and keep sharing the videos of the
cryptography with your friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
