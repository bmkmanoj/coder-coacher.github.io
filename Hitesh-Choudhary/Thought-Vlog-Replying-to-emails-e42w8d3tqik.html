with another video now you might be
noticing that things are really changed
in this video no I'm not getting rid of
that other setup that's that's going to
be there but for some of the movies i'll
be keeping this setup and especially for
the thought velox and you might be
asking what all those thought v logs so
thought veelox are something like video
logs but no I'm not going to be doing
like Casey's or something like that it's
gonna be much more technical replying to
the questions replying to the emails and
sometimes I get some thoughts that I
really need to share it with you and I
feel that I should share it with you so
that's going to be all about it so let's
get started with this very first thought
be loud so let's start our very first
thought we log and the reason why I'm
starting with this thought we log that I
haven't replied to a lot of female in
the last couple of weeks or last one
week actually and I was about to reply
to those email and at that moment I
thought that I can do much better
because I believe if somebody has taken
some time to write the emails I think it
deserves much some of my time at least
and that's the most valuable thing one
can give to anyone so I'm going to be
giving you my personal time here and
i'll be answering all of your mails even
if the question has been repeated in the
past I'll again try to take down your
questions again with different
perspective here and also in the future
movies I'm going to be talking about a
lot of things because I somehow feel
that I need to share a few things my
thoughts on some technology some latest
mobile release or maybe just on how the
technology and how the people are going
into one direction and is it good is it
bad and a lot of things like that now
the reason why I like to share all of
these things because my words sometime
inspire people and I'm not looking to
inspire hundred people or 100,000
peoples are just like that I'm looking
for that one person who takes my word
and is somehow getting trying to live a
better life whether he is trying to
learn code or just trying to live a
happy life somehow my words matter to
that one person so I'm all I'm looking
for is that one
person who is gonna live better life
because somehow I was able to inspire
him and that's okay for me that's
completely okay I'm not looking for in
spreading 200,000 people's there but
again if my words matter to even one
person I'm gonna do it so let's get
started here in today's vlok first of
all you might have seen the setup maybe
someday we can do a set up about my this
small room here so this is my desk I
usually work here I love to work here
there is another desk in another room
where I do all of my project work and
everything but recording stuff is always
and always have been here and I do
record some of the screencast another
room maybe someday I'll give you a tude
of my home as well and now most of the
time in fact seventy percent of the time
I am working from here apart from on
sites and some time I have to travel so
in this video we'll be answering the
emails so a lot of you might already
have got the link of this video through
the email because all the person who
have sent me the email on the pillow
email id you might be seeing it here so
i'll be answering all of your questions
live here not only answering i'll be
proving my thoughts as well so let's
start here with no particular order so
first of all there is a email by rishabh
so it says hey I have lost all your
videos and it's really nice and the
important part is here how much time do
you spend learning the technical skills
and how you manage to get so much time
to learn so much skills here ok resume
that's that's the question that I get
quite a lot like how much time I do
spend on learning because I have to
teach as well now the number one part of
every teacher is learning if he cannot
keep continuing with the learning pace
he cannot be a good teacher in in the
modern age actually so imagine if a
teacher he is good in maybe c or c++ now
now student to learn much more they want
to learn advanced things like javascript
or maybe Python or Ruby and somehow
people like the way that the teacher
teach so he has to somehow go into the
learning phase create some projects some
minor projects and then
understand what's inside there and teach
that in such a simple manner that the
student understand that so taking back
on to your question I do spend a lot of
time on learning because I am a man who
is highly focused on time management
skill I I read a lot about time
management skill how I can update my
time scales and everything every single
day that helps me to manage my time and
in fact to be honest the very first
thing that I do in the morning is
checking all the emails and the very
last thing that I do I was going onto
the bed is spending at least one hour
and that's on the least site in learning
the new things I watch a lot of videos
because I have found that video
education is one of the most powerful
and easiest and fastest way to learn so
every single day while going before to
the bed I don't check my facebook I
don't check my email I just focus on
watching a few videos yes I do watch a
lot of YouTube videos to that helps me
to learn a lot in fact I have learned
quite a lot about video filming editing
process like that so just make sure you
do it every day because it's not
important that how much time you spend
it's more important that you do it
regularly whether you spend one hour a
day let's do it regularly because end of
the month you will be having 30 hours of
learning that's that's important and
that's very huge so spend irregularly
whatever you are doing and that's that's
the main goal here and this is why i
like to do stuff on the video because
replying to the email is good but that's
blank even you cannot put emojis like
your whatsapp or your viber you cannot
put that so i think it's more important
that you get connected with me you buy
these emails in everything the next
email is from Vasu and says so you can
suggest me some projects in image
processing networking for my final year
i am from CSE background and doing
engineering from niit nit srinagar but
i'm not able to find a good project if
you have some suggestions related to
machine learning or at either feel that
would also work now this is again some
one of the very common question i will
be answering it but you will find the
answer by yourself now when i try to
learn anything I first try to
see that what I'm going to be doing
after learning it for example I am
learning the time management skill I
always see what i am going to be able to
achieve after learning the time
management will I be able to manage time
better or whether I'll be able to live
my life happily or maybe if I am
learning Swift what I'll be able to do
after Swift so I was having already an
idea of a game or maybe an app that i
really want to design Swift is just a
tool for that or maybe android java is
just a tool for that because i wanted a
product that was my passion i wanted to
design that and that's exactly the goal
of learning programming it's not about
learning swift java or maybe javascript
or anything it's about the product what
you want to do maybe you want to design
websites for people maybe you want to
design apps for people or maybe for
yourself that's all about it so whether
you are learning it such a great topic
like image processing or networking or
something make sure that you have a
passion for that topic and how are you
going to build the passion because you
have no idea how how you're going to be
moving into the field you have no idea
what the project you are going to be
building so why actually you are
learning the technology I have no idea
why are doing so you should try to ask
yourself what am I going to be doing
after learning this and that's where you
answer but again are coming back on to
your question you can work on various
image processing things like specially
on the satellites one where people can
find out if there is some tsunami waves
or something what are the signatures of
that so yes projects can be done on the
image processing but I don't believe
that I'm a good person to suggest you of
course I can do but why should I it
should be you should have passion for
some project and you should decide by
yourself so I hope that helps quite a
lot but again feel free to drop me
another email we may discuss it and then
there is an email from IT engineer and
it says hello there sir I'm computer
engineer and graduate in 2016 I got a
job as a search engine optimization I
want to know is there any scope or
growth in SEO field in India ok let's
get clear here there is no scope in SEO
there is no scope in Swift there is no
scope in JavaScript there is no scope in
Java there is no scoop in PHP even they
is a no scope in becoming a prime
minister of any country it's what you
create scopes are created by yourself
it's it's never there there are never
opportunities you create your own
opportunities there as use I have seen
many people i personally know them that
have have done pretty much tremendously
in the SEO field and they are earning
pretty much like five hundred dollars a
week and that's that's huge that's
actually good so and i have seen also
people who are having master degrees a
good knowledge of the java and can
design decent android apps and are
roaming here and there to ask and
searching for the jobs so it depends on
how you utilize your time how you
approach to the client how you explore
yourself and explore the world
opportunities everything so i don't get
the point why people always get worried
about is there is scope for something is
no scope for anything and there is a
scope for everything so make sure that
you understand the point here that
whatever you are doing if you are doing
it passionately there is a scoop for
everything and search engine
optimization to be honest on to other
side bar part it's a good thing if you
are able to do some good practices not
the black hat SEO kind of stuff with
automation of the tunes I'm not talking
about that but yes you can do pretty
much good thing there I believe that so
I hope I answered your question as well
let's go back and then there is a email
offs tooth is Roy hi I'm a big fan of
yours and all i watch all of your videos
thank you so much for that I always
appreciate that you inspired me to learn
coding but now I want to make an appt
but I don't know where to I get started
so I was thinking of you could help me
and I live in America that's good this
is the email that I was looking for
because you have already a passion you
want to design an app you might be
already having an idea that let's just
say my app is going to be a to-do app
that camera or something so you have a
goal and that's the toughest part
believe me so you have sorted out your
big problem now you have to decide
either one of the two things so you want
to design an app for Android or you may
want to design
app for iOS platform or Windows platform
or maybe you want to go into hybrid app
development so you have to design with
decide with that but again since you are
in the US I believe there is a good
market there for iOS apps and i'll link
down in the description below a very
good awesome killer boot camp of my iOS
course i believe after taking this
course you won't ever need any kind of
course and you will be completely happy
with that you'll be able to design your
app so this is for use to thee and make
sure you check down the description
below let's go back and let's talk about
cus to Java I hope I am NOT butchering a
lot of names I'm not good in Spelling's
in pronunciation there but again I am
trying my best stay focus there okay so
it says I want to learn iOS app
development currently I am working as
Dortmund developer if you are teaching
the Swift kindly let me know and that's
good good email i'll for sure reply you
with the email as well but again again
you can check down the same link yes I
do teach Swift so you can check down the
description below and since you are
already a dot net developer I believe
you'll pick that very very quickly every
programming experience that you are
having in any other language always
helps you to move and switch into other
language so I believe you will be
quickly able to go with that and that's
all about it you are pretty much sorted
out by yourself that's that's great
actually let's go back so Salim and
hitesh i am i'm raja from tamil nadu
recently watch your videos on youtube
all the videos are so nice what we get
to need to particular language is there
there is no necessary to basic language
like c c++ to learn properly you go to
web development you need to focus on I
guess what he is trying to ask I am MSC
grad to graduate but still no language
no one language in expert in it okay i'm
having a tough time here but i'm trying
my best nearly I complete a degree for
year ago but I am still hungry for the
right career in it watching your videos
motivated me so I decided completely to
learn under web development what are the
carrier opportunities for web developer
still I was four-year gap and it will I
face any difficulty get to get a job I
can understand your situation because
once you complete your graduation or
master graduation it's pretty much stuff
to spend life with that but again you
should have opted it a pretty very very
soon but again there is there is no time
lost in whenever you get started that's
that's the best thing so you have got
started with the web development i think
you have done a pretty good choice there
because web development is one of the
field which is very fastly growing will
ever be growing because there will be
always websites coming up there will be
always business coming up and the one
great part about the web development is
it doesn't require a formal degree it
requires what are the projects that you
have done how much complex project you
have done and just show us the portfolio
so your degrees and everything will may
surely help but they are not much there
they they may just get you a pass on to
a door that's it after the interview and
in the interview you will have to show
the potential employee that I have done
this project this project and for that
you don't need to go anywhere just
decide a project yourself hey I'm going
to building this this this and that and
just create that so that's a good thing
and I believe within six month you can
get ready as a decent programmer and you
can apply for a junior at least
front-end developer that's that's the
easiest part to get started in case you
are facing any problem or something i'll
link down in the description below a
great killer course on the front-end
development and i believe that's the
only thing that you need to take so i
guess you can get started but again a
scope why's everything as a scope just
make sure before you go to any potential
employer and everything you just create
a number of projects at least five to
ten of more than ten that would be
helpful so create those project and
whenever you approach somebody you just
show them not your degree but your
project that hey these are the ten
projects that i have done and see the
complexity there see the design see the
graphics and everything that i have
learned and do you have a job for me I
believe everybody would be ready to hire
such a programmer who just stands on his
work and not on the degrees so that's
for you Salim Raja good to have you now
I got a lot of females so
this is gonna be a big big big video so
Myrtle says the couple i want to be a
programmer in android in java what
should I start to do for better tomorrow
okay as I said in one of the previous
moments there in this video only the
only thing that's stopping you to learn
Java is that beep reason that you are
trying to give yourself every single
time so if you are so much clearer that
you want to learn Java you want to learn
android you want to design an app I
believe what's what's stopping you I
have no idea what should i do what
should I start with today for better
tomorrow start with the portfolio design
at least 10 apps so that you can have
better future that's going to give you
income from the app store or what they
call it app store no Google Play yep so
launch them on the google play and show
them to the potential employee if you
want to work for them go ahead put that
portfolio on the freelancer website if
you are looking for some freelancer
projects or something so what you need
to do to get better tomorrow start
working start working hard today that's
gonna make your tomorrow better so
moving on there is an Amazon my email I
might have ordered something i'll show
you what i have ordered it's a good
thing so it's from NM and I believe he's
from some another country but I no idea
so hello dash I have watched all your
tutorials videos and I liked all of them
thank you so much I always appreciate
that and wanted to know if you have any
patent stuff that could help with pen
test let me know the price too for sure
there's going to be a special price for
you so since you have kept me a sent me
an email I'll give you a personal a link
for that course as well but again i'll
put that in the description below as
well make sure you check it out so let's
go back and then we do have an email
from an of sri i guess i'm getting
trouble in saving ns3 i'm not going to
be taking the ns3 troubles in any of the
video for couple of movies here i know i
get almost every single time i get
messages and email from minus 3i have
different plans for ns3 but right now I
don't want to get into it so sorry for
that I'm not gonna be taking ns3 queries
right now okay so god of s shitty hello
sir i am currently working as a video
editor but I want to make career in IT
field so I'm confused like what which
coach should I take now again if you're
already into the video that's that's
actually good you are already having a
good job but again it's your choice you
want to get started with IT then there
are a lot of things in the itv make sure
you do a little bit more research
because I t is such a vast topic
everything is information security so
you need to understand what you are
looking for they're like for example if
I just say you want to go into the
networking maybe linux administration
web developer app developer penetration
tester so make sure you have a little
bit idea my channel have a lot of videos
about them so make sure you have a
little bit idea what a web developer
does maybe you want to design websites
may be front and maybe backend for
somebody so do a little bit more
research I t's such a vast field that I
cannot advise you much at this point of
time but again shoot me another email
when you want to more no more a little
bit about the details of particular
specific field so god of do a little bit
research okay Deepak be a okay now that
this is a big email hello bro hello bro
you too I am debug from Bangalore finish
my graduation in electronics oh that's
great i'm from electronics background
too but was interested in information
security Oh dushe so have enough
knowledge about information security
cyber security but I want to start my
career in information security field
don't know where to start I tried many
companies but all companies are asking
experience in this field but I am a
fresher hope you will assist me now one
of the great thing about the information
security in present era it used to be
tough in my time but now it's so much
easy to get started information security
is the bug bounty so if you have a
knowledge a lot of knowledge about the
web application or penetration testing
make sure that you hunt the bugs on our
websites like but crowd
or hacker one there are a lot of others
as well but make sure you hunt the bugs
there once you have found the works just
report them and they will give you some
time acknowledgement some money some
certificates and everything and once you
have a built up a portfolio like I have
reported a ten bucks or twenty bucks
that's it there you go there you have
your experience so that's one way of
getting started and get quick experience
with that and that is the reason why a
lot of companies are asking for
experience because you get experience
now with those websites bug bounties and
but crowd and hacker wanna like that but
again another way is to get started with
the up work as well of work has some
pretty good and decent project of the
pen testing I in fact do get a lot of
from there as well I like those projects
so that's one way of getting started do
some freelancing and the cybersecurity
projects are always fun so I hope I
answered your query okay deeper let's go
back and now there is another email and
you might be thinking that hey this man
haven't replied to the emails quite in a
while but again this is pretty newly I
just last week email only sir I am
animesh and image from India of West
Bengal okay lovely place sir I'm a
computer science student I have a
request please suggest me some books
through which I can learn programming
languages like Python JavaScript PHP
Java SQL so you want to learn quite a
lot and books yes books are always great
you can find a lot of kindle on amazon i
personally prefer packet books because i
have worked there with them in the past
and i like their way how they try to
describe everything in the books how the
rigorous process is there and the
practicality they try to show in the
technical book so I like packet books
that's my personal ones so go ahead look
for the pact packet whatever they call
that a link that website in the
description below so you can have a look
on the books but again a books only are
not a good way of learning support that
with some video course support that with
some books some practical examples some
of your quick project so that's that's
actually a quick way to learn you can
just finish up a video course within two
or three days quickly just going through
it then open up a book try to get some
from
into it then design a project that's
actually a good way and fastest way to
learn I hope I answered your question
animesh from West Bengal you are from a
lovely place okay let's go here and the
mid 390 okay hello I've asked half of
your courses uh with a friend okay so
you borrowed the course I don't mind
that now I registered my own account
trying to watch it it tells me to enroll
the course again youtube videos are
private too i'm trying to contact with a
site but contact doesn't would maybe
some more professional content like this
okay so you want to access my content
and yes what I'll be doing I'll be
sorting out all those issues that you
are seeing on the platform I'll be
putting and hosting all the things
another platform I'll reply you with a
personal email but again keep shooting
me the emails that you have got it or
not I'll work out on that that's on the
technical and I have to worry about this
is not at all a query at all okay and
then we have Zack Jack not the back Jack
Lynch hello my name is Jack and I
recently got across your YouTube video
youtube videos I was hoping you would be
able to provide some type of insight on
pen testing and hacking I'm a junior in
high school with a lot of ambition and
very interested in the security sector
and want to learn more maybe start
learning about the bug bounty program
hopefully you can help me any respond
would be greatly appreciated okay Jack I
have something good and killer coming up
in this Jan you would be surprisingly
happy with the mid of the chain that I'm
about to launch something pretty cool
that is going to teach all all of the
about the bug bounty tricks and
everything like about web application
penetration testing I cannot release
more more information other than this
that it's going to be coming up in the
mid of the jam so you have to wait a
little bit key following keep the
subscribe button hitting and i'll for
sure come up with in around 15 or 16 of
the gen that's the plan data as of now
but again a few days here and there but
again something is coming up and you
won't ever face any problem after that
so you will be pretty much happy with
that so Jack keep in touch and make sure
that you have a touch there because I'm
coming up with your solution so series a
series of Zen okay I am a big nerd in
web development I am a third year b.tech
CSE student can you help I chemically
seduce the sequence of the technology to
learn both frontin and back and in order
to develop a good website with a solid
back end Kenny also suggest me some
online courses in good free coding
platform an IDE to practice and
implement web development ok you want to
know more about the web development
details let find it out so web
development is a very good domain and
let's get started with the web domain so
in order to learn the web domain the
strategy for the front end is always
very simple first you want to get your
hands on a very good editor now yes
that's that's the basic first start and
i recommend the modern editors not the
notepad or the G edit or the text edit I
recommend Adam or maybe brackets or
something like that again both of them
are free and bracket is one of my
favorite ones so after that you want to
get your hands with HTML CSS and that's
it that's that's it for now and after
you have got your hands on HTML CSS go
ahead and design at least two or three
single one page website after that try
to add some more features using
javascript and jquery and you might want
to learn the bootstrap as well because
it's now at demand there and by the way
i'll link down in the description about
a killer bootstrap course only course
you'll need for the bootstrap and once
you have the bootstrap knowledge then
for sure you'll be able to make sure
that your website is responsive for the
mobile interface as well after that
going into the back end is little bit of
a choice you may go on to the node GS
side or you may want to go into the PHP
side and for sure later on i'll be doing
a video comparing the node GS and the
PHP because i can understand as a
beginner it's pretty much a tough
decision to find out whether i should go
on the PHP or noches so for sure i'll be
doing a later on a video on that right
now just do a little bit research and
try to find out where you want to go and
i'll surely shoot up another video for
PHP vs
genius what should be the bigness we're
doing so i hope syriza send this helps
you quite a lot in getting started and
by the time you will be moving on to the
javascript and everything the video will
be already there okay so just a few more
emails that we have to answer so this is
from the owa SP Academy from anelia I'll
work out on that later on this is not
should be opened upon that's why I don't
show up my screen that I'm opening the
emails i am just reading them out so IT
engineer again hello there sir first of
all thank you for making video and how
to learn programming and get confidence
in it okay thank you so much i like it i
appreciate that all the time this video
really built my confidence of learning
programming language once again thank
you so please make video on how to face
interview how to prepare for technical
interview maybe that's again going to be
in my to-do list but a little bit lower
on the lower side for sure we will do it
so you can request your videos as well I
keep my journal just there and I know
down all the things here so that I can
later on make up the videos on that so a
final one is also from the IT engineer I
am a graduate in computer science I want
to improve my programming skills for
that what should i do I choose to I
choose Java to learn I've already
started to learn job but I'm not
confident you will never ever faced conf
feel confident in any programming
language until analyst you do one
project at least one project on your own
that's not a project that somebody is
teaching you on the online course that's
not the project that somebody is
teaching you on the offline course
that's not but that's a good power point
of getting started so the the moment
you'll get the confidence is going to be
the project whether it's a simple
calculator app but the moment you will
design your own things completely by
yourself by looking and solving the
problem on the stack overflows opening
the books referring to the online course
and everything do it yourself that
movement you will be getting the
confidence so pretty simple no big deal
there so finally I have answered all of
my emails as of now just two of them
up now but again maybe later on do some
videos on that this was a pretty good
v-log I'll break them into the two parts
will be seeing part 1 and part 2 because
the video is pretty much long but again
I hope a lot of you enjoyed a lot there
and try to get some knowledge from it
that was all my good and with this I'll
catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
