with another video and the topic of
today's video is a little bit
controversial again just like we have
done in the previous videos about the
Kotlin java fight and a lot of people
who love java came after me
but hold on people hold on people let me
give me some time to clear up the things
in the air now I understand it created a
little bit of the confusion that people
were facing that should we stop learning
Java now or not Java will be dead or not
I would clear up all these things in
here just to remind you and quickly here
Java will not be dead you can still do
Android development on Java and will be
able to do that in future as well but
there is a little bit more things that
you need to know and specially how you
can proceed in learning Android
development in 2017 after Google i/o so
let's clear up all the things all of
your doubts in this video again and
first row that it
now I know a lot of you are big Android
fan and want to become an Android
development in this video I'll give you
three major parts by which you can
proceed in learning Android development
okay three major parts
there can be other side paths as well on
which you can yell at me at the comment
section below I would be waiting for
them where the first and the foremost
part that most people will be opting
will be on the Java now Google i/o says
that will be supporting Coughlin's but
this doesn't means they have said we are
obsoleting the Java although I assume
and a lot of people are saying this that
they are trying to push now a little bit
out of the frame
but still they haven't said that we will
be deprecating Java and I never said
that that the people are defecating Java
in the future they are trying to get it
out of the frame but not yet so in the
upcoming future three four five years we
can see that still Java will be there
and the number one way of getting
started in the Java is into the Android
is learn the Java and get into Android
development now I would also like to add
that Java can be learned directly you
don't need C C++ or anything for that
you can directly get started with Java
now point number two if you want to get
started with Android development learn
Catalan and again you don't need to
learn Java or C or C++ for the Kotlin
you can directly get started with the
Catalan and can make Android apps now I
have been doing this for quite a lot and
the Catalan code is completely
interoperable with Java and they are
complete completely interchangeable with
a right-click just like that you can
change your Catalan code into Java and
Java into the Catalan so this is also
possible and that is wait number two the
way number three by which you can get
started making Android app is why
JavaScript now okay I understand you
will be putting a lot of comment in the
comment section below saying that hey
with JavaScript you only create
highbreed apps
nobody with the Java Script you can
create full native apps and in fact for
most of the my apps that I deliver to
the client is being made in the react
native just to give you a little bit
more information react ativ is kind of a
project being launched by the face
and it uses JavaScript and specially es6
features the pac-man script 16 features
in the JavaScript so the V number three
is you can get started with JavaScript
and can take your web skills into making
Android apps wire react native okay so I
hope this clears up your doubt about
should we stop doing Java or not no you
don't need to do that if you are
learning it from anywhere or from learn
code online or wherever you are learning
I'll never say that learn from only one
way wherever you can learn it just go
ahead learn it offline online the point
should be you should be learning so
let's clear up and summarize the things
in here that Java is not going anywhere
but this is also a fact that the
community is trying to move towards the
Catalan the base fund out moving towards
the Catalan is really simple we want to
use the major feature and advantage of
both the languages we want to use the
power of Java as well as the more
detailed complexity of cottle and we can
combine that simply by using Coughlin's
there okay so they'll need to worry
about you can continue with the training
in the Java as well you will be still
able to make Android apps in the Java
but let me add this in here this can be
controversial but let me add in there
that in the future there will be going
to be a huge demand of Catalan people
because just this announcement in the
Google i/o that we will be officially
supporting the Catalan that means yes it
has created the demand of Catalan people
so learning just the Java for Android is
not going to be working in the future
because you will have to work in the
companies on Coughlin's file as well so
you have to learn Java and Android on
side by side bar you have to learn
Catalan as well okay and the way number
two is simply by just learning Catalan
and design Android apps and vey number
three is simply by going into the Java
Script learned react native and can
create Android and iOS app native apps
in there
okay so I hope this video helps you to
clear a lot of your diets and also have
figure you have figured out now how you
can learn Android
and can proceed into your future path
but again all these three languages can
be learned separately without the help
of any other languages so don't just
forget about the things that hey this
language is the mother of this language
and you have to learn this language
before learning this language most of
the language are completely independent
and no need to learn C C++ if your goal
is just to go into Android start with
the Java or start with the Cortland or
start with the JavaScript and they will
take you all towards the Android
development so this is all for this
video and I'll catch you up in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
