another video now in this video you can
see the setup is a little bit different
because I'm gonna be working on my
computer as you might have already
guessed and recently I got a request
from mr. Vargas I know him from one of
my workshop he was a student that time
and he has created something cool and he
he thought that uh he should share it
with me and it's really nice first of
all that whether the product is good or
not but something that he has designed
and he is trying to present it to the
world that's actually a nice thing I
like it and if you have something that
you have designed or created and want me
to talk about it in public I would be
glad to do so and by the way I don't
charge anything for such services ok
this is completely honest and pure
without any services charging or stuff
like that ok so what he has design so in
his own words hi my typing volt is doing
great got some serious visitors and I
got small donation to typing Bolcom can
you please make a review about it on
your YouTube channel why not this is why
I have designed this YouTube channel
this is the whole agenda here going on
I'll find something I'll talk about it
I'll clarify your questions and I'll
give some information here that's that's
the whole motive here so let's try to
open up in my browser by the way if you
are looking for this add-on in the
chrome that's momentum I highly
recommend that keeps me motivated keeps
me focused and shows me some good place
to travel I like it I like it like it
like it a lot
so let's just open it and it's typing
bolt calm and there we go ok the first
thing that I noticed is the marvelous
color scheme I like it I like it I have
no idea about the working of this or not
but I like it the color scheme is really
nice and we help you to practice every
day enable notification so that's how
they are practicing so I think this is a
typing practice or something and this is
night zero words per minute accuracy is
zero percent of course I haven't taken
any test and why typing boat that's nice
pretty simple we want you to not look at
keyboard for typing okay so this is
somehow like there used to be a software
like typing master
Pro or something which everybody used
today used in their early days of the
computer and what it used to do is
simply help you to teach typing skills
now let me just confess that I'm not a
professional in typing but yes I do
pretty decent typing I would say I don't
type much that much because coders are
copy-paste errs and most of the time
there are helper functions you just
press control space it suggests you
function and there you go so powered by
bolt AI now I like the name I like the
movie bolt if you haven't seen that it's
a great movie so I guess somehow it's
inspired by the bolt and AI I always
love a I they the predictions and all of
that going on I love that thing so
optimized for each user smart adaptive
UI so adaptive UI I'm impressed with
that how do you take that oh it's nice I
love the color scheme color scheme is
something that has impressed quite a lot
on this so there we go
copyrights and their terms and oh
there's a notification well subscribe to
notification okay
I'm not going to do that now right now
and they're good there we go practice
later boats let's see who is leading on
the leaderboard of this website
Alexander geo itself G choice itself is
semi-professional okay that's something
cool I don't think so if I can hit 94 96
percent of the accuracy with 119 words
per minute I'm pretty sure I cannot hit
that but maybe if I'll be staying on
this website maybe one day I can hit
that maybe okay so looks nice let's just
go on to the practice section and say
yep it changes the text every single
time that's that's nice
so it's selecting some random text from
somewhere it's doing that let's just
give it a try let me just see so what it
says it says a dish pop hit east ring
wall look a sock oops I'm troubling with
K I guess and it's going to be busy a
beam a tree main slow
and salt okay I know I did a pretty bad
job so 45 words per minute 93.1 accuracy
not bad
45 words per minute that's terrible
actually but accuracy is pretty decent
somehow my keyboard was far away I'm
making excuses you got that but I'm not
good that let's go onto the leaderboard
and see that if I get a 50 words almost
per minute so I'm rookie I'm rookie okay
that's there we go and what happens if I
log in with the Google Plus let's create
an account so what it's asking for email
address public info it's asking for my
profile picture full name and profile
URL okay I'm happy with that
so let's just allow that and the good
thing I like about it is something that
it's it is having a Google+ account and
I like it because you should have that
everybody should use Google accounts
Facebook account for verifying me and
instead of just writing my email and
everything again again so that's that's
nice let's click on the next place your
hand search teaches me hey you know you
have to hit the Babar's I don't do that
but I may try it I should try it and
follow the scheme there okay nice and
never look at the keyboard sometime I do
sometime I do peek a peek at my keyboard
so let's go and there we go now I do
have a profile word mansion maybe if
I'll spend a little bit time on this
website I may get better in case you are
big nerd and trying to or you're
struggling with your keyboard typing
skills I think this is pretty solid free
awesome cool looking and what what else
you can have it's it's having so much
good I like it I like it it's having a
my profile what's there in my profile
let me see that okay so top speed every
speed accuracy so pretty good data
collection it has taken my photo I
should change that I should use that
bearded photo I was having a beard
nice beard I I got rid of that let's
talk about about my beard someday else
but right now it's it's good it's having
a shear buttons that's nice nice effect
I like it I like it baby and how to type
in right now let me just log out and see
what if there is something log out page
now they don't have log out page they
just redirect back to they
next page but again I like it it's a
pretty good service and thumbs up for
that I would recommend that so in case
you're struggling video typing skills
there is no snow such good service I
guess and pretty much good with that
of course you can find hundreds of them
but I think it's nice UI design is very
sleek very awesome and I would recommend
it to all of you of course it's free you
should go ahead and check it out rich
nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
