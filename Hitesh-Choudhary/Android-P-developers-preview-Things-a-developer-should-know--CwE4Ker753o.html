code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey there everyone has
a share back again with another video
and in this video we are talking about
Android P Developer Preview so in case
you are not aware Android is finally out
with its new version which is P and
there are a lot of things which people
are assuming what does this P means but
by the side note here I would like to
mention that this is a Developer Preview
and only the people like you and me who
are developers it is meant only for that
so in case you are person who just likes
to watch tech videos and all those fun
stuff don't install that on your
smartphone it was never meant to be
installed on your smartphone unless and
until you are a developer there is
already an SDK so go ahead play around
with that in case you are not already
doing that but there is a lot more to
discuss about this Android P so first
let's get started
there are a lot of things that I really
want to talk about for this Android pee
developer release and I would like to
start with the fun stuff I would like to
start with what is B here in Android T
worsen now there is no official
statement what we are calling it as of
now it's in the total developer release
these things usually get releases in the
conferences but let's just assume some
some things here now I am pretty sure
it's gonna be Android buy but I honestly
wanted to be Android poppins
but moreover on that I wanted to be
Android pizza so the money is always on
the pizza I really wanted to be Android
pizza that would be really awesome and
completely different but I'm pretty sure
it's gonna be Android pie so coming back
on to the actual stuff why we are making
these videos which is to talk about
actual developer stuff for this Android
P first and foremost you don't need to
have a pixel device too if you want to
just enjoy and see how these things
actually looks like you can download
simply the Android studio 3.2 version
which supports Android P and can play
around with that and this is what every
developer is doing right now they are
just trying to have it write some code
and just try to enjoy it there a little
bit so go ahead and do that now moving
further after that let's talk about the
first very big feature in the Android P
which everybody is talking about
this feature is androids usage of Wi-Fi
round-trip time in simple words it's
simply the ability so that now if you
are even inside the mall you can have
much more detail about your location now
Google has been playing it around for
quite a while now and they have been
already doing it for various malls and
various famous buildings and all these
things so that they can determine even
the floors of these things so it would
be now coming up as for the public usage
as well so what is going to happen now
you will have one more line to add up in
your Android manifest file and you will
have to ask the user for its course
location and once you get that
permission you will be able to determine
a pinpoint precise location just like
you see in the movies so now if you are
inside a mall and the mall is like 1
kilometer long you can determine exactly
pinpoint which shop it is and even
furthermore if you are having a campus
drive of various companies coming around
it would be easier now to track location
of your friend if you are having some
kind of customized app for those kinds
of drives or campus Drive so you got the
point now you can find your friend even
inside the campus where he is so this is
going to be a really precise location
how is it going to drain the battery
that's a different question and we are
not going to talk about that as of now
next big stuff is the cutout so in case
you have watched the videos of Android
essential or maybe iPhone remember that
ugly top notch yes it's going to be
around for a while because Google has
made it really clear that a lot of
Android devices are going to come out
with that ugly notch I personally just
hate that so you get a really default
function which says get that ugly not no
it's not that actual actual function
this is the one which you should have
now once you run this function you will
be able to get that and you get the
three default mode of that like
display:none or always-on so you can
just customize of that now what I get
from this is a lot of phones especially
the essential phone needed to be
customized a lot of Android UI just to
make sure that they're notch is not
bothering with the time or their bars
and all of that now Google is saying
openly that hey you don't need to do
that customization we are here to help
you so go ahead make those ugly notches
phone and we're gonna support that we
are shifting our time clock on to little
bit far left side and our battery side
on to the far right side so that you can
make your designs even awesome so right
straight out of the box your design can
look amazing on the default Android P
devices
the next big update is about
Notification Center so you might have
already seen couple of videos in which
the notification section is now much
more colorful even the settings section
is much more colorful and they are
focusing on roundish icon now we are
going to talk a little bit more about
the Android 2.0 material each design
which is having some rounded icons and
rounded panels in a later on separate
videos right now let's come back on to
the notification section so now we get
much more access of the Notification
Center or the notification stream so
that we can pass on some push
notification customized now already I
have seen a lot of companies are
triggering around with these
notification by passing on images in the
notification as well you might have
already be aware of variety of
notification that you get are also
including the images now doing that is
far more easier you don't have to use
any third parties or the firebase thing
it is now supported by default in the
Android so whole story short your
notification are going to look awesome
and your messages in the notification
are going to be context aware
now this next big update is one of my
favorite and this is about the camera
settings so you have noticed already
that there is now a market trend of
using two cameras on the back probably
two cameras in the front I don't know
where they are going with the future
with that probably three or four cameras
in your phone I hope nobody is listening
to that please don't do that that would
be really insane but coming back onto
the point now Google is giving you an
extra support and extra control over
each of those cameras what you can do
with that a simple example would be
having an bouquet effect now you you
don't need to do all these machine
learning and all these things probably a
lot of kids and third parties will come
up probably alongside with the machine
learning because I have read in the
documentation they are mentioning that
now they are going to support the neural
network quite a lot as compared to the
in the previous model that was immature
they didn't really use that much often
but now they are opening the API support
for neural network as well and also they
are going to give the same support in
the cameras as well so that you can or
anybody can create those amazing bouquet
effect with the control of the two
cameras and machine learning libraries I
think this is an amazing of death update
and I would be really looking forward to
make some amazing apps that uses these
features and again the news that says we
are opening the things much more wider
for the neural network is already
amazing
next update is really the quick and the
short one is regarding the images and
the animation animations are improved
now and all the kind of doodles that
you're making on your phone are going to
be much more improved now and also on
the side of images now they are using
much more compressed size of images but
I am little bit on to the quirky side
here and I'm saying that already a lot
of a lot of companies like Samsung or
oneplus are tinkering quite a lot about
how they are saving their images and
what format they are saving so I don't
think so
it's going to matter a lot but yes now
it's a good news that you support much
more formats of the images and the
movies
moving on to our next update which is
about the job scheduler so a lot of you
might be using the job scheduler in case
you are not using third parties job
scheduler is amazing and is being used
for making some Network requests and
previously we were just making Network
requests using job scheduler and that's
it
but now the amazing part is you can also
determine what kind of size is going to
be coming up when we make a request
using the job scheduler and this size is
actually the data that is being consumed
and was being used so now you can
potentially give your users an estimated
size that you if you like watch this
video this is the size that it is going
to consume already being used by Amazon
and YouTube as well but now it's open to
everyone that you can even make some
kind of customized things with that that
hey if you watch this video it is going
to consume this X amount of data from
your whatever service you are using so I
think this is really amazing this is
this opens up a lot of door for
programmers and I would be really
looking forward for this change as well
and finally some of the quick side
updates as well of course I've already
talked a little bit that neural networks
are gonna be here and the API is is
gonna be wide open security is improved
just like always a lot of good and
amazing people from the information
security community helped by notifying a
lot of bugs and bug bounty programs and
all of that so thank you so much for
that amazing security updates are also
coming up and also your password
managers are gonna be more happier
because there is now exclusive supports
a lot of password manager to fill up
your emails and password and all of that
and these are some of the quick updates
one more just one more I almost forgot
about that now they are even planning to
have the client-side encryption of their
entire Android previously it was just
used to be meant to pushed on to some
clouds and stuff now they are saying
that clients are you will be able to
make client-side backup of your entire
Android device okay so quite a lot of
updates and yes these are all amazing
updates I am super pumped up super
excited about it but there are some
things that I'm not so super happy let's
also talk about the things which I'm not
happy and I think there is a still room
for those kind of things to be added up
here now the four
one is personal preference and I know
this is not going to happen even if
somebody is watching this video on from
the Google side as well why top notch
already a lot of people are hating that
so why you are even promoting other
users to have a top notch come up with
some Isles design I know the essential
phone also came up with that and and
Andy Reubens is the founder of Android
so probably just a side advantage that
you're giving to him whatever that is I
really hate that top notch please please
please don't support that by pushing the
default stuff here so I'm not happy with
that but it just me
the big concern still is how many
devices are going to get Android P that
is a big big issue and especially when
the things you are making up like the
support of 802.1 MC which is the latest
standard of Wi-Fi obviously the device
I'm pretty sure the device that you are
having in your pocket right now is not
going to get the Android P because again
it's a dependency of the customized
hardware especially in the Wi-Fi zone so
I'm pretty sure the new devices are
going to have Android P but this raises
the question the big question that you
are releasing back-to-back back-to-back
Android versions and still the number of
devices who can actually use the true
power of Android are like at a very
minimum hand and again this is a big
concern the reason why Apple market is
still dominating because whatever the
feature they are coming up with they are
actually pushing it to all the devices
and that increases the performance
improvement feedback and all these
things but again apart from this these
are amazing updates and I think it's
gonna be an amazing exciting yet again
for Android P but let's just see how it
turns up again my regret is that my
existing device is not gonna have
Android P I would have to buy any one so
this is your first look about the
Android P and what is about to come
obviously you can download Android
studio 3.2 to get your hands dirty with
this Android P surely we are going to do
this on this channel as well very soon
we are gonna write our first hello world
program in Android P and are going to
discuss some of these features which we
have discussed in this video in the
upcoming videos as well very
so that's it for this video give it a
thumbs up in case you have enjoyed this
video and hey you haven't hit that
subscribe button yet what are you
waiting for hit that subscribe button
and also one more thing notify me in the
comment section what do you think is
going to be the name of this Android pee
I am pretty sure it will be Android Pi I
want it to be Android pizza what
according to you it should be should be
the name and what is going to be the
name so let me know in the comment
section as well and I'll surely catch
you up in the next video
