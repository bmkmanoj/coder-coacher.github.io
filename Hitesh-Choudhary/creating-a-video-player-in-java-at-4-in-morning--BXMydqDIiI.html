usual video that I post regularly on my
youtube channel but this time I'm going
to be posting this just one directly out
there now you can see directly that
there is a NetBeans open up in my screen
but before before we move on I would
like to share this incident now you
might be having good friends so do I
have but I do have some annoying fringe
as well now what happened I owe a big
turn to one of my friend and he called
me up at this time which is let me tell
you it's 4:00 in the morning almost see
that check that out oops it's 4:00 in
the morning and some of my annoying
friends don't even bother and just call
me at the 4:00 in the morning and say
hey Paige you owe me one big time I said
yes but is it a time to pay back he said
yes this is the time I know you are not
yet sleeping so I said yes what can I do
for you he said uh my younger brother
needs a project to be done I said what
you just want to do a project at
midnight in here and by the way
tomorrow's Sunday so he asked me that he
wants to create a media application a
simple java based player which can open
any media file and can play that file
and that's it and he said I want you to
create that please I know this is
awkward I'm calling at this time but my
younger brother is so annoying and it's
it's something important that needs to
be delivered on Sunday morning ok now I
know this is this is not kind of a
regular video that I post around the
quality is not so good and everything
I'm not going to even turn off my AC
because I'm super super annoyed right
now but still I'm going to code this
application and just deliver this
application and we'll sleep after this
ok so what I'm going to do since he his
instructions were not clear he just told
me we need a simple GUI based
application which can open a file and
play it I'm going to do exactly that not
even a close button or anything
I'm just going to design that and I'm
going to be sharing it with you as well
in the job of course the two annoying
things I don't like Java I don't like to
be called a by the four o'clock in the
morning and
I want to sleep now so I'm going to be
just doing a simple application which
can open a file and play that that's it
that's it I know this is not a kind of a
video I usually post I want to post that
because I'm going to be sharing this
link and tell them that how annoyed I am
right now okay
coming back onto the point we're going
to be using NetBeans in here not one of
my favorite editors of course I do
prefer eclipse and on top of that I
prefer IntelliJ if I have to code in
Java on top of that I'm going to be
using scene builder from this Glu on
hq.com whatever that website is just try
to search on scene builder and it's it's
one of the very first link you will come
across very useful very handy just
select the version what you want in this
case I'm going to be going with a Mac if
you are on the windows and still
survived with that nasty malware then
still just go ahead download that and
there we go that's it that's pretty much
it let's just close this guy we don't
need here yes that's my wallpaper work
harder and trying and still people are
making me up at 4 o'clock in the morning
super annoying so I can open up my
NetBeans wherever that is and where are
you NetBeans it's taking a little bit
while popping popping up wait a second
my dear friends okay
come on come on NetBeans you can do this
open up done loading modules ok and
still taking still taking a minute come
on can't you be a little bit faster and
there we go finally opened up let's move
in here I can do a full screen oh no
this is fine this is ok so what I have
to do is file and create a new project
please forgive me if my instructions are
not that much clearer I just want to
clear up this project quickly so this
will be a fun project if you want to do
along with me so it will be a Java FX ml
by the way you can also do the same
project in the swing as well I
JavaFX ml will be super helpful for me
to quickly finish this project off and
let's just click on the next and yes
just do whatever you want to do I'm
going to be creating and naming it as
media media player annoying yep this is
what I do when you call me at four
o'clock so yep and let's just do a
finish
make sure the create application class
is also being checked marked here and
what it will does it will create an F
XML file for you and in case you haven't
downloaded that scene builder yet and go
ahead do that otherwise things
instructions will not work okay so go
into the tools and for Windows guys go
into the tools for the mag guys go into
the NetBeans and preferences and there
are my preferences there we go click on
the Java and click on T Java FX and make
sure your scene builder is selected for
Windows guys you have to go into
wherever you have installed the scene
builder C Drive Program Files user data
AB data wherever that is cool and this
click on apply ok my mine is already
done I have done a previous projects in
there in the Java had to be doing that
and now let's click on this guy let's
first run this application if it is
running or not on making some nonsense
things in here I don't make these kinds
of video regularly don't you think so
yeah
and there we go we have a nice this
small guy I can click on it oh it says a
little world nice nice and now I can do
is if your scene builders properly said
you can right-click and click on open
otherwise open option will not be
available for you and there we go our
scene builder and what I can do is I can
actually delete all of these guys yeah
delete that delete that to delete that
and there we go and just bring it in
here ok so what I want to do have in
here I want to have first of all the
border pains so border border pain is
nice just drag and drop
and whatever the size is it's okay I'm
not going to bother much but you can
play around with the layouts as well 600
left 400 anything will work in this case
and I need a couple of a horizontal box
and vertical boxes so first let's get a
V box and I'll drag and drop it to the
bottom that's that's too big for me I'll
just put it in here and then I'll need a
H box as well to put inside the V box
you get design it has as an Tavish this
is this is okay cool I'll select this
edge box guy and my preferred height
would be like 50 oops
I bumped into microphone don't do that
again and use computer size okay that's
okay and now what I want is bottom not
bottom you know I'm sleepy
I need a button and button is going to
go into the edge box and that guy is
going to say open open open open
anything okay looks pretty decent okay
now what we need is a we need a stack
pane stack pane and stack pane will go
into the center of this guy because
maybe he needs to add something more
than there maybe maybe he does okay and
inside the stack pane I can add a media
made of you pretty easy pretty easy
stuff this is too small too small for me
media hey what is your layout properties
width should be maybe 400 yeah for it it
is good
this guy's 300 I'm not bothered about
the aspect ratios of now 500 would be
good yeah looks pretty decent so we do
have an open box and it can play some
media files there no big deal but we
haven't linked up anything yet so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to select
this button guy and I'm going to look on
the controller and this button guy would
be linked
to this guy and then I can move into the
code and I can say into an action
yeah whatever the default had election
button that is I'm going to just work
with that and I'm going to save this guy
mmm interesting now I need to go back to
hierarchy media view and I'll select
this guy open into the code view and I
need to give it a media ID as well
because obviously I would be needing it
so let us call this as media view it
enter I know it's it's probably yelling
at you as well because we haven't
written a FX accessible code for this FX
ID but that's okay I'll see this guy and
I'll close this off probably we won't be
needing it anymore anytime soon so let's
just go in there first of all I would
like to remove my annoying face in here
because it's it's annoying so now let's
just do and I think it's visible enough
I want to go into this controller Java
file aver we can have this access handle
button action I don't want to print you
HelloWorld
I want you to do much more much more
than that so first of all first thing
would be to access a media player and
how we can do that how we can do that
okay although we don't need this label
guy but I'll just keep it there and all
you have to say is F XML and then you
can access this private media vu is
going to be simply media view it's going
to yell asset because it's not being
declared and I can hit a click in here
and hit alt and enter and click on enter
to automatically enter everything for me
okay that's good not bad not bad not bad
we can finish it very quickly there is
nothing much in here to D look at that
so for the media player we have got
access to the media player
now we need one more variable to store
whatever our file path is the media part
and we can just work on with that so
let's just have a private this is going
to be obviously a string Java works
quite a lot on the string file pop there
we go and I'm here what we can do is
there are a couple of steps involved I
don't know maybe you know it or not but
if you want to open up a file and play
that in a media player there are a
couple of steps in ios/android
in Java pretty much anywhere very coded
first is you have to choose a file with
extension and then you have to open a
dialog box to choose that file and then
you have to set a path where you have
choosen the file and then simply you
have to just set it into a media player
and plate okay quite a lot of step but
it's not that much so what we can do is
we can first have a file chooser and
this file chooser will of course we file
chooser there we go
gonna yell at that because file to that
is not being declared yet it's going to
be new file oops
file chooser there we go nice and easy
nice and easy and obviously we need to
just hit alt and enter there I don't
know if there is a shortcut to just fix
that quickly more quickly than that and
now what we have to do after this is to
mention that we want mp4 files because I
want to play my video files my YouTube
video files from there so what I can do
is simply say oops file chooser is going
to have dot X 10 come on so just me
control space yeah extension filter and
that's going to be filter now filter is
available in here extension is
predefined in the file chooser and I'm
going to say simply new and file oops
file chooser dot come on suggest me
extension filter yep and it takes two
parameters you can see in here
description and the extension
always forget them so I always rely on
these suggestions file path okay
so file path will be given for you now I
don't need that so I'll hit command C
extension filter and I need this guy the
description and the extension okay Wow
come on that was awkward and control
space I'm asking you to give this guy
the description and the extension again
again you just give me file path okay
I'll be arrogant and will be writing the
description and extensions in here so
two double coats and for extension I
want to open all mp4 great and what were
what the description mp4 file please
there we go nice and easy okay
that is okay so we have chosen our file
and done good things with that and now
we need to apply everything so how is
that file chooser dot get X come on
suggest me get extension filter dot add
and this guy takes a one parameter only
we could have actually placed this new
file chooser and everything in here but
we have stored that into available so
we're going to copy this guy and paste
that and to be honest we have done all
of this this Massacre thing just just
for this guy because this guy needs it
okay so there we go now we have done
this guy obviously we need to put a
semicolon annoying semicolon there and
now now let's use a file in here so
everything is done that we are only
looking for mp4 file now it's time to
open up a dialog box and what we are
going to do is file equals file chooser
okay choosie chooser just show open
dialog box I never was a big fan of this
name they could have done it a little
bit simpler by simply open dialog but
show open dialog that
that's kind of funny for me and we are
going to just give it a mouth there
obviously it's yelling for the file old
inter and add import now you're happy
yep he is happy and what else we can do
with this file now we can bring up our
file path this guy to actually work on
in here okay so I can just put my cursor
there okay nice and now when the dialog
box is open up I'm going to say you know
what our variable file but okay is that
a file cut yep I like to copy this guy
maybe I'm making a mistake
okay file path is good now is going to
be equal to file dot two I'm looking for
this guy to URI and it will be converted
to a string otherwise it always yells
string and there we go should be now
file path should have this URI part and
it is converted being into the string
okay everything in Java or mostly mostly
things certain to Java are are going to
work in the string so we're going to
have now a test that if there is a file
path it should not be null there should
be a file path if there is a file path
then we are going to just play it just
that much it so last block in here I
think so
so if file path is not I know this may
crash because there are a lot of things
you need to check around but I don't
care for that right now it is going to
be simply media and this is going to be
media equals new media this is funny too
much of the media in here file path so
we have given a file part to the media
come on yell me at media Alton enter
sometimes I don't even realize that I
have imported this package or not I
forget that so there we go and we can
have a media player and this is going to
be new
Media come on so just make something
MediaPlayer annoying okay this is not
I'm looking for a media player just
maybe player and there we go
okay media player there we go media
player is going to be equals to media
player and we need a media there and
there we go
and why is it being annoying in here
okay so we are having some problem okay
so what we are doing in here is
problematic okay you want to add more
things in here I don't know why you are
doing that we have just imported that
again I don't know maybe maybe okay it
looks good media player maybe we are
doing a mistake in here but we'll fix
that out in a second and let's just
carry on with that okay I think I think
I know what the problem is because I am
calling this as media player and knowing
maybe ok we'll fix that real fix that
maybe maybe I'm too much slippy so media
player or media player is done so media
view now let's call set and what I want
to do is set media player there we go
and it requires the value so we're going
to use media player that we have just
created and there we go
why is it denying its media cannot find
symbol media player ok why can it you
find that ok not that strange media
player new media player looks good to me
what is the problem in here ok we will
fix that in a second all that we need to
do is now play the media media dot
player dot fillet command suggest me no
suggestion at all that was
rude okay so we got a meetups why why a
dot in their media player dot play so
what a media player is not working media
should have a media player and okay I
think the reason why media player is not
working because I haven't defined it yet
how's that possible
yeah I think too much slippy so let's
define it there's no big deal let's just
define it string I thought I have to
find it maybe I'm too much sleepy media
player that's it okay you have too much
too much annoying there and I forgot
that it's it should not be a string type
it should be a media player type media
player and there we go you have learned
the debugging process as well
I think it's happy now it's not we can
just press alt enter
yeah it's happy it's happy I thought I
have defined the media player of type
media player so let me summarize what we
have done we have a user file chooser to
choose the file and we have given
specific instruction that only choose
mp4 file in there and now we are just
adding a filter in there no big deal
then we are opening up a file chooser or
a dialog box which can point to the file
and once the file location is being
picked up by to URI we are converting
that into the string so that we can
store that in a variable file path why
because once the file path is not null
it is being required by this media guy
so that it can play the media and we
have given it a file path so now it has
picked up the media and in a media
player we have created an instance of
this guy and now we are setting the
media player to media player obviously
and now we are doing that too much too
much of the code sometime but it's
pretty easy now let's just say that and
hit a run there may be we may crash this
application okay there we go
didn't crashed open this guy and there
we go my YouTube the
wanted that every big nerd programmer
needs a little at the old video just
play this guy yeah that is cool okay
there we go
does it open or crash yeah but plays yes
it plays it plays the four o'clock job
is done I within 30 minutes but yeah not
a big deal because I've worked on this
kind of media player prowl
in the past as well so probably still
the code hasn't changed much but this is
a fun project I won't be saying anything
after this because this is done I have
to back this project and just deliver it
to my annoying friend and I'll link you
I and to my annoying friend don't call
me again in four o'clock in the morning
that's my sleeping time okay buddy and I
owed you one
now I don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
