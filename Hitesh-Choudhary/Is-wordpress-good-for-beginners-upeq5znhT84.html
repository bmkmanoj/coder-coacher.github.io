with another video and in today's video
I want to talk about the WordPress now
briefly I'll be touching what is
WordPress but my major point of concern
is when it's actually the right time to
get started with the WordPress now I see
a lot of beginners directly getting
started with the WordPress so is it good
or when is actually the right time to
get started with the WordPress all of
this coming up in this video
in this channel we discussed about
coding programming technology and
everything related to the computer so in
case you are new here consider
subscribing now in case you don't know
what is WordPress what per simply is a
ready-made cooked-up system which you
can directly deploy on your domain and
voila you are ready with a website it's
motor with a content management system
which gives you a beautiful back-end
system which you can just upload the
things like how you manage your Facebook
or Twitter you can just you see exactly
almost the same admin panel there you
can change your title your headings your
images your sliders there are dozens of
themes and basically it's very lucrative
for the bigness to directly get started
with the WordPress now this is
completely a wrong thing now I'm not
talking about the people who directly
just want to get started a general
website for their business and they
won't be looking at it if you have that
guy then it's okay to get started with
the WordPress but if you are technical
and you are directly jumping into the
WordPress that is going to be a bad move
now let me tell you why it is going to
be a bad move now since you are directly
getting started with the WordPress you
are unfamiliar or you are not that much
confident with HTML CSS JavaScript
jQuery PHP and all of these technologies
now WordPress try to understand this is
a tool to faster your productivity not
to totally rely on that otherwise you
will be killing your creativity now once
you have the basic understanding and
knowledge about HTML and CSS and
JavaScript type try to create a couple
of projects in that now once you have
handles or
most about five to ten clients and that
are purely into HTML CSS and JavaScript
I'm not saying try to handle the clients
which need stick and WooCommerce or
entirely ecommerce website just the
clients who need a simple five page
website or just try to create your own
fictitious project to make sure you
clean up your hand in HTML CSS now once
a person actually is good in HTML CSS
and JavaScript and he is able to
manipulate things on his own then the
WordPress is actually almost good to
move on now why almost because WordPress
actually manages a lot of things and it
is heavily dependent on the PHP now if
you can create a web page by page
website with HTML CSS and JavaScript and
can also create a simple login form
which actually allows you to visit
legislate 3 or 4 more pages then
actually it's the perfect time to move
into the WordPress now I use WordPress
quite a lot because for me I'm already
familiar with these technologies in fact
I'm quite a lot familiar with HTML CSS
JavaScript angular and all those
technologies I work with them almost
every week and but for most of my
clients I still use WordPress why
because it saves me a lot of time now
many times the client actually requires
to and to give me or to produce an
entire ecommerce webstore which takes a
long time if we'd if you develop that
kind of store in simple angular or maybe
nodejs or other back-end system now
WordPress gives me a lot of
plug-and-play things which I can
configure and of course I can do a lot
of editing some creativity's and all
those things
since I know HTML and CSS that is why
I'm able to manipulate them but for a
big man who is try to directly jumping
into the web place and thinking hey now
it's going to be a comfortable life it's
actually a bad move so my tip for all
the big nerds who are very lucrative
about the WordPress don't get started
yet you will eventually get started
maybe in the later point of time or
maybe you'll find some other CMS much
more powerful and much more easy to get
started but if you are a big nerd
don't touch the WordPress that would be
your creativity killer don't
your creativity now after once you move
into the project area then it's okay to
get move on so this was a quick overview
about my part that is WordPress good for
beginners are not link down in the
comments section below that what do you
think about it
your thoughts exactly like mine or if
you have some different thoughts let's
discuss them in the comment section
below and maybe I can create more videos
on the same topic and if you think that
this video was okay then give it a
thumbs up subscribe if you have new here

this video much more make sure you share
