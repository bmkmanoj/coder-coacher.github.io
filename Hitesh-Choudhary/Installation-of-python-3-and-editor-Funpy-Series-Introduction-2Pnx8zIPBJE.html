Python I can surely help you but first I
need to put this camera down this is
heavy I need to find my tripod okay so
here's the deal I was getting bored here
and I wanted to do something much more
productive so I thought let's start a
unique series on Python now what's going
to be unique in this series is we will
not follow that the normal routine
structure like learning about the loop
function anything like that and if you
are a big man at that level don't watch
this video this is not for you this is
more about practicing but of course from
a big nest level so I'm going to be
talking about installing the Python and
choosing a right editor for that and
then just direct them will be learning
about tackling down the problem how the
solution is being built for a particular
problem and of course we are going to
have a ton of fun with the Python so
falling back on to my regular stuff this
is not like that about how I'm going to
be talking about each and every stuff
like loops and functions no I'm not
going to be talking about that rather
I'll be moving and taking steps onto one
more level and I'll be talking about how
the levels are being built up like for
example I when I do have a problem I do
how do I read that how do I write a
pseudo code for that and how I actually
write a Python code for that this is
going to be fun and by the way will be
using Python 3 for this entire upcoming
few videos and I think this is going to
be much more cool I have a lot of
problem sets which I have already built
up and this is going to be super cool so
I think it's really excited so let's go
and move on and try to install the stuff
let's go here hey did everyone and
welcome back here so we're going to talk
about first of all the installation of
the Python and why I'm using the pipe in
version 3 and my choice of editor which
editor I'll be using if you want to
follow along with me then it's fine
otherwise if you already have a favorite
editor then it's pretty cool you can
just work on with that so here is the
website which we all know and which we
all love python.org and we're going to
be moving on to the download section but
obviously the debate comes here the
legendary debate about Python 3 or
Python 2.7
now python 2
is really awesome I loved it I loved it
and I actually learned everything on the
Python - now the shift from Python to in
on three is pretty easy there is not
much that you need to bother about and
it's much more object oriented and the
most important part in the future Python
2 is not going to be supported yet only
about a 2 or 3 percent of the packages
really need to move from 2 to 3 but
right now currently I can say that
almost all packages have been shifted to
Python 3 so obviously it makes a good
choice to download the Python 3 I have
already got it downloaded on my system
and I'll be installing it in a second
but wait a minute wait a minute now for
all the Mac &amp;amp; Linux users you also need
to install the Python 3 your system
ships in default with the Python 2 but
we will be using Python 3 this doesn't
mean you need to uninstall the Python 2
if you will do so you make her up to
your system in the Linux and Mac there
are a lot of files and systems which are
dependent on the Python 2 so you should
not do that and for the Windows users
there is no such problem it doesn't
ships in with the Python so you you have
to download this it's pretty simple
install for the market is going to be a
pkg file for the windows it's going to
be e x e double click yes yes I agree
and stuff so let me quickly install the
Python and then I'll talk about the
editor itself in the meantime it will
install so here's the Python installer
for me this hit continue continue I
agree pretty simple installation we are
all pretty solid in that continued and
installation install it's surely going
to ask me for the password I'll enter my
password and there we go so pretty
simple installation nothing much to be
bothered about but the next point that
comes up is which editor should I be
using and as I always say while you're
writing scripts or you're writing
programs for HTML PHP or anything
you should definitely spend some time in
finding about what's the best editor
being available so let's close this guy
first of all now for the Python there is
not much of the abundance although it's
very favorite language to most people
but still not much of them are out here
the one option that we do have is
pycharm and it's available for free as
well as for the paid the Community
Edition is free but if you need more
full-fledged environment then for sure
you can go for the paid version as well
it's completely about what you pay what
you get pretty solid but I have
something interesting for you and I have
been using it for a lot of development
recently and that's Adam by the way if
you haven't watched this video yet go
ahead watch it it's damn hilarious so
what you need to do it's basically a
text editor but as they say it's the
hackable editor so I loved it and I'll
show you in a minute why so go ahead and
download it if you are want to follow
along with me I will be using Adam
throughout this particular video series
so let me just launch up my Adam there
are you there we go there we go this is
our Adam that we will be using now at
first glance you might see that this is
not something that we want to use this
is basically in HTML or PHP editor but
wait a second so let me save this file
and I'll be calling this as simply test
dot py just to simply do a test and I'll
be writing a simple Python code here and
that's going to be simply print and our
customary hello world but nowadays the
customer is actually the to do list but
let's just say we have this and I'll
save that now you might want to run this
and you might be saying hey now we need
to open up the terminal run it from
there but wait a minute I do have this
terminal here at the bottom inside the
editor Litella is customized as well and
what I can do is I can simply say
peyten I guess three yep Python three
and I can simply run it with test dot py
and there we go it says hello world we
look out for the syntax and everything
later on and we'll be solving a tons of
problems here but I think this is pretty
cool but you might be asking how I did
that so let's go on to the this guy and
look for the packages which packages
actually I have installed so I'll go
into the Preferences and the packages
and specially the package that I have
installed it's loading up
is actually where are you one is the
autocomplete for Python it needs setup
data we'll do it in a minute and the one
which is platform you IDE terminal
that's the one package that I have
installed now this is a super cool
package that gives you a terminal here
and it has got a lot of settings and it
will open up the terminal inside the
directory wherever you are so there are
a lot of options you really need to
check out those it's pretty cool I like
it a lot there are a lot of default
colors that you can go for and if still
you find that there is no default color
that I am liking it you can actually
change that so what they give you here
in the themes section they give you this
particular CSS by which you can change
actually all the things like you want to
change the background color or the
selection or for the terminal you can do
so and it's actually my customized color
that I've been using it it's pretty good
for the teaching purposes so where you
have to paste this code so just copy
this and look for the CSS the stylesheet
here it says a stylesheet
just open it up and when you're not
opening up there we go
and all you need to do is you can paste
down it here and can choose your
customized color I have chosen the
background color as green and the
background color is black for the
selection and for the terminal cursors
like so that's why you see the black and
it's pretty much taking the attention
here so that's why I'm using it by the
way if you want a little bit more
hacking you want to do or not sort of
hacking but your customization you can
do for the treeview
for the text editor I love this editor I
used to be a big fan of the brackets but
recently I've shifted on to the atom I
loved it so this is all the setup that I
really wanted to talk apart from this
there is not much to talk here because
we will be dealing directly with the
problems so I think everybody is happy
with the setup that I have right now and
let's move on and from the next videos
we are going to be talking about the
problems let's go there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
