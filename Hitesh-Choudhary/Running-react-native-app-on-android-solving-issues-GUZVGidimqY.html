with another video now this is not an
ordinary video that where we talk about
advices programming and stuff this is
about solving some issues so let me
first of all clear up this video is not
for everybody
yep that's true it's not for everybody
let's define our audience who am I
looking for in this particular video so
let me tell you I was running an Android
app basically it was a react native app
and I was trying to run it on the
Android simulator and I faced a couple
of issues couple of a couple of bugs and
you might be facing some of the issues
in running your react native app on the
Android and that is probably you are
here and we are going to solve that
issue so if you are associated with
react native learning running Android
simulate apps on Android simulator then
only this video is for you otherwise hey
catch you up in other videos this is not
for you okay
so let me tell you exactly what happen
and how I solved my issues and what were
the issues so let me open up my
terminals where they are there we go so
this is some of the terminals that I
have and basically you just generate a
react native app so this is how you do
it let me just clear up the console so
that you can see this is react native
init YouTube just a demo app that I
created and when you run this app using
a react native run iOS it just magically
runs or maybe I work quite a lot of my
us so everything was properly set up
there perhaps perhaps I'm not judging
there so that is why it run really
smoothly on my iOS app but when I try to
run it on the Android it gave me a few
issues and how I solve them let's
discuss them now very first time when
you will run that it will install a lot
of Gradle scripts on your system and by
the way the Gradle scripts are to
support your Android apps or to run
quickly and effectively on your
simulators okay we may talk about Gradle
scrips later on so let it do be patient
there it's going to install a lot of
things with the doctor and it just does
the stuff so the first thing is let it
do that and a few thing that you might
have skipped from the documentation
let's just go back and watch out for
them
so I expect that you might already have
installed the JDK even on a Mac you need
a JDK although now Android simulator
says or Android studio says that hey you
don't need JDK we just installed
prepackaged with that but still you're
going to need that react native does
require that so as it says Android
studio requires a recent version
although in the studio may want to skip
that but you want to install the JDK
there okay the next thing is install
Android simulator and everything that is
good but let me show you a couple of
things that you might be missing okay
open up any app or maybe an app which is
being generated by react native and then
after go to the tools and click on the
Android and SDK manager and now in the
SDK manager
make sure the check mark on this show
package detail and one thing for which
react native was yelling at me is I
didn't have the 23rd version of API that
means Android marshmallow of course you
can just scale up your apps to the
latest and nougat or whatever the latest
always there but again you need to have
this guy installed there it makes a lot
of issues there so this is number one
thing that you might want to do is
install this okay I'm going to hit the
cancel there and thereafter we need a
AVD manager as well in the AVD manager
you might be looking up for the Android
latest API which is Android 25 API but
somehow again you have to create another
device with 23 as well API level 23 I
happen to choose Nexus 5 you can choose
any other phone it doesn't really matter
but for the first time of the running
you need this guy ok that is step number
one now open up your Android app and
your new react native project for
example in my case it's the YouTube so
where is it there we go so it's a
YouTube app and in that you have got
Android and iOS folders make sure you
open up the end right not just the
YouTube not just your base project
folder go inside this Android and there
you will see a lot of properties and
everything in here now one thing that
might bug you off quite some time
is this locale dot properties file
sometimes now this is sometimes this
react native initialization of the
project doesn't generate this locale dot
properties file so you might want to
create a new file that says local dot
properties and what is inside this file
is pretty easy let me open that up okay
come on
why are not going okay this is what it
does you don't need this all the things
because you don't need it actually you
just have to have a thing here that says
SDK dot dir equals slash user slash
whatever your computer name is my name
is happened to be studio and then slash
library slash Android / SDK now in most
of the cases this file is automatically
being generated but in some of the
project I have seen that this file is
not being generated so you want that
file ok hey ok and this is the problem
majority of the times you might be
facing this problem or maybe the API
level is not installed on your system 23
ok that is another let's go back to this
guy and they are also saying that hey
you need 23 level he P had to be
installed there and of course sometimes
you might want to export the path I
didn't need it to do that maybe for some
reasons but I didn't need it that to do
that and after that there is again an
issue there just like in the end in the
iOS you just run the command react
native run iOS automatically a simulator
is being triggered and your app just get
placed there and you can just run that
it doesn't happen in the Android so what
you want is run the simulator ok once
you run the simulator then only the
files it get installed on it but again
it's not going to say you that I have
done this and will not automatically
open the file so you have to go into
this guy and you have to look out for
the YouTube and then you can proceed to
work out also a small K wait there that
in the end in iOS simulator you just
press command R to reload your app but
in here you have to press R 2 times it's
by the way written in here as well so
these are few
issues that you might run into it and I
think this is going to solve everything
on to a quick revision make sure that
your JDK is installed after that makes
your Android studio is also installed on
your Mac and on top of that the first
thing that you might be looking up is
the file locale dot properties should be
there in your android folder after that
make sure you have got a TA level 23
being installed there it is required and
a device should be there with that with
the API 23 and after that you need your
simulator to be up and running and then
you might want to run the command react
native space run Android and that's few
issues I think a lot of you will be
helpful by solving these issues when
running your app and I I assume that you
might also be involved quite a lot in
the iOS app and that is why a few of
these issues are pretty common okay so I
think this video was helpful for few
people who are facing some issues in
react native Android and if you think
that this video was helpful give it a
thumbs up and I will surely catch you up
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
