again with another video and this one is
interesting as well as little bit
fantastic as well alcohol that's pretty
awesome
so as the name suggests of this video
we're going to have some fun with
machine learning and I haven't tested
out this special thing I just wanted to
see this live on a recording session so
that I can post it on YouTube and what
basically we are going to do is we're
going to find out some of the
celebrities like Narendra Modi Donald
Trump
maybe Salman Khan maybe Shah Rukh Khan
and we'll try to detect if what the
machine learning actually says about the
these person if the machine learning is
still able to find those persons or not
now I know this is not going to work
well because the model of machine
learning that I'm using is not meant to
be identifying the personalities and
that is that kind of technology is not
yet evolved but it's always fun to
explore unhurt territories and it's
always fun we are going to do some basic
stuff as like finding is it going to
detect basketball or a bread of Lou or
something like that so yes it's always
fun to give it a try and maybe in some
of the videos I'll walk you through that
how I design that now first of all let
me show you that what kind of model that
I'm using here so here is my browser
okay come on fire that up and the model
that I'm using is a reson 850 which is
available on the github as well if you
want to look quite a more detail about
it
that's the resonant 50 I'm using and you
can see it's a it's having a couple of
version like resonant 51 52 and I'm
specifically using the model being used
in the iOS development because that's
the iOS app that here we have got and
that's that's all here is and you can
see some familiar words which we have
discussed in the previous videos as well
so this is going to be pretty fun
exercise and let me bring up my
simulator here I'm going to minimize
this okay so again again first of all a
disclaimer a big disclaimer that if you
have a problem with this app or
something don't watch this video for the
almonds because I am not pretty sure
when I'll fetch photos like Narendra
Modi or Donald trum what's going to say
so I'm not aware of that and neither
it's something that has to do with me
because I'm you
the model being designed by Apple and
Google so don't put a case on may he
just follow those guys okay I'm just
trying to use them and trying to show
you that it's available for everybody
okay so and again maybe in some videos
later on I'll show you and walk you
through that how this app was designed
not this one actually not this one this
is a different app this is the app that
we have and you can see that's a pretty
familiar app you can fetch it a photo
and it's going to judge what the photo
is it's according to its guess and it's
all going to say I'm only this much
person of the shore so I'm going to pick
up a few photos here and I've got a few
good photos here now as you can see this
is a bread loaf which is obviously a
French loaf everybody can tell that so
no big deal and it says that 99% sure
that this is a French loaf okay really
good good starting there and can you
imagine here that what kind of power the
machine learning is actually giving to
you you are able to just fetch any photo
and it's going to judge it like that so
this is this is pretty fantastic if I'll
just tell you to write the program for
such things I can fetch it hundreds and
thousands of type of bread and I'm
pretty sure it's going to come up really
clean with that ok and let's try to fit
something more interesting and I thought
hey why not - fetch Steve Jobs and
figure it out that if it can find out
the Apple Steve job of course the app is
running on the Apple we're using a model
ResNet model of Apple version of it here
but again it says bow tie bow tie bow
tie so not a good job machine learning
not a good job there with the Steve Jobs
let's try something else as well I have
got the famous guy sundar pichai here so
it's a his lab coat and laboratory coat
nothing impressive see machine learning
is getting involved but it's not right
there yet it has to do a lot of things
it's still in version 2 I think in
version 3 or 4 or 5 maybe we'll have
something more fantastic there so there
we go
if I just open up a camera roll for the
two famous guys of the Google it doesn't
really work there as well let's see what
it does for your favorite for machine
learning and AI
it doesn't even recognize its
predecessor or maybe successor if they
are one so there we go and what about
the this space it says it's a mosque and
I am really impressed with this
situation here because to be honest it's
a machine in man so it's mosque lay or
so it has done a pretty good job of
finding out that it's a mosque being
thrown here and this is something
amazing that machine learning is doing
let's try out with something else okay
so I was looking on the Google and
trying to say save a couple of images
here so let's try with a Donald come on
give me something
let's try to look for a Donald Trump and
let's pick up some good images and you
know I'll go with this one this guy is
really famous so let's just save this
image and try to fetch it to a rap and
see if it can fetch it out so you
couldn't find the image we had at damage
okay did I saved it come on
the damage got saved or maybe not this
image okay this looks decent come on
give me this image I want to save this
come on why the image is not getting
saved okay there we go
so let's fetch this image and says shoot
shoot off clothes good not amazing job
but we are decent ok let's try out with
our honorable Prime Minister there and
come on let me search for him and there
we go an array in the bode okay let's
look for something good picture oh this
looks nice looks really on some picture
there so let's just save this image and
let's try what it says for that picture
okay come on detect it okay racket it
doesn't look like a racket to me I
cannot play any sports with it let's try
with another image there and let's try
this smiling face image that is one
lovely image fantastic so come on let me
save that and we're going to give it a
try and shot with a couple of other guys
as well which are pretty famous so let's
try with this and this we shake oh I
don't know what that is a bearskin I
have no idea let's drive it something
fun here and try to look out for
something else as well maybe it can
recognize a famous guy in Bollywood here
I think this photo looks good decent I
don't know if it is smiling or try to
cry there but hey I know Salman Khan's
fans are going to bash me for that which
who cares
so let's just go ahead juicy t-shirt
t-shirt up so it has done a fantastic
job here for detecting the t-shirts and
that's fantastic I like this app I can
play it all day long and the reason I
have added recently a camera button over
here because in the bootcamp we were
just playing it around fetching like
bottles and mobiles and camera lenses
and goggles and pretty much everything
we could have found over just clicking
the picture and throwing it on the app
to find out whether machine learning can
do it or not and I'm planning to fetch a
couple of more models to it because
right now I'm just working on one model
I'm planning to add at least two or
three models more to it so that can
detect more categories of the object
right now just detect for our 700 each
categories of objects but I think a more
cool part would be if it can detect like
like two thousand three thousand
categories and one amazing thing that if
Kate can detect a face as well as can
try to find out on the internet what
it's looking up for I know I'm being too
much optimistic there but surely it can
detect face we can put a face there but
that's the face detection I think that
Google the face book is doing if that
kind of thing becomes open-source
possibilities are endless because if you
do remember in the face book it can
automatically detect the faces as well
as can compare it to your friends images
and can find out that hey this is the
friend that you have made and shall we
tag this shall we tag that so I was more
hoping for that kind of opportunities if
they can make it open source surely we
can design an app with that so that was
fun it was a fun exercise we
made a different kind of video for this
channel here so I would say that's it
for this video it was quite fun maybe in
some upcoming videos based on requests I
can walk you through how I design this
app it's pretty basic
nothing much easier so that's it for
this video if you are new to this
channel to hit the subscribe button we
play around quite a lot with the codes
and technology here pretty geeky stuff
with programming that's all what we do
at this channel and that's it for this
video do hit the subscribe button if you
like this video give it a thumbs up if
you have any thoughts write down in the
comment I see all of them and I'll
surely catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
