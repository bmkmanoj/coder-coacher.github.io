with another video but hey students this
video is not for you this video is
dedicated to all the engineering
instructors all the teachers who teach
programming as well as who teach at some
engineering universities to all the HIDs
to all the founders at co-founders of
all the engineering campuses and also
known as engineering colleges and
universities this is a special video
which I really wanted to do from a long
time and I have got dozens and hundreds
of emails filling up my inbox about this
subject so let's talk about it in this
video I should have loved ok
all those people who have been writing
me to make a video on this subject about
the situation of engineering colleges
and engineering students here is my open
replied to everybody and let's talk to
all those people who can do something
about it
all those engineering people who are
associated with some kind of a head
positions maybe actually maybe founder
or co-founder so I really want to
address you in this video so one thing
is fact that the thing how you are
applying all the things in engineering
colleges and university is not working
out really well and I'm talking about
all those rules that you are saying as
these are compulsory rule and you have
to follow them regardless you are not
telling the students why they should be
following like 75% in his criteria or
maybe visiting daily or why they are
choosing this particular subject in
their stream this is not clear to the
students and one thing we all can agree
on this is this is not working out well
and the proof of this is that see that
the condition of engineering campuses
and the engineering students right now
in India this is not really great and
you cannot deny that so there is
something wrong going on because these
are students who are like creme quality
students till they are in the school as
soon as they move into engineering
campus they are not able to survive
really well and something is going on
wrong and we need to address this the
first important aspect of solving a
problem is first accepting that yes
there is a problem so make sure you
accept this first of all next up let's
also accept that the way how the
engineering slavers and the curriculum
is being designed especially for the CS
students some of this some of their
subject are intermixed with other
branches and for a mechanical students
some subject are being mixed up from
computer science this is not really
working out well and also a lot of
engineering slaver's that you are
teaching around is really outdated so we
really need to talk about this that how
we can actually upgrade all of these
slavers how we can move forward first
and foremost you are not able to
understand the students mind and you
really need to understand this otherwise
things are not
going to work out just like in any other
industry in a corporate sector there are
business analyst who just goes out in
the market and try to read the clients
mind whatever the product they are
selling they try to reach out their
target audience and try to understand
what is their mindset and how they can
serve them really well similarly these
universities needs to understand that
how a student's brain works and what
they are really wanting here and how
they are thinking right now because as
you can see the students are one of the
rebellious group of people in all of the
community take the community of like
government people who are working in the
government jobs or nine-to-five jobs or
maybe is a small age group the
engineering people are the most
rebellious
I'm not saying in a bad sense but they
are rebellious in the way that they want
to explore every single option every
single possibility that they can do with
their careers so hey - everybody is
thinking on the right way students want
to learn and explore and we want to
teach them so where are the things going
on wrong the things are going on wrong
in the way I call it as fear learning
you are trying to impose the concept of
fear learning you are imposing a lot of
rules you are imposing a lot of
mandatory subjects mandatory unnecessary
rules on the students and are asking
them to follow them blindly now this is
not how the things are gonna work
anymore
the dropout rate in India is increasing
day by day and a lot of people who are
thinking about dropping out is
increasing like exponentially this needs
to be stopped so here is how you are
dealing up with the situation just to
give you some of the ground up students
I am already teaching more than 120,000
students all over the globe I'm not
imposing any kind of attendance rule any
kind of a submission of the assignment
rule any of them student and at any
given day at any given time you can just
watch the stats and at least 10,000
students are learning at the given time
whether that's a Saturday night a Sunday
night early Monday morning whatever that
is at some moment or some point of time
at least 10,000 students are live and
learning from my videos okay so you are
listening to me right now and this means
that somehow I have actually came up
with
system which is far more interesting as
well as impactive as compared to your
fear learning system so what is my
system by which I'm able to inspire so
many students and I'm able to just focus
them and give them the idea that hey you
should be learning you should be working
hard now there are four main pillars of
the things that how I actually see the
things now I have studied quite a lot
about the engineering student brains as
well as in general students brain and I
came up with a system of four pillars
solution and I really want to share this
in this video to all of you step number
one is give a spark to the student this
spark is really interesting and really
really important students want to listen
from established industrial person that
what they can do in life this is the
spark they want to see that how by
working hard by learning something they
can reach to an x point in their life
this is super important this is fart
cannot be delivered by a regular person
who has not done something big enough in
their life so for this is Park you need
to call up some industry experts maybe
that person may be from Bajaj automotive
may be from test life you can afford
maybe from Facebook Google flip kart
snap deal so you need to call up those
person and you you really want to make
sure that they give at least five or ten
minutes of session to the student so
that they can get the spark that yes
this is my inspiration I want to become
like him this is the most important
pillar the spark to the student second
point is also related to the spark which
is inspiration and again these are two
separate things and make sure you give
them the second one more often and on to
a regular interval which is inspiration
students are really easily distracted so
you need to make sure that you give them
time to time inspiration make sure you
give them a little focus that carry on
and to your Android development or maybe
an engine working or maybe a robotics
and just keep them inspiration from time
to time they really need to listen about
your talks what you think about life and
all these things so inspiration is also
important maybe you want to call up some
persons from other outside campus or
anything like that
but again this inspiration is important
and make sure you don't
doubt that this is super important here
the third most important thing is make
sure you give them right direction
students are really exploded in nature
they want to explore every single
possibility that they can do with their
life and for that you need to give them
right direction you don't want to force
them that hey you should only learning
be the Android or only be learning the
web development or only should be
learning the robotics this is the wrong
way of doing the things don't impose
over impose the things that just show
them the correct amount of right path
that these are the options that you can
you can pick up and can get started this
is known as giving them the right
direction
once they are into that direction if
that direction is your subject of
expertise then only direct them only
then if that subject is not of your
expertise just openly say that this is
not area of my expertise and you should
really be asking to somebody else about
this subject obviously somebody would be
saying hey this talk something about
robotics or something I'm no expert in
that subject so I cannot talk about that
if somebody gonna say hey sage talk
something about microcontroller chips I
cannot because I'm not a subject expert
in that so don't be shy just accept that
you are not expert in all the domains
and show them that right people who can
direct them in the right direction and
of course don't force them the fourth
and the final pillar of this entire
thing to work out is a gentle kick in
the butt no I'm not saying that be harsh
to the student this would be the longest
thing that you can done do that you can
do to the students make sure to give
them a gentle push a gentle kick in the
butt now most of the people are
hardworking they really want to do
something with their life but still
there is a small community of people in
the students who really don't want to do
anything they are just lazy and you want
to give them a gentle kick give them
some inspiration or impose a certain
rule on that particular group of the
student only or maybe you want to give
some competition to them some prize
money or maybe some scholarship or
something like that so that these lazy
people can also take participation in
what the thing that you are trying to do
so these are the four pillars that I
have been following for so long in mind
life to make sure the student learned
something and I don't have to be pushy
about any kind of unnecessary rule to be
imposed to them or anything like that
and I have figured out that this is
working really great for me I can also
understand being a university it's not
easy to just change the curriculum just
like that
or maybe just introduce Android or iOS
development just like in your curriculum
but again I have seen some of the
universities in the past have done this
by arranging like extra classes on
Sundays or maybe just giving a free time
slot to that particular learning things
and all these things yes of course if
you are gonna work really hard and want
to think about it you can change the
life of these students and this is
really essential the way how the
engineering college and universities
these things are moving towards the
direction I am NOT happy with that
because they are not at all inspiring it
anymore a lot of people are thinking
about dropping out because they are not
able to do the things which are
currently in the industry demand they
are not able to learn about Android iOS
web development machine learning these
are the things which make students
really interesting at least in the
computer science domain and similarly
such new more modern things are there in
robotics and architecture and all of
these things so either you should really
focus on updating these things updating
your curriculums or things are going to
be really worst in the near future I
know most of the university people have
already closed down this video because
they don't want to listen to anybody and
if this is going to be the case you are
going to see the things really really
worst in the near future but regardless
of this it was my duty to just make sure
that this topic needs to be covered up I
need to say it out loud because I was
receiving like hundreds of emails about
this subject so these are my open
thoughts again just to remind you the
things remember my four pillars how you
can tackle students into a right
direction as well as things are really
not going really good in the engineering
campus so think about it there are these
fine
to be the air for you me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
