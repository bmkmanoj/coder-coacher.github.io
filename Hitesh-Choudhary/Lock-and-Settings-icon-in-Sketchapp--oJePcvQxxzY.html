again with another video and in this
video we're gonna be designing for
amazing icons now since you have already
seen that we are gonna be designing for
icons that means they are pretty easy
one to design and yes they are super
easy to design so first and foremost
we're gonna take down the tough one it's
not the tough one it's like it consumes
a little bit more time as compared to
the other ones other ones are super easy
so let's bring up this first lock icon
you might have seen that just right near
by the passwords so we're gonna learn
how we can design that really really
quickly so first and foremost press o on
your keyboard and we're gonna press down
our option key and the shift key and
we're gonna just get a nice big it's
like too much big I'm gonna get a circle
and we are gonna remove the borders from
it and we are gonna fill it off with our
global color which is this gun and
that's pretty much it now we need
another circles just at the center of
this like that press down option and
shift so that we can start working like
that and there we go and I think that
outer one is actually too big so I'm
gonna just go ahead and do that okay
that's nice we don't even need to change
color because we can just select all of
them and can hit subtract and there we
go nice and easy so now click on your R
and we need a rectangle so what we want
to do is we want to start right from
here till here and we want to have it
something like that remove the border
color and press ctrl C to quickly grab a
color there we go okay now comes the
interesting part let me change it a
little bit color so that you can see
actually what is happening so I'm gonna
go with the grayish there now notice if
I just select all of this and Katie
Union this is not exactly this is kind
of exactly what I want but it can be a
little bit tricky for you maybe so let
me show you what I mean by that just
select this and probably you are
designing this and probably this
rectangle is at the bottom of this
combined shape then if you select that
and hit on to the Union this is exact
what I'm looking for and not the
previous one okay let me again show you
that what I mean by that hit command C
so sometimes when you are designing
these things the layer actually can
affect a lot where the layer is on the
operation so if I just put this
rectangle at the top and if I select
that and hit a Union although I can
proceed on to this lock I can from here
as well but it can be a little bit
tricky from this side so hit command Z
and make sure that the rectangle is a
little bit at the bottom and then you
hit the Union icon by selecting both of
them of course so that we can have
something like this now yes in the
previous ways also we can proceed to do
again and there are always tons of other
workflows through which you can design
these icons I like to go with this way
so I think this is much better for me so
now what we want to do is press R again
to have a rectangle and we want to go
this time
inside and we want to just elongate it
here till the here I think so I'm gonna
bump up the width a little bit like that
and we'll try to just move it a little
bit there and now you can select both of
them and can hit subtract and hit
command Z because I see that there is a
border and we can remove the border
I think the border is making a little
bit problem you can always hit Z and can
like eyeball it a little bit if you are
not happy with it like probably I'm
gonna remove a one pixel here and one
more pixel and I'm gonna be just
shifting it towards there this is
actually much better and yep this is
exactly what I want to go I want to
increase that a little bit and now you
can select and hit subtract and there we
go almost perfect there is still room
for improvement in this but I think this
is like good enough for us okay now
press R on your keyboard and we want to
grab a nice big lock here I think that
is good enough we're gonna round this
corner a little bit and press control-c
to grab this guy you can also change the
color of this one not at all a big deal
so there we go it's like too much big of
a lock icon I'm gonna go a little bit
squarish
totally a precise thing how you want to
take down this and I think I'm happy
with this one okay now the inner one is
actually pretty easy so you can just
press o to get the oval or four circle
hold down your option and shift key and
drag this guy wherever you want it just
place it like that I don't like the
border at all you might have already
seen me
I don't like border as much so there we
go nice and easy and now I need a
rectangle so I'm gonna go for rectangle
just like this okay there we go and I
can just click on transform and can
increase the size a little bit like that
and remove the border choose the fill
for this guy and there we go that's it
pretty much easy and if you wish you can
just combine them just hit a union and
there we go
if you want even roundish and all of
that you can have more anchor point and
can have mirrored and all of that but I
think I'm pretty happy and I think I
like this one
much more than this one so this one is
more precise so this one is better now
comes of the next icon which is actually
super easy I don't even want to call as
one part of it so let's have an art
board and we're gonna have an art board
of 500 by 500 and this is a settings
icon but it is super easy to design so
get a rectangle have a rectangle like
this and you know it border is gonna go
gone global color and you might want to
transform this because settings I can
actually should be broader from the
bottom and the top can be a little bit
like like one pixel like that okay so
you want to shape something like this
once you have a shape like this I want a
pretty much a smaller one once you have
a shape like this one you can just click
on rotate copies and you want exactly 13
of them total in 14 so it will create
like 13 more of it and just click on OK
and there you go your settings icon is
now ready and even if you want like a
little bit more polished one or more
on one you can just press o and can go
here like exactly Center hold down your
option and shift key and can have a
circle like that remove the border fill
the color with a global one and there we
go nice and beautiful circle if you want
like more things to be done they are all
now in the separate path if you wish you
can just design something more onto it
but I think I'm happy with the setting
icon within quick time I was able to do
it now we have two more the this guy
which is pretty easy to design and
probably you know I have been designing
so many icons so I'm gonna give you this
one as a simple exercise to do it on
your own I think this is probably the
easiest one you can come up with so I'll
just leave it with you and I'm gonna
just say it like this is here and text
and this is gonna be a sign mint so
select that and press control C to have
color there we go
come on get me a color come on that is
too much they are not giving me colors
okay there we go so this isn't how an
assignment that all of you can do and
let's come on to this one this one is
actually pretty fun so hit R for having
no I don't need a rectangle I'm gonna
delete that I need an artboard there we
go
and go for 500 by 500 there we go I hope
it is 500 by 500 this is not 500 by 500
okay so how we do that it's pretty easy
press o hold down your option and shift
key to have like probably this big and
let's just remove the border have a
global color there we go
now what you want to do is press R to
have a rectangle and we are gonna have a
rectangle like this big okay and double
click to make it a vector and we're
gonna just put a point on to like center
of the bottom line and just click and
drag and make sure it's straighten you
can also have a mirror like to have like
a little bit roundish I don't like it if
you like it you can always go for it I'm
gonna go for the straighten one
and once you have this guy you can just
select them and click on subtract and
there we go top part is ready and then
have a rectangle and we're gonna have
like nice and big arm for this one
probably a little bit like like that and
a little bit longer I'm gonna select and
I'm gonna round the corners a little bit
like that not much I think this is
enough 15 is good and let's just select
the color so ctrl C and there we go and
now we want to select and union that and
there we go and just for the last final
touch I'm gonna hit Z and just zoom it a
little bit and I'm gonna press o for the
Oval and just press option and shift and
have a nice cute circle and there we go
and we are gonna just say you know what
this should be subtracted come on just
select them and hit subtract and there
we go so this is nice a nice addition
now select the whole thing and just
rotate it a little bit to give it a lies
and easy setting psych in here not
usually settings but usually I prefer
this icon for settings known globally
but probably for some reasons you want
to have it so you can have it so there
we go if you want like more inches on it
you can always just click on this and
can drag it a little bit from here so
that you can have more grooves to give
it a more sharp and dynamic features I
think this is it it is so much fun to
design these icons and sketch and I'm
enjoying making these videos I hope you
are also enjoying watching them and
learning the insights and in details
about the sketcher as well the more
you're gonna practice on any software
the better you become so that's it and
I'm gonna surely catch you up in the
next video hey if you haven't yet
