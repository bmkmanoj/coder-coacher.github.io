bootstrap course now you'll find me at
the start of every section so that I can
tell you what I expect you by far now
what kind of things I expect that you
would be ready now and what you can
expect in this section now so far we
have just covered up one basic section
but I expect a few things with you now I
expect that you should be ready with
your favorite editor might happen to be
Adam I'll be using it throughout the
course but in case if you are a die-hard
fan of sublime text hey I get a back off
there I completely understand that now I
also expect that you might be having a
CD and install of the bootstrap now here
is one quick word that I want to get in
here now if you want to get started with
the CD and you should always be
connected to through the internet
because I hope you understand that it's
there to a content delivery network
system which works on the Internet
now in case Internet is an issue then
you might want to download the jQuery
the tether and the bootstrap GS as well
as boost FCS on on your system and we
will walk through there so that was
section one quite easy and quite
friendly now what you can expect in this
section too now this is the section
where we are going to first touch our
bootstrap and you might have noticed
that browser applies some of its own
default styling to your text tags your
paragraphs and that is one of the
reasons why your website looks little
bit different on Chrome than Mozilla
Firefox and we won't be getting started
on Internet Explorer's let's leave that
so we learn how we can just overwrite
those stylish styles simply by importing
our CSS file of the bootstrap now our
main focus in this section would be text
and images we'll walk through with a lot
of text tags like paragraphs h1 displays
and that's all further we'll also
explore what are the images what we can
do with the images in the bootstrap now
as soon as we learned that we'll try to
throw up everything on our very cool
landing page now just a quick word in
here I would not call this as a perfect
landing page a perfect landing page
should always have a call-to-action
button like Buy Now or check more or
something now but we haven't learned
about the buttons yet not at all any
problem we are going to just learn and
apply whatever we have learned in the
project obviously things are coming up
more into the course so you don't have
to worry about anything there I think
this is quite enough prep talk there and
now let's go ahead and move into the
section and write some code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
