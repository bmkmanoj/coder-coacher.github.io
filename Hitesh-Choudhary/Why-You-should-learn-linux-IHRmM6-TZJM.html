lots of different software everything is
open-source is compatible with a lot of
low-end hardware's and doesn't require
antivirus but these are the reasons
which you read in every single blog
which say stuff five reasons to learn
about Linux top ten reasons to learn
Linux and all such crappy blogs that you
read around but these reasons definitely
are not at all convincing enough to make
sure that you get started to learn Linux
but in this video I'm going to be
sharing why you should be learning Linux
okay so everybody has heard about these
things that it's open source it's free
it comes up with a lots of distribution
and everything like that but to be
honest for me these reasons have never
been convinced enough so that I can get
started to learn Linux these are all
crappy reasons honestly if I would have
been a Windows user or Mac users and you
say that hey it doesn't require an
anti-virus or something like that or a
lot of software's are free there I
wouldn't be jumping on to learning Linux
because I would say why would I learn
gimp over photoshop because to be honest
let's be practical here there are a lot
of job opportunities that phase we
require a Photoshop expert but there is
no job opportunity that says hey we
require a gimp expert there's a for
designing of a local no it doesn't so
definitely if we get tactical onto that
side people will say that hey or your
mind will say actually that there is no
scope of Linux learning and like that
but it's not at all true it's completely
wrong not to the GIMP softwares actually
but a little bit difference so let me
tell you why you should be learning and
these are the honest reasons I hope many
of you will agree now let's just go back
onto a little different time when you
just saw for the first time Mac or for
the first time Windows and you might be
wondering that why things are so much
different why in the Windows there is a
C Drive and why well on the Mac there's
just an application folder having one
icon so where did all those files go and
why they look drastically different it
might be just the same hardware like a
MacBook interview you have installed a
Windows on
Macbook why the things are so much
different another question similar to
like this when you format a pendrive in
a Mac it doesn't work in the Windows why
is that happening and if you drill down
a little bit people might be saying
words like the format's a little bit
different Mac uses something else and
Windows uses something else like exp XD
fat or fat simply fat32 or NTFS while in
the Linux is basically ext4 now not
going too much into the technical
details but to be honest what is this
filesystem now all these curiosity which
I believe every computer person should
have every IT professional should have
these curiosity will be solved when you
will jump into the Linux for me that
that was basically the reason I wanted
to explore more about computers I wanted
to know more about the file system
structure how the things are different
so that that was all for me I wanted to
have more open mind system that if I
have to work on Windows Linux or Mac I
should be ready for that and as an IT
professional you should be now a lot of
you might be web developers or app
developers and might be thinking hey we
will never
they will never need these kinds of
Linux skills and anything but trust me
if you are into the IT business the more
skills that you have the more you're
going to enjoy let's just say you had a
website and there's some permission
issues with the files and you have no
idea what the permission is what the
file structure is you will not be able
to solve these problems quickly of
course you can look around on the Stack
Overflow there will be hundreds of
answer you will eventually solve it but
that's not the point the point is how
well you are understanding your
operating system the thing that you are
using every single day you use a phone
every single day so you explore every
single options every single setting in
that and here you are working on a
computer in front of you every single
day and yet you don't want to explode
why the things are different why if
there is a command like LS it's working
there but in the Windows it's not
working there so all the things should
be explode these things should be there
so that you can understand what is the
open - that that's actually what I I
liked about it another thing that has
givin me a boost to learn about the
Linux is problem-solving skills now if
your actual coder or passionate about IT
you should understand one thing
there is never ever a smooth ride
whether we are designing a website or
maybe app you will be stuck onto a
problem for quite a long time and that's
how it happens
now when you learn Linux as well there
will be a lot of problems like lot of
your software's will not be compatible
or might not be compatible sometimes you
don't have to get connected your Wi-Fi
so much easily or many problems like
that
now these problem solving skills may
give you a little bit of the boost to
that years I want to solve that problem
I want to have that so that's that's how
actually it got started with me now most
people why they do get started in Linux
is basically of two simple reasons they
found a bun to much more attracting or
maybe sent OS was already installed on
their school and the second reason they
wanted to get started in information
security and they found out that lots of
information security tools are already
pre-installed in backtrack or colleague
so these are the two main reasons why
people get started with the Linux now I
I have no problem with that definitely
if you have got started already with the
Linux and it's the great thing you
should definitely do that no matter what
the reason you might coming up from the
InfoSec industry or from any other just
curiosity just do that now let me give
you also a quick tip about getting
started with the Linux now nowadays
things are really really easy I did a
lot of certification in the Linux almost
seven or eight years ago things were
really different online industry was not
that much good now you can just buy the
most greatest quotes on the Linux in
around fifty or sixty dollars anywhere
now I'm not selling you anything in here
I'm just saying go ahead do a little bit
of research or discuss with other people
or me to grab a great code so the Linux
online industry is so much great now
that you can just buy any course and
fifty or sixty dollars from the greatest
professional who is actually being
delivering or teaching the Linux for
almost ten or eleven
so go ahead grab yourself a great quote
on Linux and just try it out but again a
very good point that I can give to you
is don't switch on Linux now you might
get that completely wrong I'm not saying
if you wish you can surely but right
from the straightforward if you are get
getting attracted with the Linux system
don't switch it yet because you will
face a lot of problem and that
frustrating might land you up in not
using the Linux so what you should do
you should just use the software known
as virtual box which is going to install
the entire Linux system on top of your
operating system just like a software
just like a Photoshop you can anytime
install it and voila it's gone so don't
get into that frustration stage and try
to use virtualized environment and try
out different flavors of Linux maybe you
want to maybe Kali maybe send to us or
mint or Piero a switch look-alike for
the Mac or Windows so go ahead and try
that out I would be really happy if some
of you would try out Linux if you are
just following along with me or just
following what I'm saying I would be
really happy to say that some people
were able to explore a little bit more
about the next and that's what I want to
say in this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
