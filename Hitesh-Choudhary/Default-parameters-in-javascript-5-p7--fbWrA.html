enjoying quite a lot in this JavaScript
series so let's move further and there
are a couple of things which I would
like to talk about these functions and
for that I will be creating more
functions so first and foremost let's
just comment this guy here so that we
don't have to worry about anything and
probably this one as well so let's just
create one more function and this is
gonna be quick revision so here's a
quick thing for you now just like I have
my adder go ahead pause the video and
create a function which says my
multiplier and as the name suggests it
should do the same okay so I hope
everybody did pause the video there and
nobody cheated so we're gonna have
simply let my and multiplier and this is
gonna expect two parameters of course
and this is gonna be like function and
in the pair of parentheses we are
expecting num1 and num2 there we go and
there we go our function definition but
this time we will be doing everything in
just one line so what we can do is we
can simply return a write the keyword
return and we can simply say num1 it is
multiplied by num2 so yes by this way we
are actually saving a little bit of
memory and these little bit memories
actually do count a lot in a big project
so here we are declaring a variable then
doing it on one line and then returning
it here we are directly returning it so
yes these things and nobody understands
at the first and these are not being
guessed by everyone I didn't expected
you to do it but later on as you will be
moving on and when somebody shows it to
you one time you always try to reduce
the line number of lines of code so it's
completely okay and we will not be
running this function because you
obviously know how to run that and
that's gonna be a simple assignment for
you so go ahead run this function and
pass on a couple of parameters here but
I want to discuss a little bit more
about here okay so let's say we are
gonna be creating a new function here so
we're gonna say let and this is gonna be
like something let's just say a user
comes on my website and he clicks onto
the Google link or Facebook link to
create an account and then he wants to
have a course purchase list as well so
let's get started and write a function
for that so
we're gonna call this as guest user and
that is gonna be a function now in that
function obviously guest users should
have a name as well as how many courses
he's gonna have okay so in order to have
it we need to define two things here
first of all let's just say we're gonna
have a name and the second is the thing
that is gonna be course count okay
something like that or maybe in the caps
course count okay so these are good and
we just want to just kind of a return
that back so we're gonna simply say
return simply like this and we will be
returning something like this and I'm
gonna be saying like this hello and then
we can concatenate it with name and your
course count is and then we are gonna be
oops I forgot to have like concatenation
here code here and they're not gonna be
code here and then we're gonna be adding
it with course count there we go okay so
there we go I hope you can see that now
okay so there we go this is our now
simple list here but the problem is
whenever we are gonna be calling a
function like this and we simply say
guest user and we just go like that it
is okay but you may run into variety of
special situations where either you
don't have a name or you don't have a
course count so if you're gonna be
running this function like this and even
if I just get something like this and
run it using console log which is gonna
be saying guest user and run this like
that
now strange things may happen so let me
just press this guy and bring it up and
there we go so what is going to happen
it says hello undefined and obviously
let me hello undefined here and your
course count is undefined and let me
have a space or something like this and
now if I run that again notice this is
what we don't want undefined so there is
a quick thing
to JavaScript that you need to know that
whenever a value is not being defined it
is by default undefined in JavaScript
okay and that is something which
everybody should keep in mind now if you
want to explicitly set any value to like
null you have a keyword here like you
can explicitly set that to null so for
example let name is gonna be equals to
null so this is something you are
deliberately doing which is considered
as a good approach but if something like
this appears as undefined this is not at
all considered as good approach because
this is considered as some case which is
not being handled by you okay so make
sure you always keep that in mind now
how we can take over this situation it
is actually absolutely simple for the
name you can just assign a name and can
say something like on name and you just
have to assign the values here and the
course current is gonna be default so
these are known as default parameters
when you don't pass on anything these
guys take over if you pass anything
these guys says hey I'm gonna step back
and you can just take over so let's just
save this and try to run that so that we
can see that in action and there we go
hello our name and your course count is
zero so what happens when you try to
take over let's just say your guess two
username is our favorite John Doe so
there we go John comes in so this
unnamed is gonna say hey you know what
something is coming up from this
function I'm gonna step back and I'm
gonna let it take over so let's just run
this and there we go
so it says hello John and your course
count is zero so let's just say later on
you decided that the course count should
be updated directly to at least like
there is a default course whenever user
should enroll to website he should be
registered into that course you can just
say one and can later on figure out how
we can do that but let's just say we
have hello John and your course count is
one so this is known as default
parameters and you should be really
focused on that now you can have as many
parameters as you wish if you wish you
can define them if you wish you cannot
like you want to define one but you
don't want to define for another that is
also fine it is totally and totally
dependent on your use case scenario
okay so we're gonna keep this video
short let me quickly summarize that we
always drive in function that we reduce
the line numbers of number of line of
code as well as we have also learned how
we can have default parameters in
functions in JavaScript and it's really
simple in that just like assuming that
it's available we just define it but we
don't use anything like let or water or
Const we just have it that this is gonna
come up we assign a default value and
that's it
our default values are only gonna take
up in front only if you don't pass on
anything if you pass on anything they're
gonna step down and this is gonna take
up okay so I hope everything is clear so
far and completely understandable so
that's it for this video and I'm gonna
catch you up in a next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
