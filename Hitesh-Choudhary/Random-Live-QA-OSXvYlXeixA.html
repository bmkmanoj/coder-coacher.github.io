the connection quality is still
suffering why I'm not surprised it's
always suffering there so this is just
another random life testing out a few
things before we launch up a lot of like
things in here I think let's just test
out a few things because i'm planning to
do a lot of live coding session and
before I move on to the live coding
session I need to do a lot of test runs
so that i can understand what kind of
problems you are facing while doing live
coding with me and all these things
don't worry a lot of content is coming
up I'm just busy with all the stuff
related to YouTube only and this all
thing is going to be published on the
YouTube wait for this week only surprise
is going to come up in the next week and
you all will be really really happy with
this code sessions so a lot of people
are saying hi let me just reply to them
hey hey hey hey everybody hazel hey Bab
patchy shubham free education I love
that concept okay pawan is there a lot
of people you can ask me questions as
well as if you wish this is just a test
live run let me also know in the
comments section whether the screen is
right now or we need to do some
orientation change or also tell me that
if the live stream is going good or we
need to do some more set of change okay
so please let me know that that I
actually wanted to know about content
what content writer is so content writer
is basically a simple and a tough job at
the same time a lot of companies want to
make a website and they have no idea at
all what they should writing they should
be writing on their web pages so a
Content writer is is basically a very
more elaborate than that but this is on
to a basic level of the content writing
writing about the company's what their
vision is what the target audience and
everything but on to if we go to another
level there there is a subject known as
copyright content and that you write all
the legal terms and pretty much
everything for the company I hope that
answers your questions we on hey hey hey
everybody
hey Ashwin hey IEC hi sir how are you
I'm really good how are you how are you
faisal I'm really good in here and C
sharp xamarin good platform to make a
pot for app so I junk here I hope I'm
pronouncing that correct I'm not a big
fan of xamarin somewhat maybe there's no
specific reason why I'm not a big fan of
Z brain but I don't like xamarin for
making apps at all no good reason to use
every very have good platforms like you
can go for ionic or I'm a big fan of
react react native reactor produced a
lot of such good app that has presented
themselves quite a lot in the recent
days like the facebook app the instagram
app the messenger app one of the biggest
audience has been on to there so I don't
think so there is no good reason to
learn react so I'm not a big fan of C
sharp insane right now I'm it react guy
a bj s open-source guy okay so uh how
are you hit Asia IEC IEC ki velli I'm
not getting your name but hey how are
you I'm good in here how much can come
earn such in okay such an ask how much
can come on how much do iron iron decent
I'm not the richest man on the planet
yet neither am poorest there as well I
earn decent maybe we can talk about it
some day later on but its life is good
and thank God I got you there i want to
ask so much things i am here to ask i'll
be here for quite some time you can ask
me questions i'll be doing a lot of such
live runs because i want to test out my
connections and everything do let me
know how the quality is and everything
okay we have made it a lot of changes in
the bandwidth in how the live session
should be going on and all those screen
setups and Lighting's a lot of things
have changed okay so sir I mean in
programming what should I do if you
hadn't been programming you should learn
programming that that's it I don't know
how tough that is but ok and life
session quality is good it's also good
ok thanks basil let me know again how
the quality runs out throughout the
session I'm really really expecting this
kind of feedback so please give me thank
you for that and free education is my
second channel ok moving ok I know this
guy I hear them from quite a lot of
emails so free education ok that's good
that's cool ok I'm it asks how I get job
in networking field I MMC a student so
what kind of certification you have done
in the networking what kind of knowledge
do you have in networking how much you
have produced yourself in the networking
that all depends on it I'm not much into
the networking all the one at one point
of time I I realized I wanted to go into
networking really hard but I love
programming I cannot skip that so that's
why I did invent into the programming so
this is it necessary to get good
programming job but you have from IIT or
government college i'm not from IIT I've
not from government college but I have
given enough amount of lectures in iits
nit s even abroad colleges in some China
and in some of the colleges in Paris and
Switzerland universities and I still do
give a lot of life lectures to us-based
universities as well from here I'm
neither from government college and
neither from nit I still do right
lecture curriculum from us and state
universities so being from any colleges
is that it doesn't mean it's a
programming world it's totally your open
showcase world show us your talent and
that's all about it ok i would i'm
working on a music platform of over 1
million data that that's awesome and web
platform with angular 2 and no j is
nearly completed for apps which platform
would you recommend ok first of all your
name is awesome it's damn cool ok if
you're already in the angular although
i'm a big fan of reactors but i would
suggest you for you if you are already
into the angular I think ionic would be
the platform for making apps for you I
really don't want to say this but yep
goes with the ionic but again if you
have already 1 million data that's a big
thing you should be really little bit
worried about the data management and
how the traffic would be management
managed in all of the things okay so for
that particular scalable things react is
awesome but again since you are already
into ionic and angular ionic is the way
to go okay and hi sir screen is good
life string is more than awesome that
more than the last coding session yeah
that that's awesome and maybe we can a
longship I have actually high-sugar Neal
first of all and I have already placed
that particular session which we were
planning to go into the live stream into
another video if you want to watch that
that is there as well we have used a
live YouTube API there as well and the
app is still running you can just
download it in that but definitely in
the future we are going to have more
such code sessions for the android apps
as well there's a lot of things that is
being planned on and I'm launching a
full-fledged course on YouTube next week
i guess if i'll be able to do work a
little bit more i'm working almost
insanely i'm working i'm just leaving
almost five hours six hours a day and
working insanely on that course so i
think a very soon you'll be able to see
that course it's awesome and for
learning iOS development how much time
is required ok problem a for learning
the iOS time is it's time consuming i
would say because there's a lot of new
concept that you have to digest and it's
not about just wait for a second ok I
need a lot of water I drink a lot ok not
anything just water so in order to learn
the iOS you need some good amount of
time I'm not saying that you can learn I
us within few months it requires at
least three or four months of good
amount of training and regular work
because there is a lot of new concept
that you might want to learn it's not
about your regular web development it's
not like that because you have to learn
a concept I likes when the screen will
appear when the screen will disappear
how the things need to be done how the
segways are performed what is table
views and moreover what is protocol that
is one thing that web developer
was quite get a hard time there so I
think yes it requires a few things ok so
next move on stylish Sharaku ok there
are some pretty damn cool name in here
my channel name is really really simple
there sir I'm learning angular know
basics but I want to to integrate with
spring hibernate will you suggest me
book am bit confused why why would
anybody want to integrate spring and
angular and node and why would anybody
would do that perhaps you might be
having your own reasons but I don't get
that why you want to mix up everything
in here I don't think so we are going
hello sir what will I do daily to become
a shower programmer you need to learn
java and create a lot of projects in
fact a job program like a launch of an
amount of apps on there and cannot quite
a lot there ok I want to become web
developer I know a little bit CSS what
to do further hey Rocco you just need to
wait for one more week if you want to
become a web developer there's something
awesome that is coming up on the YouTube
in next week so what you have to do
Rocco is just wait for one more week and
subscribe to the channel that's the only
thing you need to do because we are
coming up with something good in here ok
how do I get my practice with coding
starting from C or from where first of
all what you want to build up that's
important because starting with the sea
I don't think so that's that's taking
you anywhere if you have something
planned up that required see then learn
C otherwise you can just move on in any
language ok being a fresher okay okay
just tell me first of all how is the
content quality this time is the video
having some grains or the quality is
good and how the loves live streaming is
going on and really really really need
your feedback because I want to launch
live coding session in which everybody
can code along with me ok so give me
your feedback please please i need that
sir can we learn android development and
linux development side by side and also
web development
just to get knowledge about web
development okay for think you want to
learn a lot of things at once that's
that's not a good idea although it
depends on what kind of learner you are
you can do so because at my stage
learning new things is pretty obvious
for me so I can learn bootstrap for and
react GS and react native all at the
same time but again if you are looking
up for your beginner then i would say
that stick with one technology at a time
and focus on that first of all then
obviously when you're learning skills
becomes much more then you can switch to
many things there's a lot of time you're
just getting started IEC Kagan asked sir
where are you from I'm right now in
jeopardy lifty of april and there are
some plant should use for travel i'll be
taking all of you with my travel with my
v logs now i know a lot of things about
videography photography and everything
so definitely with the 15 i won't be
able to upload any content technical
content from 15 because i have a travel
but definitely after that we'll go again
back into technical okay can you give a
complete guide for a full stack web
developer it's pretty easy it's just
HTML CSS bootstrap and javascript that's
it that's the full stack developer
nowadays because video JavaScript
knowledge you can move in to react and
with that same JavaScript knowledge you
can move on to node.js that are
completely back-end technology and in
fact you can use MongoDB that also can
be connected with the JavaScript and
everything so JavaScript that's it
that's the full stack developer
definition nowadays okay and hi sir a
very clear video thank you so much i
expect this kind of feedback from
everybody please let me know how the
things are going on in some time i'm
just planning out that this poor
connection things goes off but again we
don't have much of the bandwidth in here
furnish your speaking skills are good it
becomes all it comes with all practice
so make sure you practice as well i'm an
IT engineering student okay a lot of
questions a lot of questions okay okay
come on come on
is just going on there I don't know
maybe if i'll be able to answer all of
your questions are not because it's it's
going on like insane there okay i cannot
even read it now so it's just keep on
going my screen is just getting mad
there okay where can i start again and
it's not ending okay where is it going
okay okay okay i saw a question from
ashish hello sir i need to know more
about ns3 i've been getting many hairs
in my code and history let me tell you
how the ns3 thing got started I was
facing some troubles in my dog trade
with the NSC so I thought I should not
face these trouble again make these
videos and keep that for my personal
whenever I need to reinstall the things
and I thought these videos will go
somewhere from my hard disk or maybe how
does make rash of and everything so
let's just upload them on the YouTube
and I realized so many people face the
problems in ancestry in fact a couple of
publisher approached me that you should
be writing a book on industry I am into
writing a book with one publisher but i
am not getting any any time or anything
for ns3 i definitely want to write a
book on ns3 maybe in upcoming months
i'll try i try even harder to write a
book already i'm just getting asleep of
five maybe six are and working quite a
lot and still on top of that writing a
book is such a such a pain thing ok ok
and i saw its streaming quite well thank
you so much sir video quality clarity is
good ok that's good I know the audio
calera t is not that much kid but my
some of the things are coming up from
amazon i have ordered a few things so
audio quality will definitely improve in
the future that's for sure and Martin
Martin asked Indian yep for sure I have
Indian and how to resolve ok ok ok hey
you take on wordpress simplifying web
development yep I do a lot of WordPress
development and in fact most of my
client requires a wordpress development
do quite a lot on that but again if you
wish we can take up some session on
WordPress as well that is good as well
okay okay okay a lot of questions are
coming up and somebody has got to you
know how to hack I have no idea
absolutely no idea what hacking is I
don't know what you're talking in the
world I have no absolutely no idea
perhaps you are coming up from watching
SQL injection master course or maybe pen
testing with kali linux or maybe the
metasploit course baby I know a few
stuff feel not much so what should I
learn java or android they go hand in
hand if you know Java you can already
get switch into Android within a week if
you know Android you must already be
knowing a Java but you might be learning
reactors but that's another thing sir do
you use adobe photoshop in your web
design no i don't use it away photoshop
is a bellow photoshop is something that
i like to stay away quite a lot because
of their recursive payment it's kind of
a look you cannot get out you have to
use it again again i use a beautiful
software known as sketch app but
unfortunately that only comes up for mac
only but since i use mac as my daily
driver sketch app is that I used and i
use a gimp software which is almost
equivalent in the open source of
photoshop i stay away from the photoshop
it's very expensive very very expensive
and just the recurring payment if they
just asked me I pages four hundred five
hundred dollar for the product I'll pay
I'll pay any day but this recurring
payment is something that bugs me off
even etc t nine dollar maybe fifteen
dollar but it bugs me out take my four
hundred dollar at once and just leave me
away that's the kind of a guy on ok I
want to start ok ok there we go there we
go all the questions are going i'm not
able to read anything anything Jacob
says I'm looking for job experience are
you looking for assistant I us junior
developer ok Jacob i'm planning to start
a couple of courses and yep i'm looking
actually for assistant in is there was a
per if you are looking for the job
experience we can talk on it because i
really need some experience
I us developers as well as Android
developer because there is something big
going on for sure i can give you
experience certificates and experience
letter from a company as well no problem
at all this is the thing we should be
discussing in and private okay so i
think we need to discuss there somewhere
else okay i hope you got that Jacob that
was something important i luckily i
didn't miss that thank you and ok code
pen ok code pen say is a lot of thumbs
up I love code banned by the way your
name is awesome on the YouTube I do post
a lot of things on the code pen and when
students are facing problems in here I
just post the solution on the code pen
students love that I hope you don't mind
taking me break okay there we go a lot
of questions ok ok how to stop come on
at the leaf you need to you need to be a
little bit more things into this is a
programming channel and I think you
should show a little bit more courtesy
there and we don't answer these kinds of
questions okay so you need to get a life
there is there any software on market
which is developed by you yet there are
many there but mostly which I develop
person on my personal time on the github
they are open source I i developed a one
app one thing that I realized fight a
lot was interesting by the way this is a
question by Nicholas was kind of a GUI
version version developed in Python for
aircrack-ng tool which is kind of a
fantastic tool so it's it still runs
really nice and just a complete
graphical you I that you can put up in
your color linux and everything is
graphical again one more important that
I remember is angry analyzer in which
you can just get all your pcap files
from your Wireshark and whatever you
have captured converted into csv and put
that into angry
lizer and you can analyze all the things
into maps and bar chart and all of that
these are couple very soon I'm launching
a few almost 12 12 apps on the App Store
as well they are already in the queue
very soon they will be out apart from
that I design a lot of websites for
clients as well if you need and if you
need some work to be done and you're
asking for that definitely i can send up
your portfolio for iOS Android and
websites as well but mostly I work for
the clients I I don't work get time to
work for myself for my projects and
that's how the life goes on ok no GS
versus PHP no GS any day any day Jose
any day noches I'm a big fan of
JavaScript not a big fan of PHP it's a
good language I'm not saying it's a bad
language but hey where you can just get
on things with ok ok can you please
suggest some cool java and Android
project oh come on this this is a very
very naive question if there are so many
things just try to build anything you
were just built in a snapchat just built
a Twitter maybe a social channel the
vedic somebody can do it simple chat you
can do anything and just subscribe your
channel it's nice to know about
programming c plus plus yep that's
that's a nice language cool language and
thank you so much for subscribing to the
channel we do a lot of live coding
sessions in here and that we are
planning a lot of them and we do a live
Q&amp;amp;A session as well man you are ignoring
my question dead man ok did you ask
something else in here because sometime
I'm hot you can have a thing anybody's
question actually sometimes people just
ask the question I just scrolls away and
in fact I go back on there and it is a
scrolls away again so that is what i
want to start reverse engineering and
exploit development any help where to
begin ok first for your name dead man
you can get started from cortland there
is a web site colon a kind of a go-to
guide if you want to get started for XY
development a very very good resource
being put up there I think there are 12
12 blogs there by which you have to go
through there and it's awesome thing and
complete get started guide for exploit
development okay I don't do that much
because I don't get interest in that and
the best web development ide i use adam
and i think that that's the only thing I
need can you make a video and exploring
knowledge about working as a freelancer
surely I can because freelancing is is
awesome i do a lot of freelancing in
fact mostly i do freelancing and
interrupting in between sir stylish
Rocco ok GTX ok it's so the session is
getting interrupted in between some time
I'll take care of that next time GD x
1050 it is good GP or not i don't know i
don't use GPU much there i just used my
big imac and that's the one machine i
use every day I'm not on windows I don't
play games in fact I don't get time to
play games i would love to but I just
some time boot up my playstation and i
just spent time there but I apart from
that I own I don't get much time and
Moses a just subbed thank you so much
tell me website to practice some Python
problem for big nurse let me tell you
one thing there is no such a website
that can give you project there is no
such website that can give you problems
there are already enough amounts of
problems there that you can solve with
the prion just take any data sheet in
CSV and try to analyze it and do a lot
of things in here so I don't know why
people get so much worried about
projects projects project there is so
much thing that you can do in here with
any language that you can get started
swiftor Android according to IT industry
and this is a question from is from
mahajan ok I'm a big fan of surfed I
don't like that much Android in fact
recently if you're just getting started
why don't you get started with react GS
you can build up app for Android and iOS
at the same time just native apps just
saying but if you want to get started
with Swift or Android i would say Swift
any day because you have a cool accent
ok let me tell you a lot of people say
that this is a fake
send anything this is not because I
believe that any language should be
spoken in that particular language if
somebody is speaking Hindi he should be
speaking in Hindi tone if somebody is
speaking in English he should be
speaking in English stone if somebody is
speaking Spanish he should be speaking
in Spanish stone the all meaning in here
is to convey properly what you are
saying and that's the goal okay I hope
that's clear and thank you so much and
so how can I practice my ethical hacking
okay that that that is a weird question
I hope you are not aware about the bug
bounties that's how you practice and if
you want to practice more develop
something that's the actual practice of
hacking okay write some code create some
creative software that's actually the
hacking okay it's not about hacking into
facebook it's not about maybe you found
a bug that's not how you solve that bug
that is actually the hacking okay i hope
you get that I don't know and a lot of
people are going to rant over this thing
that hey this is not hacking let's just
talk about some other day man I want to
start reverse engineering and exploit
development any health where to begin
hey I just answered your question colon
is the thing that you might want to go
and again it just crawled away a lot of
things goes on okay is that true that
Sanskrit is the best programming
language hey why are you even here you
are just here to make a fun just
trolling just be there you are awesome
by the way and I think we are having
congrats on 11 k thank you so much thank
you thank you brother which is better
android app developer or programming
okay under two different subjects I
don't know do you think jay s is
powerful than java that is that is one
question where you want to keep me okay
i'm a big fan of JavaScript I was never
a fan of Java and especially because
what I could try to control it so much
so much I don't even like it okay so you
are ignoring me how do okay that went
away how to become ninja okay you want
to become ninja I think you need a
tuition from back
okay I think so he became a ninja after
going into Himalayas go to Himalayas I
commented thrice already okay okay I'm
really really sorry for that Muhammad I
don't know where these comments are
going on there just keep coming and keep
going hi this can you make a video
regarding radio buttons on iOS 10 okay
ikik plan that that is pretty easy and
height age can you make a video okay
there we go there we go again how to
hack servers just watch any any movie
that includes hiking or just watch robot
season there you'll learn all the
hacking I believe so just watch robots
gridding from Poland greetings from
India to bartek and you said code land
no it's not code land its core land a
colon colon actually my bad c.o.r.e LAN
I i believe so the website still exists
I haven't checked it in a long time how
can I host my website ok where where
that where that thing goes on how can I
host my website on my own computer you
don't want to do that trust me this is
not a good idea you need you don't want
to just play around with your eyepiece
yep cool and that that's it yep Nisshin
on that Scotland or maybe I can check
that on quickly on my computer what
website that is and can give you some
briefs there ok yep there is kollam
kollam dot b e and as you search it on
google it just says expert writing
tutorial part 1 so that's it ok there we
go a lot of questions or PHP vs.net
which is better any day PHP any day not
dotnet not a big fan of clothes platform
like Windows why would anybody be on
the.net I don't get that ok what is
jQuery that's interesting question
jQuery is the framework trying to
simplify the work that JavaScript does
if you know JavaScript switching into
the jQuery is just a one-day job one day
just ate ours that's it ok try to make
videos more on Android night nice layout
ok I can try that in fact for the
Android and planning to go with
so that would be good freelancing videos
please sure maybe okay can we make
android apps using react GS yep you can
make but it's not react GS it's react
native okay so have a little bit talk on
our discuss something on the react
native or maybe I can make a video on
react native what react native actually
is and yes it can make android apps as
well as it can make I usf you just
basically write code in your apt GS file
which is basically the main file and
that same code can be pasted into
Android and iOS and it just works fine
native apps not hybrid apps native apps
okay should I go for macbook air as I'm
planning for okay can we up okay where
the cushions are going on how to set up
my local okay okay okay okay come on
come on it's just going on let me scroll
back a little bit can we opted for MS in

want to continue react a little bit mode
ok so is carried away stead professional
hackers and security consultant Hugh to
be honest security consultant doesn't
use the cali they just use some tools
and analyzing and all these things Kali
is just Justin always just like a bunt
too just like maybe fedora maybe
anything else it just comes up with a
lot of tools that you need it is just an
overkill sometime what is the difference
between native and hybrid app okay
native app is that that runs directly on
on the on the hardware well hybrid app
are just a wraparound in the browser so
i hope if that that gives you some sense
i don't know if that explains anything
because it's just a quick word there ok
ok so i think a lot of questions i have
answered in today and all I'm saying in
here is I asked the same question 62
times I hand subscribing I don't know
what we have asked am really really
sorry buddy and he's there I think I'm
missing your questions and all those
crawlings i'll try to answer i'm trying
i hope nobody get matts there because i
don't know why people get mad when I'm
not answering question I'm just doing
all the things for you I'm spending time
with you okay so don't get mad there
should i learn android or web
development I think you can start with
the web because that's easy and then you
can move on with the Android please tell
me which language should i start with
i'm from commerce background currently
working as a software tester I am
completely clear that code I am
completely intimated by java and please
suggest yep java is intimidating for me
as well I got scared of the Java when I
first time try to learn it and after
that I had to do a project that is why I
learned it and I never touched it again
III don't like the job I either so I
think you can start with web development
that will be much better for you it's
far more easier and javascript is much
more fun language come
java not good answered asked so many
times which is good macbook air or imac
of one leg for doing android development
and three ties and sometimes doing 3d
animation maya and programming like c++
so you look quite a lot of things
kuldeep i believe you need to get
something like a big imac with a lot of
ram because you will be doing a lot of
rendering lot of android studio so get
something like imac if i can show you my
big imac there go with the big one
install around 64 GBS of the RAM it's a
complete package to hardware one of the
main reason why i use this hardware
because it's stable it's awesome and it
doesn't produce any sound otherwise the
windows laptop gets so much of the fan
noise so i think you need to get an imac
yes if you're doing that much of the
stuff you definitely need good
investment in the hardware and ok ok ok
so a lot of people are coming ok so what
are the languages for the future the
languages for the future j/s javascript
swift and i would say C sharp is also
going it is doing good I'm not a big fan
of seizure but ok ok ok ok so a lot of
lot of questions ok ok we are just ok so
i would say this was a pretty decent
life that we did i'll try to even do
better lives than this one and once we
have enough testing of these lives then
we can move on to the code session so
that everybody can go there and can code
live with me in case you haven't just
subscribed to my subscriber list go to
my facebook page there is a thing that
says live code and submit your email
there and do all the stuff they've
mentioned again very soon very soon we
are going to start live coding session
as well ok so let's just say that this
is all in here ok ok some harsh
commenters coming suck just coming out
there ok i don't mind them people are
just there sometime angry I don't know
ah ok so we are ending this thing up
this is going really really long in here
a lot of people will be watching it
after the finishing
this thing I would say thank you thank
you so much all of you because it was a
lovely session there I try to answer a
lot of questions but I know we need to
