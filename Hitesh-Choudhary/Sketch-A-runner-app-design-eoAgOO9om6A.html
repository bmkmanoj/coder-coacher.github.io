with another video this is again a
designing video where they're gonna
learn something amazing about sketch and
I'm gonna la do a lot of blunders in
between because this is designing this
is designing is almost like coding you
do this stuff you don't like it you
delete it you do it again no such hard
thing about that okay so what happened
today I was doing my regular running an
exercise and stuff and I realized that a
lot of running apps are not so amazing
now what I want from my app a probably
I'll design one for that is when I just
select my goal for running I just want
to see that I don't want to see my
heartbeat I don't want to see a GPS map
or anything I may have an option to see
them whenever I want to but moreover I'm
looking for an option let's just say I
want to run for four kilometers I should
see how much gold I have achieved and
how much it is left and that's it
minimalistic look that's it so we're
gonna design something for that okay and
probably in the later on some more
videos we can design a run or serve for
ourselves no big deal so I looked up on
to pixels and I found this to be an
awesome background for our design looks
pretty dope previously I selected
something else then I didn't liked it so
we're gonna go with this one you can
just pass down the video and can search
for and can write the URL or maybe you
can just search for rather and can find
out your own image I've already
downloaded that it's on my desktop okay
so this is the full sized full scale
image okay now let me fire up my sketch
document of course so let's just press a
on the keyboard and we're gonna go this
time for iPhone eggs I know this is a
weird design but trust me it's gonna
look on dope on iPhone X it's very shiny
device trust me and next thing that we
are gonna do is whenever you design for
i4x it's it's another thing if you just
directly get started here so click on
the insert iOS UI design iPhone X and
you want that top most ugly notch here
there we go place it anywhere very like
just make sure you do a zero comma zero
here so that it just fits perfectly now
whatever your design is it should
actually go below this notch otherwise
there's no sense of having a notch
my Apple could have an arch it could
have been just like a circular like that
just get rid of that okay anyways let's
just not get into that now we need a
design here so what we're gonna do is we
need it runners here so drag and drop
command one two just shrink it we are
gonna just focus on this beautiful lady
here make sure you don't just put it at
the top otherwise the notch is gonna be
like super bad and we want this to be
like that maybe a little bit okay little
bit more come on I want full-fledged
to look here is so amazing that's so
crispy shot okay yep this is exactly
what I want on my screen okay so now you
can drag and drop it at the bottom of
this a gleen notch looks good press R
and we are gonna have a rectangle and
yes of course you gets to try it we need
to mask it B need to mask it and make
sure the iPhone size is 375 by eight one
two so this should also be 375 by eight
one two okay otherwise it's not gonna
fill up remove the borders and they just
make sure it's below the notch and it's
below this image as well now we need to
select both of them and we're gonna mask
it okay now it's an exportable graphic
command one again to zoom it up okay and
this looks pretty dope already but it's
actually so crisp image I don't want it
to shine too much it's gonna just reduce
the simplicity of my app so I'm gonna
press R again and we're gonna have a
rectangle again and yes you guessed it
right we're gonna do the opacity thing
again
it's 375 by eight one two so 375 by
eight one two okay but it's not
positioned right so we're gonna get zero
zero okay now select good and we're
gonna again drop it below the knotch
we're gonna do something funky here I
remove the borders and fill it up and
we're gonna start with nice and funky
greenish like that we're gonna choose
with this like gradient stuff choose
like a little bit funky green and the
next one is gonna have a tint of blue
okay
maybe too harsh under the blue a little
bit like that I want just to smooth out
the things looks good
and now reduce the opacity it's gonna
look dope don't reduce it too much
otherwise the image this image is so
crisp that it's gonna pop out even with
the slightest so we can go with 85 or
maybe 90 let's just hang around with 86
okay let's put it up pretty dope now the
next thing is we want a button so press
R and we're gonna get a rectangular
button just like on to the knees okay
this looks good okay and now what we
want with our button obviously we want
border in this case let's just go with
three three is good we're gonna go with
the white and after the white sorry
about that
okay so we're gonna go with that and we
are going to fill it with okay what
color red is yeah that looks dope but it
should be little bit shinier flattish
red okay
C F one two one two that's our color
because I want the text inside this to
be white and that's gonna look dope if
that is a big red button okay and we're
gonna okay railway font this already is
looking good okay
I something like I quit okay this is a
motivational app so if somebody's
pressing on this he is willing to say
that yes I am quitting collector space
yep looks good okay looks pretty good to
me already but we can this is just a
basic thing we are gonna make it a
little bit awesome so we're gonna press
on to the shadows already looking good
make sure you get a shadow of two and
two maybe a little bit and a little bit
more blur okay
unless it should look good I like it
make sure you select this one as well
and we're gonna have some shadows on it
it is already looking - hope not to you
let me show you how it's gonna look
though
press that key on your keyboard and zoom
this see how crispy it is and how dope
this is looking I already loved it I
like it okay it looks pretty good to me
this is nice borders and shadow ish
thing this is already looking good I
like it I like it already
now let's go and press command 1 to get
it out now I want a circular thing that
how much goal I have achieved of
legislature I want to run 4 kilometers
okay so press o for getting in Oh will
each circle second stands for so see
it's it's over so press down your Shift
key and we need a circle okay so we're
gonna go with nice 200 by 200 yep and
we're gonna Center ish just like the air
I know these all things are not Center I
would probably go with something like a
centering based on maths but later on
not right now okay so this looks good we
don't want it to be filled up we want it
to be with borders so we're gonna go
with like okay 20 yep 20 and make sure
it's on to grayish color okay light
grayish I'll tell you what we are doing
in just a minute so make sure it's a
light grayish like that and then you can
just copy and paste it command C command
V immediately sooner as this thing this
press command R and make sure these name
it oval two because we'll be working on
oval to not on the oval one they are
exactly same okay open to is gonna have
a border color I'm gonna go over the
yellow because it's gonna pop out a
little bit here okay okay this is a very
colorful app and I love it okay now the
problem is we want the circular progress
bar here that's not a problem that's
actually very easy to do make sure the
position says Center settings ends gonna
here and now we're gonna have a gap of
let's just say
500 not 500 maybe let's just go with
8,000 nope I had just just weird with me
let's just say bear with me 8,000 is
okay and now what you can do is you can
just press your shift key and hold down
your up arrow and this is gonna give you
a round circular arrow wherever you want
so if you want a progress bar for every
single stop here you can get that okay
notice the circular here is that is
inside make sure this is gonna get
inside here if you're gonna select this
at center if I select inside it doesn't
look that dope so who make sure it just
says Center okay next thing that you can
do here is come on what happened there
command Z I'll just select the settings
here and let me show you a mathematical
formula here what you can do is whatever
the percentage you want let's just say
you want 25% so right dot 2 5 then
multiply it with 200 and then you can
multiply it with by pi which is 3.14
okay and the full credits for this
formula goes to envision guys they're
awesome so this is this is the formula
for 25% okay so if you have achieved
your goal for 25% that's what you can do
now I'm gonna do a command C and command
C command V so that we have another
screen here and this is screen is gonna
have like 50% of a goal so let's just
see what we're gonna do is come on
settings and again what we're gonna do
is let's just say we this time wants 50%
so dot 50 we are gonna multiply it with
by 200 because my circle is like size of
200 and Malta ply it with with PI 3.14
the Big O so now we have a 50% goal here
we can write some text here okay and
we're gonna say 25% and select that and
we're gonna bump this a little bit size
is gonna bump a little bit okay and
there we go 25% no real way is not
looking good
not at all not at all yeah this is dope
I'll freak I don't know how to spell
that I'm miserable in that okay it looks
pretty good I like it even the % can
have space there looks pretty good now
select this guy and we want a different
color here let's try out a different
color here maybe a yellowish color mmm
how about that okay yeah looks good Mac
matches up with the things wait we do we
are not allowed to have a wait here so
that's not a big deal we can have a
border here and the border can be
whitish the border looks really ugly
okay so we're gonna go with 25% we're
gonna copy this and we're gonna come
here paste that and this is gonna are
gonna save 50%
oops command C it's gonna say 50 there
we go so 25% 50% and I quit so this is
gonna keep a track of how much goal you
have achieved and similarly you can have
like 25 percent 50 percent maybe 51
percent if you want to go with that
precise and you can have the images just
like that so circular images you can
just replace them images by images no
big deal there so this looks this is a
pretty good in taupe and what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna try out and bring it
some kind of thumbnail with that so I'm
gonna select my iPhone X 50% okay and
probably we can have couple of icons and
buttons here so that we can just tap on
that and can move on to the navigation
bar maybe some other heartbeat and
monitor so you can place up small things
here and there okay you have markers and
stuff like that right now let me just
export this entire iPhone X and just
export this guy and I'm gonna try to
bring up a thumbnail from this okay this
is gonna be pretty dope so this is how
it looks like and probably in the
thumbnail you'll see some awesome
artistry work based on this design let
me know in the comments section how you
liked it this is pretty informative as
well as minimalistic thing I would love
to have an app just just say is how much
you have achieved okay enough of that I
enjoyed this
quite a lot that's it for this video and
probably in the next video we're going
to learn something more amazing stuff
about this sketch that's it for this
video and let's catch up in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
