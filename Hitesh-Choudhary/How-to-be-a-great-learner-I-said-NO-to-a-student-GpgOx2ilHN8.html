once actually said no to a student in
taking in one of my boot camps so I'll
share the entire story and the story
will help you to actually become a
better learner now the best part about
being a human being is actually to
become a learner and it's not about
programming or pen testing or whatever
you are learning you should be a best
learner and this video will help you
quite a lot so why did I say no to a
student in one of my boot camp and you
will be surprised that the student was
ready to give me even two times or the
three times of the money that I usually
charge in my offline boot camps so it
was ready completely to pay that much of
an amount of money but still I did say
no for a very very strong reason and
this incident will help you to
understand that so let's get started
hey did everyone get a share back again
with another video so in case you are
new to the channel we talk about
programming and web app mobile app and
pretty much everything related to
technology in here so in case you are
new here do consider subscribing now
let's get back on to the point now I do
some time takes offline boot camps and
to be honest these boot camps are very
very powerful ones and I do host them
sometimes the number of students are
limited and these well being organized
all over the globe depending on where
I'm getting collaborations and sometimes
I do host online boot camps as well and
luckily for me these online boot camps
are always filled up and students are
waiting in here to join those camps now
recently about a six months ago I said
no to one of the student and you might
be asking hey why you said no then the
seats were filled up no seats were not
filled up actually that was a very nice
shell day and see didn't got filled up
that day so the students said I want to
learn from you and want to join your
boot camp have been waiting since two
months and now I want to join it I said
you're most welcome that's what I do I
want to take you in and he said what
you're going to teach and that's a
lovely question whenever you are coming
up into the boot camp or joining any
class you should have an idea of the
what the curriculum will cover and
luckily for me I do have a lot of video
courses that exactly shows you what app
we are going to build up or what project
we'll be doing of what websites web
pages we are going to create up so
everything is there I don't want to
cheat the students I just display
everything that these other things will
be doing and I exactly did the same I
showed him the entire projects and
entire curriculum and what he said to me
was surprising he said these are not the
detailed ones I want more detailed one I
want to learn everything and I said okay
just wait for 15 more days because as
soon as we finish up this boot can we do
have advancement and these are the
topics for advancement and he said yeah
this is okay but this is not everything
I want to learn everything and that got
me a little attention there that what do
you mean by everything what do you want
to actually learn just mainly the topic
and he
said there is no such topic I just want
to learn everything about this
particular subject and I said no I don't
have that much of the time to just teach
everything because honestly I don't know
everything and he said I'm ready to pay
you three times or four times or
whatever you are charging and I want to
take your personal time to learn
everything and that is the time where
the bell rang into my mind ding ding
ding ding this student is not for you
this students will never get satisfied
although the student was really humbling
but that ding ding ding ding was really
nice there simply because I would not be
able to satisfy that student no matter
what I do
that shouldn't will always be carving
and will be saying I want more I want to
learn everything let me tell you the
pattern here
ask any programmer who has been
designing our usf4 for many years many
many years and he'll be still saying and
learning still I am I don't know
everything still ask any swimmer any
Olympic medalist swimmer swimmer he will
say I'm still learning new techniques
ask any basketball player he will say
I'm still learning the new things so
there is no such thing that can teach
you everything about anything whether
it's the web development whether it's
pen testing its iOS development or
Android pretty much anything there is no
such thing in it that can teach you
everything and a lot of people think
that if I'll buy this course I'll be
ninja in the topic if I'll buy this book
or I will go that Institute I'll learn
everything no it's not you make sure you
understand learning is not a goal it's a
process it's a journey that you need to
have yes of course these books these
online courses these offline training
gives you a little bit push in that
right direction so that you can follow
up in a right manner right direction but
these are not going to teach you
everything you have to do your own
research and eventually light will teach
you a lot of things you have to spend 10
20 years in the domain to know a lot of
things still you will not be able to
learn everything so I don't take these
kinds of students in my boot camps who
just keep saying again and again I want
to learn everything I want to
everything yes it's a good thing but
expecting everything from one course
that's a bad idea that that's not
something that I expect from you I
expect that students who are watching
this particular channel must be a good
learner first programming pentesting
these are these are different things
these are later on first become a good
learner okay and good learning means the
journey is never-ending it's not a goal
that you can achieve it's a journey
the nearer you will become be at the
goal side then it's a good thing okay so
I hope this incident has helped you
quite a lot in understanding what the
learning is process is what to expect in
an online course what to expect from a
book or from an offline Institute or
anywhere wherever you are learning be
happy and keep learning I hope this
video has helped you quite a lot in
understanding a lot of things and has
given you a lot of open- things to you
