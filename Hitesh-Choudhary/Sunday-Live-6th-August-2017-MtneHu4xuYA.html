with another Sunday live so I'll be
waiting forward a few minutes because
again just like all the ways I didn't
posted it on the Facebook that I'll be
going live but hey it's Sunday you
should be expecting this I try my best
not to miss anything on Sunday so it's a
friendship days so I would say first of
all to everybody happy happy Friendship
Day to everybody recently got friends at
YouTube so hey everybody I will be
waiting for a few more minutes so that
people can show up can ask their
questions and just like that and in case
you did noticed I'm back at home
enjoying my iced tea just like always so
let me say hello to a lot of people so
hey Sean I had it there hi Kate how are
you I push back a high creative je
that's a good name
hi Priyanka I actually higher faith hi
Naveen hi Michael hi Shyam hi Briana
that's a good name heavy there we go
hi moving the Gurdwara Hayashi Tosh
Hayate Indra so a lot of people have
shown up and there we go let's wait for
a couple of seconds and I think these
Sunday lives are amazing and it helps me
to interact with you guys it helps you
to ask your questions directly I know I
try my best to answer all of the
questions that youtube comment or
facebook comments well it's not enough
it's not enough coming up live and
asking questions and answering them on
to life that's amazing that's something
amazing and I have been a little bit
busy in a couple of weeks because there
was an offline boot camp as well as I
have recorded almost 150 videos for iOS
training it's not yet done we have to
upload it quite a lot more so it was a
busy day busy week in fact please spell
my name
I should I I am it that's not a good
request
should spell your name happy Friendship
Day mo health how are you how did it
remind ABS fries there is no such fixed
format to determine the apps pricing
system first of all it's not gonna be
how much work you have done it's it's
not gonna be dependent on that it's
gonna be dependent on how much unique
feature you are having and do you want
your app to be available to everybody or
not depends on that you can price it to
$0.99
to one dollar and 99 cent that's all was
$2.00 so that's on to you and one more
interesting thing here jpt there your
apps if you want that your apps is
should be getting a paid and there
should be paid downloads then Apple is
the platform and if you're expecting
that your app will be purchased in the
Android Market chances are it's like
this much graph this is Android wear
user will purchase and this is the Apple
where people are going to purchase so
call me wrong here but this is my
personal experience but but in the other
hand if you want that your app should
reach to wider audience and mass
audience go with the Android don't go
with the Apple surprisingly the Android
audience is far more far more aggressive
and downloading the app and using that
on the other hand Apple people are far
more precise in what they need and if
the app is really worth it they are
ready to pay that so that's kind of a
gamble you have to play pricing versus
mass audience so go ahead like that okay
your mystery says Android course is
awesome thanks buddy I am really happy
that they are enjoying this course they
are planning to launch a couple of more
things on Android specially
project-based courses just projects now
basics at all so things are under
construction a lot so tell about machine
learning hi push back if you haven't
noticed I uploaded two videos on machine
learning go ahead check them out in one
of them I created an app on machine
learning so I hope you can enjoy that as
well okay please tell me how can I
promote my business online if you want
to promote your business online first
thing and foremost thing is try to serve
you
that's the number one way writing blogs
writing a conversational post on
Facebook or Twitter they are all
secondary they are all secondary the
more you will be serving to the audience
the more knowledge you will try to give
them or try to give them a product then
people are happy that's number one kind
of a 101 for any business ok so hello
Scully hi Vickers happy Friendship Day
to you hi nice arm happy Friendship Day
to you as well hello sir you are great
thank you you are great too unkilled
akshatha
hi sir hi except ah how are you such an
says web development or software
development or machine learning or data
science now this is all personal thing
like maybe you like web development you
can spend all day in writing HTML and
CSS in JavaScript code then for sure
it's a web development but something
people sometimes people just hate
front-end development I used to hit that
in my early days and they liked Python
so go for machine learning in that case
so it's a very personal thing try to ask
yourself that if I have to sit down and
write a code for entire two or three
days continuously what that would be
will it be Python or will it be HTML so
go ahead ask yourself by the way I'm
having iced tea just like always I'm a
big fan of iced tea
always always drink that ok can we use
JPEG instead of PNG in Android yep you
can there is no such issue but TNG's are
a little bit more good but again JPEGs
are a little bit smaller in size so it's
totally on you there is no such thing
can you talk about competitive
programming no I don't talk much about
competitive and progressive web apps but
for the progressive I can talk in future
there is some plan going on for
progressive web apps but nothing for
competitive as of now hi I tagged hi
Abhijeet happy Friendship Day to you as
well which laptop is best and cheap
there is no such thing that goes
hand-in-hand with
best and cheap no match there if it's
going to be pricey then it's going to be
best if it is going to be less pricey
chances are it might be decent not bad
but decent so don't look for these kinds
of things as a combination it's the best
and it's she no it's not gonna be
because if you are looking for cheap you
will not get a graphic card you will not
get SSDs and therefore it's cheap and if
you if you are looking up for a hardware
now like a good graphic card good RAM
SSDs or maybe fusion drive then
obviously have to pay for that so I
don't I don't know how to describe the
situation best and cheap power and happy
Friendship Day to you Tech card sir I am
a computer engineer so give me some
important tips for iOS app development
ah I would say after taking the course
the recent one that I've published iOS
11 development course go ahead
invest $99 in buying a license and push
out a few apps that can be a couple of
social media apps app couple of app that
uses a cameras and photo libraries and
just like that that would be good but
again I would say I would recommend to
spend at least six months wherever you
are learning like Android or maybe iOS
just whatever you're learning spend at
least six month dedicate Lee on that
platform that is what is going to make
you extraordinary in app development
it's not like a magical thing that
within a month or within a week you are
going to be extraordinary have patience
for at least six months or if you can
spend an ear on that a complete cycle of
moving from iOS 10 to 11 or maybe
Android n 2o that would be amazing
but at least stick for that four six six
months at least
okay okay so some people are posting
some questions in Hindi as well I would
be translating them in English so that
wider audience can understand you need
to understand that Hindi is just a
distel language in the top part of India
if you go into the southern part of
India Hindi is not not even a popular
language
so try to ask your questions in English
that would be beneficial for the rest of
the other users as well okay I hope you
understand that and don't take it
otherwise okay so good morning I love to
see all laptop yesterday thank you so
much I'm having a lot of machines I do
agree on that and even top of that I
didn't showed you my other devices just
like this one I do have a lot of things
going around so this is a couple of
laughs I do have couple of iPads as well
a couple of Android tablets as well so I
didn't talked about them maybe I'll show
all of my gadgets someday there's a huge
list here okay so thank you so much
asking for that London and yoke and says
hey Hiro hey yourself here too as well
pratik says I'm a big fan of you you're
great hey Preity you have a big fan of
yours as well and in fact everybody who
is there so I'm a big fan of yours as
well
data engineer and dotnet which one is
good okay that's interesting
in case you don't notice
in this channel I don't talk about much
of our dotnet and the reason behind that
is you might think because there are a
couple of institution nearby you or
maybe your college instructor or teacher
have told you the dotnet is in a big
demand but where I serve most of the
time in the United States in the Europe
site specially in the Paris and Italy
and Switzerland and a lot of Indian
clients they they don't ask me to design
anything on the dotnet they shortly
asked for Ruby on Rails they surely
asked for PHP they surely ask for
node.js or react.js or angularjs iOS or
Android but never got being asked about
the dotnet and only there is a small
community at least what I think I don't
get much projects on the cart next so I
will talk about it and that's why I
don't like to
Kanna I once tried to look at an
overview of the.net I'm aware of that
that just by looking at the overview I
cannot judge a technology but just by
looking at overview I thought its mood
were controlled by Microsoft and you
don't get much of the freedom there so
that's why I don't prefer Totman
personal opinion personal opinion that's
all I'm sharing here ok so let me know
if you have a course on SQL ah yes there
is some big plans going on for the
courses on SQL - SQL injection it is
being a Longview course I don't want to
get any spoilers here but yes there is
something going on with that SQL - SQL
injection but again no promise is there
because I'm super-powered super busy and
don't want to get any spoilers there so
don't keep your hope up with the head
course because it might be little late
like three month five month or maybe six
month so don't keep your hook there but
yes there is something planned for SQL
happy Friendship Day this our happy
Friendship Day to you uncle as well
hierarchal how are you I'm good
Moo it says so how to put apps on the
Play Store by a license it's I think as
of now is of $30 you have to buy a
license there is a little bit
formalities Android Play Store power
formalities like teeny tiny this much
only compared to the iOS of course it's
a big formality there it takes a couple
of days to revise your application for
license but on the Android Play Store
just buy a license pack your app push it
out there and probably today in the
evening or maybe tomorrow in the morning
I'll upload a video about before you
upload your app on Play Store or App
Store there are some cautions that you
have to get and there is an amazing
product that I have just received and
for sure hand it over to everybody so
that they can take use of that okay by
other apps like Paytm Beam cannot read
OTP automatically from geo 4g voice app
it's it's not like that it's not that
easy but a lot of other payment gateways
when they install their app or maybe
browser they ask you for the permissions
of reading their messages like one of
them is if I do remember correctly pay
you money I think does that a razor page
surely does that but razor pain doesn't
have an app like ATM or something it's a
different kind of payment gateway but
razorfish orally reads automatically
that so it's not a big thing okay
how to start coding Gaurav you need to
visit learn code online dot in to get
started in Cody happy Friendship Day
Chaudhary same to you mr. Reddy happy
Friendship Day to you hi - hi Satish
hello sir can you please tell me how can
I promote my website online just
answered year already which is best for
data science are or Python I would go
for Python this doesn't means I'm saying
that R is a bad language R is obviously
an amazing language but just to work on
data science if I had to learn up a new
language I would not go for it rather I
would go for Python Python is far more
in demand in writing scripts writing web
sites as well Django platform is there
so yes it's in a big demand I would say
go for Python okay I am an ionic -
developer should I move to react native
I don't think so there is such need of
that because if you're already doing
pretty good in ionic stay there there is
no such thing there almost similar
platform and these things arrives for
the people who says I'm getting started
if somebody is getting started in that
kind of development then I would say
that hey choose wisely but if they're
already there that's good
please make a video for aptitude tips I
don't do that I don't do that I'm not a
big fan of aptitude test
if a company is judging me by aptitude
test probably they are missing up a good
employee
to hire who is pretty decent in coding
stuff and knows a lot about the tech
they might get rejected
they might get they might reject me
based off of the aptitude test so I'm
not a big fan of aptitude I'll never do
that okay Photoshop which learn best any
job I don't know I didn't got you there
come bangaluru we are waiting for a
meet-up here yes Bangalore is lined up
because I do have a couple of meetings
in Bangalore or some big ones yes
especially that there are big meetings
they're going to determine our what we
are going to do for the next couple of
months so yes that's our big meetings
surely Bangalore is gonna be there but I
don't think so I do have it that much
kind of a big people list who will show
up in Bangalore if I'll just say I'm
coming to Bangalore I don't think so I
do have that much kind of a people yet
but surely if I'll come up I'll surely
post on my hotel name and everything so
that if people are interested can show
up and we can have a nice tea together
maybe you are a coffee guy okay the ask
how to get started in augmented reality
now the easy way if you ask me
iOS is a very very easy way to get
started an augmented reality but if you
want any other alternative unity should
be a good way to get started and
augmented reality but with that I would
say unity is not such an easy beast to
control
it's a tough beast and he should be
worried about that so it will take a lot
of time but it's worth it totally worth
it so go ahead and get started with
unity okay it does fresher have a career
in Python or experience is needed in
some programming language ah for me I
roam around in a lot of industry what
they consider as a fresher
anybody is somebody who knows just the
basics like functions and loops that guy
is a fresher and if somebody wants to
remove the tag of the fresher from them
go ahead get started working on a
project now nobody is going to give you
an idea on the project look on the
github try to create something that you
are looking why you have learned that
language to create something to create a
product and just try to create a product
with that and you have removed stripped
off the tag of pressure and tab set and
you are ready to go you can apply to any
developer there or any company that that
hey I have designed this product so I'm
not a fresher anymore
you can hire me simply this is my
project check out my book and if you do
remember I did posted a video about a
student getting an internship identify
one of my friend is there identify he
posted app he did posted a very amazing
job opportunity an internship and one
student nailed it down with just one one
line of resumes that was just as link of
github and then a link of where he'd
write his blog post and that's it he got
the internship very next day so you
should be focusing on that instead of
just printing a long page saying that
hey I got this much intent this much in
twelth this much in first semester
second semester turn to that don't do
that it's a bad thing just show off your
project your skills because that's what
you have to do at the programming okay
what is good Android or Java like that
they go hand in hand okay it's not a
good question okay are you working for
any company nope I have just finished a
project for a company so right now I'm
totally free and not working for anybody
but I do have joining for for 15 days
for a company not in India but yeah that
kind of a mini scale project and I have
to go and train the team and that's it
so almost free now okay
please come to India ASAP I am in India
right now till I guess I guess 20th of
September I am in India I have to move
back to euro
Europe I think I'll be going to France
or maybe Switzerland not yet decided but
uh yep that's gonna be the case on 20th
September I have to still do the tickets
and everything so yes I have an India
right now okay how much Mbps of internet
speed is needed to use Android studio
smoothly it'sit's not like that you just
need a constant internet connection so
that you don't get those nasty great and
build errors so just get a constant
internet connection and once you have
downloaded all the things that it
requires that's it the exit how much an
app earns with thousands of dollar how
much an app with thousand downloads
aren't there is no such thing and if
your app is totally money oriented that
I would like to earn from the ads and
that's it there is hundred-percent
chances that your app is not gonna do
try to serve the user that's the number
one thing what we are doing at this
channel if I'll be thinking that hey I
should have learned from YouTube and
that's my number one goal I have to make
videos daily regardless of whatever that
is I have to make videos daily
ultimately my channel will follow up it
might grow up quite easily because I am
posting videos daily but that's not the
purpose of this channel the purpose of
this channel is to interact with you to
serve the quality content here and
that's it I don't care if I have to post
only once in a week or maybe twice in a
week doesn't really care so focus on
serving now that's most important okay
so such as best language for complete
full stack development okay a lot of
people are gonna hate me for that but
JavaScript yeah you can do all of the
front-end back-end and to add everything
in JavaScript please make a video for
aptitude tips now that's already done
which is what is what function in
angularjs that's probably I need to go
into the computer and that's what we can
do okay I want to develop apps in iris
so give me some important tips for iOS
app developer
you can go ahead to learn code online
Dalton I have recently rolled out an
amazing course on iOS 11 go ahead check
that out so you don't need tips you have
got entire course is there any Institute
for IOT sir it will be helpful for
future of our development these things
like I have T development Internet of
Things of in testing with Internet of
Things these things are not easy to find
even if you roam around in the United
States or in Paris or in India anywhere
these things you have to learn either in
a bootcamp in a conference or through
only online so if there is another good
choice you have to go with that okay o
couple live okay that's nice name by the
way hi what is the future of C and C++
is it worth shifting to full stack a
shifting to full stack is amazing and
not a big fan of C++ I got a job at the
Kindle headquarter in the United States
for writing the codes in C++ at Amazon I
rejected that job I didn't got I was not
interested all the company was really
good in hiring me offering that position
but I was not interested in C++ so I
think I'm not a good person to ask
because I'm not a big fan of writing
code in C++ I even turned down the
Amazon job for that so you judge it by
that okay please shout out my name can
you make a video in data science
I will try Abdul Wahab I will try to
make some videos and data science but no
promises as of now I have seen your
video on machine learning I am
interested in them about it thank you so
much for watching that video I'll try to
upload a few more videos on usage of
resident just to remind you here that
these videos are not going to be
creating a machine learning model rather
than applying those machine learning
models like ResNet 50 or Google 50
models just like that okay I am sixteen
I know
Android development what next are doing
twelve I think if you are doing working
on your twelfth class I would say focus
on your studies first
get some good marks and then you can
focus back on Android if you're good in
Android writing the bare minimum codes
not just using some apps so just by
looking here and there they're good in
actually writing the code
go ahead publish a lot of apps okay I
want to build a startup so I wanted to
know what steps I should follow I have a
project idea
techno guru I'm not a big guy in doing
startup or just like that I'm no kind of
a Ambani there to launch it Geo
or neither I'm a bun sell to the Hot
Chip flip card so probably I'm not a
good person to ask how to do a startup
or anything like that okay
happy Friendship Day nice arm thank my
guru please do fly just to fly to you
buddy have patience is faith in the
future there is no such one language
which is future if I'd say javascript is
the future yes a little bit true for web
development but mainly PHP might just
come back and it might just go like that
so nothing is future and nothing is past
it just what kind of your preferences
okay okay love repeted questions so what
about system programming that's an
amazing domain but I'm not a big fan of
system programming I did that in my
Master's if I guess so not a big fan of
that in my master I try to design a
couple of compilers that was my subject
compiler design modern compiler design
and that was their nightmare subject Lee
after design syntax of a language
programming language go ahead with that
it opened up my mind how I thought the
programming is working and how I now
think that the programming is actually
working yeah it's a good thing but how
let's just leave that how I come to
Assam for meetup please
hi mr. ray I I have visited already
Assam once I was there at page 4
University and IIT Guwahati for a guest
lecturer there so I have visited Assam
once but it was little scary and it was
it was really a scary thing
Isana is not such a easiest place to
visit because there was some landslides
going on there and all those nasty stuff
but yes it was a good once I reached to
the tej for university there was a fest
going on
it was amazing there such a beautiful
that visited a lot of places there so
probably I'll try to come back later on
as well okay can I have the iOS app on
Windows I bought a Windows laptop
oh no you cannot now a lot of people
will come up and say hey there is a hack
in tow which you can install Apple
machine on the virtual device I would
say go ahead read the Apple developer
license you might have got lucky and
publishing an app through the virtual
machine or hackintosh but things may get
a little bit dark sighted because in the
Apple developer license they openly says
that all of the Apple software are meant
to be run on only an apple hardware and
if you are not following the agreement
we may take action against you and since
we are publishing your app you submit
all the 50 details credit card pan card
address and everything they might take
action against you so don't play there
it's a fire
you may burn up yourself so don't do
that if you are interested in the Apple
development it's kind of investment you
have to do because it pays quite a lot
similarly you have done investment in
Windows laptop because you are
interested in Android or something like
that
similarly everything is an investment so
go ahead ready for that okay how much
does it end ROI tap come on a lot of
repetative question let's go hi this you
say Django is not scalable
do you know sites like Instagram I
didn't say that Django is not scalable I
just say that I don't prefer that much
of the scalability on the Django yes
it's decently good when it's a lot of
complex code you have to work on with
it's easy to give an example on any
technology just look out for dotnet or
anything you will easily realize that
there are a lot of big junk a big giant
website on those technology but right
now starting from the scratch with that
particular tag
and moving to that kind of thing is not
easy so I know a lot of big nerds who
have no idea absolutely about how the
applications are being built up or how
to work on progressive web apps or
scalable web apps where thousands of
employees are working it's easy to say
that
so don't this internet Google something
that hey apps built in or websites built
in Django and just finish these websites
are building Django how dare you to say
that it's not easy
have you tried to write some code and
make it application that can handle
traffic often hundred thousand users
have you even tried that go ahead try
that out first and then we'll talk about
it okay
I like react native so much how can I so
how much how can I make a wireless
connection game through Wi-Fi in react
native can you show me by making any
video no I'm not into that much of the
death that I can make a wireless
connection game with that probably you
are looking at for is an internet
connection game like using firebase
power so back unless something wireless
connection game I think I'm not getting
there habitant masters yep up with I
have done my masters I have also
enrolled myself in doctorate but I don't
like to work on that because those
people sometimes don't understand what
I'm trying to say in what I'm trying to
build up so I guess I've done my masters
in computers and security so yes
oh this but doesn't really matter where
to get web developers ok one thing all
of you forgot to do is hit that like
button we got so much involved in
talking and talking hey guys you forgot
to hit that like button that's the kind
of indicator that shows me yeah these
lives are going good and I should stay
just here doing all those lives we have
a lot of time today so you can spend
around
hi sir okay I can see a lot of likes
going just like that it's amazing
show your love because what I want to
say on the sidebar here that whenever
you like something or you just like a
t-shirt of somebody don't just hesitate
in complimenting him it's it's an
amazing theme if you like his t-shirt
just say hey nice t-shirt a t-shirt just
like that if you like a video don't just
hesitate in hitting that like button
because your appreciation is always
appreciated
so go ahead appreciate that you like
some food safe way to say to the waiter
that hey the food was amazing or if you
like the t-shirt just say hey t-shirt
was amazing if you liked the video and
just say hey video was amazing so show
some love it's always good I know you
have been showing a lot of love to this
channel but keep that coming up okay
help me to solve my problem linear
layout 5 buttons alignment what's so big
deal in that just get all those five
buttons and hit a linear layout that's
it
I don't think so there is a big deal
there tell about no SQL I will I'm
coming up with that very soon for a
video what about in Swift iOS
development what do you want to know
about that and kept growing audience is
really insecure me to contact with you
in feature no it's not like that Shiva
growing audience doesn't means I'm not
going to answer you yes replies might be
late because there is a lot of traffic
coming up but it's not like that you
have to hesitate even a little bit to
approach me to talk to me it's it's not
like that okay I'm working on an Android
app with firebase is back-end
it's something like quorum hey Sammy
that's amazing that's good you should
keep working on that problems will come
but don't worry you will be doing that
I'm pretty
of that keep going on with that best of
luck for that and if you just come up
with that entirely ping me for with the
link as well I would really like to
download and at least try to use it okay
hello Abby Shaikh choosing right courier
okay which programming language learned
first you can get started with Python
that could be that could be super easy
to get started where to get web
developer projects to get an experience
in it um you don't need to get a project
this design anything what you think that
design a clone for a Facebook just like
a post or like or just like that do
anything it's not like that somebody
will come to you and will say hey do
this project and you're gonna do that no
it's not like that just do whatever you
like
okay Java Android I don't know how to
answer that okay do you have any course
on DBMS not yet as of now but recently
I've got a huge demand on DBMS and
specially in the SQL my SQL connectivity
all of that I think probably this is
because a lot of engineering college in
India have opened up and this is in the
first couple of semesters there so I
think this is because of that but yes we
are planning for that as well which site
you used to get a freelance project I
have used a lot of them up work
freelancer fiber but now I don't use
that any of them because I'm being
approached directly by the clients so I
don't need to bet on them anymore
in fact I I have almost forgotten the
password of my account
everything just comes up on my email
right now but in the early days I used
up work a lot and I have used one trick
there are a lot of people what they do
is they look up for the fresh project
and what I have searched up is the
struggling project because let's just
say a user has given the project to XYZ
developer now that
has left on and now no next developer is
not ready to take at that project
because half of the code is written by
someone else and it's really hard to
read someone's else code so for that
kind of project you get paid extra like
somebody's paying thousand dollar for a
regular that kind of project now that
project can be taken up for one one
hundred and fifty dollar like thousand
and five hundred dollars or fifteen
hundred dollars or something like that
okay
please make video in Hindi I know
Spanish as well
should I make videos in Spanish as well
will you be able to understand that okay
I'll try to make some videos purely in
Spanish okay we'll see how that goes up
okay so which course to take after
react.js I'm not pretty sure how you are
able to just finish up those courses so
quickly because if you have finished up
course like a front-end development and
react.js
I would recommend you to go ahead move
on into app development but again I
think you're moving too quickly spend
some time in doing projects as well
okay machine learning I have made a
couple of videos of machine learning
go ahead check them out on the channel
after this life of course come to
Kolkata
ah as of now there is no plan for the
Kolkata but surely I would like to visit
that city there are a couple of
checkmark lists in my to do list to
visit in Kolkata I will try to finish
them up what about what is about nano
degree nano degree is like a
certification that's it it's not a
degree it's a word that has been
trademarked by organization you know
whom I'm talking about but it's not like
a degree it's not being recognized by
UGC or any other government body there
it's just a certification okay they are
using a word their degree and that's
really a good marketing strategy there
but it's it's not a degree okay how many
programming languages how did you
learned I know the base of all
programming language because it
the loop variable functions classes
objects just like that so I know the
base of how the programming language
work all I need is just a week to
understand the syntax and everything and
I can just apply logic and do everything
any language so just like that what to
do after your front-end developer boot
camp hey mebu I would recommend complete
react GS course that enum that is an
amazing course you can take after
front-end developer bootcamp okay how
help me to solve problems okay come on
don't just repeat it please make a video
about startup and enterpreneurship I
know enterpreneur I have not done any
kind of good startup that is having a
billions of dollars or at least millions
of dollars funding for any things so how
can I make that okay
Sanjay do you like couples sure my show
I haven't watched it in last like six
month or so I didn't got time to watch
TV so I have no idea how the show is
going on right now I haven't posted in
like last six month or so I have
absolutely no idea how that looks in
fact I don't watch much of the
television I don't have time for that so
honestly I have no idea how that is
going on what is your views on Bluebell
game and outside of technology this
reminds me of a very cool incident if
you remember there is a lot of buzz
going on with the dark side of the
technology this blue whale game and let
me tell you one very funny incident
there was an augmented reality game that
was named as blue whale and how that
game was doing was showing you a blue
whale coming out from maybe a floor or
anything you just it was just an
augmented reality game and people
thought that this blue whale game is
exactly same as of that Russian version
of the blue whale suicidally game so
what people did they went onto the App
Store downloaded that app and just
posted bad reviews on that see this is
this is
and awareness about the things they
thought this is the same blue whale game
and the father of that blue whale game
got confused absolutely have no idea how
my game is provoking these suicides and
everything so funny funny thing you have
absolutely no idea how people can get
crazy without digging up really deep
into that so just a funny thing to share
with you okay suggestions for a big nerd
to get a good internship there were
projects a lot of projects that's it is
macbook worth buying for 99k as i am
student right now I would say it's
totally worth it
I know it's it's a big deal you probably
have to take a loan or something because
for a student buying 99k is is not
affordable I I agree on that but what
you can do is you can buy a Mac Mini
that's affordable it's like forty five
thousand or something which is if you're
interested in iOS development of that
kind of thing
only by Apple machine if you think that
hey I'm gonna be doing a lot of
programming it's a very stable machine
by the way so yes I can agree with you
ninety nine a thousand rupees is not an
easy thing to just spend like that in
that particular age specially so go
ahead look for the Mac Mini options that
can also work with you okay how can I
learn jQuery and Ajax I think jQuery and
is already included in front-end
development course so go ahead check out
my complete front-end development course
at learn code online dot in what is data
engineering practices not I don't have
much idea for that please make it video
in Hindi I just applied you buddy that
I'll be making videos in Spanish - good
morning good morning - use of nail enter
into the / or Java EE developer I would
say n white in right there okay in what
programming language does L see us
written let's keep that a secret very
live I live in the beautiful city of
Jaipur and
sometimes I just ignored it but I
realized that it's a beautiful city when
I go to the city area the main hub part
of the chair for I see thousands of
tourists with their cameras clicking
pictures and then I realize that how
blessed I am to live in such a beautiful
city it's it's really amazing to live in
the cheaper city heritage a lot of
royalness here so I just enjoy every
single day being in Jaipur so online
Java applied 30,000 thousands monthly
okay what's F number so some spams are
going on just trying to get your
information don't do that just ban than
all these guys okay I speak my name's
your name's is Tina hi Tina hi how are
you do you have any curse on DBMS not as
of now no video Hindi please video will
be in Spanish for you only so Santa Paul
surely I'll make a video in Spanish for
you hey Dave my length class has started
I'm not getting time to complete my app
any tips I would say focus on your
studies first because you're eleventh
and twelfth or something that's once
it's gone it's not gonna come back
programming is gonna be there so focus
on your studies first I know a lot of
people
I just want to directly get started in
Abdel depend on something you can spend
some time on sunday is just like hobbies
or something but again to make sure that
your studies don't compromise with that
okay so nice t-shirt haha thank you haha
it's a nice t-shirt decent eye bro hi
Ashley how are you okay hi Suresh okay
come on a lot of people sir your God
gifted or learn everything yourself
nobody's God gifted it's not like that
when I was born I knew programming it's
not like that
did you forget to hit that like button I
know recently a lot of people joined up
and if you have joined up recently doing
it that like button we're doing a very
constant live today there is no internet
connection problem here I love that okay
so okay so a lot of questions but I'm
not able to read them they're just going
magic just like that I'm a machine
learning in Android what's best Python
or tensorflow
that's that's a very naive question it's
not like it's like you're asking that
hey I don't even have words to describe
this but a Python a tensorflow do you
even know that tensorflow is completely
dependent on pythons so and machine
learning is not easy to fly on in
android right now there are no such big
famous libraries so that you can do that
Apple has done a pretty good job with a
machine learning kit but a lot of
message is coming up from Facebook as
well okay a belated happy birthday thank
you so much
in case a lot of you didn't know I 2nd
of August is my birthday recently gone
and enjoyed a lot that was fun so thank
you so much for all of your wishes okay
- I am in dotnet asp.net vb.net c-sharp
only since 80s what should I do
professional betterment and I'm also
from Jaipur that's good that you're from
Jaipur I'm not a big fan of dotnet or
just like that vb.net I like to work
more on open source and I recommend
people to just get shifted quickly on
open source as quickly as possible
okay it's this degree necessary for
programming not at all not at all I have
trained people who were in the
construction business in my boot camps
and now they are programmers so it's not
a requirement okay should I read you
don't know jeaious series by car
Simpson you really want me to just talk
about everything that's happening on
internet I should be aware of that no
I'm not so and just judge me whatever
you want to Rahul sir you are amazing
motivator thank you so much I'm happy
that if I'm able to motivate some of you
to get started in programming I would be
really happy with that
oh okay make some videos on VI or vim
text editor it will be awesome
no VI of M is more of a Linux oriented
probably in some Linux course I can
discuss that but it's not a big editors
yes there are a lot of commands involved
in it for sure like copying and pasting
and there's a lot of commands but surely
I can try that okay what is your
drinking I love iced tea I'm a big fan
of black coffee as well no milk no I
just like my coffee to be pure and I
love iced tea that's also awesome
I'm a big big fan of iced tea okay so a
MacBook Air or MacBook Pro if you have a
budget go for MacBook Pro sing that's
besito Spanish I'm not good in singing
anything so no chance of that how to
stay motivated and manage time I'll do a
couple of videos on that for sure
eagerly waiting for Bangalore meter
surely I have to visit Bangalore so I'll
shortly notify all of you that whenever
I'll be in Bangalore angular 2 in learn
code online dot M not to at least the
latest version because at learned code
online I always try to make sure that
the technology is latest up-to-date so
that you can get a idea of what is
happening at the market right now
okay so shortly angular but the latest
version if
I start learning Java and Android and
spent five six hours daily on it that
how much time will it take to reach my
first app on the Play Store if you're
that much of the dedicated like five six
hours so daily that's a big number trust
me Kai five six hours daily is such a
big number I'm I'm not sure if you'll
able to cope up with that but let's just
say you're able to do it I think within
a couple months at least at two months
you will be able to roll out your very
first app in the App Store that's the
maximum time I'm dealing up with here
you may be able to do that within the
first month as well but if I'll call you
a decent developer at least give two
months at least with that speed of five
six months usually I say spend six
months at least okay okay a lot of
questions regarding personal stuff as
well what's your students for a normal
day it depends really on it's really
heavily dependent on what kind of
project I'm doing right now and what are
the future plans of that but it always
starts like I always if I'm in jeopardy
French it is if I'm outside that's a
different but regardless of that in if
I'm in jail for I start my day with two
hour of exercise almost forty minutes or
so in gym I don't do heavy weight
lifting or like that I like to do cardio
sand little bit weight training around
40 to 45 minutes and then 1r of swimming
so that's how my day starts every single
day usually that's what I do and after
coming back from swimming I spend some
time in reading important in emails as
well and replying to them so that's how
my day starts and then after I sit back
and decide what videos I have to make
what clients project I have to take down
what are the problems that I have to
switch up so that's how the word keep on
building but it always starts with
exercise to our yeah and that includes
of an hour or sometimes one hour and 15
minutes of an hour 30 minutes of
swimming so that's what I do okay thank
you for answering my questions
you're welcome buddy
so love again repetitive questions iOS
or Android def per carrier can sip
development be done in Windows
VirtualBox
I don't recommend it I don't recommend
installing an entire iOS or Macintosh
like Sierra or like that in a VirtualBox
I don't recommend that any plans for
jabber meetup can be done not a big deal
because I must say I'm any cheaper but I
don't know I have much people from
Jaipur to know me and they will show up
for a meet-up or something like that and
I'm pretty sure if people do know me
that much in Jaipur server I left
penetration testing please reply there
is a very strong reason I left
penetration testing and one of them is
the bug bounty because obviously
everybody have to do some freelancing
you get a lot of projects but with those
projects you have to work on freelancing
as well and in that freelancing stuff
with the bug bounties you sometimes get
really good money like $200 $300 but
it's solely dependent on the mercy of
those people who to whom I have reported
the bugs maybe they want to give me just
20 dollars maybe they just want to give
me a lousy t-shirt then that's a it's
solely dependent on that so the word
flow or the income flow of that is is
something depending on them heavily
instead of me and one thing that I
realized in the boot camps and in the
workshops and training is that in the
penetration testing since you don't make
any product which is in the hand of the
learner they always think that hey I
haven't learned enough there should be
more there should be more there should
be more now it's good that they have the
curiosity of having more and more but
since you don't get a product in your
hand at the
of the day you don't realize that when
you were coming into the course of boot
camp you didn't have any knowledge and
now you know so much so knowledge has no
very criteria and that eventually makes
students kind of a less satisfied Derek
and again it's not like that I have left
the penetration testing domain totally
but now I do it mostly for the clients
for which I am developing websites as
well because through which I can
actually get a bigger amount of money
because I what I've seen is when people
report the penetration testing that's it
they just report it that this is a flaw
and that's it what I do now is I offer
them that this is a penetration testing
I have done for you these are the flaws
and I can fix them up because I know
programming I have designed a lot of
their projects or Android projects just
like that and I get a bigger amount of
monies so I have limited my penetration
testing career now to special clients
only and that is why I'm able to get a
lot more money compared to just what
penetration testers are making because
once you offer the penetration testing
services as well as development service
your package goes just like that so I
hope you understand out okay should I
read
okay that's again repetitive questions
how do you get hired on online project
Android just show them your portfolio
that these are the apps that are built
up in the past and that's it that's it
belated happy birthday thank you so much
I really appreciate that
happy birthday sir thank you so much I
appreciate that I appreciate that
Android concept and shandricka showed
I'd really appreciate that branches with
not much programming I don't know
web development or iOS depending upon
future scope and money scope is
everywhere scope is every single layer
for the money part I would say iOS is
little far more money making has
compared to web development but it's not
like that if you
getting hired for a bigger project in
their development surely surely can make
more money in that okay electron
development hints electron is such an
amazing thing you are going in a very
right direction Vinay because I think I
think that you are interested in making
desktop apps for Mac Windows and
everybody electron is such a nice
direction that you have picked up I am
glad on that first of all second thing
is focus on JavaScript and especially
the es6 syntax and that's it that's all
what you need for electron development
okay so what's about what's about
Nokia's new Android phone in case you
didn't notice that in this channel we
don't talk about much on the phone or
reading their brochures or just saying
that this processor is good this is not
good
we don't do that but this channel there
are other beautiful channels that do
that in this channel we took we talked
about more about programming concepts
the core concepts like JavaScript and a
whole lot more okay so let's just keep
it that way okay so you are amazing
motivator thank you so much buddy
okay belated Happy Birthday stay blessed
thank you so much so man thus I really
appreciate that we make Modi thank you
so much I'm in testing right now what
should I learn which has good future
scope I think go for appium or selenium
I think that should be your go-to guide
if you are in testing she'll be that's
an amazing thing go for the selenium or
appium okay it's a lot of questions your
courses on udemy yup they are there as
well in fact they are on a lot of other
websites which are not aware of it like
open learning in Australia a couple of
to tell us in span Spanish there's a lot
of other websites are there okay of
questions some of them are Swift or
react the French is getting started
trying to react although I'm soaked over
the per word still I would say go ahead
start with this react okay
please do it Django project tutorial
surely we can do that Django or Ruby on
Rails we can try with that as well
probably in the future oh okay a lot of
questions are coming up if I'm good in
PHP can I get job in Facebook it depends
if you work hard shortly you can nothing
is impossible
ah okay a lot of questions are just
getting repeated what is the difference
between flexbox and grid flexbox is just
like CSS like you do a background color
a font that is your flexbox and that's
it and grid is almost similar but it's
different the Xbox is nothing
extraordinary it's just a new CSS kind
of variables that have come around okay
so a lot of questions hello we need your
ok there's a last question there ok let
me just go like that what exactly an
engineer doing job after placement
depends on where you get hired
ok so ml in Android using Python and
flask framework what do you think it's
good it can be good but there is as of
now there is no such big and useful
libraries that you can easily implement
these things like tensorflow or
something like that in android apps so
Android will take still a little bit
time to apply machine learning in their
apps it's not a right time to do all
these things in Android right now Apple
has just started it but it's not like
Apple is only going to keep it for
itself obviously Android is gonna come
up with machine learning apps and
augmented reality apps and will open up
libraries for everybody so it's just a
matter of time you have to wait and it
will surely come up okay so top cloud
database for Android development there's
no such thing as top or worse so just
like that if you're looking up for a
cloud database firebase is amazing you
can go for parse if you want more
control and you know how the awsm is on
web server world and if you are looking
for something alternative back-end
is another one so you have two options
there that you can also start with there
okay so I need to block a couple of
users there because they are just
posting some random things here so
probably I'll just block them after this
life
I don't like spammers to go up there at
what time you wake up I usually wake up
around like 4 o clock or 4:30
sometimes five ish so before 5:00 I wake
up every single day because I have to
hit the gym and swimming yourself so if
I'm in Jaipur I wake up around 5:00 or
something but again it heavily depends
on what kind of project I'm involved
sometimes there's some online boot camps
going on from here to get into States so
I have to wake up at night to teach them
and then the gets changed sometimes
I have to talk to people in Australia or
something so she didn't get changed
quite a lot so there's no such good
thing but I like to wake up early in the
morning and hit the gym hit the swimming
that makes me refresh so that's what I
do okay sir I'm from that pool I'm good
with java to enter
I'm IT sector what other should I learn
which should be best with Java go with
Android if you're good in Java go with
Android okay so a lot of questions right
what time I wake up I just answered that
what is CMS probably will make a video
on CMS and what are the different kind
of CMS available for that it's basically
kind of a content management system
WordPress is one Magento is one
blogger is one a lot of them okay so a
lot of questions did he forget to hit
the like button there Hank buddy I think
you have just joined up a lot of you and
forgot to hit that like button go ahead
do that come on okay let's get started
there there we go you can see the
increase in like buttons there okay
Abraham I I remember your name
now Abraham and as Charlie block you now
okay getting to know about new
technologies in Sunday live that's
that's what I like to do talk about the
new tech that has come up pros and cons
of new technology not the new phones but
can you take like angular or react or
just like that so Charlie Charlie will
do that every single Sunday thank you so
much for coming up here okay so only
because of you I started focusing in
programming before watching your videos
I wasted my first year of BTech you are
lucky Rahul because you have just only
wasted one year I have seen people who
have wasted all four years of their B
Tech and now they are just starting now
so you have you got wake up really early
so it's right good time
go ahead watch out some of the courses
at learn code online dot n or regardless
of that wherever you want to learn just
start working on that
start working on programming it's
amazing okay so it's almost one our life
that we have done today
this was amazing cheers for you guys you
have been with me for one our that is a
big number okay let's pick up more
questions Drupal or WordPress if you
want to go with the Drupal or maybe
WordPress I would like to go personally
with the WordPress because that is far
more easier more popular but there's no
such big difference between Drupal and
WordPress WordPress being more popular
and more plugins are available more
themes are available
so my choice would be WordPress but
there's no such thing as one is best or
one is worst
both are equally good if you have if you
feel comfortable with the Drupal go with
that no problem
okay can you tell about DevOps and big
data Institute to these certification
DevOps is amazing I I don't have much
knowledge about the big data's and stuff
like that because I don't work on them I
just saw it for once in a couple of
seminars but I don't do much in it
DevOps is amazing but there is no such
Institute that I can recommend I'm
pretty sure that there might be some but
I'm not aware that if somebody is more
reliable than that so but I cannot
recommend with that okay happy
Friendship Day to you hit HR 3 as well
name sake there sir HP omen is a good
laptop I have absolutely no idea because
I haven't read the specs there I have no
idea about the pricing issues or
anything I have absolutely no idea what
that HP I mean I don't even have a idea
about how that looks like so I'm not a
good person to talk about it ok at what
time you sleep there is no such big
schedule that when I sleep sometimes I
sleep like in 5:00 in the evening
sometimes 2 o'clock in the night
sometimes 11 o'clock there's no such
fiction enough sleeping or waking up
it's a fiction you okay a happy
Friendship Day to you as well everybody
Amazon Web service it's amazing but it's
little bit costly recently we got a
little bit bill high on Amazon Web
service like a monthly cost rising to
$500 a lot of bandwidth was consumed so
yes we are planning to launch up a
couple of videos on web services Amazon
Web Services well it can go little bits
expensive and I don't think that people
are right now ready to invest like 20
$30 or $50 will just learn Amazon Web
service although it's amazing
but hey okay automation test
what should I do because of AI right now
just go with the selenium IPM ai is not
being him yet implemented in our testing
so go ahead with the appium or selenium
okay so I want to make self-driving a
bicycle haha that's funny how can I go
for that please right now all the
researchers are going on if you look up
for the digital I Triple E there are a
lot of research paper there so go ahead
get started with there okay okay can we
learn I used two different windows or
Linux know you can you can shortly built
up and hackintosh I don't recommend that
and not up with you if you are doing
that you will face a lot of problems you
can surely try that there is no such
thing as no you cannot do it yes surely
you can but you have to deal up with
your own problems and there will be lot
trust me okay which is good laptop for
programming under 40 K I have no idea
okay how to get money with help of
Technology learn programming serve
people with programming deliver your
product and earn money how simple is
that
okay so a lot of questions are getting
repeated thanks but it's not funny okay
so it looks like a lot of questions are
getting repeated and I think we can just
call it a day for this this was a pretty
good sending life that we have done one
hour further pleasure in full time relax
saying just like that but now I would
like to say bye-bye to everybody we have
spent a good time don't forget to catch
me up in the next Sunday live and don't
forget to hit that subscribe button and
ban button so that you can get notified
whenever I come live or whenever I
upload a video you can just do that
subscribe and hit that Bell icon so with
this I would say bye bye for everybody
surely catch you up in the next
life don't forget we go live every
single Sunday to answer all the
questions that's it for this video and
let's meet up in the next video bye bye
everybody bye bye Amir bye bye
Loretta love it to all of you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
