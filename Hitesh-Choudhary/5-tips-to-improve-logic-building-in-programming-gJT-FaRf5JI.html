again with another video in this video I
want to discuss something awesome and
something important this Christian has
been into my emails for quite a long
time and a lot of people just ask this
question the question is really simple
how I can get better in programming
logic or building logics or solving
bigger problems by making it into a
smaller chunks and writing code for that
pretty common question that is being
asked now in this video I will give you
five awesome tips so that you can get
better in solving logic so let's get
started here
now the very first thing that you need
to understand before we move on and
proceed with the five tips is that the
more experience you will have the better
programmer you will become now in case
you are thinking that the person who is
fittingly code online or offline or in
the book it's far more better than me
then of course it's true because he has
spent pretty much a more a huge amount
of time compared to you in the
programming world and he has faced a lot
more problems than you so that is why he
is becoming better a simple example that
I would like to give you is can you
write a program for finding odd and even
between 0 and 100 probably first time it
was really tough the second time it was
comparatively easy for the first time
but on the tenth time it became just
like a breeze you just cruise through
over it but yes in the first time it was
very tough so what I'm trying to say
here is experience is the key and
experience good experience comes with a
bad experience so it's a kind of a
change so don't get disheartened and
let's start our five awesome tips to
improve your programming logic building
skill now in the number one point I
would like to keep is heat moving on
the moment you have just understood what
I'm trying to say here is that is the
very first step of building logic then I
say keep moving on I say that once you
have solved a problem don't just repeat
it too many times two or three times is
okay but don't repeat it too much
there's too much out here for example
you are learning how you can find odd or
even number just practice it two times
or three times let's just say you're
practicing printing different kind of
patterns just look at it for one or two
time but just keep moving on the more
you will try to start on there this is
one of the best thing that everybody
does just keep on spreading to the code
and they don't understand it sometimes
they do sometimes they don't but what
I'm saying is keep moving on try to face
as much as problem as you can and just
keep going on which brings us to our
second point in building the programming
logic which is faced new problem every
single day
every day is a new day and you need to
face new problems of programming every
single day if you'll be just keep
printing the odd and even numbers
throughout the week that doesn't make
sense
and you should spacing more problems
problems like if you are making app like
dismissing the keyboard bringing back
the keyboard or taking input from the
users just learn new things every day
this is one of the most important part
because this gives you more exposure to
the real life problems and will help you
to write code and solve these skills
these problems so definitely keep moving
and the second point is paste new
problems every day the third thing that
I want to share his keep staring at the
code that others have written so have a
look speak into the code that other
people have written
now sometimes it might be a little bit
daunting thing and not all like this
where there is a plethora of code on
github so that you can understand how
the people are writing those code and
how the people are solving such skills
and such problems sometimes you can even
take those methods and can just modify
an address that in our code as well but
it's one of the best way of learning the
programming skills probably you are
doing and you are finding the same
solution for the same problem in a
manner which is which solves the problem
but actually is a tougher way but other
people who are doing it who are much
more experienced I've done that in an
easier manner so always in always look
into the others people code through the
github through various open-source
libraries and bitbucket there are tons
of things on which you can look up at
the peoples code so with three points
with a third number point look into the
other people code and peek into it and
try to learn from them that's number
four to improve your logic building
skill is look at the holy grail of
programmers community these Stack
Overflow
now Stack Overflow is a community
website where all the programmers
hangouts regardless of whether they are
a fan of Java or Swift or Jas or
whatever the programming languages this
is a very kind community and chances are
high that's 99% of the time the problem
you are looking at for is already being
posted down there and lot of experienced
programmers have already provided that
solution there and based on the voting
system the problems the solution of the
problem gets high votes and no votes and
most of the time the first answer is
going to be with the highest vote and
it's probably the best solution for your
problem but don't be a kind of a person
who just post everything on any website
don't be like that
because cycler is a community very
search for your ant problems first of
all probably and this is there are high
chances that your problem is already
being mentioned there but try to search
on to the Google as well because this is
the programming community and you should
respect that not like if you are not
able to install it just the Android
studio and you just post like hey I'm
not able to install Android studio these
questions get discarded there so respect
the community a little bit and it's a
very kind community if you are really
facing some problems and are not able to
find solution on there do post your
questions there people are really kind
there and you will get really good
solutions within a couple of days and
that is a maximum of thing so hand
around quite a lot on the Stack Overflow
and you will really enjoy what the
community is now step number five of
building logic is the most important not
the least it's the most important
working on the project now this is super
important
if you'll be spending all of your time
in just writing writing the code for
finding odd and even on printing those
Fazal patterns you will never get a
better into programming one of the key
aspect that a lot of people miss and
just eventually leave the programming is
building up some real-life good project
and for that you have to maybe move on
into different other kind of programming
languages protects completely okay
because end of the day they add this
programming language they just help you
to solve some problems so try to move on
into different language and try to build
up some good project maybe you want to
build an Android app maybe an iOS app
maybe a web application or whatever the
case is try to build some meaningful and
big scale project maybe a system which
takes which gives you a movie ratings or
something suggest you movies or a
calculator or maybe a DSP text
calculation system a simple soft the app
that when you enter the number of cups
you want to drink the coffee
it just calculates the price of that
coffee pretty much anything anything but
make sure you deal up with those
projects these projects will give you
the exposure of how the first flow of
building a project goes on and this is
the most important part without this you
can never become a good person who is
solving a logic pretty easily so when it
comes to solving the logic project I
think is probably the most important
part and is as I would rank it at at
number one so that people can understand
that yes this is important and I can see
a lot of offline Institute and
universities and college just beat the
basic bare minimum spintax and don't
focus on the project so project is
important and you should actually take
those offline or online classes which
walks you through along with him to
building all those projects and apps
this is super important it's not like an
assignment to be given I have seen a lot
of colleges and universities just give
that hey you have to build that and go
away home and just build that No
this is not a way of treating people or
teaching how to build logics in
everything students need to go through a
long with you in the entire building
process of a project once they have done
at least four or five with them now you
can provide an assignment of building
first a component of that and now after
that you can provide them an assignment
or building the wholes project this is
very important now why am i why am i
pacing it so much because yes this is so
much important and on a whole story I
hope you have got that how important the
project is now by the way if you are
interested in learning how the projects
are being done I have an awesome Android
course link is in the description below
check that out and we'll be building can
10 awesome Android apps in that so with
this I'll come back with another awesome
video in case you didn't like this video
don't forget to subscribe and hit that
like button it always shows me that how
much you are liking the videos are
probably not let me know in the comment
section below what more videos should I
create so that I can make you an awesome
programmer and can help you to solve
some of your problems so I'll be looking
forward in the comments section below
and I'll surely catch you up in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
