again with another video yes I know you
have missed me because in last week or
so I haven't created much of the videos
in this cetera because I was out but
regardless of that in this video I want
to touch upon three subjects and three
topics which are very interesting the
first one is star student concept that
is going to help you a lot whether you
have created an app or a website or
machine learning or whatever you have
learned it is a concept that is going to
help you quite a lot the second one is
there is going to be more support to
your questions and the third one is
giveaways are finally here at this
channel so let's start in a little bit
more detail at this video
first of all let's talk about the star
student concept now I have created a
star student concept at learn code
online now this concept is amazing and
the most important part is this concept
is not for only those students who have
purchased codes from learned code online
it doesn't really care about that the
whole idea of this channel is to promote
programming is to promote the students
who have done something something
amazing like creating an app creating
amazing websites doing something
scripting work in Python or machine
learning or anywhere so wherever you
have learned it doesn't really bother
about that the whole idea is to give you
recognize a ssin so that you can be a
source of inspiration for all those
people who think that I cannot do
programming anybody and everybody can do
programming so you are going to be the
next source of inspiration for rest of
the people go on to the learn code
online website learn code online dot in
and on the home page you can now see the
button which says star student just
click on that button and you will see
some of the amazing faces of the
students who have done something amazing
now these are the students who have got
benefit from this YouTube channel from
the learn code online or regardless of
that from wherever you have learned the
whole idea is these students are
successful successful in the terms they
have created something they have reached
to their goal whether that goal is just
by simply having a small scale
calculator app or a big gigantic
application and see or maybe an amazing
website it doesn't really care about
that all it cares is you have finished a
project that is a big deal and that's
the whole idea of star student concept
and in the future as well I would be
doing something great for these students
and there are lots of future plan as
well right now we will be hosting your
photo as well as your work on the star
student page at learn code online now
this is not a marketing platform or a
marketing page so people who are just a
company or organization who have created
something amazing there these apps are
not going to be at star student concept
page this page is totally dedicated for
the students who are first-time learners
who have done something amazing because
that small-scale app the the calculator
or yours first login page even really
means a lot and this whole page is
dedicated to you okay so this sounds
interesting and you have checked out the
page and there are amazing people
already there how you can join up that
page now of course I can not take all of
the requests because it's always flooded
but yes I do regularly check out who can
be possibly the next star student at our
page now all you have to do is simply
make sure you always and always attach a
photo in your email because that's
compulsory and you have to throw an
email with the subject line star student
I receive a lot of emails and I cannot
filter them all of them manually so some
of the work is done automatically by
scripting in filtering out those emails
so make sure you keep the title of the
subject as star student not Dean star
student not a star student just star
student in that email the number one
thing that I'll be looking up for is the
link to your website or your app of
Android or iOS or maybe your github
repository this is compulsory without
having a github repository or your app
maybe at github or maybe at an app store
or Play Store
I cannot feature you on learn code
online because all the people that learn
code online who are featured as a
starter in should have a project so in
case you are using any free hosting
website or anything like that I won't be
able to take you up there and yes that's
it
it's really that simple just your photo
and link to your profile page very have
done or built something amazing and
that's it now on top of that if you can
share some of your amazing stories the
hurdle that you have faced or how this
channel has helped you to promote you to
get your achieve your goal at
programming I would be really happy for
that but that's not compulsory just
again on to a sidebar your story really
means a lot to me if somehow I have
helped you through this channel through
learned code online or anyhow just send
me your photo as well as your link of
your project I would be really happy if
a project is worthy enough I would be
really happy to show it as star student
page update number two now you will be
getting more support to your quest
now I have seen that the recently a lot
of student have joined learned code
online and I didn't expected that to be
really honest but this channel is
growing at an amazing fast speed as well
as people are joining up at learned code
online dot in as well so a lot of people
have came forward and asked me that they
want to give their support to the
platform and I have actually accepted a
lot of them so there will be some
responsibilities assigned to some of
those people so that your questions can
be answered easily so from the 5th of
October you will see that your questions
are more frequently being answered your
assignments are more frequently being
checked and a lot of support will be
coming up now as of now the top priority
of the support is totally in the paid
courses very soon definitely we will be
launching up support for the free
courses as well I always try my best to
record the videos and take care of all
the possible things that can go wrong
but of course support is a necessary
element while learning anything so I
take care that very seriously as well
and for sure in the future more such
support will be coming up and on this
occasion I would like to take a moment
to thank all of the students who are
trying to help other student as well I
have seen a lot of students who are
taking out their valuable time and
trying to assist other people - pointing
out the resources like github
repositories are solving their small
bugs this is really a big contribution
and this is something what we are
building up at this channel the
community who is very kind to help the
people who are starting in the
programming or learning a new language
or a new framework or anything like that
it's really an amazing thing and I would
like to thank you for that update number
three which is really really exciting
and finally the giveaways are here at
this channel now all these giveaways are
not sponsored by anyone I will be
sponsoring all the whole of these
giveaways
now these giveaways are not distributing
off laptops or mobile because at this
channel I don't accept other mobile
reviews or all these things yes people
do send it to me but I don't accept that
because they're not related moreover to
this channel but there is there are
actually a couple of things which we can
you
as a giveaway so what I have decided in
the upcoming future I'll give you more
details but right now I have decided
that I will be sending you some books as
a giveaway now these books will be fresh
from Amazon directly delivered to your
home based on random selection and all
other usual gains things which we do
regularly on YouTube so definitely these
giveaways are coming up I will be
sending you a book and I will be
announcing that book earlier in the
videos upcoming videos of course and
after playing the game or things
whatever the task is being assigned to
you that will be that book will be given
to the lucky winner I think this is a
great way of getting the books and
upgrading your knowledge because
throwing up the random giveaway I don't
think that'd make much sense but getting
an amazing book on Python on Java on C
on data structure on networking is
something that is valuable to all of us
so more updates will be coming up on the
giveaways but finally giveaways are here
and I will be making a separate video on
upcoming giveaways yes I know this is a
long video because a lot of updates need
to be shared up still this is just a tip
of the iceberg of the updates that are
about to come stay tuned so if you have
liked all these updates and if you have
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
