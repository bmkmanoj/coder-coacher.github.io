Android training and in the previous
movie we have seen how we can install
Android studio on a Mac but in this
movie we are going to work through for
the windows guys and some of you might
be asking hey you are in a Mac how
you're going to show everything on the
windows no problem at all I have just
recorded a studio training there on the
Windows platform and this is the entire
movie for that or video for that and
what I'll be showing you is enter
training on the windows now the reason
why I'm not I haven't recorded actually
the audio along with that video is
because I wanted to show you a couple of
tips and tricks on the weight and the
windows laptop was little bit noisy
because it was a laptop of a guy who
actually regularly works on designing
purposes so it was heavily used so again
for the windows guys the website is
really the same developer.android.com
where you need to go and in that you
need to click on the develop tab and you
will go into the Android studio there
now again it will automatically detect
whether you are on a Windows or on a Mac
and the Windows version of the Android
studio is little bit larger than the
size 1.6 GB and obviously takes a little
bit of the time there now the important
part again on the windows side is as
well here and these are the system
requirements that we are really focusing
here so if I I would like to point your
attention there that for the Windows
users it's at least minimum 3 gigabytes
of the RAM but again I just work on on
that and even the 4 gigabytes of the RAM
was sounding a little bit slow but again
that will work for sure no problem at
all so I recommend at least 4 gigabytes
of the RAM in your system if you are on
a Windows and again it works really
great on Windows 8 and 10 no problem at
all I try it on both of them it works
really like a charm
and of course everybody recommends that
more RAM you will have it's more going
to be easy because a GB really is the
point where you want to hit and of
course 2 gigabytes of the free space I
hope many of you might be having all of
that now one interesting and important
thing is this at the bottom and this is
actually the Intel haxon I will show you
at the
which is the problematic point for most
of the windows guys so let's just
forward the movie dear and just of the
things really works like the same I have
already downloaded it double-click on
the file and it will take some time this
is the important part it is going to
take some time there and after that it's
really the same just click on the next
and I have installed everything on the
default again it takes a lot of time to
extract depending on what kind of lamb
and what kind of processor you have but
again apart from waiting and having the
patience there is not much that you
really want to have and it took me
almost 40 to 50 minutes to install and
download everything and again I was not
on the fastest internet on the planet
was around 1.5 Mbps download speed there
on a bandwidth of almost eight or nine
or eight or ten gigabytes there so not
on the fastest side on the world but
here's that that just works for me okay
and after that after once the
downloading is complete or extracting is
complete it's going to further download
a few components and that is the
interesting part here because you can
see after clicking and I have done
everything on the standard no
customization at all and thereafter my
important part here again is to make
sure this is one is checked this is
super important there because it is
going to install and download and
install a hexam which is required for
the performance purpose now at the time
of installing it's not going to give you
any problem there but when you will run
your AVD the Android virtual device then
it really makes a problem so go ahead
and make sure you check that we do not
need Android virtual device because we
will be downloading the virtual device
platforms and everything or setup up
these things later on same for both Mac
and Windows right now we don't need that
so you can save a few minutes there now
as soon as you click on the next it will
just download a lot of components
including the axiom and everything and
then we can just simply wait for the
download it took me a lot of time there
so I'll just fast-forward the movie
there and there we go there we go
unzipping everything and going really
fast there okay so this was the most
waiting time for me
and now just in the last one minute of
the movie or so I'll just lay there with
a regular speed now right now it says
int'l hexam installed successfully now
this is the message that you might be
looking for if you don't want any
trouble for the AVD device there but
again in case you think that hey this
was not done successfully or somehow you
have doubts there let me just show you a
more interesting thing there let me
fast-forward that a quickly and this is
the screen we are looking for but in
case you just want to double your open
up your file explorer and go into your C
Drive so there we go we got over into C
Drive go into Android SDK extras and in
the Intel folder there is a rejection
the hardware accelerator execution
manager which shot forms for the hexam
this is one we are looking for and if
this guy is not installed the Cheka is
not installed you can just anyways
double click on this file there the
application file Intel hack same Android
and double click that and install that
apart from them a rest of things is
really smooth now the Android studio is
much more stable compared to the
previous one all the time when we have
to install and download and configure
everything into the Eclipse but now the
thing is really really awesome so that's
all what we need now once we have done
everything there now what we are looking
here is for this screen now from this
screen onwards everything on the Mac or
Windows is going to be exactly the same
so you do not need to worry about
anything not even a single thing and we
will configure our AVD Android virtual
device or our first project our hello
Would everything from this screen onward
so this was a quick installation tool
along with my commentary on the Windows
platform and I'll catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
