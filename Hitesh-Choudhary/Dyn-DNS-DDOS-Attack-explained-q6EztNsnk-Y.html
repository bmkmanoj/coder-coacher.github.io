with another video and if you have been
seeing news lately you might have heard
the term or the news that entire
internet was being under attacked and
internet or half of the internet was
down so how is even that possible how
can any entire internet be under attack
half of that get bounced out there
answering all these questions in this
movie let's go on so if you have been
seen the news lately it was pretty scary
incident that the half of the internet
got down major websites like github
Heroku read it maybe PayPal was under
attack and this was not just not just
ordinary attack it was pretty massive
pretty powerful and the attack went
through for more than five hours and
this means a loss of billions and
billions of revenue out there this is
scary but how this actually happened so
this was happened because of a DDoS
attack or distributed denial-of-service
attack I'll not go much into the
technical terms of that how this was
carried out what what was the bot that
carried out how the bots are being coded
out there no I'm not gonna do that but
I'm gonna explain everything I in the
laymen terms so let's try to understand
first of all what is dy and DNS service
DNS means domain name service or some
call it as domain name servers what does
the domain name service does it just
transforms an IP into the equivalent
name and the name into equivalent IP now
you and I understand the facebook.com or
the reddit.com but for the computers and
servers it just an IP maybe ib6 I before
or tons of others as well so they just
understand these things when we make a
request that hey I want to go on to a
facebook.com web site they just say hey
you know what what is this facebook.com
we don't understand that so the DNS
transform that requests into an IP and
just serves as the website's back into
the facebook.com form and that's what
all is happening now in order to get
these services we have a service named
as DNS and yes there are a couple of
servers there is not just one server
like DNS we have master slave backup
cache couple of these servers that
go into that depth but yes these are the
services which help us to provide these
kinds of solutions and yes this was the
point which was the target attack out
there and how is that being made
what is this DDoS attack now DDoS
attacks simply is a denial of service
you are not allowed to take the service
or the server is not allowed to give the
service to the people now that doesn't
sounds really bad but what happened
actually is the server is being made
let's just call an arbitrary figure off
let's just say a million requests and if
you'll just serve ten million requests
on to that server
you know server is gonna say hey I'm not
gonna work let's just leave it so a
server is eventually gonna wrap up and
bind up and is going to shut to all the
services out there yes the server coders
for the people who manages all this
request usually use multi-threading x'
and a lot of such server requests and
management all these things but still
there is a limitation for all of these
things there is always a high end number
and in the DDoS attacks when the
requests are being made more than which
is expected out there eventually the
server gets shut down now this is not an
usual case out there because this time
the attack was heavily plan and heavily
implemented out there so how did how did
that actually happen it was happened and
again these are all resources I am NOT
making a benefit now according to the
official tweets it was see severe
vulnerability in the IOT the Internet of
Things you know a lot of things are
using internet now he has smart TVs your
printers and everything so eventually
with some resources a bot was being
designed as well and was implanted for
over months into these kinds of IOT
devices and recently the bot was being
activated and everybody was sending the
DNS requests out there eventually making
a flood over the server and eventually
the server got crashed and why it was so
bad because the IPS were not being
converted into the name and names were
not being converted into IPs eventually
the websites were not being served this
doesn't mean that the web sites were not
under attack eventually on some way yes
they were under attack but the website
data was completely secure
you were completely secure the link
which was connecting you
into the website was actually attacked
and that's why the websites are not
being served and when the things are not
being served it gets a lots of revenue
loss millions of revenue imagine the
PayPal was not active or let us say the
Amazon was not active for let us say at
two days how much revenue they are gonna
lose and the developer might be
completely familiar with the term when I
say hero who was under attack I feel
your pain because I was also doing the
same I was nodding my head and I was
just screaming over it because he Roku
was not working and the developers who
are with me are are working with other
some big scale application know that
when we talk about the attack on the
hero coup or the cloud 9 or the Amazon
web server it's it's kind of a massive
everything is dependent on these three
four technologies are they're not
talking about the giants like Facebook
which are holding their own servers but
a lot of application use Heroku and
eventually hero kuvasz attack so a lot
of web applications were not being
served yes people on the DNS services
like diva Ann were are taking now steps
good steps to make sure that this
doesn't happen in the future but I guess
are getting smart over days and so is
the protecting guys for protectiveness
with that so this was the whole story
which was going all around out there and
I thought I need to come out and explain
that so that everybody can understand
what is happening and was it kind of a
panicking situation for you or the
developers or for the website guys so
this was all about it now let me know
your thoughts what is your thought about
the DNS attacks or the IOT attacks and
what you're thinking about it let me
know in the comments section if you are

you think that this information needs to
