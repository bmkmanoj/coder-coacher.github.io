you can tell from my voice I just got up
and the day starts now it's early in the
morning Sun is not yet up but I'm and
this is what I do you should always get
up early this makes your day much more
productive and much more awesome and one
thing that I always like to do is simply
to keep my phone away and it's getting
dark you might not be able to see me but
simply saying I always keep my phone
away so that I can wake up early and
that's a good practice you should also
follow that up it's not really easy to
hit the gym daily and there's a solid
reason behind that I know what's the
reason because it's hard to show
consistency for health reasons it
doesn't really make sense but if really
that would have been the case nobody
would have been the fat so it's really
hard to hit the gym
okay so this room really needs some
renovation and I have few killer ideas
in my mind and I'm gonna be doing all
the DIY stuff so all the projects that
I'm gonna be doing in this room for the
decoration purpose are gonna be just my
creations I have actually a notebook
here which is pretty nice actually
I like the pages and everything here so
I have written all of the notes here I
really need to do some shopping as well
for this room and you're gonna be coming
up along with me in the shopping as well
but the changes that I'm gonna be doing
in this room are gonna be drastic it's
gonna be purely purely creativity and
I'll show you more around the way in
this village so stay tuned okay so it's
being a super busy day I just went ahead
and ordered a simple table because I'll
show you in a minute what the condition
is here it's really the bad condition
but I have just ordered a massive and
super awesome table and that's about to
come at 4 o clock and just now it's
almost 1:30 I have to leave and drop my
mom to it relative and I have to come
back and show up into a meeting which is
really important for me and after that I
have to catch the delivery of the table
as well so I'm on a very tight schedule
very packed and for sure I'll be showing
you what the condition is and after that
you will be enjoying some views outside
so let's just catch up there okay so
here's the condition and you can see the
tables are really in the bad condition I
have actually combination of two tables
which is really bad one is this and the
bad part is this is on the moveable
tires which is really bad and my pricey
iMac is sitting on it and let me just
quickly show you what's the condition
there as well this is my mic oops I
bumped it and there is another table
where all of the expensive stuff is
there and I am also there let me try to
zoom it there if I can reach you can see
there's a little statue of me not statue
but a rubber impression it's really nice
I always keep it by my side so this is
the condition as you can see
it's really in the bad situation so I'm
gonna be just moving these all to tables
I've been working on these combination
of two tables for almost a year now and
I think this is a time to upgrade I went
ahead and did the upgrade so this is the
condition and I'll show you the
condition once the table arrives and
once I pack that so this is all what I
have right now do you desk super cool I
like it
one of the very awesome desk I have got
over more than two years this is new
desk and I like it and this almost sums
of the day I still have a couple of
works but after that I'm gonna be just
going to sleep because tomorrow is a big
day I have a big meeting and that's all
about it but we have something
interesting for the renovation of the
room let me just show you so we have got
this big roll if you can find out just
by looking it here
there is something mystery coming up
here that's one thing also I do have
some of the papers here there are a lot
of papers going on here
that's all are gonna be used for the
purposes of decoration and I have
actually figured out something really
really cool and I'm gonna be showing
that apart from this I have got few
stuff from the wreaths from other nearby
place stationery you can call it lot of
sound is here tapes more tapes very
called glue cutter
very sticks and we're gonna do is some
fun project with this whole totally
about the creativity in the budget but
we will not do it tomorrow we will do it
day after tomorrow because tomorrow is a
big day big travel big meeting so but
definitely you will be coming along with
me I hope you enjoy today's vlog and
I'll catch you up tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
