code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey there everyone
with a sheer back again with another
video in this video I want to talk about
prototyping and spatially prototyping
with sketch so in case you are not aware
sketch has recently rolled out a
prototyping feature in their sketch
previously also it was possible using
third-party plugins and envision and all
of that but now sketch is giving ad as a
by default but that's not it I wanted to
talk a little bit more in detail and
then we are gonna move on to our
computer and we are gonna walk through
with the process of prototyping and how
does it looks like in the sketch so
let's talk about it
in this video I just don't want to talk
only about the prototyping I wanted to
talk a little bit more about the entire
design community who are using the
sketch versus the Photoshop and a little
bit debate about that first of all let
me walk you through that I am an early
adopter of the sketch I loved the
product when the initial release was
made and I have seen the progress that
this product has made from the early
days to right now parrot is standing
there has been an outstanding updates
that has been released with the sketch
and of course when things are going
really good at the company site people
also love that and I have seen an
immense love for the sketch by a variety
of community especially the programmers
community now usually for a tool like
this usually that designer community
shows most of the love but this time
this tool is so simple that most of the
programmers are also now doing they're
designing tasks and trying to learn what
the design impacts the color selections
how these buttons are being made and how
all these designing process are being
made so absolutely most of the
programmers are turning into designers
because of this sketch and I am also one
of those guys who are moving into the
design only because of the sketch so my
love towards the sketch is kind of a
huge also let me talk a little bit about
the big issue here which is sketch
versus Photoshop now in case you don't
know sketch is not at all a competition
for Photoshop and sketch made it loud
and clear that we are not at all a
competition for Photoshop we are doing
something which is completely different
yes Photoshop can do that but we are
making things simpler and easier and
sketch did that and Adobe soon realized
that that the market that is sketch is
grabbing is unique and our Photoshop is
not competing with that in answer to
that result Adobe released tool which is
known as Adobe design Adobe XD which was
initially free as a Creative Cloud
subscription but soon after that they
have released it as a separate
standalone product and which now cost
like a little bit around seven or eight
dollars per month and this is how they
are doing on the other hand sketch is
like one-time fee and you'll get an
early subscription of that but even
after that if you don't want to like pay
for the next year
you can just keep using their product
the only thing that you should be aware
of it a couple of people mentioned that
in the previous video in the comments
that sketch is not allowing them to use
their product and asking for the key
again let me just clear you on that as
well
yes sketch do that but let me aware you
that sketch is not doing any fishy
business of course I'm not associated
with sketch anyhow but I tried that my
subscription expired like a few months
ago and in case you don't want to again
purchase that just enter that old key
again and your sketch will be good you
don't need to purchase that again so
this is the answer for the query which a
lot of people made in the comments in my
previous sketch video coming back onto
the topic that Adobe soon realized that
sketch is grabbing a unique market which
we are lagging behind so Adobe released
a new product which was giving a good
competition at initial phase just
because one great feature which is
prototyping Adobe built this prototyping
thing inbuilt in their Adobe XD and in
return to the reply of that sketch also
release an update recently a few days
ago and if a few weeks ago and release
this prototyping tool which we are going
to see very soon in our computer as well
I can see that the prototyping in sketch
is right now at a very early phase and I
personally like that this prototyping
thing should be done in the envision
envision is so much better software in
doing these prototyping thing neither
Adobe XD prototyping is so somewhere
near to that or neither the sketch as of
now right now what they are they're
doing with the prototyping is nowhere
near that yes of course I would like to
see the future that how the sketch is
evolving with this prototyping feature
but right now as of now for all of the
client work and everything I'm using
envision and everybody just loves it
there is just one big downside about the
sketch which is it just a Mac only
platform and this is where Adobe is
going to get a lot of their market share
because Adobe is cross-platform and
their Adobe XD or other way design is
going to be Windows as well as Mac both
the platforms are going to be supported
and also they are doing a lot about the
performance issues which are little bit
lower in the sketch when you have like
hundreds and hundreds of screen but if
you
having hundreds and hundreds of screen
in just one page that's obviously not a
good design how you're managing this
stuff but regardless of that I do agree
that sketch is just only a Mac only
which is losing a good market share but
also on top of that I would like to make
this controversial statement here that
yes most of the designer that I have met
personally are on Mac probably it's
because of the true colors that Mac
shows on their display or maybe they're
kind of compatibility with the Cintiq
tablets which Mac is giving but again
this is I know a controversial statement
but regardless of that yes I know
sketch is only Mac oriented but most of
the designers are already on Mac but yes
a lot of big market is there on Windows
as well which is which which sketch is
honestly losing their I don't know
what's their plan for the future but as
of now what I can see is they are only
going to stick on to the Mac environment
and are gonna do what they are doing
already at their best so now let's move
on to our computer and let me walk you
through how easy it is to make
prototyping and do a check of quick this
prototyping thing on the computer let me
also be make this statement here that
the prototyping is right now kind of in
version 1 in the sketch it's not very
detailed and all these things are not
right now up there as compared to what
was there in the envision but right now
whatever we have let's move on to the
computer and check that out so moving on
to our computer let's walk you through
about the prototyping thing with the
sketch now as of now this is the blog
the official blog which made it release
that in the sketch for demand version
we're introducing the prototype yes it
is in a very early stage but I like the
move that how they are moving towards
the better future and there are a couple
of ships as well as video which is going
to help you a lot of course I'll do that
and also the product that I was talking
about is envision which I'm currently
using for all the prototyping and all
these stuff it is a really amazing
product and also I'm not associated with
any of them neither I'm getting paid by
any one of them I genuinely like them of
course if the guys at envision or sketch
if you are watching this video it would
be really awesome if you can sponsor my
channel and you guys are doing amazing
work thank you so much for that now
let's go ahead and move on to this
each file here and let me walk you
through how this prototyping thing is
working this is the sketch which is
latest updated to all the whatever the
update they are having and what you can
see is these are the all artboards here
which we are having this is the
artboards here these are just the text
don't worry about this introducing
prototype this is an example given
directly by the sketch guys so these are
all our artboards the black guys this
one this one these all blacks themes so
these are all artboards and what you can
do is you can select any of the button
or any of the area of that and then you
can click on the top this link guys so
let's just say you want to link this
part of the area to this and you want
that somebody touches on that it can
swipe on to the next screen so they have
a nice inbuilt animations as well so you
can just click on any one of that let's
just click on this you can click on this
link and then you can just link it to
any screen wherever you want and it's
going to display the thing that yes when
somebody taps on this i need to go onto
this screen which is really amazing you
can hit escape to just kind of undo that
if you haven't clicked it yet so that's
pretty easy and once you have done that
you can simply do a preview here which
is really nice and in when you do a
preview it gives you all the details now
notice whenever I click on somewhere
which is not meant to be clicked
legislate on this icon it was meant to
be clicked but let's just say I click on
this featured which was not meant to be
clicked it gives you a little bit hint
that no this is not the area you should
be clicking on this is the area which is
having a separate screen as well which
can take you on to the next screen so if
I click on that notice the animation is
so amazing I like this so you can just
click on this it gives you all these
details and notice it giving me it's
kind of a guiding me through that how
this is being designed so I can click on
that and this gives you an entire feel
that how things are meant to be done
when somebody's designing yes it is a
good move but it is nowhere near right
now to the envision app I found it
really amazing yes of course things are
great and I would love to see more of
the devices here so that I can get more
overfilled right now it's just more over
generic devices but I would like to see
more of the devices which are
iPhone or Android or Samsung devices so
that I can see actually how exactly my
my design looks like there but anyways
right now I believe that it's a very
early phase to say these things but I
love all these menus which sketch has
given to us link they also do have their
cloud account so that you can
collaborate video team and all these
things exactly like what envision is
doing I like this approach I like this
approach and you can also preview the
things so that's a very quick look
probably in the future videos we I'll
walk you through with more details about
that but right now this is a quick
overview of how sketch is trying to do
the things and I would say this is a
step in the right direction so that's it
for this video in case you are new here

well as hit the subscribe button that
red button just below this video go
ahead hit that and I'll surely catch you
up in the next video
