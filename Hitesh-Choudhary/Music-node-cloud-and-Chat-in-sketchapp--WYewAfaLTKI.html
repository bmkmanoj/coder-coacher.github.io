to the other video and in this video
we're gonna be designing not two but
three more icons so a simple music I can
then we have a cloud icon which is very
famous for the sketch and also we will
have this kind of comment or text or SMS
or message I can whatever you call that
so let's design these are actually
pretty simple to implement so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna press a again we
need an artboard so we're gonna have an
artboard like this okay sounds nice and
we're gonna drop it like a little bit
again 500 by 500 so 500 by 500 there we
go
okay and we're gonna move it a little
bit down so that we can actually see
what we are designing so how we can take
this down it's actually pretty simple
first of all press o on your keyboard
and we need an oval now it should be
little bit like broader on the area like
mine is gonna be 130 by 75 I guess so
130 by 75 okay so this is the one I like
of course without the border we're gonna
have it now once you have this then I
think you know it's less fat so we're
gonna make it a little bit fat and we're
gonna move it to like 130 by 80 so
that's that actually looks nice and then
we are gonna have a rectangle so press R
on your keyboard and then we are gonna
have a rectangle okay so there we go and
we're gonna remove the borders from this
now what we need to do is press Z key
and we are gonna zoom it so this is
something which needs to be done using
your arrow keys so move the arrow keys
just like that and then move it a little
bit top till then the edge is actually
completely gone and it looks like a
complete one shape okay there we go
nicely integrated select both of them
and click on Union and there we go now
it's a one shape so we're gonna press
command minus and a couple of times so
that we can have it it looks nice and
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna
press our option key and we're gonna
have a copy of it which is gonna be a
little bit above the last one because
this is how the music notes looks like
and there we go nice and easy
now the next thing that we have to do is
we have to draw a line which is gonna be
connecting both of these guys I can move
it a little bit closer here so there we
go and all you have to do is press your
R to get a rectangle we're gonna start a
little bit just a little bit above this
guy and we are gonna be going a little
bit like that and there we go connecting
it till here okay and we are gonna
remove the borders of course and then
what we have to do
press Z key again and let's zoom this
area okay now first of all it's too much
like take I wanted to be like 216 by
probably 25 that's it I'm gonna double
click so that it converts into vector
and then move this guy up at the top and
this guy also it's gonna align you with
that so notice this point and this point
is now connected here so there we go
that's easy
now comes up the difficult part what you
have to do actually is let's just hit
enter there now what you have to do is
move it a little bit above so that it
looks like this okay that's nice and you
have to also shift this a little bit
above so that it moves like this so this
is how you get your perfect music icon
in case you think that this is like too
much like fat you can always double
click and can keep can get into the dig
of it and can reduce down the shape like
probably a little bit like that if you
wish probably like 75 a little bit more
but I think I did like the previous one
so hit command 1 again oops not that
command C and we're gonna select these
guys and there we go looks pretty nice
now what we're gonna do is select all of
them press command G to group them
together there we go nicely done or we
can hit command Z and let me show you we
can select all of them but here's a
problem and you're gonna be selecting
the Union here sometimes it can behave a
little bit odd but since we actually did
it perfectly I think it's good enough
and what's the advantage of having the
Union versus having them in group that's
the common question so hey let me it
command Z now they're all different
shape now when you hit into a command G
sometime
not always sometimes you're not allowed
to actually have colors and all of that
because catch things they are completely
coming up from different background and
don't allow you that but when I hit
command Z to undo that and hit a union
now this hole has become just one shape
it is assuming just like it's a circle
it's a rectangle this is a shape so that
is always much more advantageous and now
you can fill that up with something nice
like this blue which is default in my
color palette for a 9 0 e 2 nice so
there we go have our music icon so we're
gonna select that guy and we're gonna
keep that at the center okay we can also
do the same for this guy keeping it at
the center okay next up the cloud which
is actually pretty easy
we're gonna have an artboard so or there
we go nice and easy artboard I guess
it's 500 by 500 okay nice and easy okay
having it cloud is actually pretty much
easy you can press just R to have a
rectangle just like that a little bit
smaller like that probably because we
always are gonna be tweaking it a little
bit so I'm gonna have to 20 by 60 the
height is actually 60 now notice here
the height is 60 it doesn't have any
border so we are gonna be doing a radius
here so height is 60 we want 30 here to
make it a completely almost rounded
corners and there we go okay that's nice
now let's just zoom that here a little
bit okay
and what we are gonna do next is we're
gonna have an O for oval press down your
shift key so that we can have a nice
circle there okay and this is gonna be
like I think that's good enough
perfectly 60 by 60 is what I wanted here
but without the borders and I would like
to change the color a little bit so that
I can see it what's happening okay now
the first thing that I would like to do
is place it somewhere like here okay
that's nice and then I'm gonna be
pressing my option key and having one
more and now this time I want to scale
it so press down a shift key and then
scale it a little bit like that
okay and then we are gonna be shrinking
that down a little bit because I wanted
a little bit like that okay now what we
are trying to do here is we are trying
to keep this edge onto this edge notice
the gradient line here so we are trying
to have a perfect rectangle here so that
rectangle starts here so that it kinds
of gifts like this corner here notice
here it looks really really awesome the
almost same thing we are trying to do
with the grid lines here as well so that
it gives like nice and perfect edge and
there we go okay so that looks pretty
decent to me now we can right click here
and can remove all the vertical grids
select all of them and we can just click
on Union and there we go your nice
lovely and beautiful cloud cloud is
ready for you
probably cloud looks pretty good when it
is blue there we go
nice and easy command - and there we go
it's actually much more beautiful as
compared to what I designed previously
previously I didn't use these smart
guides so that's why this corner is not
perfect here you can see how perfect it
looks very sharp I love that okay now
the next thing that we are gonna do is
you're gonna be understanding a lot
about the vector tools which is this
great nice icon so press a and we're
gonna have an artboard again you know
the stuff 500 by 500 there we go so what
we're gonna do in this case let me bring
down that little bit oops command Z I
haven't actually selected all of them so
probably I'll be having command G to
group them
oops command ctrl Z select all of them
command G so that I can move it once
here okay that's nice now how we're
gonna take that down it's actually
pretty easy the only tricky part is this
one where you're gonna learn one thing
so press o for oval and we're gonna have
a flat nice really fat one here I think
285 by 160 is good okay and of course
you know me no borders at all and once
you have this we are gonna first convert
that into a color and nice greenish
which is b8b 89-86
okay in case you want exact same color
now we're gonna press o to get a square
a circle press down
the shift-key and we're gonna have nice
circle and there we go I think the
circle is 41 by 41 I don't like it I'm
gonna go for 40 by 40 there we go
remove the borders and there we go now
this circle is gonna be our fill white
okay obviously green and white makes a
contrast so hold on your option key and
we're gonna have some copies of it
notice how smart guides are helping me
to have an equidistance from nineteen
nineteen nineteen there that looks
pretty nice hold down first release your
mouse and then release your keys okay so
now what we're gonna do is click on this
circle which is the outer one and then
click it one more time so double click
there quickly now it is being converted
into a complete vector now in the recent
sketch like probably like five or ten
revisions earlier now you can add more
vector points and that helps to create
this kind of things easier now how
you're gonna do that let me zoom that a
little bit so first and foremost what
you have to do is mark an anchor point
now these anchor points are something
which is going to help you now let me
show you that it's much more easier
click once here
don't touch and move that click once
here and now what is going to happen
everything from this to here is gonna
remain intact from this this point to
this point will remain intact if you
will add one more anchor point in
between here okay so add one more no
don't don't click on this guys these are
connected with these guys so just click
somewhere in between and then you can
click and drag it so something like that
okay so this is what we are having now
just click and drag a little bit and let
it go and there you go you got your nice
chat I cannot comment icon now let's
just click in here and select this guy
by selecting that now obviously you can
have a straight in case you like a
little bit sharper something some people
like do sharp edges and all of that
completely your choice you can just
click on the sharp edge there just
select the point and either click on
straight either click on mirrored to
have it like much more bold and
something now although these
disconnected and all of them have
different roles to play but obviously
you can use this in other hacks as well
so there we go I think I'm gonna go with
the
little bit like that obviously can drag
your handles a little bit to make it
less Sharpie from both the side and all
of that but I think I like it however it
is it looks it gives me a good feeling
like a little bit roundish maybe you
like too much Sharpie thing you can
always go for that so there we go
now again we're gonna select all of this
and this time selecting the union is not
at all a good idea notice if I just
select that it just removes everything
here we don't want to do that so command
Z this time I want to press command G to
group them all together now the
advantage of having a group together
sometime is almost like Union as well
but the whole point is we want to make
it just as a one shape so in this case
if I just want to scale it a little bit
probably like 120 percent it just all
scales up and that's that should be how
the icon in your application so that if
you want like a 1 X 2 X you can just
make it X portable have it 1x 2x or
probably 3x for iPhones and stuff it
just works like that ok so this was it
this was a quick explanation about all
three icons and some more fun stuff in
the sketch so that's it for this video
go ahead join me on my youtube channel
as well and I'll catch you up in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
