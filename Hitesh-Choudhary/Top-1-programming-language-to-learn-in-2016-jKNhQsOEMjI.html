technical talks first of all I would
like to apologize because I discontinued
the series that's my bad but there were
some reasons for that of course I was
travelling quite a lot around the globe
and also my technical stuff was not that
updated it was the old camera and icon
at three to double zero which doesn't
have at that flip screen so I have to
bring in someone and focus on them then
record a lot of stuff needs to be there
but recently I updated my technical
gadgets and now I can be caught much
faster so welcome back on to that
technical talk I have so much content
being planned and that I really want to
share so let's get started with this the
single most powerful programming
language that you should be learning in
2016 and I can see that it will
definitely going to be scaled up in 2017
so what is that so if you're expecting
say C++ maybe Python Ruby that's not all
it that's this guy
the chain s the JavaScript and since I'm
making a point and I'm selecting one
particular language obviously lots of
people are gonna hate me and some of
them are hard-coded fan of C might be
C++ Python and all of that but let me
make a point here so I would like to
start with that I love pison I have
coded it and I've got it in this
language for about let's say two or
maybe two years maybe more than that
because I started with this language and
not about those little teeny tiny stuff
I have coded it for a professional grade
I have created some information security
tools which are available at github some
of them I lost on my computers and I've
also helped quite a lot of companies to
build their applications in Python so
I'm a big fan of like
and on top of that recently let's say uh
seven to eight months back
or maybe just about that I switched to
Swift which is Apple's new programming
language I created some of I try to
create some of the apps I get succeeded
within that so Apple app I like the
language Swift quite a lot in fact at
first I thought it's the best language
if you want to teach any pig nurse in
fact I still do believe in that but I
also helped a couple of veterans iPhone
and iOS developers so it was a good
experience but still I'm saying not a
big fan of JavaScript now I was not a
big fan of JavaScript in let's say act
for three or four years back but now
this is the fun most programming
language I would advise all of you to
learn as quickly as possible things are
escalating you cannot even imagine the
rate of or accelerating the rate of this
particular language you will be amazed
when you will jump into it now it's not
about obviously it comes with assuming
that you already know HTML CSS but
that's basic everyone knows that if you
still don't know that that's very bad
you should be switching on to my channel
or my website near to me and you can
actually watch some good lectures are
there ok let's leave it there but what
you why you should be learning
JavaScript because it's really great it
gets crazy when it gets out there with
some advanced frameworks like or maybe
jQuery or recently that Angela chairs
the node.js I'm really very very filled
when I just completed a two project
started in the notes yes they are
marvelously powerful I don't even need
PHP ASP or maybe any other language just
JavaScript everywhere so just learn one
language and I can do in terms of things
even I can design iOS app Android apps
Windows app of course they will not be
as powerful as native apps although they
say it but performance wise it's a
little bit lag which non-technical
people will never ever know if they are
even technical people's will not know
about that if they don't know about the
performance
and that's really a kind of a thesis
level topic that let's not go there but
again let's come back here the second
most powerful technology that I consider
right now to learn is JavaScript if
you're still not yet up with jobs baby
you should really leave everything out
there and should get started with
JavaScript of course oh I would say I
would not just make a point as learn it
I would say that this is a part to learn
JavaScript the first one is of course a
steam and then CSS and once you learn
the JavaScript create a few functions
try to do with some things out there but
then quickly switch on to the jQuery
because when you actually polish your
javascript stuff with jQuery you'll
actually start to like the language and
once you then like it move on to
angularjs as quickly as possible it
would be intimidating at first but what
it isn't but once you get on with the
angularjs you will really like this
language quite a lot and then you can
move on to a server side like nodejs or
something
again I'm not advocating any language so
let me know in the comments below what
is your favorite programming language
and we'll discuss it more I'll be much
more frequent in the technical talk see
you out there
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
