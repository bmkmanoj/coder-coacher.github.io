learn code online dot n make sure you
visit the website there is some amazing
content there so let's go ahead and talk
about this arrow function so we have
seen that error function is latest it's
modern it's amazing it's short syntax
and tactic sugar is there so you might
be thinking I should use arrow function
all the time no my dear friend no it's
not like everything that has came up as
a new it's awesome it's amazing yes it
is most of the time but there are always
limitations or something it is not at
all
compulsory that if something is new it's
gonna be amazing it's it's not there are
chances it might be so use it wherever
you think it is gonna be amazing
otherwise you can just lead that lot
there is no such compulsion that you
always have to use it yes I would say
there are advantages of arrow functions
but it's not like I use them all over
the places and I'm gonna show you what
are these places where arrow functions
can make a mess and even sometimes they
are not like favorable to use them it
depends on a use case of course so let's
just get started and talk about all
these things I'm still in my arrow dot
J's file and let's just have it so I
have actually commented out all the
console logs you can also go ahead do
that so they don't bother us much so
what we're gonna do we are create we are
gonna create an object so let's just
have an object for the camera is lying
on my desk so let's have a camera so
cameras oops
and what does cameras have okay and
cameras have price of course they're
very pricey this one is not so much so
I'm gonna go for $600 that's easy and
let's have a weight probably 2000 grams
is good and I forgot to put a comma
there that's why it's complaining okay
and probably the camera has the
description that I'm an amazing camera
or maybe have a brand so let's just have
a brand for this camera and probably a
prize or something like that so I'm
gonna call this as simply let's have a
description and I'm gonna call this as
my desk for description just like that
now this is going to be a function which
is gonna say this is a canon camera off
prize whatever the price is price is
going to be accessed
from the price in the properties okay so
usually what we do is we create a
function we put a pair of parentheses no
big deal have it like this and in case
you remember we talked about it in this
previous video we use something like
return return and use back takes and we
say something like this oops this come
on this cannon come on
cannon camera is off I'm gonna say prize
in here so this like that I'm gonna use
a dollar sign again not just like that
our previously I'm gonna use let's just
use a dollar sign after you can use that
previously as well and in order to
access the property I was not able to
say prize like that if I'm gonna do it
just to remind your jog of pure memory
this is gonna give us an error so let's
just run this and clean the screen and
run this and we forgot to just use it
anywhere so let's just get that error so
it's gonna be log and then we're gonna
say cameras dot my disk there we go
so now we're gonna get error and there
we go and the error is simple it says
price is not defined we have seen that
error previously as well and when I
access this dot price again we are gonna
get resolved this time no errors so
there we go
$600 okay now you might be thinking hey
why we are using the function we have
just learned about the arrow functions
shouldn't we be using them nope
you should not be using arrow function
in this particular use case there can be
different where you can use that in this
use case you cannot let me walk you
through why so what is basically arrow
functions how do you use them you remove
this function keyword got it you use
these arrow signs got it no errors no
problem it totally depends you want to
remove this or not but what I want to
show you is not dependent on these pair
of printed a pair of curly braces or
return or anything remove them or not
totally your choice but now since we
have converted this function into an
arrow function this is going to give us
an error and this is the classic claw
big mistake don't do that please and it
says the canon camera is of undefined
price so what is this undefined here now
this one more thing about arrow
functions is it doesn't do anything
automatically for you now in JavaScript
the huge huge problem was this keyword
this keyword was a nightmare in
JavaScript it just automatically binds
it sometimes it's binds to the window
object sometime it binds to the function
itself and there was no way to control
it
honestly programmers used to hack around
their pass on a different functions and
all of that but now in the arrow
functions
nothing is binded neither the arguments
neither this so they are completely free
now comes of the important stuff if you
really want to use it in this way that
you'll be using for sure in the things
like react or maybe others as well then
you have to explicitly bind this
function and this is a common syntax
everybody doesn't that in react right
now I cannot show you this how you can
bind that because for that I have to
create a use case scenario that involved
react but probably in the future we can
do something in the upcoming videos so
make sure you hit the subscribe that was
smooth but again so please please please
don't do this in here ok so this is the
worst case scenario where you can have
this kind of this statement and function
so please don't use that now here's my
couple of word of sense that I wanted to
give you that please never use arrow
functions in methods and constructor you
cannot use them there so but again there
can be used case scenario but most of
the time people like to avoid them ok
now next to minutes is for only those
people who do understand a little bit
about redux or takes interest they're
probably in future I'm gonna learn Redux
somewhere for rest of people you can
just go off that's it for this video so
let me just walk you through for the
redux guys there is one thing in redux
we do is returning back a lot of key
value pairs and using the arrow function
you might want to do it it's great idea
but here is a word of caution so we're
gonna have something like a function
here and this function you might want to
use something like pair of parentheses
and then you might want to return that
and what we usually do is this
kind of stuff where you have a key and
you have probably a value that value
there we go and if you will be doing
something like this in redux it can get
you in a little bit of trouble so you
will be getting an undefined in this
case if you want to use that make sure
you wrap that up in a pair of
parenthesis this sounds weird I know
this is little bit weird stuff but he'll
be thanking me later on when you'll be
learning the redux so just keep in mind
somewhere in the side corner that if you
are going into the Redux thing and you
are returning a key value pairs which of
course we do in Redux quite a lot make
sure you wrap that up in the pair of
parenthesis and don't just directly look
for these curly braces okay so this is
I'm gonna put a comment and I'm gonna
write a note here this is only for Redux
people okay that's it so this was all
just one more thing about arrow
functions I know it can be a little bit
tricky from starting from here but don't
worry everything will be smooth I'll
make sure everything goes like that as
smooth as possible so that's it for this
video in case you have enjoyed visit my
website learn code online dot and we do
write regular blogs there as well and
amazing video contents as well subscribe
to my channel and I'm sure I'm gonna
catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
