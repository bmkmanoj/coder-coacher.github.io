three simple lines
we've been trying baby
trying to keep up we used to be but we
are your baby I miss
research
you don't hold me back okay
no wallpapers no big deal but you know
what happened after that I got bored
with those monotone as color that I was
using as a wallpaper alternative not at
all good
so another decision came up that I will
learn about Photoshop Illustrator and
sketch after learning Photoshop
Illustrator finally I was making my own
designs the designs of clients that I
was working on their apps and webs were
not being outsourced anymore they were
all my design
then things moved from version one to
version two things got better now
icons were awesome and buttons were
super cool as a graphic part this is
awesome but I was not still happy almost
a year ago I decided that enough of
these graphics now I want to click some
of these awesome photos that are nature
some objects or whatever that is I want
to click them I took a lot of boot camps
online courses offline courses and got
in touch with a lot of photographers
that possibly I could have after a few
initial crappy shots I got better in
them things like aperture ISO all these
became a common term to me I'm not
saying I became a pro photographer but
good enough so that I can click my
photos and can use them as my personal
wallpaper I'm still not a pro
photographer but something amazing
happened yesterday I was randomly
checking my account on website pixels in
case you don't know pixels pixabay are
websites on which you can upload your
shots your photos and everybody can use
them without worrying about copyright so
they are a community service and you
know what the stats says the stats says
that my photos have served to more than
2.5 million people and this is just a
start from one website one single
website my photos are there on lots of
other websites a lot of people just
download my photos and use them in their
templates as a wallpaper or maybe
various other things that even I am not
aware of the feeling of serving 2.5
million people with just a hobby is
amazing it's out of the world my main
job is coding programming which is
already serving millions of people so
far but when
come to know that your hobby skills your
photography skills are serving more than
2.5 million people this is when it gives
you the best feeling in the world no
matter what your hobby is or what your
passion is whether it's programming
taking photos moving to gym or whatever
that is do it every single freaking day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
