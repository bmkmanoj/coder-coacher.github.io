again with another video this is not any
normal video this is a special video
because this is 100k special Q&amp;amp;A and yes
I know a lot of you might be pausing the
video just to watch my tattoo but
regardless of that let's roll that intro
before I take on on to your questions
and everything I go out there this is a
sidebar and I just want to say this
video can be a little bit longer because
I just wanted to talk to you guys
directly just you and me raw talk so it
can be a little bit longer so please
excuse me for that for this special 100k
Q&amp;amp;A a lot of question came on and I
posted a thread for posting your
questions on my Facebook yes I am on
Twitter now with this handle but still
I'm not that much active on Twitter but
yes finally the app is there in my phone
and yes called me old school here but
still most of the questions that I
picked up here and almost all of them
are from the Facebook
I didn't picked up the question that
were sent to me in inbox or in my email
because I forgot that excuse me for that
but regardless of that let's get started
and there were a lot of questions I have
picked up like funny ones and good ones
so that we can make this a fun video and
entertaining as well as educational
content for this 100k special Q&amp;amp;A the
first and the most asked question was
people wanted to know a lot more about
me a lot of people know a little bit
about me that what I do and what I stuff
but people who are interested to know a
lot about my childhood and stuff like
that now probably I'll make a separate
video on that but just to answer your
question briefly here
my childhood was totally rough totally
like broke completely broke to be honest
I didn't have much of the things and
enough things to get all these amazing
things like cameras and laptops yes so I
have struggled quite a lot but the
moment I started programming everything
was really great and in fact I'm now one
of the lucky persons who can actually do
whatever he likes to do being on YouTube
or coding or programming or traveling
around the world
driving the Harley these are like the
things that I wanted to do however and
I'm doing them right now so it's kind of
a dream come true
apart from that it's not something that
that is so much to share at least in
this video for sure I'll talk more about
my education qualification and
everything maybe later on in some other
video I do have a kind of my resume a
video they are up there but just to give
you a context about my education yes I
am Anja near by degree as well as by
passion has well most
I make youtube videos and code I love to
be called as programmer as well as
youtuber so that's a brief intro about
that I am a big fan of iced tea as well
as good quality coffee you might have
seen that in Sunday lives and everything
I'm insanely crazy about good quality
iced tea as well as coffee fan as well I
have so many friends but yes a couple of
them are really close to me because they
are my childhood friend but I absolutely
love to meet people make new friends all
around the globe you can call me kind of
a friendly nature I have been to various
colleges and those people are still in
touch with me I absolutely love that
part see this can be a little bit longer
so maybe we will talk about what what is
all about me and everything maybe in the
later on video right now let's just move
on and talk about the questions that are
far more interesting than knowing about
me
okay so official question number one
comes up here what is daily routine make
a V log on it I may try to make a V log
on my lifestyle maybe in the upcoming
future but I think it will not be that
much interesting or to be very honest I
will not be able to make it that much
interesting so that's why I don't do it
most of my day is on my chair and I just
sit in front of computer and write code
for that
apart from that two R's are always
dedicated in exercise one are of gym not
very much heavy weight lifting kind of a
stuff but regular moments and all that
and one are of swimming so that's my two
hour of exercise yes of course almost
daily no Sunday exception in that on
Sundays I don't do gym but still I do
swimming so that's kind of in my daily
routine
apart from this daily routine my friends
usually drop at my home sometimes we
play playstation talk nonsense things
about what's happening at Pluto or maybe
what's happening in Canada or something
like that just all crazy stuff that
usually all the friends talk about so
usually I do that as well and that's
kind of my routine part and apart from
that yes I do travel like insanely I
have even stopped posting my check-ins
on airports and everything because it's
too much of the travel but yes maybe in
the future I'll try to put a V log it's
can be interesting if I'll be able to
make it otherwise if the things are not
interesting for YouTube I actually don't
make it I found this question really
interesting and
pressive it says who are your favorite
youtubers yes they are youtubers I
absolutely love watch video content and
I'll name only precise a few of them but
yes I'm pretty sure I'll miss a lot of
them now two guys are which I watch
regularly are mkbhd and Casey night star
the reason why I watch them because
their composition their shards lighting
and everything the way they handle these
camera stuff is absolutely insane plus I
love the way how mkbhd is dealing with
the YouTube the quality of the content
the amount of reviews that he gave it's
all precise and the best part is he's
not just always saying all negative
things about the things he can
understand that how much it takes to
make a phone or something like that
he gives precise thing in always says
that hey maybe the air buds are not good
I would like to see the version two of
them and he understands the tag that how
tech actually evolves in the future and
how it should be done
so not bragging about it but yes I love
to watch the content of these two
youtubers at most apart from these two
youtubers from India I love to watch the
channel known as I can I don't know if
you know about it or not but yes again I
call him as Indian mkbhd he handles
camera absolutely nice all those nice
reviews nice audio everything is so
amazing about it now I don't get much of
the time in watching the YouTube so I
watch these three channel like more of
the time rest of my time on the YouTube
actually goes in watching the comedy
videos that's not a big time amount but
still it's a very small chunk amount
time and in that I watch comedy videos
especially from the channel happy Phi
it's amazing it's hilarious it's
educational what more I can ask and yes
all time favorite youtubers like Zakir
Khan and Attila 3 and all these I forgot
the name of a lot of them but yes these
groups I always watch them current Alwar
being one of them veer thus one of them
I love to watch them one thing I always
take care while watching the YouTube is
I don't watch abusive content now I have
a theory I believe that the more kind of
abusive content you're gonna hear you'll
feel that it's actually cool to be
abusive and just to say anything
anything about any person I completely
avoid that I don't like the content so
it's not like that I'm gonna be going on
to there
hitting their thumbs down and all of
that no I don't do that I simply don't
like that content I don't watch it and
that's kind of my personal choice I
don't like abusive content
I like the comedy which is pure which is
satire or maybe on politics or anything
I just love to watch that and that's
where most of the youtubers that I have
follow here yes I know I am missing out
a lot of youtubers that I watch kind of
a instantaneous answer here between you
and me so I forgot a lot of them back to
the tech this channel is all about tech
so how can we miss some of the good tech
questions it's a good one actually it
says learn PHP or node.js for
freelancing now here's the difference
there are projects for both available
for PHP as well as for node chairs but
the quantity and the quality where it
matters if you want to do a lot of
projects lot of quantity go for PHP
because there are hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of projects on PHP recently
one student said that after taking your
course on PHP as well as front-end
developer now I'm making four hundred
dollars monthly through the PHP now it's
completely possible and probably chances
are high that he'll be doing like a
number of projects with the PHP on top
of that if you want to do some kind of
quality work of course it's gonna take a
lot out of you compared to the PHP it
will be tougher but it will get you more
amount of money so no J's if you want to
do like one project a month and want to
earn like twelve hundred or three
thirteen hundred dollars per month that
would be no GS so yes projects are there
for both of them for beginners I would
obviously recommend PHP okay so this one
is little bit repetitive but it's
actually cool it says where can I find
resources to practice for HTML CSS and
JavaScript I have completed course but
still not confident ok this is common
now first of all when you actually do
any kind of course it will give you like
50 to 60 % of confidence which is good
enough because you know the tech now but
after that the projects are required now
after doing the projects you will even
get just 90 percent or 85 percent of
confidence and that key important part
15 percent is still missing the reason
behind that is that instructor have
teach you taught you everything about
HTML CSS GS even making a project
workflow all of that
still he will get 85% of confidence the
rest of the 15% will only come up when
you will design the project completely
on your own of course it's going to be a
little bit tough but this is actually
which gives you immense amount of
confidence and the ability to say that
yes whatever is going to come up I'm
going to handle it
so yes you are missing a little bit of
project work come on do that and you'll
be absolutely fine okay so this is a
little bit about my thoughts and it says
so how much you expect from a final year
computer engineering student now I do
expect a lot and I do agree I do feel
guilty that I do expect a lot and again
I do have a theory for that again now I
believe when a student is in finally he
knows a lot about friends he knows a lot
about Game of Thrones he knows a lot
about Prison Break and of course let's
just say give or take at least eight to
ten seasons that he is watching
continuously so if a final student just
by giving like one hour or two are in
the night can learn a lot about these
seasons why cannot he learn a lot about
the technology I expect he should be
aware of course HTML CSS JavaScript is
kind of a bare minimum basic everybody
who is an engineer should be aware of it
I also expecting that he should not be
proficient but still be good having a
good knowledge about Android a little
bit about iOS or maybe what's happening
latest in the market like react angular
I'm not saying he should be able to code
in that but he should be aware of these
technology if he has done kind of a like
five or ten projects in that that's
awesome but at least these kinds of
technologies should be aware to him I
know I'm asking a lot from a final-year
student which is not even being touched
in the university but yes this is a
market demand when you'll move out in
the Silicon Valley of India or in the
United States you will be asked these
kinds of questions so from a final year
engineering students I do expect that he
should have this amount of knowledge at
least a little bit optimistic question
here what should i what should I do if I
don't know anything about Web Design but
I want to make a paid perfect website
within a day look my friend there are a
lot of things that we wish I really wish
that there should be a flight which can
which
take me from New Delhi to Australia
within two hours doesn't happen
I also wish that while traveling from
any country to any country there should
be no visa process and I can directly
land into any country doesn't happen a
lot of people expect that they should
not get any error in their programming
life but it doesn't happen see what I'm
trying to say that programming is kind
of a no magic button that can you can
click on that and it will create an
amazing awesome website according to you
yes there are platforms like VIX and
WordPress but again these are not much
of kind of a customization that is
available to that if you want to make a
website from code HTML CSS and want to
have full control
it takes time this is not a magic that
you can do within a night or within a
day or within an hour it doesn't happen
like that
you have to work hard you have to get
experience and then only things work
hey get real here there is no magic
being served okay I didn't expect it
this kind of question still it appeared
and it says who was your first crush
let's keep everything technical let's
not go into in-person way here but I
would say my first crush technically was
MacBook Pro I know this sounds weird but
being technical person let's just keep
this channel not onto a Love Guru
channel but keeping it on to it
technical Channel the moment I saw
MacBook Pro I actually got an idea that
yes I want this I'll have this
no matter how hard I have to work for it
I am gonna buy this cool question
because it says it's cool cool how many
hours do you sleep in a day and how many
hours do you spend on coding ok I feel
do guilty about it because I steal a lot
of time from my sleep time into my work
time and yes I am NOT proud on it that
I'm stealing a lot of time out of my
sleep this is not healthy but I'm guilty
of it I do it and probably in the future
I can see myself wearing the glasses
like Casey netstat and the reason why
Casey always wear sunglasses because he
also takes a lot of time from asleep
into his work and no matter what you do
you can be on camera with good lights
and everything you can look healthy and
everything but your eyes actually speaks
for itself and when you don't sleep that
much
sometimes your
become red I have shot a lot of videos
with my red eyes swollen eyes so
probably I think maybe in the future I
can also get Casey sign
Casey Knight stats and glasses and can
shoot videos like that probably not
gonna happen in near future this
question is for all the people who are
masters or maybe in the PhDs or
something like that so it says sir how
to get complete knowledge in ns3 any
help available I do believe and I do
agree with you that ns3 is stuff it's
not just stuff it's really really tough
because it it requires you to have a
knowledge of Linux 11s network
simulators a lot of network algorithms
as well as C++ Linux so it's a lot to
take on even on to a master degree
student or a PhD degree student
unfortunately there are no books or
nothing available on NS three of a back
I created a few videos which are still
the most popular videos on the planet on
NS three so go ahead and watch them
apart from that unfortunately there is
no book on NS three or nothing else you
have to dig down into documentation and
have to do research sorry about that but
that's the truth a question related to
freelancing a lot of you might love this
I just want to know how to write good
description in freelancing for getting
first project here is my first step that
is applicable on 2017 November 2017 do
not copy paste even a single word in the
project submission of the bidding that
you are applying on the freelancing now
freelancing has different rules than
what it used to have it's all like more
strict but it's actually good for
everyone now what they are doing now is
even if you copy/paste even a single
word they are going to punish you a lot
so don't copy paste try to understand
what client is asking and try to a kind
of a personalised proposal to him and
obviously it makes much more easier now
for actual genuine bidders who have
knowledge to bid onto a project and get
the project the main point in the
freelancing is to understand the clients
requirement and then bidding according
to it now a lot of people just copy and
paste their proposals it doesn't work
like that even freelancing is punishing
everybody so the main point here is try
to understand what the client is asking
if you already have such kind of project
don't even hesitate to
attach that link of the project in the
proposal it will help you a lot because
client will understand that yes this
person has done this kind of work
already in the past so he will be able
to understand my projects deals and all
the things that are required in this
project and chances are high that you
are gonna get your first project very
soon best of luck okay so let's take one
more question the final one and says
first of all thank you so much sir for
learned code online lco thank you so
much it's a beautiful place for learning
with a great teacher like you and sir my
question is in 2018 will you go in other
countries or will you be staying in
Jaipur I want to have a cup of coffee
video sir
definitely very soon in the Jaipur I'll
plan to meet out put a small meet-up for
everybody who is living in Jaipur of
course coffee is gonna be all on me for
all of you who are coming on the Jaipur
hope you don't come like in hundred and
thousands of quantity just like few 10
or 20 s I can only afford that much of
the coffee here as far as the part and
the plants are for 2018 yes there are of
course plans for travel travel is kind
of unavoidable for me and probably I'll
make a video on why do I travel so much
and I love to explore all these
countries but yes I do have big plans
for the traveling in 2018 as well I have
done a lot of traveling in the past as
well I absolutely love that and for sure
very soon we will catch up a meeting
will probably have an iced tea or maybe
a coffee if those guys can make good
coffee but again iced tea is always good
there okay so this was a long long Q&amp;amp;A
session and I really enjoy making these
Q&amp;amp;A videos because I can answer to you
directly one on one to you I absolutely
love these kinds of video so with this
that's it for this video in case you are
new to this channel we talked a lot
about programming crazy technical stuff
and all these things so in case you are
new here do consider subscribing if you
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
and just like always I'll surely catch
you up
