with another video and in this video we
are talking about capacitor so I've been
aware of this project for a long time
and finally it is in here and right now
it says it's coming early 2018 but
actually the alpha version of capacitor
is out so a lot of you might be asking
what is capacitor now just to give you a
brief idea about capacitor I would like
to compare it with some of the other
frameworks and stuff like this so that
you can get clear idea so Facebook has
got react native recently Google has got
flutter and finally ionic has got
capacitor now this is an amazing product
and I really really recommend if you're
onto that side of the river where you
work on angular or Cordova PhoneGap or
something like this you should really
keep a close eye on this project if you
go on to this docs we can simply say
that capacitor is a cross-platform app
runtime that makes it easy to build web
apps that runs natively on iOS Android
as a desktop app using electron and the
web and of course they're calling it as
a native progressive web apps I highly
highly recommend everybody to keep an
eye on this project but in case you are
already aware or working on react or
react native then you can just
completely avoid this as of now in case
you have your opinion about flutter you
might want to go into that also you can
avoid this one but in case you are
interested in angular typescript could
have Apache Cordova or audio Bay
PhoneGap then obviously it is now again
they openly mentioned that this project
is inspired by react native so obviously
all of these projects are being inspired
by react native it is really killing it
now it really makes sense that all of
these guys are moving into that that
really openly openly mentions that the
hybrid apps are going really out of the
market I highly recommend you to switch
onto this installation is pretty pretty
simple and I I would say that this is
one appreciable point by the capacitor
guys I really like the installation
process it's totally NPM dependent I
really worked on to a couple of projects
on react not like a big scale just like
toy apps and the installation process
was totally pain it was simple but not
at all something which I liked I like
the way how it is being installed
by NPM install and then you can just go
for the capacitor I liked it and you can
also look on to the documentation about
how you can produce your bill your app
for iOS or for the Android or for the
web or for the desktop application so
really a good project will I be using it
into the production as of now you know
the rule of the thumb here it is right
now in a very early phase in alpha so no
not at all this is out just to keep an
eye to have some play play shape or toy
app with this project but definitely
should you be keeping an eye on to it of
course it is so my recommendation openly
now to everybody is hey if you are still
into the hybrid apps everybody is
shifting toward the native apps using
flutter react native these capacitors so
even the guy who are using Cordova or
something like this and it has openly
mentioned their intention with this that
yes capacitors out and we highly
recommend everybody to switch onto it so
what the give is shot definitely
recommend I'll leave the link in the
description so that you can at least
check out the website updates this is
this project is in a very fast progress
of being build up I have been aware of
it for a while and you'll see a really
tremendously fast updates in this
project definitely keep an eye on that
so this was a quick update about the
capacitor by ionic team and in case you
have enjoyed this quick tip news about
this we talked all about these
programming stuff latest tense in
technology which are just coming out
there in case you like that give this
video a thumbs up in case you have
enjoyed it more to share the video and
of course don't forget to hit that
subscribe button and I'll surely catch
you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
