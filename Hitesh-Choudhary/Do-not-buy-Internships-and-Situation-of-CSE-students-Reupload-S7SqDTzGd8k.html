code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey did everyone have
a share back again with another video
and in this video we're gonna do two
things first we're gonna read an
interesting email that was a feedback
email from a student and actually it's a
student's voice that I am trying to make
sure it reaches out to you through my
platform and the second thing that we
are gonna talk about is I want to
discuss something really important
regarding my travel and it's not an
update of course it's something related
to the engineering students and what
they are facing right now and what
they're thinking actually about to work
into variety of big companies like
Google Microsoft and all of that so it's
an interesting talk here but first let's
read that email but before that let's
roll the intro
this email is regarding a situation
which students wants to make sure that
everybody is aware of and he obviously
knows that how wrong this is and this is
regarding my video that I rolled out a
few days ago about certification and
dumb an incident which happened at my
friend's company so if you haven't
watched that video you can go ahead and
watch that and again we are going to
back into the context here so let's read
this email respected sir I follow
regularly your YouTube channel and watch
all videos just today I have watched
your video regarding certification and
dump this incident happened to me in
last month I was searching for
internship in a Facebook group named
internships that's a nice name for a
group there I found an internship
opportunity and applied for a web
development through a Google forum with
certification then I got mail stating
that they are providing only
certificates and not the internship by
laying out some amount we need to pay to
get an internship certificate without
even working in that domain that is
absolutely bizarre then the person
called me on the phone and told me that
this is a good opportunity he is not got
any opportunity to work I feel sorry for
myself okay
I missed a line here and this is a good
opportunity he convinced me by saying
that I get a chance to work in an
internship after paying then I agreed
and paid the amount of certificate I
received the certificate that is at
least good you got something but still
did not got any opportunity to work I
feel sorry for myself at least you felt
that that is amazing I can show you the
mail which I received please make a
video on this topic too don't take my
name
I am afraid I am only a student you can
see the email that they sent I am
attaching a screenshot
thank you for letting people know about
this issue and you can just watch this
screenshot as well here I have hidden
the company name I could have shown that
but I don't think so it's a good thing
because it doesn't really matter what's
the name of this company the point is
that you are doing again a kind of an
injustice to yourself
I know
these internship certificate are
mandatory to complete your degrees but
it's actually better to get fail in your
exams right now right here in the
college as compared to failing into the
industry when you'll be reaching out now
again I know this student has paid a
really good amount just to get that
internship certificate but here is the
point that at least he is sorry now that
he has done something wrong and I think
you all are aware of the situation and
please do yourself a favor not to me to
yourself don't buy these certificates or
don't buy these internships certificate
at least do yourself a favor if you're
not getting an internship certificate
just do an online course or maybe buy a
book and read that at least you will get
something better than this and again it
is important to learn certificates are
important but not that much the topmost
thing that is important is learning so
make sure you don't do this buying
certificate and stuff okay so this is
the part 1 of the video let's move on to
the part 2 video you can consider this
as two videos but this is part two
part two of this video is little bit
scary so in case some of you know and
follow me on Instagram and Facebook and
all of that I've been visiting a lot of
colleges recently in the last three or
four days I have visited like three
colleges and one Skype talk it was a
Tech Talk for a college I couldn't just
fly there so they arranged a Skype talk
and what I found out is some people some
of the universities and college students
are absolutely amazing they are aware
about the latest Alltech about the swift
angular node whatever latest is
happening in the industry at least they
are aware they are not mastered in that
but of course they are running really
absolutely good but the problematic
situation is with the some of the
universities we are third year and final
year students absolutely have no idea
and yes I'm talking about the computer
science students have absolutely no idea
what is no js' or what is angular or
what is react but this is not the whole
story on top of that their goal is to
somehow get into Google and Amazon and
Facebook and all these big giants they
have absolutely no idea what is binary
search trees which is a very common
interview question they cannot even
perform a classic physics operation
which is again a very classic interview
question so it makes me kind of an
amusing feeling here that they have
absolutely no idea about trees they
cannot write a properly and if and else
program and their goal in the third year
and finally it is to get a job in Google
and Amazon they are absolutely blaming
their call is that they are not calling
Amazon and Google in their campus and on
top of that they have no idea what it is
no js' now I might be wrong here that
I'm thinking in that way but I think and
all of these I ask this is a very
specific question they were all of them
were aware about what is the next season
which is coming out for the game of
thrones have they watched G ot and all
of them were updated absolutely episode
by episode on Game of Thrones so this
makes me realise that is it a wrong
thing about the college or student I
think this thing needs to be a
reanalyzing thing that you should do
that whether it's a fault of college or
whether it's a fault of students that
you are not even aware of the
things which are going in the market and
you are aware about the seasons that are
coming all the way long so I believe
it's a time to get little bit serious on
getting friendly with the industry and
at least I'm not saying just buy my
courses or learn all the time from my
courses no it's it's not at all
composition you can just buy good books
you can buy online courses from other
great instructors as well but all I'm
trying to say here is at least know what
you're doing or what you're trying to do
in your future like companies are all
industries moving here and you are just
here come on get on here and you need to
be here as well get friendly with the
latest tech what is happening in the
industry read a lot read a lot of books
and at least practice a few stuff don't
make yourself a miserable in the third
year final year you have absolutely no
idea what is a binary search tree or you
cannot how can I imagine a person in the
computer science having no idea what is
no js' all the tech that they knew was
the I'm not talking about the projects
that they have done the tech only the
name that they knew was dotnet in Java
I'm not saying these are bad tech these
are absolutely amazing but from a
computer science student is it is
expected that he's aware of what is
happening in the market and current
standard on top of that I asked a couple
of students who are saying that we want
to join up in the Google and I asked
them what what domain you want to join
in like in the what domain and he said
it's sir I'm not getting your question I
said it's not like you just go to Google
and you just start working there are a
variety of domains there is information
security there is front end there is UI
UX there's designer there is a back-end
part there is a like media interaction
there is their marketing there is a
management there is a person who buys
the coffee so he has there are a lot of
jobs and senior software developers
junior software at other parts there is
a whole list available at Google careers
form if you'll check that out and there
are responsibilities as well as
requirement being mentioned there so if
you want a job there are you preparing
for that what kind of check mark you
have done for the requirements which are
there and to my no surprise at law at
least here they were not at all even
aware what I am talking here so
I think if you are looking forward to
join these big giant X companies prepare
for the hem at least so I am starting to
thinking now that it's not totally the
fault of college that they are not
updating the things yes of course they
are not updating it but since you
yourself can get update on the Game of
Thrones episode I think you can get
updated on latest tech and at that
moment of time exactly when I was in
that college I was feeling absolutely
fantastic about the crowd that I have on
my youtube channel the crowd on my
youtube channel asked me all these
questions even point my mistakes as well
when I do mistakes in a Google login by
a fire base or fire store or when I do
all kind of such things and talk about
angular they ask the question that hey
why we should go for react and not for
angular or we should go for angular and
not for react I feel absolutely amazing
that I'm lucky at this channel that I've
got the absolute cream crowd on this
YouTube channel I really absolutely am
enjoying this so yes these are few of my
thoughts and I think it's time for all
of those students who have recently
joined on my youtube channel as well get
serious and start reading you need to
read a lot of blogs learned code online
also post regular blogs to read them
also read out some other good blogs and
at least get in the sink where industry
is having around choose your tech
whatever you like dotnet Java GS
JavaScript whatever that is it's totally
your decision but at least get in sync
where the industry is going on so that's
it and I know I'm a little bit busy in
this stuff going on very soon we're
gonna get back on to the pace with a
youtube as well but I think that's all I
wanted to say in this video the goal
here is you should be learning
regardless of whatever the resources are
how you're learning it's not important
the important part is from wherever
you're feeling comfortable start
learning okay that's it for this video
