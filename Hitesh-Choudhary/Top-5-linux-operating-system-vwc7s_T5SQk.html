with another video now I know I haven't
been posting videos in the last week but
I'm back again it was a awesome tool
it was Mumbai Goa and Bangalore but
again we are going to talk about
technical things again if you are new to
the channel we talk about technical
things programming coatings and
everything that runs and revolves around
computer so if you are new here consider
subscribing now let's talk about the top
5 Linux distribution not distribution
Linux operating systems that comes
around now definitely first thing that
you should look around on the blogs is
that this is the difference between the
distributions and the operating system
that's a new topic I have just given you
with my stumble but again let's not
worry about that so let's talk about the
top 5 operating system based on Linux
which you can check out and definitely
you should consider if you are new in
learning Linux now on my list the top 5
in the top 5 the fifth position is for
the Red Hat the famous Red Hat now why I
have placed it on the fifth position
although it's really great because it
charges you a little bit of the money
and have some of the copyright issues
that you can sell upon now if you are
into the training industry or you're a
company who doesn't actually bother in
spending a little amount of dollars in
paying Red Hat for this awesome and
killer support definitely then hat is
something that you should consider for
now for the students it's really awesome
because the learning path for the Red
Hat is actually being provided by Red
Hat itself you can go for the RSC er the
CFA and different kind of certification
that has Red Hat offers but they do
charge money and a lot of money but
definitely this is a great platform
where you can start learning Linux and a
lot of corporate organizations which are
hosting your websites and everything
actually do prefer to use well had quite
a lot so definitely it's a good option
now on list number four is the center
will now you might have already seen the
center is if you are in a college or in
a university because it's actually a Red
Hat but just rip off all the branding
and all these copyrights
that comes up just rip off all of that
and here you go you've got your Center
well now definitely a great operating
system if you are in the college or
university your college actually prefers
to install send to us because it doesn't
bother you about the branding it doesn't
cost you any single amount of dollar so
that you can have a lot of Windows lab
it doesn't require that it does come
with the awesome young support which is
a lot of repositories a lot of software
that you are looking around for examples
GIMP in place of Photoshop again it
cannot replace Photoshop but it's a good
alternative and tons of other familiar
software like Chrome or maybe fire for
dozens of list is there but it's
definitely a good system and one thing
that I like about these two operating
system is very young now definitely
there is a to John ray of the
repositories the apt get back apt-get
based and the yum base now young based
is all of them are actually maintained
by the Red Hat so you get all those red
head stuff in the center web as well now
on my list the number third is Fedora
now Fedora is again a brand of the Red
Hat by the way this video is not at all
sponsored by Red Hat or any of them red
has actually dominant a lot of things in
the open-source society so on my list
the Fedora is there two on the list
number three now while I have considered
Fedora
because Fedora is really awesome first
of all and the second thing the Fedora
is actually a little bit compact
compared to those guys now they are very
famous for the server additions and
stuff but Fedora is more over like a
desktop user if you are familiar and
would like to use more over the
graphical stuff the awesome graphical
stuff
like everything to be done all happen to
be installed like just with the click
mouse or the finding the repository
hitting the click then definitely Fedora
is worth considering now on my list the
second position goes to the Debian now
Debian is usually underrated but comes
with an awesome repository based on
apt-get of course but it is much more
stable I personally use Debian quite a
lot and
the reason why i use the debian is
simply because it comes up with Kali
Linux now Kali Linux is in case you know
that it were it's an upcoming upgrade or
it's now an upgrade of the backtrack now
backtrack was based on different things
but now this Kali's has shifted totally
on the debian which I think personally
is a great move now debian is again
having a tons of repositories a great
amount of support but you cannot
actually get the support directly you
have to look out for the forums and
everything but it's great now for those
people who don't know what the color is
Kali is actually an open-source
operating system which is backed up with
a lot of penetration testing or you can
say hacking tools and that makes it
super awesome because you don't have to
spend time in looking for the tools they
are already there cooked up built up
ready to use now on my list the number
one position goes to these famous no
doubt at all you can applaud for that to
bunt you now the bundle is really
awesome now one of the reasons why I
like Ubuntu in the early days I don't
know whether they do it yet or not in
the previous days when I was starting to
learn Linux I was looking for somebody
who can actually give me a Linux it is
2.5 or 3 TB is operating system which is
not easy to download when you are living
in a country like India where it used to
be a download speed of 10 kbps which is
really I cannot bear that now but it
used to be that now I filled up a forum
I signed up for that and you been to
actually shipped me a CD at my home and
they didn't even charge me the shipping
charges so that made me the fan of
Ubuntu in the early days I don't know
whether they do is now a lot but a CD at
your home without any cost
it's really awesome now why I like
Ubuntu so much because they have got so
much of the support online so much of
the forum's are talking about the
solutions you obviously get a lot of
problems in the Linux like your drivers
are not working your volume keys are not
working your Wi-Fi is not working and
all such problems now obviously the best
way to find the solution is to look up
for the online and I found dozens of
blog tons of forums discussing about the
problem
and taught me about how I can get
updated my repositories what files I
need to edit what things I need to do
what command I need to run by I need to
run then all of these such awesome thing
is actually that bun to now open to also
comes up with a variety of flavors it
comes up with a mobile the Dexter of the
tablet the servers and a lot of things
they also do run LTE like long term
support LTS and all such stuff but again
we can talk about them in some later
video so here is my top 5 list and
definitely if you are a Windows or Mac
user definitely consider installing a
VirtualBox or virtual player or fusion
and try give it a try to these operating
system especially the crazy cool swiping
effect in the Ubuntu that drives me
crazy spill it's really awesome but
again also try out the Kali but again a
lot of people are going to say that hey
you haven't mentioned that Kali actually
I mentioned the Kali in the Debian one I
tried that but in case I missed any one
of them which is super awesome super
cool do mention them in the comment I'll
make another videos with your credits so
that we can actually consider more of
these awesome Linux distributions and
operating system so definitely post down
the comment there now in case you are
new here definitely consider subscribing
and in case you think that somebody can
get benefit from this video share it on
your Facebook or Twitter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
