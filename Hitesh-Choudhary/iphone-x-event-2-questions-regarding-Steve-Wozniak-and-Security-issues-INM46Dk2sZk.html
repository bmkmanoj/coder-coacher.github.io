with another video now as a lot of you
might know that yesterday was an Apple
event and apple recently launched iPhone
8 as well as iPhone acts now we are not
here to talk about how good the phone is
is it a value for price or not whatever
that is let's leave that aside it's you
might be already seeing hundreds of
videos on them but I want to discuss
because I have two questions with Apple
now one question is about the event and
one question is about the security
issues that everybody is going to face
with the iPhone acts and all those other
phones which are having this face
detection and lock thingy thing let's
talk about it now my very first question
is to Apple event now Apple event
usually are great and this time they
have used the Steve Jobs theater which
was the last project on which Steve Jobs
worked now Steve Jobs has a lot of hype
around him now I'm not saying he
deserves that or he doesn't deserve that
let's keep that aside let's not make
that as a point of debate now what's
interesting was in the event that I saw
Steve Wozniak hanging around there now I
really personally think that Steve
Wozniak deserved at least five minutes
or less just say at least two minutes on
the stage saying about how he sees that
Apple is progressing or about the new
updates that are coming on to the
company or maybe how the campus is
looking like whatever there was in his
mind people really wanted to see Steve
Wozniak on the stage and at least what
he has done for the company I think
everybody knows that he deserves those
two minutes or five minutes on the stage
now I will not say that Steve arsenic
didn't wanted to appear on the stage
maybe or maybe not but I am pretty sure
that he was having thoughts in mind that
he really wanted to share with people
because you can see a lot of Twitter
feeds coming up and saying that hey I
was naked praising the campus he's
saying that Beauty has no parameters
some variables no numbers it's just
amazing beautiful so these things
instead of just seeing them on a Twitter
feed I would really love to see them on
the stage directly from Steve Oz neg on
the event now let me know in the
comments section what do you think about
this I think this great man who has
contributed so much in the app
deserves at least two or three minutes
on the stage let me know in the comment
section what do you think about it now
my second question and concern is about
the iPhone X and regardless of iPhone X
other Samsung phone as well who are
using the feature of face detection and
unlock now let me give you a very simple
example now we all have one such friend
in the group who just leaves his phone
unlocked for maybe two minutes or even a
minute and the next thing that he sees
on his Facebook wall and Twitter feed is
he's getting committed to a random girl
yes I'm talking about when you utilize
your phone or your friend's phone to
update some random and nonsense status
just you found unlocked phone there now
my concern with the security is what
will happen to those students who are
roommates and you know when your friend
is a sleeping beauty and you just have
to take his phone and just put it as in
front of the face and that's it enjoy
his phone unlocked with all the feature
and Apple is saying you can even use it
for Apple pay so I can see I can just
imagine what is about to happen with
this feature whoever the phones are who
are using these features
I'm just waiting to listen all those
amazing stories that are about to come
on the internet about the misuse of this
face unlock feature continuing with the
same concern about the phone's security
now you might have read a couple of
articles regarding the person who was
working at NASA and was hold at the
airport by airport authorities and was
searched thoroughly and even the airport
authorities asked him to share the
password of his phone now he said that
the phone is his private property he is
having some personal informations
pictures and also some NASA pictures
there so regardless whatever the case
was and was it right or wrong whatever
that was I'm pretty sure that the next
time these things will not appear that
much of the big issues because now all
the airport authorities have to do is
become their phone and say in your face
security and that's it you are done with
that now although these numbers look
really amazing like one in a million
chance to open up your phone and just
like that but we know all about the
truth that it's not about one in
million chance or something it's about
how these things are gonna be misused
and I'm really looking forward for the
next year black head conference and the
Nelkin conference where people are gonna
show up and I was gonna say how they
bypass these face detection and all
those biometric things I'm really
looking forward for that so these are my
two quick questions to Apple the first
one is why was Steve Wozniak not on the
stage and second one is about the
security concern about the face
detection and things like that now I'm
not saying the face detection is a bad
thing yes we are moving into a forward
direction and definitely things are
going to improve in future but for right
now these are just my concerns let me
know in the comment section below that
what you really think about these couple
of issues and I'm really looking forward
for us healthy discussion in the
comments section let's hang out and
think what more productive we can find
