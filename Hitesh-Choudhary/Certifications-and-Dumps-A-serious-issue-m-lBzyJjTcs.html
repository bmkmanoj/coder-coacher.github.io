code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey there everyone
they share back again with another video
and in this video we are talking about
certifications dumps and one incident
that happened today this incident is
completely full of humiliation for a
person and I really don't want you to
face the exact same situation if you are
trying to do any certification or
anything like that again I'm nobody to
answer the question that whether I
should be going for this certificate or
not it's totally your decision it's
totally your money but I think this
video is going to help you that how you
should be pursuing a certificate what
should be your vision behind doing any
certification again I'm covering all of
the certificates here whether that's a
Java certificate CCNA some certified
ethical hacker certificate osep maybe
red hat or whatever the certification
you have heard I am going to share an
incident that happened today which is
completely humiliated for a person and
I'm I'm gonna tell you that why actually
think happened so before you go for any
certification or even think about it
just watch this video and you will be
the judge platform my youtube channel I
get interacted by a variety of companies
co-founders founders they like to
interact with me they like to talk with
me and of course I do have variety of
previous friends as well they are
working in a big company one of my such
friend have left the company quite a day
ago quite a days ago and he got funding
as well now his hiring was completely
done a week ago and we regularly chat on
whatsapp and stuff like that so today I
again had a Skype call with him and I
want to share this exact incident video
he is the reason why I'm making this
video he wants his message to be
conveyed through my platform again he
said don't mention my name or company I
don't want any kind of PR with that so
the incident goes like this he a week
ago he just finished up his entire
hiring process and everything everybody
was looking amazing he hired the entire
staff but one of the people of
entire staff was really looking really
so amazing on the interview as well in
the certificates and all these receive
me on paper he was looking rock-solid in
interview he performed really well but
you know what from the last seven days
the entire staff was completely like
shocked with that one one person and he
was having the certificates in
networking he was having certificate in
Linux and he was having certificate in
Java as well and couple of other good
certification as well
he was looking really a top notch guy
here kind of investment of like almost
one lakh rupees in just those
certificates so obviously once a person
is having that kind of credibility and
certificates he looks really good
the moment he said onto in front of a
computer he was absolutely dumb nothing
at all he was having no idea from where
to write the code or where to write the
code how to start the things or how to
end the things absolutely no idea at
first all the people at the company
thought that this is a new guy having no
experience so there might be some
learning curve he might be little bit
scared of the things or hesitant with
the things so they everybody corporated
with him now again a little while after
that people realized that even after
giving him the exact instruction what to
do he was not able to perform the task
and then again interview went for him
now this is a rare rare situation once
you get hired interview doesn't really
happen again but after one week the
founder of the company again went asked
him that hey come on to my room and I
want to take your interview again and he
just opened up his resume and he checked
out and this time he noticed that he did
all of these certifications in a span of
just three months and he asked his some
of the questions which were in detail in
depth and obviously the person couldn't
able to answer any one of them then he
forced the person that if you're not
going to tell me truth that how you did
all these certifications I might put an
F IR against you obviously he couldn't
do that why would he like to do that and
take an extra pain just for a one person
he just tried to just get out of the
things from him now one thing on a side
note I would like to mention here that
the interview that you are giving to the
person he he is taking the intro
you there he has been spent he might
have spent time like for ten years or
five years what do you what you are in
front of him you might have spent time
on a code like one year or two year
those person who are sitting at the desk
taking interviews or have been the
founders and cofounders of the company
they have spent like any years or 15
years just behind the code screen so
just be extra careful what what you are
telling them you cannot fool them that's
that's the interesting stuff so again he
asked him that how you cleared all these
certificates and how you got that
because if a person is having that much
expensive certificate he is expected to
perform at least on to a 10% scale not
100% but at least 10% and he said you
know there is this certificate company
he also named me the company that there
is a company near my resident and he
just gives you certificate for this
amount of charge they give you
certificate dumps in case you don't know
what the dumps are dumps are like there
will be 20 questions in your exam here
are the 20 question just memorize them
and answer them or there are something
like there will be 20 questions in the
exam here are tied equations just just
memorize them and just just throw them
there and this happens for unfortunately
this happens with all of the exams
whether there's a java exam that's a
networking exam whether that's a PHP
exam or whatever the exams you are
talking about even for Linux
certification as well now let me tell
you also frankly the truth about it most
of the companies are aware about the
situation that yes there are dumps
available so if you are expecting that
just with the certificate you are gonna
get a job might be you might be getting
a job but obviously after that there
comes a huge humiliation that you don't
know the subject you have the
certificates you got the job and now you
are not performing you are not able to
do any task this is a serious
humiliation situation what I want to
tell you with this incident is that yes
I am not skating you out that don't go
for a certificate or anything it's
totally your choice go for any
certificate whatever you like whether
that's programming or anything just go
for that but again if you're going for a
certificate go honestly with it these
certificates are done in a bad manner
and in a good manner as well
make sure you always choose the hard way
you choose the good manner yes surely
there are chances that you might get
failed in the certificate you might lose
20,000 or 25,000 amount that you have
paid for this certificate but yes of
course this is a truth that you have to
face you can get failed if you are going
to choose the easy way that's not how
these certificates were meant obviously
some people are cheating them and you
will find a lot of Institute if you are
surprised with that go out and look for
the centers in Delhi in Bangalore in
Rajasthan in utter Pradesh in Madhya
Pradesh in Maharashtra every city every
city it's not an exception like it's
happening only there it's it's all over
the India and even in the global scale
as well there are dumps available you
can pass the certificate quite easily
nicely without even knowing anything
about it but obviously it's not a good
way so what I want to say my message or
my summary with this is if you're gonna
cheat in those certificate exam you
might just save a twenty or twenty five
thousand rupees and you might get a
certificate but if you don't have exact
knowledge about what needs to be
performed or what needs to be there you
will face a lot of humiliation in life
and obviously you might crack up some of
the interviews as well you might join as
well but after that what comes is a
severe severe humiliation in the company
and of course since you are presenting
wrong data if the company is big and
want to take some actions against you
they surely can so make sure before you
put any kind of such big name
certificate in your resume take good
knowledge nobody expects you 100 percent
in the industry on the day one obviously
nobody can or nobody should be expecting
but at least if you have those big name
certificates you should be able to
perform at least 20% or 30% of that it's
not like you should be 0x0 there okay so
again it's totally on you certificates
are costly I do agree but my advice is
go the hard way with these certificates
don't just take the dumps if somebody or
some Institute's is giving you just the
dumps to pass those exams say no okay it
will be really beneficial for you but
again you'll be the judge of deciding
what you should do in those situation
totally it's your money and you'll be
the judge for that so that's it I wanted
to share this incident I think it's
going to be helpful for all of you go
hard way
learn the things first and then if you
have money invest in certificates but
again don't cheat that's it for this
