know this is a little bit poor
connection but it will become stable in
a minute
so yes I'm waiting for a people to come
up there and this is going to be a live
video in here so you can ask your
questions but mainly this video is to
give you an update our data really
awesome it's not like a Facebook update
it's update on something that I am
working so this month I have just a
decline to all of the offers and the
jobs that I was being offered so what
I'm doing right now is working for you
guys on the YouTube so that I can bring
up all of my courses all of my boot
camps there are hundreds and hundreds of
videos which are waiting up there so
they are all getting uploaded as we talk
now and in the past I have received a
lot of requests that we are not able to
pay with the credit cards and all those
things so now I have actually teamed up
with a geo money and a lot of guys so
that things can become affordable as
well as easier for you to reach in so
this is a quick update yes things are
getting in a very smooth flow and very
soon very soon you'll be able to get
access of all of the courses using your
Paytm geo money a two-lap your debit
cards your net banking so every facility
is coming to you okay
so this was just a quick update and now
I will be moving on to the comment
section so that I can answer you but yes
everything will be on the same channel
every update everything that you'll be
getting will be on the same channel on
this this thi tube which we will be
getting in here everything will be in
here okay so make sure you do subscribe
to the channel and keep looking it
because I think we'll be able to move on
into the beta testing within this week
and I'll be inviting a few beta testers
to access all of the courses and tell me
what they feel and what they like about
everything and once that is done I think
I think probably within the next week
we'll be able to roll out for everybody
okay so now let's move on hey hey hey
everybody so let's just go in there for
how many years your programming in this
field I think I have been programming
for over six or six or seven years so
far but I have been changing the other
things really quickly so I think that
gives me an advantage in here and let's
just talk in here okay hi kuru hype
Pegasus hi Akash
shhh with city you belong hey I live in
the beautiful city of Chappell but I'm a
very frequent traveler I do travel quite
a lot to Delhi and am debarred and
Bangalore as well for training purposes
of course I love to spend a lot of time
in the Paras I do spend a lot of time
there I I I just live in there quite a
long time I love that city so that's all
please make a video on Android versus
Apple future okay but that's a nice
topic that's fighting topic we will
surely try that
remember the million data question I
asked for music site here is in complete
demo beta musi sir calm I forgot that
damn cool that my bad my bad completely
my bad I forgot about that maybe you
want to comment that again because I
almost forgot what you asked about the
meze sitcom I want to learn Android okay
so Android will be there very soon what
are your qualifications qualified enough
to teach programming and I do have a lot
of certifications in degree as well you
can check out my resume resume a there
is a video on the same channel about my
resuming you can check that out but I
didn't believe much in the qualification
and all those things if I know this
stuff I can deliver it well I can
produce some apps with that that's all
about it what will be courses courses
about everyday things that you learn
like web application development
front-end development back-end
development and app development mobile
apps android apps iOS
react react native react jeaious es6
angular a lot of stuff like that how to
make website like my smart price we will
discuss that on the cursors as well how
to connect to application which are from
the different languages it's very
difficult to connect to two applications
when they are in the different level
usually that is being done by the API
levels just what similar to like react
native is doing the integration with the
Java and the Swift it's almost similar
process but connecting to application in
different language is just a pain in the
butt so how much Java is needed for
Android development little little bit
Java you should be familiar with writing
the concepts of functions the loops
basic if-else which case conditions
because you will be writing your logic
in the Java apart from that things like
getting the buttons and everything is
completely different so basics of the
Java is okay don't get too much stuck
into the Java because I know this this
is required but sometimes you just learn
on the go okay I hope that answers your
questions group rate and I did you know
Mark Zuckerberg everybody knows Mark
Zuckerberg and so do I a couple of my
friends are working at the Facebook so
maybe I can visit sometime are you
single of course here
how does marks matters marks let's not
talk about it maybe maybe we can talk
about some Dale's how to improve coding
skills online what are the websites to
start with to be honest to improve your
skills you need a couple of projects
only you don't need any online website
or anything you need to work on a couple
of projects because when you'll be
working on the projects or making some
clone websites or something you'll be
facing challenges and those challenges
are the only way to get better in there
ok what program to learn ethical hacking
will answer that I think lacking
schedules and modules are coming up so a
please explode video in Apache Cordova
ok let me tell you here I don't work on
Apache Cordova
is we do have better options Apache
Cordova and phone gaps are a rapper that
makes experience is really really bad
and I don't like it you have to design
apps on the Cordova or PhoneGap but I
like to use react native which produces
native apps and there's just one code
base to maintain so that's what we do
purchasing MacBook Air go ahead you
won't regret it that's that's my words
but I think if you have a little bit
budget do add a pro in their MacBook Air
is awesome but Mac Pro is far more
reliable and solid in there is
ransomware has killing switch it's true
it seems like it seems like there is a
kill switch and somebody has triggered
the kill switch but the latest I have
received the news that the latest
updates on that are also being produced
but they are not from the original
authors they are by some copycats but
still they are making a lot of nonsense
in there so that's the update I have so
please tell us about how to connect to
application I just have answered you
when do you provide courses for Indian
student spatially and only and only for
exclusively for Indian students it's
coming up in this week for beta tester
and the next week for everybody ok so if
you want to become a reader Esther do
comment drop me a message on the
Facebook I will give you access but but
in order to become a beta tester you
will have to spend like 50 rupees or 60
rupees because you'll be purchasing the
course again and again back and through
so you will be spending around a 150
rupees or 200 rupees I'll try to give it
to you back to you but that's how the
testing will go ok why are you wearing
same t-shirts for all of the videos in
YouTube it's not about the YouTube I
always wear this kind of t-shirt whether
I go in party or maybe for a ship - I
always wear this I love it sir does
automation really kills our job nope
Automation never never never kills
anybody's job it's makes more job
because to write the code for the
automation you need more skilled and
more advanced
programmers okay it's something similar
to when the computers were coming up and
everybody was saying computer will kill
the job no it doesn't when the
technology evolves it gives you more
jobs how simple is that
put up the books you read on the website
like a time management etc yeah I should
do that really I'm not getting much time
for that I should really do that
sometime how to make fun with Java
language every programming language is
fun okay so so if you are getting a lot
of questions which city are you from
I live in the beautiful city of Jaipur
how cool is that which operating system
is going to have market share for next
seven to eight years ah both of them
Android and Apple you cannot get rid of
them because Windows is not doing
anything good
Ubuntu just failed it really bad so both
of them are going to share the market
for next two or three years at least
if python is required for AI yes python
is required for AI you can also work
with the AR but there is no much sense
to learn a new language to just for one
thing so go ahead get started Python
it's good thanks for answering the
question okay okay why again and again
are you single what's the point in
asking again again are you single how to
turn website to app easily if your app
is being designed in the react GS you
can quickly turn into react native and
can produce Android and iOS apps quickly
but apart from that there is no good way
because if you'll just wrap it around in
a wrapper it's it's not going to be a
good thing make tutorial and Swift
programming already done and is getting
uploaded where the course will be
available and what will be the price
price will be just about a movie ticket
or a couple movie ticket and it will be
the links and everything will be
discussed on the YouTube thoroughly so
don't worry you know hon everything will
be shared okay sir which language to
learn for ethical hacking it's no such
one language the more you will
understand the system the more you will
able to produce security for that like
for example if application is being
designed to react and you have no idea
absolutely no idea how the react is
performing then what you'll be doing you
will be just getting a pop up and you'll
be reporting that but react structure
does work really different so the more
you will understand the more you will
understand the security okay so here's a
lot of questions a lot of questions I'm
trying a lot of questions in there how
can I use Kali or palette in macbook air
should I use VirtualBox
yes VirtualBox absolutely works in the
Mac I use Mac all the time I use
VirtualBox but there is a parallel as
well which is paid option really really
good but if you don't want to go with
the paid options which the Box just work
flawlessly there okay Android or Apple I
usually go with the Apple because the
process is actually a little bit smooth
when you write the code when you submit
the application if you know all the
steps in process it's far more smooth
but putting up your app and designing
everything is cheaper in Android like
it's just a $30 for lifetime license
within the Android and Apple it's $99
per year so not every application
reaches to the App Store in the Apple
area simply because it's it's surprise
you have to pay and on top of that you
have to pay every year so if your
application is not doing good it will
just go up so that's the kind of thing I
like okay what are the courses you have
online I have almost I have a lot of
courses I have a lot of courses in fact
I do have a lot of boot camps as well
and particularly the main reason why I
travel so much okay here qualifications
what do you want to do with my
qualifications yes I am a qualified
engineer as well I had done my masters
as well what do you want to know more
about my certifications you can go ahead
and check out my gaiter profile instead
of just asking for my certifications
okay so how to send my resume at a big
company like Facebook and draw
because I watched your video on resuming
you don't send your resume it to these
companies because there's a different
process there's a different process why
Indian own OS boss not so popular if
it's not popular means it's not doing
good hello sir I'm from Nepal hello
fellas
hello from India - I hope you are doing
good so you have answered all questions
but not mine I have written two times ok
Anjali I am sorry for that I missed your
question because the questions keep on
rolling it's just ghost like that so I'm
sorry if I'm missing your questions
again and again okay who is your mentor
when it comes to coding my mentor is
stackoverflow yep that's that's my
mentor for the coding because eventually
the time comes in when you don't have
any books any online tutorial I remember
the times every time when the new
version of the Swift comes in like ship
3 and Swift are - there was nothing
apart from the documentation so we have
to just put our head on to Stack
Overflow and documentation back and
forth and I have to update our apps that
were already in the App Store so I would
say Stack Overflow is a good thing if
you once you are a little bit advanced
coder apart from that do learn from
online courses it's good ok ok I have a
question please never stop doing such
live sessions and what is the right time
to switch for a Java shop right now
right now it's 5:16 it's the perfect
time to switch on into any language
where you want ok and thank you so much
I will we keep doing all these live
sessions they are really awesome I will
be doing them quite a lot how much time
it takes to learn PHP depends on how
much previous programming experience do
you have if you have previous
programming background experience I
think within a week you should be ready
if you are getting started with fresh
with the PHP the more you will
understand the PHP I think within a
month you can just start rolling and
with the next six month you will be able
to create a full-fledged app but I think
instead of PHP why don't you try
JavaScript because you
into quite a lot and nodejs react even
in angular so why don't you try out with
the JavaScript okay there are a lot of
questions still going on and let's keep
going going make a video an internship
for tire three students a lot of
questions are coming up and I wanted to
show you more of more things in here but
this video just I have created this live
session to give you a live update of
what's happening so good news is about
to come on this channel as well we
provide you all the links and everything
so very soon I'll be doing that and this
was a very quick video although we have
crossed the 15 minutes but that's all I
wanted to do I have to get back to work
everything is messy in here and then I
have to head back to some places so
definitely with this thank you so much
for attending this live I'm really
really grateful to all of you people
keep subscribing to this channel keep
looking up this channel I upload a lot
of content a lot of good things are
about to come within this week and the
next week okay in case you do want to
get into the beta testing go ahead ping
me on the Facebook bye bye everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
