Microsoft has just jumped back with a
marvelous and gorgeous piece of hardware
the surface studio but is it really
worth to buy and what are the things and
what is the first impression that it
gives on me my name is Satish and let's
get started
so yesterday Microsoft got a new release
out there and this time they have gone
through a little deep and they have gone
with the hardware as well so surface is
really a pretty impressive piece of
hardware out there and a lot of company
previously have tried out with the
all-in-one PC but this time Microsoft
did the thing right way they really hit
the ball out of the park out there the
marketing team has done a brilliant job
in designing the videos the website the
advertisement pretty much everything is
right with this but I'm pretty much
scared of a couple of things now don't
get me wrong I usually use the Mac but
I'm a big fan of Microsoft 2 for in my
initial days of learning the programming
computer technology I got started with
the windows and it's pretty easy to use
it's smooth but there is one thing that
always bugged me off as a windows and I
know that's not a problem with the virus
that is the heating issues now I deal
with a lot of videos out there in fact
every single day I deal up with the
videos and heavy softwares like
Photoshop Adobe Illustrator or maybe
Premiere Pro and something like these
and one thing that Microsoft hardware
has always been lagging around is the
heating issues if the hardware is gonna
heat up a long it's not of any use for
me in the sound of the fan actually is
quite noisy and of course how we can
forget the blue screen of death but
keeping these things aside I am
expecting these things will not happen
in the surface studio so what the
surface to do is it's a pretty gigantic
and a gorgeous machine out there it's
pretty expensive
it starts with $3,000 and go up to 4,000
and $200 but these kinds of machines are
not for everyone if you are a school
going kid
or if you are getting started in the
programming these machines are never
meant for you so stop those kidney jokes
they are really really boring nowadays
go ahead find something we can live with
the one eye so go ahead and find
something new out there kidney jokes are
not gonna be much impressive out there
coming back on to the topic if you ask
me will I go for it
I would say no not at now obviously
because I have recently invested in iMac
which is a big one
going with a 32 GBS of the ram 2 GBS of
my graphic arts but again if I had to
buy anything big like that now I would
have waited a little bit more longer why
because now I'm a good competition
studio comes up with up to 32 GBS of the
wrap that is pretty high gigs and up to
four gigs of the graphic ads and almost
two TVs of the hardest which is kind of
a normal and yes the resolution is quite
nice a little more than the 4k also a
couple of things that is impressing me
is the hinge and the new hardware that
is really a marvelous piece of
technology the rotating dial is pretty
impressive it works
based on what application you are using
and in the ad or advertisements we have
seen that it can rotate with the color
dial as well or as well the thickness of
your pants as well but how is it going
to compete with the other designer
things like there is a simpler tablet
out there and some vacuum tablets out
there so it's gonna be a tough
competition for the Microsoft but I
would say this is a right step Microsoft
is back into the game with these piece
of hardware I would for sure be taking
care that how this hardware is
performing because a couple of my
friends are trying or are thinking to
buy that so I will be definitely looking
for the couple of things like the blue
screen of death which is going to look
really nice on the 4k what I'm expecting
that it's not going to happen
the hardware and the software both are
now compatible and I expect that these
things will not happen also very very
important for me and a lot of you people
out there is the heating issues how much
loud is going to be the fan for the
peoples who record videos like me noise
is one of the most important factor that
we have to take care well let's just say
I'm recording a screencast and my fan is
making a room out there it's not gonna
make
for me so definitely that's one bummer
for me and it has been a bummer over the
year but I'm looking for that out there
now it is they are saying that within a
couple of months the sale is going to be
in India for the broad there I think
they have already started out the sales
but let's see I'll be back with the
studio because I am really excited with
this hardware Microsoft has done a
pretty innovative job and has challenged
the Apple openly out there that yes we
are back into the game you really need
to see him and fix up a lot of things
out there so I'll be back with that
