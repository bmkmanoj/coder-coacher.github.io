can never be perfect in programming now
a lot of people after watching this
sentence are gonna say hey what are you
talking about man you always have been
talking about learn programming and
everything and now you're saying nobody
can be perfect in programming or nowhere
near the perfect in programming what are
you saying actually let's talk about
that in this video
in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps and
pretty much everything related to
programming and technology so in case
you are new here consider subscribing
now there is a little bit announcement
as well with this video I have actually
got a cool surprise for you and that
will come up at the end of the video you
will really really enjoy that
but first let's move on to the basic
agenda of this video now why I am saying
that nobody can be ever perfect with the
programming now obviously nobody can be
now I have seen a lot of people spending
a lot lot lot of time in just mastering
the language now I'm not saying that
it's a bad thing it's obviously a good
thing but spending too much time in
programming can be dangerous and why is
that because all the time you will be
looking up hey I'm not good enough I
should even practice more I'm not good
enough I should practice more and this
loop never ends now let me tell you what
approach you need to take now once you
have mastered the basic syntax like for
example I'm not saying you should be
completely skipping those parts but of
course I expect to you something like
you should be familiar with the loops
the concepts of functions and little bit
of the classes in object and that's it
that's it once you have got that you
should be moving on to designing your
dream project or any fundamental project
that you're looking for now a lot of
time a lot of people just learn on the
go and that percentage is almost 90% and
90% of people learn on the go now in
fact if you ask me I sometimes even
forget where should I define my object
or how to call a web request or even how
to define or how to call a segue there
in the iOS apps or even in for web
applications sometime I forget how can I
make this fullscreen background image
there I forgot all of all of these
things so in fact if I have been coding
for almost 10 years now I forget these
things it's obviously common for you as
a new programmer that you forget a lot
of things and it is completely ok so
what I'm saying in here is don't worry
about anything
you will never master programming even
after 20 years or 25 years you will
never master them the only thing that
you can master is solving
on the go now what happens when you take
a project is that there are specific
goals that you want to achieve now if
you're familiar for example let's just
say we taken a simple example of web
development and this can be applied for
iOS Android or pretty much anything and
you want a specific feature in your web
application that you want this
particular type and somehow you don't
know how to do that what you do use
research on the web you take some chunks
from here some chunks from there and
design that specific goal for your
website and you just mix around
everything until your desired product is
being produced how you do that because
you were being able to do that simply
because you were familiar with the basic
concept of the language and you just
learn on the go that's what I'm saying
so don't worry about if you are getting
scared hey I'm not feeling confident I'm
not getting much about the language hey
if you have if you are going good with
loops function a little bit
object-oriented that's okay now it's a
good time to move into project go ahead
write code for your dream application
that you were thinking to build learn on
the go solve the problems on the go so
don't wait for that and in case you have
no project mind you have no idea about
what kind of project you're going to
build up design specific project that
are fictional for example a website for
me or maybe for yourself or maybe for
your dad or maybe a simple replica of
something like if you are in the app
development clone is simple uber app or
maybe is if you are into game
development copy the flappy bird or any
other game like that and again the gist
of this video is simply learn on the go
you will never master anything now this
is my quick advice to all of you apart
from that the second important thing is
one of my friend actually alcohol of the
other business sprint when the student
actually mailed me quite a number of
time that I want to appear in your video
and I said why not it's it's okay to
appear in my video I asked him if you
can shoot a quick under two-minute video
and I'll shortly place that at the end
of my video there is no problem in that
so what I'm planning to do in here that
in case these videos are helping
you you can anytime pick up your phone
shoot a selfie video under two minute
please and tell me how these videos are
helping and what you think about this
channel I'll surely pick up those videos
and put at the end of my videos and this
is going to give you a good opportunity
to appear on the channel and with this
now let's move on and see what he has to
say and with this I'll catch you up in
the next video good morning everyone
I am Nandan Candela I am a huge fan of
hit a Chaudhary sir and today I have got
this golden opportunity to be on this H
Drive thank you sir for putting me in
this a drive I'm feeling very cool I in
respect of Atisha I would like to say
that he has really been a great part of
my educational life right now I am in my
final year studying software development
hate racer videos are really helpful and
they have helped me a lot thank you sir
have a good that is actually a cool
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
