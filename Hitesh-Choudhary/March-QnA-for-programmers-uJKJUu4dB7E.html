another video and in this video let's
answer some of your questions and
foremost I would like to congratulate
all those people who have been following
me on the facebook we have successfully
completed our three months of
consistency and haven't taken a single
day off I hope you are enjoying this
consistency just by posting on my
facebook day 1 day 2 just it takes just
a second but it against it again reminds
you about your goal and what you really
want to learn it doesn't cost you
anything and all the people are already
seeing some great amount of result with
that so in case you are not aware of it
go on my facebook page links in the
description and you just have to follow
the everything that we are doing there
like posting day 1 day 2 and can you
believe this like three months of
consistency and this is our fourth month
without even a Sunday offer any single
day off
it's a congratulation to all of those
people now coming out to your questions
part this video can be a little bit
longer because I don't like to play
rapid-fire round I like to give thorough
answer to your question just stay here
chill out calm and just talk about your
questions so let's pick up your very
first question which is interesting one
sir help me out I cannot afford to do
private BTech and I love coding I want
to go in CS field sir help now if you
cannot afford a like a heavy end
bachelor's degree in technical or BTech
it's not at all like compulsion you
should have a BTech to become a
programmer without even have a BTech
degree you can pursue programming stream
and I have seen a lot of people doing it
already and are successful and are
working in big giant companies one of my
friend is working in uber and he didn't
had a BTech degree and he's an amazing
Android developer so yes if he can do
that you can also do that having a
degree is not at all compulsion but
since you don't have degree you have to
work extraordinary hard so that you can
have whatever the field you are choosing
up you can have a lot of portfolio and
lot of knowledge on
so go ahead and surely you can pursue
programming without having an official
degree the next question is actually fun
WOM it says how can I keep myself
up-to-date to new technology and market
since college slavers is really out of
date how can I know which language or
software has more demand in market now
in simple words what I can say is if you
want to get all these knowledge and
update do hit that subscribe button that
would be really your first choice but of
course there are a lot of blogs and I
would highly recommend to keep an eye on
stackoverflow and Stack Exchange for a
lot of these recent trends and answer
and you can easily check out on the
Stack Overflow which questions are
moreover coming and where the trend is
going on and yes I do agree that the
tech channel which actually talked about
this programming stuff and market trend
are very less in number and that's why
this channel is growing like really at a
very high rate but yes obviously they
will come up as the time progresses I'll
link down the link of the couple of
Google official blogs and all of that so
that you can follow up a good way is
always to subscribe this channel and
keep collecting the knowledge just like
you are doing right now so in the next
one we actually have to question but I
would have one answer to both of them
the first question says how to create
balance with healthy and physically in
programming job life and the second one
says tell us about how to handle
programming and stuff our personal
project along with exams which is just
like marking up kind of thing just
because makes you eligible for
placements now yes this is like a lot of
people might be thinking these are two
separate questions
but answer to this question is actually
just one word which is time management
and your priorities now it all depends
on what are your priorities and based on
that you can fix up your time management
as well like for me in the evening time
it's like the priorities actually goes
ship that I should go either to gym or
to swimming or somehow because I have
learned the hard way that managing your
health is really amazing has still duke
sometimes slips out the sleeping time
and all of that but yes I make my
priority that at least the exercise time
doesn't goes out because once you are
healthy you can actually work a lot more
which is much more efficient so I do
that now in the college time also I have
been into this phase where I wanted to
work on
but then the college exams and
everything came up now I personally what
I I think about that is if you are gonna
get fail in those exams or will get
backlog there's actually a much more
time based so it's rather good to just
study that thing at that particular time
and just clear off your exam at least
with the minimum grade that's okay fine
too but please just clear them up
because restarting for that and re
giving their exam is actually a time
waste so don't do that time waste at
least study that much so that you can
get past at least let's move on to the
next question which is also fun I've
been following your channel since 3k
subscriber that's almost a year now it
was a long journey and best part ever
happened to me I have observed that you
have a constant smile on your face
what's the hack for it I love you sir
hey Rahul a nice question there and the
reason for my smile is actually two
reasons are there the first one is the
phase that I came up at this point of
life
my old phase was really harsh I had a
really tough childhood and all of these
things and moving to this phase is all
good it's like a dream life for me from
where I came I never thought that I'll
be making so far and so good in life so
that's my number one reason and the
second thing is my hobbies and my number
one hobby is on being on YouTube which
is like amazing community like you can
just see the comments here the love that
is flowing on this channel is amazing I
never thought that people are gonna show
this much of love to me this is like
insane that's I don't have words to just
say what I really want to say at this
thing but yes this love is actually the
reason for my smile the love from the
people that's coming up so I think
YouTube is the best thing that ever
happened to me and keeps me happy keeps
me smiling so keep this love coming up
and I just love you all and just I
expected somebody is gonna post
questions into questions into questions
so same thing happened here there are
series of questions here hi sir in
January Q&amp;amp;A you gave little bit extra
marks zuckerberg overmask what's your
opinion after Tesla Roadster project now
first of all the Roadster project was
killing
it really nailed it down to everything
and musk really showed something really
amazing and awesome about Zuckerberg I
would say that it's his worst time in
the life and he's going through the
really a tough time just like you might
have seen the Logan fall situation it's
even ten times worst with the Mark
Zuckerberg so let's just leave this guy
alone for a few days or few months until
everything gets settled down and this
doesn't mean I'm like I'm a hater of
Musk it's not like that I have read his
books and I have read his biography and
all of that so it's all impressive it's
not about I'm favoring any one of them I
am just favoring whoever is doing the
most work which we all can see and
consume I would love that guy honestly
so I just believe in who is ever he is
showing his work nicely in the results
actually so my favor always goes to the
person who is working well and is
showing some results okay another
question is actually fun one from the
same guy and he says now in India
everyone concerned about Facebook data
leak but not in AD hard data leak what's
your view on that
so here other data leak was quite in
news for a long time and everybody is
now Facebook now the point is the
government handling the government or
saying anything about them you can just
say but you cannot do much about it and
honestly you you are not doing much
about the Facebook data concern as well
whatever he's doing actually takes a lot
of guts first of all that mark came out
and said that yes we made a mistake I
wish some of the politicians could have
that kind of guts and could have shamed
that yes we have done some mistakes so
extra point to the mark here that he
came out apart from this the other data
leak is concerned I would say that yeah
that's kind of a tricky situation but
anyways until unless they they get
registered in some kind of bug bounty
programs very tie in tight security is
kind of almost impossible without those
programs so and the third question from
the same guy sir when you post Google
Facebook interview related video
actually I was a little bit busy in the
March with some amazing project I'll do
that announcement very soon and the
YouTube but I was a little bit busy with
that it's amazing
apart from these interview question
you're gonna love this next upcoming few
videos very soon so stay tuned a lot of
good news are coming up
next question is from Rabindra Joshi and
it's really fun when he says how do I
learn to play guitar hey turban as soon
as I will come to know that how to play
guitar I'll surely personally message
you how to do it as of now I am just
unaware as just like you the next
question is fun and it says should I
jump to Java after see now if you always
wanted to learn Java you even don't need
to learn C I have made a couple of
videos on this you can directly jump on
to Java or as a matter of fact any
programming language directly there is
no correlation with any other of that
but in case you have already learned C
shortly it's going to help because the
concept of loop functions and all these
things stays same in every programming
language so experience with any other
programming language also helps in other
programming language as well so no need
to learn anything else just go ahead and
move on to my Java bootcamp at learn
code online dot Ian okay this question
is something which is personally closed
because I faced the situation by the way
I am from an electronics branch so
that's why this question is it says I am
from Chemical Engineer and I have
learned Python from lco I also have
learned JavaScript and currently
learning web development
I love coding should I think about Bran
change after BTech now I also came from
a different branch which is electronics
but it's not very far away from
computers we learned a lot of things
about microcontrollers processor data
structures algorithms and all of that
but as far as you're concerned your
branch is completely way off different
chemical is completely different from
that but now every branch is actually
somehow affected or is being included
with the computers so even if you are
not able to change that that's
completely fine you can still pursue
programming as a hobby and later on can
take it as a full-fledged
but in case there are chances that you
can switch that I would recommend that
because your interest is in programming
so surely changing that really makes
sense but in case you are not able to do
so it's fine it's ok probably some of
the things that you'll be learning in
chemical engineering and mixing with
that programming can come up with a
superhit idea as well so no need to be
worried about every knowledge that you
gain from
any branch it's always helpful it's
always useful okay canal say is I want
to make Python GUI with advanced
graphics please make a video on that now
when I was in college I made a project
in Python and I used TK inter to get a
GUI for that I think TK entered is still
one of the best in getting the gif with
Python and I have absolutely no idea
what do you mean by advanced graphic if
you connect like in the comment section
Explorer
explain a little bit more detail about
it probably I can answer that in a
better way and this is this one is
actually my favorite question of all the
questions here I desperately need answer
of this funny question that why
programmers love coffee hey buddy are
you new on this channel at this channel
I'm a big fan of iced tea yes I do love
coffee too but if I would given a chance
to choose between coffee and iced tea it
would be any day iced tea so yeah like
not all programmers love coffee some of
them are a big fan of iced tea and tea
as well I really wanted to address this
question it says do you do you go to
YouTube creators event now I would love
to go to YouTube creators event in fact
one a couple of times I thought about it
but I do have limited amount of time
that I can spend in going to these
events and all those times when I
planned actually some invite came up
from some university or tech fest or
something like that and the audience at
this channel who loves me a lot
is actually in the engineering colleges
so I always have given preferences to go
to universities as compared to these
events I would love to go these events
make some new friends from YouTube
community but as of now my priorities
goes most of the engineering colleges
going there it's so fun to be back at
random campuses people know you there
they try to ask all of your programming
questions and you are you are really
there to help them it makes me it gives
me much more good feeling as compared to
these events I will try to go into these
creators event Sharleen future but as of
now the priorities are totally for
engineering colleges and again time is
really limited with me that is really a
thoughtful question it says if you were
not a programmer then now when I was a
kid I really wanted to become a
cricketer yeah of course you cannot
blame me for that I have seen the
players like Rahul Dravid and such in
they battered so well and all of that
like anybody in India who have seen
these players playing they're very fun
to be cricketer at the early childhood
after that during my school time like
the last days I wanted to become a
physics professor that was like if I
wouldn't be a programmer I would surely
have been a physics professor but the
moment I saw coding and all these stuffs
this fascinates me and now I cannot even
think that I would have chosen any other
carrier programming is all here so no
chance of that I'm gonna stick with
programming forever that's that's what
it is me it's all programming stuff now
the next question is actually fun one
and is about programming it says what
was the bottleneck for you when you were
learning programming now I had to tough
situation when I was learning
programming at the beginning I spent a
lot of time at C and C++ as well and
Poynter was one of the concept that like
was a nightmare for me I I was not able
to imagine how things are there until
unless that imagination came to me about
pointers it was so tough for me to just
nail it down and create some projects
and stuff like that so that was my first
nightmare the second nightmare came up
with the JavaScript and I was so
terrified about this keyword this
keyword was the toughest one for me to
understand and because I came up from a
background where I coded a lot in C++
and Python and in those programming
language this keyword is like really
rock-solid li defined but in JavaScript
it's it's completely like a nightmare
it's a mess and later on I figured it
out when I had really good understanding
of programming that this keyword is
completely broken in JavaScript and that
was the whole point of confusion now yes
in the es6 version of javascript this is
fakes now and by this I mean this key
word this is fixed now and it's so much
better it was really a nightmare so
these are the two points which where I
struggled a lot the next question is
about interviews do interviewers ask
object-oriented design questions in
every software developer interview now
it totally depends on what kind of
company you are applying if the company
is already having a product in the
market surely they're gonna ask you
object oriented design question and if
it's a start-up and things like that
they usually don't ask that that's
personally what I have faced if it is
the rock solid company surely they're
gonna ask for it now for rest of the
people let me just be clear that if you
are thinking that here I'm talking about
classes and objects and inheritance no
I'm not this is not object-oriented
programming I am talking about here is
object-oriented design and it's a little
bit different from your class as an
object here we really talk about UML and
all these stuff so yes these are being
asked quite a lot and the final question
is really interesting it says I am in
fourth semester of Bachelors of computer
science I'm already working on some
projects as a freelance and also I have
one to two pending on my list that's
really a good stats I am unable to
manage my time is it okay if I keep
working on the projects or should I
leave it now until I get graduate from
University now that's okay I have faced
the situation in my college journey as
well I would highly recommend you to not
to leave your projects because in the
college you are learning and studying
all these things that's good what else
who knows your college is gonna be
completed you will be dealing all these
projects and this is gonna be whole life
for you so don't leave these projects
just reduce down of taking new projects
but at least whatever the project you
have in your hand just complete them and
still pay a lot of time to your project
work because this is going to be your
life for your lifetime and college is
gonna just pass on within a few years or
months maybe depends on where you are
right now but again I would not
recommend you to leave all these
projects work I'm sure you're gonna find
some ways to manage that but my advice
is stay on with this project the thing
that you are learning with this project
is far more high as compared to what
you're gonna be learning at the
universities so in no case I'm gonna
advise you to leave those projects keep
on doing with that and figure out some
of the ways to handle the time here so
pretty long video isn't it yeah I know
it was a long video I don't like to give
a rapid-fire round I just want to
have like interaction and a proper
meaningful answers to all of those
questions so I hope you have enjoyed
this March Q &amp;amp; A this is one of my
favorite series because it's so fun to
answer all of your questions I post all
of my questions on my Facebook page I
just managed my Facebook apart from that
handling other social media is not at
all possible for me I also manage my
Instagram as well but as far as
concerned I'm still not on Twitter
so go ahead follow me up on Instagram as
well as don't forget to join me on my
Facebook page that's important one so
that's it for this video I hope you have
enjoyed if you're still with me you have
enjoyed this long very long Q&amp;amp;A notify
them in the comment section that still
if still you were with me have you
watched this video completely or you
just went out off half of the way it's
okay if you have turned this video off
in the halfway that's completely fine as
well so do hit the like button and just
customary in case you haven't yet
subscribed the video go ahead subscribe
we are having so much fun at this tech
programming channel catch you up in a
next video so why did you body
I think about about you all the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
