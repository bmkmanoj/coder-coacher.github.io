again with another video and yes you
read the title correct we are going down
that road the road that has a lot of
hate and obviously without even watching
this video a lot of people might have
come on to the video and start half
posting these abusive comment in this
video yes because some of the people's
are like too much sensitive about the
language issue but yes I cannot be just
be afraid of those people and cannot
just talk about this subject this is an
interesting and important subject that
every big nurse should understand
so yes I'm gonna be talking about that
before I get started and talk about how
much English is important for a
programmer or developer I would like to
mention two very important point the
first one is I am from Jaipur my
hometown is from Jaipur that's why I
speak Marathi as my language also since
I am from northern part of the country I
do speak Hindi as well I know English as
I'm talking in that language so I know a
little bit about it I'm not a grammar
nazi' I am also not completely a guru of
English but I speak decently so that
people can understand what I talk I also
can completely read Spanish as well and
can talk about that in a bit so yes I am
multilingual and that is an important
point I'll I'll come back on to this
again but that's a point number one
interesting and important point number
two I belong to a developer community
and I think developer community is the
best community present on the world
because we are developers we don't
discriminate based on nation caste
language your gender we are just all
like the most amazing persons on the
planet we don't we just code and that's
it code doesn't understand your gender
all these bias things so that's why I
belong to a developer community a
developer for example Google it's a
product it doesn't discriminate you
based on anything you search on it it
gives you a result people on development
site try to build amazing things like
uber for example it just gives you a
ride wherever you want to it doesn't
discriminate based on what language do
you speak or what language you don't
speak so that's why I
consider myself as a developer first and
I just love this amazing community and
the reason why I'm talking about this is
because this type of community in the
developer is the most sensible community
who thinks as well as try to understand
what is the perspective of the person
who is trying to say something very
important to things that's my point
number two okay so yes I like to always
talk about my things with the examples I
will come back on to the point that how
much English is important let me give
you some examples and proof as a concept
now once I was travelling to Dubai and
there were some Chinese group - who were
also happen to be going to Dubai as well
directly from China and it happened
somehow that they stopped at Delhi or
probably they might be visiting from
Delhi
they were hopping to Dubai now what I
saw there a lot of people and you by the
way let me tell you that Chinese people
are so proud on their language the
Chinese they are always like go Chinese
and all these stuff now regardless of
what they think about their language or
they don't think about their language it
is a compulsion that during the transit
visa you have to fill out your name and
password number now your name regardless
of wherever you are belonging or
whatever country you are representing
there you have to write your name in
English no exception at all so those
Chinese people some of the them didn't
knew English much so they were just
trying to draw their name in the English
that was really funny but that's a true
incident lot of them were trying to just
draw their name in English because they
didn't know the English now there is no
exception for them because they are so
proud of their language or not you have
to go in English
that's the rule example number two one
of my friend happened to be a pilot
previously he was flying to Delhi to
France now he's right now he's flying
from Delhi to Thailand and he told me
this exact word and I verified it it is
correct all the simulation of the flight
regardless of whatever the country is
all the simulation of the flights are in
English all the books are in English
whether you go to France whether you go
to Germany whether you go to Thailand
all of them are English so how no matter
how proud you are on in on your language
or not if you want to become a pilot
English is the language now some of you
might be wondering why I am Telling
all of this let me prove it by another
programming related examples now the
examples that I want to present you I
don't want you to take just my word go
ahead and verify them as well now let's
just say a client came to you and says
in my Android app or iOS app or F or a
web I want to integrate PayPal services
PayPal is a payment gateway and you can
provide that service it's not a big
thing to be asked by a client it's a
very routine process you'll see that
quite a lot now what will happen just go
to the documentation obviously you will
be going to the documentation of PayPal
website and we'll learn how these can be
integrated in iOS app or Android now go
to PayPal documentation and you will
notice that all of that documentation is
in English yes they to support multiple
currencies but there is just one
documentation there and that happen to
be in English another example for all of
my fellow friends from India in India
Paytm
is a very famous wallet just like PayPal
each thing for India it's a really
famous wallet now regardless wherever
you are from the country maybe northern
part or southern part just go ahead and
try to find the documentation of Pei Pei
TM how you can integrate that in your
website again what you'll notice is
everything is in English integrating
Facebook or Google login is a very
common thing for social platform whether
you like it or not it's not a matter if
clients is asking you to integrate that
we have to do it try to look into the
documentation of that you will also find
that these documentation are in English
and yes if you are a developer you
happen to already know that Stack
Overflow the giant lifesaver of every
programmer is happen to be also in
English so yes we have to agree that
English is a dominant language now it's
not a matter of whether you like that
language or not if you want to become a
programmer if you want to become a
developer english is the language here
now I do have variety of my friends from
France I do have friends from Russia as
well when we talk on skype English is
the language we choose you will be
surprised to know that a lot of French
people do oppose quite a lot English
here but regardless of that if that guy
is a developer you have to learn English
there is no exception in that when you
start writing code eventually you
become better developer and eventually
you'll be attending a lot of conferences
these conferences do happen all over the
globe in Thailand in Las Vegas in Asia
China in India in France Switzerland
pretty much everywhere and we are not
the Prime Minister of any country so
that we get the Liberty and luxury of
speaking in our own choice of language
and there will be a translator for us no
it's a kind of automatic default for
every dealer for every developer that we
have to go with English now again let me
tell you a lot of people come from
France a lot of people come from Russia
a lot of people come from India whose
first language is not English but you
know what I have never ever seen in my
life in so many conferences that I have
attended virtually and at live as well I
have never seen anybody pointing out hey
you missed out the past tense there hey
you missed out the future tense there
hey you missed out an is or head there
nobody cares about that all they care
about is what the person is trying to
say we understand that what we are
trying to say that you get that that's
the whole motor people do understand
that a lot of people now speak English
but still English is not their first
language even if you are speaking in
your first language many times you
fumble up in your grammars and all these
things so most of the programmers are
not like that grammar nazi' they ignore
completely about English in fact while
reading the documentation a lot of
people can point out a lot of
grammatical mistakes but nobody cares
about it because as long as your code
works you are able to say what you want
to say that's all what people care about
so my advice for Bignell would be start
speaking English and start learning
English now you don't need to take much
of the courses for learning English
because you're already good in that you
are on youtube.com you type that
youtube.com completely in English you
are able to read the title of this
particular video as well that was in
English so there is no such need of
extra focusing on that but make sure you
do practice it regularly in order to
become a great developer you have to
first of all be comfortable with English
now I can totally totally understand
that learning anything or understanding
anything in your own personal language
whether that's a Tamil that
might be a Punjabi that might be Marathi
or marvadi or maybe French or maybe
German learning anything in your own
language is amazing and it's so simple
but eventually you'll become more
advanced developer and then there will
be no one who can actually teach you in
your native language so eventually
you'll be moving out in the world world
is really big my dear friend and you'll
be moving on to the instructors and
books and documentation which happen to
be in English I also know that after
this video is being released on the
internet on YouTube there will be a lot
of people who will be coming hey why are
is not proud on your language now it's
not like that I'm totally proud under
all the languages that I do speak but
you know what these politicians and some
mindless people are trying to make you
divided based on your languages what
language do you speak or what language
you don't speak but trust me my dear
friend these are all politician all
these mindless people will not be there
to pay any of your bills when there will
be no food for you to eat they will not
be coming and giving you their own food
it's not gonna happen the reason why you
are learning programming the reason why
you are learning all these development
skills so that you can become better
developer you can live a better life and
that path of better life always will go
through with the English language yes be
proud on whatever the language you speak
but there is no exception of English
you'll be talking to a variety of
clients who happen to live in France
Germany United States Australia New
Zealand a lot of other countries which
you might not even heard about them and
yes the eventual way of communication is
English fact as fact so summary of this
whole long video filled with tons of
example is be proud on whatever the
language you speak but if you want to
become a better programmer or developer
start focusing a little bit on English
now you don't need to be a grammar nazi
for that or have to take any other extra
classes for that there's plenty of
content in the youtubes that can improve
you in that but again the number one way
of improving the thing is practice it
regularly and practice it daily go ahead
