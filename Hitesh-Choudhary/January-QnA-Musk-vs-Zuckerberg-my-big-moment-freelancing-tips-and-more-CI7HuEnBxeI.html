again with another video this video is a
Q&amp;amp;A video in case you don't know every
single month we do a Q&amp;amp;A video where you
ask your awesome questions and I try to
answer them this month also I posted an
image on my Facebook page that here is
your Q&amp;amp;A image for this month and
surprisingly this month I received more
than 100 questions below that image
these Q&amp;amp;A are my favorite part of the
series on the YouTube because you guys
asked amazing questions and I really
want to give them the thorough answer to
them now that's why I have picked up
only selected few of them but also I'm
planning to make a part 2 of this video
since the questions are so huge in
number so let's get started for the
January Q&amp;amp;A I was kidding myself just
like always the questions are fantastic
it was really tough for me to pick up
these questions only selected few of
them and try to answer them and that's
why I'm picking up a few in this video
and few in the next upcoming video so
let's let's start with an amazing
question that says a lot musk or Mark
Zuckerberg who is right about artificial
intelligence now the people we are
talking about are huge figures they are
not like any random people or any random
youtuber on which I can talk about they
are really giant pioneers in their
industry and I have seen that debate
that they're both are having different
perspective about machine learning and
artificial intelligence and yes Ellen
musk is trying to be a little bit
arrogant there and that's not the point
here the point here here is that both
are pioneers and both are really a great
people to talk about anyone who knows
about machine learning and artificial
intelligence in other don't both of them
knows it really well now the only quick
only thing that I have my perspective on
this is that on the one hand we have got
musk who is really great pioneer great
visionary but is only able to produce
Tesla and all his projects are like
fantasy so far like moon landing and
these roof tiles of solar system all of
these and
the goal of the technology is somehow to
make sure that this technology whatever
you are creating or designing should
reach to the mass audience and so far we
have seen that Zuckerberg was able to do
it whether that's an oculus or Facebook
he somehow knows that if I'll do
something I know how it should reach to
the mass audience so it's not the point
that who is right or wrong it's the
point who is able to do these machine
learning and AI make sure that it
reaches to the mass audience and so far
I think that Zickuhr Berg is winning the
game so far the next question is
interesting and I like it really a lot
so how programming languages are created
can you create your own programming
language if yes how if not why or how to
make your own compiler now let me tell
you this thing when you do your master's
in computer science or any related field
there is a subject in your stream which
known as modern compiler design and this
is the exact way how you design your own
programming language and in fact all the
people who have successfully completed
their masters this is a semester where
this is subject where you have to read
in either one of the semester or either
whatever the course there is but the
point is this modern compiler design
there is an awesome book as well I'll
link that in the description section
which I read during my masters it's a
good book and in that practical session
you also learn how these modern
compilers are designed what is these
grammars that you write for your
language and of course in a short
practical everyone does a small
practical where somehow we write our own
syntax for a language I called my
language during practical as a hit a
language it's not a really good name for
a language and people liked it actually
my batch mates it was like I called it
as each language and it was nothing
mother's language it was just somehow
you are able to assign a variable put it
into memory and print it out back that's
it because designing a language really
takes a lot of time effort thinking
rigorous testing and a lot of teamwork
as well so yes it's completely possible
to design your own language using modern
compiler design and a couple of other
subjects that you have to study it's
completely possible if you wish just go
ahead and design your awesome language
this next question is also really
interesting it says may
things cooking up for future like IOT AI
green transportation and blockchain so
according to you how future looks like
in a one world if I had to say I would
say future is gonna be amazing and more
centric towards computers and mobile
phones I was really lucky enough to see
this entire evolution I saw how people
just opposed the computers at first
there were rallies in India that
computers are bad and all these things
then I saw the evolution of mobile
phones right right from the very first
mobile phone which came in India and
then to the evolution where we are
seeing the iPhone 10 and all these
Samsung devices so I think it's really
going towards computers programming
mobile phones and all these things but
as far as future is concerned there are
always going to be a lot of Curie's and
research which are far more hard to
implement as far as they looks really
good in the fantasies for example the
self-driving car this looks so amazing
circuits there are good side of it there
are bad side of it and in theories these
all looks really good but actual
implementation is far more tough also
this blockchain a technology is really
booming nowadays machine learning is
also booming machine learning was there
already previously it was known as data
mining now it has got a fancy term known
as machine learning which is helping it
it in gaining a lot of popularity but
the point here is that yes future is
looking really promising and I think
that people who know right now how to
code are gonna be really taking the
advantage of the future whether you are
a painter or maybe you are a shopping
expert or whatever you are a few basic
knowledge about programming is surely
going to help you and feature and at
least I'm a big fan of programming so
what you can expect me is saying that
yes I can see a bright future about
programming regardless of what people
say and what the artificial intelligence
is shaping up machine learning the one
thing is really sure that programmers
are gonna have bright future and I'm
really proud that I am one of them the
next question is also interesting I
think I have answered it previously as
well but let me try that again what do
you think about Sofia AI now Sofia AI is
something that I have been following for
a really long time
and before even they have applied to
this Saudi Arabia citizenship I was
following this project even before that
and I'm really happy that somebody has
got open-minded and allowed a
citizenship for that I even followed
Sofia when Sofia came to IIT Bombay
I had a known professor there I wanted
to go there but due to some client
issues and work I couldn't travel there
but I asked my that professor friend
that hey can you please go into Skype I
really want to see live how Sofia is
interacting all of that I'm really
optimistic about how things are facing
and even we have got a robot that can
understand our context that's really
fascinating for me and all those people
who are worried about Terminator kind of
issue come on that was just a movie a
lot of things happens in the movie in
case you are following the news right
now a lot is happening over at the
movies but regardless of that it's a
really leap forward where we are going
in the future and if we'll be afraid of
the future we cannot achieve that so I'm
always optimistic about this I have a
very very high hope for Sofia to be
turned up really good in the future I
would also like to see some athletes as
well as robots like I would love to see
somebody some robot that can actually
looks like a human and is able to
compete a race according to human limits
as well and swimming and all these
things just like right now in the
colleges we do have Robo war competition
I would love to see all of the robotic
competition Robo swimming a robot
running and all these things I think
that would be fantastic and I would
really like to part of that it's amazing
to see all these things a question about
freelancing let's pick this out how to
get clients in freelancing website and
one thing how to know the trending topic
in order to make a video on that topic
on YouTube let me answer that one by one
first and foremost I think the two
things that you should always keep in
mind while bidding is make sure you have
a portfolio after that you bid up and
make sure you understand two things
about the client first the client is not
fool so that you can just present him
any pre-written context or predator and
template and can just give him in the
bed don't do that and second is make
sure you understand the client as well
it is really the important part what
you're giving to the client is not about
just a website it should be whole
Experian
and this will allow you to interact with
the client and get more projects so
again look for the client understand
what are his need and according to that
only gave him his demos of these project
that he have built in the past or you
have worked on your own at the initial
stage bidding and getting freelancer
project is stuff I do agree on that but
it's not that tough obviously at the
initial stage you have to reduce down
your prices you cannot charge $500 for
making a website at initial stage you
have to reduce down your price quite a
lot but once you have got projects you
have got a reputation you have got few
stars from the clients obviously you can
charge up later on quite a bit so always
just remember client is not a fool and
try to understand the client as much as
possible give him just don't don't just
give him a project give him a whole
experience so that he can become your
fan a really cool question and I think
it will help you to understand my
perspective as well is it better to
learn complete front-end development
before Python now let me point out
straightforwardly here that python has
nothing to do with front-end development
of course we are not talking about
Django or flask but what I think about
it is everyone everyone everyone should
know how these front-end technologies
work specially HTML and CSS at least
whether you are a pen tester you are a
network admin or you want to go into
Linux Linux whatever you call that or
maybe you want to go into mobile app
development Python machine learning data
science whatever that is HTML CSS this
is how the entire web is being made and
at least if you want to call yourself
programmer at least have a basic
knowledge of how HTML and CSS work this
is like basic and I always recommend
these skills of front-end development
are always going to be helpful whether
you are going into machine learning data
science these are the basic foundation
and structure of the entire web so an
extra skill is never going to harm you
always and always take some time and at
least learn HTML and CSS or if you want
to go into complete front-end developer
here's the link also link is in the
description check out this course next
let's pick up a question about my
experience it says have you ever out
sourced any project if so then how was
your experience
what are the do's and don'ts of
outsourcing yes I have outsourced quite
a lot of projects some time it gets
really busy up so I found out some of
the outsourcing people and outsource
them my projects it was a mixed
experience sometimes you get good people
who are actually working on your project
and sometimes you get the people who
don't really understand your project at
all and just throws up random words and
give you random things I really
absolutely hate them these are the
people who are just running a senseless
companies on the freelancing websites I
absolutely hate them but again there are
good companies as well who likes to
understand your project and deliver you
accordingly but I really sometimes see
that there are companies who just works
on WordPress and just gives you a
project being designed on WordPress
whether that's a requirement or not and
sometimes you just say that hey I want a
guy who can work on react that's it and
these companies who work on WordPress
and all these things try to bid on those
project I don't know what is happening
there but again it's not always about
bad experience I have some found good
amazing writers good amazing designers
who have not only completed my project I
have asked them to teach me something
about designing and all these things and
they happily took a charge and taught me
a couple of good tricks as well so
always sometimes there are amazing
experience on freelancing world is all
like that there are good people and
there are bad people so it's a kind of a
mixed experience a question where I'm
gonna bash down a lot of universities so
the question says degree or project
portfolio which is more important in
programming job okay let's just be
honest here that degrees are also
important but not that much important we
all can say this really honestly if you
just ask me I'll just say that
universities Labour's is completely
outdated and this is not kind of a fact
that I'm telling you already knew this
and all the people who are teaching at
universities all the higher management
of universities they also know that we
are nowhere near where actually the
technology and the industry is going
towards so obviously degree alone can
never never get you a decent good job
probably you can get a job where you'll
be sitting on a bench or maybe working
on a company which in which the work can
be done by a student who is just tenth
or
maybe 12th standard and you are just
working in such a company I don't think
that's a fruitful thing so yes my honest
opinion is if you are just relying that
I have done a degree I'll get a job you
are in such a dilemma that is completely
wrong get out of that myth with just
with the degree you obviously won't be
getting a good decent job where you can
get progress you have to work it on your
own you have to learn it on your own
whether that's a Python machine learning
maybe Android maybe iOS whatever what
are the things are networking pentesting
whatever you want to go you have to
learn it on your own at your own free
time whether that's night day however
the struggle is you have to learn it on
your own the reason why a lot of
universities are staying behind the
industry standards is because there is a
lot of paperwork and a lot of process in
order to update any slave s or
curriculum the the moment they will
start to update their curriculum for is
ten probably it will be iOS 15 which
would be in the market and obviously
again they will be really out of the
standards who this is getting really
long but the questions are actually
really interesting and I like to answer
them a question about personal life and
it says do you have girlfriend because
many programmers don't have girlfriend
they only love computer ish thing only
also tell us why you always pronounce
word with ish tell us story behind that
if you are good in time management you
can be multitasking and that's only
statement I'm gonna make for question
number one about the my adding of the
ish thing it's all about one of the
Singapore company I was leading through
and those people were good in
programming not so good and also they
were not good in English so I was really
having a hard time in making sure that
they do understand what they have done
is correct but not hundred percent
correct and it was really a tough time
to make sure that they understand this
once I added that this is correct ish
but not completely correct they just
clicked with me and they understood that
it's not a perfect thing and we are not
doing we are doing something wrong so
that made me realize that when things
are not 100% you can just say it's ish
like it's almost there but it's not
there and people just understood it
nicely so I got this habit from there
and I didn't look back after that I am
still like this another cool question
so your favorite fictional character who
really motivates you in life and whether
without even a blink I can say Tony
Stark hard-working talented good amount
of resources good money and don't give
us out what people say in life just try
to do what he likes to do and that's
what keeps me motivated that no matter
what the world says about you just keep
on doing your job and do it all the ways
perfectly and in style also onto a side
note I'm talking about the Tony Stark of
the movies because in the fictional
character or in the cartoon series or in
the comic series it was mentioned
clearly that Tony Stark got mutated and
that's why he's super intelligent so we
are not talking about that we are
talking about the movie one okay this is
really a cool questions and I'll like it
and you know what I have been saying
quite a lot cool question so let's just
give that when did you realize that you
have achieved something in life I am
really happy with what I have achieved
so far in life but of course this is not
which I can only do I can go really far
beyond I came from a place where I had
to drop out for three months from the
school because I didn't had enough money
to pay for my school fees and it was a
forceful dropout I absolutely hated it
and now I have come to a place where I
have achieved really good things in
education I have got my own Harley
Davidson I have traveled all across the
world the office that you see right now
is my own office it's not rented I have
purchased it with my own money so I
think I have come really far and a lot
of these like buying Harley Davidson
buying your own office these are all
point where I have realized that I have
achieved really good also recently I got
registered my company got registered in
the United State that was a big one but
out of all these which has given me a
lot of like inner peace is something
being on YouTube the community love that
I have found is like far beyond I'm
getting your first Harley Davidson or
maybe getting your first office or all
these things are far less as compared to
what I have seen on YouTube I go on to
restaurants and people just know me and
like to say hello to me and I get all
these beautiful comments in the comment
section I receive tons of messages
hey we are just being motivated they are
learning something because of you maybe
not on your platform but still we are
learning something just because of you
we got started in programming this is I
think the most best thing and the
beautiful thing that has ever happened
to me this recognition on the YouTube
this love towards the channel I don't
really care whether you tube stops
monetizing my videos or anything YouTube
can never stop something which is the
love I'm getting from the people and I
think this is all why because this is
all why I do everything on YouTube so I
think this is my biggest achievement in
getting stay in touch with all the few
people I think this is kind of a
extraordinary feeling I absolutely love
this next question how regular your
haircut is just want you to know okay
come on this is going too far probably
we are not going to answer this but wait
for part 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
