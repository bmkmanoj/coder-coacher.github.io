Catalan training and in this video I'll
show you how you can seamlessly
integrate Java everything Java packages
and pretty much everything in the
Catalan files in here also we are in the
continuation of the tonic of our
functions and let's just carry on in
here this is our main function
we have defined some dummy functions
which are just a basics basic clearing
of all the basics so let's just say we
want to define a function that just gets
a current date and we will be using Java
classes in here so all you have to do is
write a fun keyword in here and let us
call this as get date okay
and this should not do anything this
should just a run a function date but
the return type would be date now you
can see it automatically suggests me
Java dot util because they it is being
brought up by the Java dot util as soon
as I hit enter there notice it has
automatically imported Java dot util for
me and that's it
that's pretty much it you have
integrated ahead Java functionality in
here so I can just run this guy and I
can use a return keyword whenever you
want to return something from a function
you can return it and I'm going to call
this run the date that's it there we go
as simple as it sound so you might be
thinking there should be some procedure
of integrating Java into this like that
now it's not you will be writing the
code exactly in here and you will be
just using the structures and mechanism
in here for the Catalan and he will be
getting everything from the Java so this
is this is something super cool and if I
run this in here do notice in a second
that we should be getting some date we
have actually got the date which we
forgot to print that out so we should be
printing it now so let me just write a
print I'll end there and let's move this
guy in here there we go fix that let's
just run this again and we should be
seeing the date this time okay there we
go we forgot to add a line break in here
so our date is in here we can do quickly
in here as simple
I'll end there I think things should be
fixed now this time at least and there
we go so Sunday May 21 pretty late night
in here so this is how you do that now
what I would like to do is simply just
do a quick refresher or a summary kind
of thing in here because I know we have
discuss quite a lot so first of all in
order to define a function what you need
is a fun keyword the name of the
function followed by parenthesis and in
the definition followed by the curly
brace you can write any definition of
the function or whatever the working you
need in here
sometimes in the function you need
somebody to pass an argument as well
like when the function is being called
somebody should pass something from
there depends on what the thing is being
passed on it can be string or it can be
integer anything this name is completely
on you you can call it anything
regardless whatever the things are being
passed on but the datatype really do
matter and you can utilize these data
types in here in these couple of
functions we are not returning anything
in in the function that is why this is
not being followed by the syntax of
colon date so whatever the return type
of your data is you have to mention in
here for example if you might want to
return a string value in here what I
would do is put a colon in there and I
would say I will be returning a string
then the return and the type should be a
string is compulsory to be defined
inside the body of the function also we
talked a little bit about how we can
seamlessly integrate Java as well so
there is nothing much extra you have to
do you have to just write everything in
your syntax of the Catalan whatever you
are doing and every functionality that
is there in the Java every package that
you have found us under that you usually
use you just have to call that just like
that just a the integrated editor will
suggest to you hit enter and it will be
importer at the top and that's it you'll
be writing it exactly in the syntax of
the Catalan and there we go and that
this is one of the reasons why most of
the features are now being upgraded in
the applications like uber and Coursera
and all of these other guys are being
updated in the Cartland it's easier to
write as well as you get the full power
of the Java for which the Java is known
so this is a win-win situation for
everybody so this is a quick update in
here and I hope you are enjoying this
course so far and let me know in the
comment section as well how you're
enjoying this course so far and now
let's go ahead and move further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
