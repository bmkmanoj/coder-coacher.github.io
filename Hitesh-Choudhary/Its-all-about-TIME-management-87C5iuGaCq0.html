again with another video in this video
we are not talking about tech but it's
related to the tick where it's more over
how to learn taken how to manage your
time this is going to be a special video
which has been requested for a long time
on my channel that how do a lot of stuff
so easily in case you don't know that I
do a lot of stuff managing my clients
managing my own apps and websites as
well as teaching things on boot camps as
well as on videos having offline boot
camps traveling to the rare part of the
world like Switzerland or Egypt and a
lot of other places as well or riding my
Harley Davidson from Jaipur to Goa so I
do a lot of these kinds of stuff every
single year and a lot of people ask me
how am i able to do so how do I manage
all these times and how do I actually do
it so in this video we are going to talk
all about it coming up in this video
in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps and
pretty much everything related to tech
as well as sometimes some tips about
tech just like this one so in case you
are new here please do consider
subscribing now moving on to the point
that how am i able to do all these
things now at one point of time I was
just like you guys just like a big nerd
and I was completely happy now also I
would I would like to just kind of
accept this year's at one point of time
finishing up my favorite season just in
one night was the most prioritized thing
for me and I was completely happy with
that but eventually I realized that this
is not going to work watching all those
seasons all those movies just lying
around at my bed is not going to work if
I have to do something meaningful with
my life I have to work on it and I have
to start a little bit hard next day then
too hard this was formatted none of the
things and none of the episodes now the
movies that I really do like to have
collections even I stopped doing that
third of all of my DVDs and everything
all subscription plan cancelled them all
and started working now again I worked
really hard on that and one point of
time I was a great penetration tester I
still do that but I was working fine as
a penetration tester having a good job
nice salary all of my travel in the
India air tickets at hotels were covered
up by the company I was getting a lot of
invites from the universities I have
traveled to a lot of them and life was
good but then I realized I can do a
little bit better because I read a coat
I really forget where I read that I
really really am sad that I cannot
actually give credit to the person who
wrote that code that no matter what
happens the Bill Gates or the Mark
Zuckerberg all of them have 24 hours in
life and so does you if you want to
utilize your time if you want to utilize
your life you have to work a little bit
harder try to squeeze out the time a
little
from your sleep little bit from the
movie time little bit from the family
time and obviously you can get success
now this was the code of saying that hey
everybody in the life has 24 hours and
some people utilize it
some don't really stuck it to me and I
really wanted to make sure that now I am
going to do a lot of things I learned
about the time management and this is my
tip to everybody whether you are
learning programming maybe guitar maybe
learning bike riding or whatever you are
doing time management is the most
essential skill make sure that you make
a proper plan of your entire day a month
and a complete year if possible I know
at the initial stage ear planning is not
at all a good idea but at least make a
plan of entire day or entire week you
should have goals in my mind that by the
end of the day what will I complete what
is the new thing that I am going to
learn by the end of this month I should
analyze my think that what I have
learned is there a difference in my
educational level from the last month to
this one and what I have actually
created now this self enhancement or
self assessment will help you to
understand that what you have gained and
what you have lost time is the most
beautiful thing it's the most valuable
thing money you can earn it at any point
of time but time once it's gone it's
gone so make sure that you create an
entire time now I in my phone I use a
lot of productivity hacks like one most
important thing is my to-do list I have
just created my own personal to-do list
my own personal app in my phone it's not
there on the App Store but it's nothing
extraordinary you can find hundreds of
to do apps it just lists down what the
things I have to do today now I am never
able to finish all those apps I just try
to keep a list of them how how many I
can check them out in a day that's my
goal and I keep adding a lot of them and
I try to make sure that by end of the
week on Saturdays it's completely off I
should be free now this is one tip that
I follow up but apart from that that
will help you to make sure that you are
the best in the time management is going
to be priority and nobody can tell you
what the priorities are sometimes
varieties more to the friends than the
work sometimes more to the work then
friend you have to be your own judge
what you are going to do sometimes
sometimes people will say hey family is
the most important thing a friends are
the most important thing I am NOT here
to argue or discuss about that
all I'm here is to say that it's the
priorities and you have to set it on
your own base sometimes it's not the
priority to go ahead and watch the
latest movie sometime it's more priority
being given to the project that you are
working or the thing that you are
learning and make sure you record
yourself as well because this is a game
key important aspect if you will not
reward yourself then it's going to be
little boring so make sure when you when
you are taking a course making a project
or doing learning anything once you have
done that make sure that you you kind of
a give a simple party to yourself go
ahead watch a movie by your gadget that
you are looking up for just read
yourself it's the important aspect now
these are the few things that I have
shared with you so let's just summarize
them as well and I'll make sure that I
come up with these videos later on as
well first of all everybody in this
world has just 24 are in life one day 24
hour that's it
whether he is a Bill Gates Mark
Zuckerberg or you or me you can do a lot
more than what you are doing our human
body is capable of handling a lot more
than what you are doing so far right now
point number two that I really always
emphasis have a schedule if you are not
going to be scheduled it's the you who
is going to be feeling bad about it so
make a schedule what you're going to do
today what you're going to do in the end
of the week make sure that everything is
planned up keep your everything in a
to-do list what I need to do today make
sure if you are in a course or somewhere
I have to watch five videos today that
is going to be priority make sure you
check mark every single day for it I
have to learn Java or Kotlin or Swift
whatever you are learning make sure you
keep in mind that by the end of three
weeks I will accomplish that no matter
what happens travel plans movie plans
that will come up later on but I'm going
to stick to that that's point number two
so everything you should keep that into
an arrangement
point number three
is setting up the priorities which is
super important and uh I'm no judge here
to say that hey don't go with the
friends just keep on working or keep on
working don't go with the friends
whatever you like it's the you who is
going to decide what is your priority
and trust me once you've started to
working a little bit on your time
management scale and self-assessment
that hey what I have accomplished in the
end of the day or maybe end of the week
light is going to be changed thoroughly
eventually we will get more time and you
will be able to treat yourself a little
bit more better like for example when I
will be accomplishing this Android
development code I'll be treating myself
by some travel or maybe some buying a
new gadget or something I haven't
planned it out yet but yes that is
important ok I know this was not the
conventional video which we do at this
channel the tech videos or something but
again to learn anything learning is the
same process and to learn Tech or maybe
non tech things time management is the
most essential and beautiful thing ok so
keep in mind that time is something that
you cannot get back money you can the
time you cannot so treat your time as
the most valuable things so in case
you're watching your favorite CDs or
movies you can get back to that or you
can start something that you really
wanted to learn so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
