with another video now in the last video
I promised all of you that we'll be
doing a Q&amp;amp;A session and that video was
meant to be done on the very next day
but actually I got a little busy with
the visa and all of the stuff but here
am I making you excuses in here and
we're going to talk about the Q&amp;amp;A
section and I'll be taking some of your
comments from the YouTube and I'll try
to answer them in this channel we talk
about programming web apps mobile apps
and everything related to about
programming and real technology so in
case you are new here consider
subscribing now obviously I cannot take
all of the questions because simply
there are a lot of them and if it will
if I'll try to answer all of them in
very detail it it will take a half an
hour video of an hour video and nobody
likes that much long video so I'll start
and I'll pick up a few questions the
answer I'll be reading them from my
screen and you'll be seeing them in the
bottom section below so let's get
started and it says the first question
is from Sean I hope I'm not bullshitting
down your name but what's about problem
solving depression after learning first
programming language I go for problem
solving but I stuck on there some time
it's like problem solving is not for me
or how can this be a big nerd level
problem still I don't give up your
advice can help me out on on this kind
of stack so please respond
ok problems are good they are not the
end of the world in fact if you are
following up me of me on the Facebook I
recently posted that it took me almost
40 hours to figure out where am I
missing the curly braces there now
obviously some of you might be thinking
hey brackets and all those editors
automatically do this for you how can
you miss that but yes incidents do
happen and it's it's one one approach
that you can look out for is first of
all read the errors that's the most
important advice I can give it to you
now before searching for the errors you
should be aware of what kind of error
you are dealing up for example I knew
already that somewhere I'm missing it
braces it's not like I'm just wandering
and randomly doing things in here and
there I knew exactly that what I'm
missing in here there is a syntax error
that I'm missing up so first advice
would be look out and read the errors
properly if you are good in reading the
errors then you can do tons of stuff and
all those pentester guy would be
agreeing with me that years reading
those errors is super important whether
it's an SQL injection or maybe debugging
your own error the first step would be
to look out and read properly what your
error is now again a good resource
everybody knows it is a Google but I
would say instead of googling the simple
error try to look out on the Stack
Overflow I know Google is a big giant
big dog in the game but looking out your
error on the Stack Overflow can be much
more helpful you can straightforwardly
get your answer and eventually with the
practice you will realize that a lot of
errors you have already overcome in the
past and you can solve them pretty
easily so that is your response now
second is a very interesting question by
hurry and he says is it important to
study algorithm and data structure
thoroughly to work in a big company and
I would say absolutely yes now in case
you don't know I recently a couple of
months back I got an offer from Amazon
to work for work for them and I denied
the offer because basically it was more
over about the C++ profile and I didn't
wanted to go into that although it was a
good offer in the States but I didn't
took that offer so all of that I can say
is a big amount or a big amount of
problems that big giants are facing like
Amazon's and Google and Facebook is they
have a tons of data and how to manage
that data is the important part and if
you look out for the interview process
and everything you will figure out that
they focus quite a lot on the data
structure how the data is being managed
the three organizations or how the data
is being retrieved merge saw and all
these sort things and the managing
stacking of the data linking lists and
all these are pretty important so yes
thoroughly reading about the data
structures and data management is pretty
solidly important if you want to go into
those companies
now coming up on to the next case by an
IT engineer hey IT engineer I receive a
lot of your emails but have sadly I'm
not able to respond all of them but I'm
trying my best first of all now going on
to that your question how to remember
the code syntax now I would say your
problem is not just basically about
remembering that code syntax your
problem is how to remember the code
syntax when you are switching from one
language and I would say yes at first
it's not that easy because I switch
languages quite often from Python to
Swift from Swift to JavaScript so yes
it's not that much easy but eventually
you will realize that it's it's a little
bit of the syntax and within a few lines
of code maybe just 200 or 300 lines of
codes will make you quite frankly freely
about the code syntax but yes I don't
remember them that much also before I
switch my language I quickly go through
some syntax and PDFs and they just look
out for what are the syntax make a quick
hello world or to-do list and it gives
me much more frequently but if you are
looking that hey how to remember only
one language syntax I would say just
stay with it for four almost five or six
months and the syntax will become breeze
to you so no big deal there practice is
the key there is no such hidden secret
you are asking for Shubham sharma asked
hello i am shiva my question is that can
we learn programming without going
college absolutely look in fact going
into the big companies and all of these
doesn't require a college degree and in
fact I know a lot of big giant and
structure lanes from the profiles where
I teach they are not at all college
graduate but still are doing fantastic
in their companies so yes definitely
it's not important that you go to
college college studies are completely
different from the coding you can take a
few boot camps or maybe you can take a
few online classes or offline classes
and you can prepare your portfolio
profile and that should be solid of
course because you are competing with
the people who have gone to the college
and you haven't gone to the college so
your profile and portfolio should be
rock solid create those apps or mobile
apps or web
apps our website that whatever you are
creating should have a lot of features
and it should feel to the guys that yes
this guy has done something rock solid
instead of going college and we should
definitely add him so definitely it's
possible to learn programming and
everything without going to the college
and uh she asked hey can I get your
email id my email id is already quite
public if you ask I would say hit H at
the rate hit h re calm you can see that
in the tag below the video as well
pretty public email I have got and the
final question that we will be answering
is you are sharing great knowledge to
the point really appreciate thank you so
much Sun gate and I would like to get
answer to my questions how should one
get started in UI UX like XML up Android
development as well as iOS please make a
separate video on this topic yeah sure
for sure I can make a separate video on
that but to be honest UI UX is not about
XML or the views in the iOS it's a
completely different subject and for
that you should be looking up to learn
apps like a sketch and everything and
there is a complete different subject
there is not related to programming UI
and UX is completely about how user is
going to behave or is going to think
when he is going to interact with your
app and there are a lot of great courses
great books by there in fact if you can
just mail me I can link you up with some
instructors who are teaching UI UX but
again to be honest it's not a
programming subject it's a completely
different animal there in fact recently
I also took a couple of lessons from
those instructor because my apps were
good but client was somehow not feeling
good about the app so I took a few
classes from them and they taught me how
the menu should be layout or what menu
should be displayed on the front because
we have got just a very small screen
there and we have to adjust everything
in there so they have a complete
different scenario of wireframing the
app which button should be there what
color should be used so it's more over
about the designing and graphic process
and not about XML or Swift or iOS it's a
complete different subjects we are
looking at at the very wrong way just
look it from the designers
perspective and that would be good I
would say so with this I would say that
this was all that was in my mind for the
Q&amp;amp;A definitely in the future we will do
some more Q&amp;amp;A and we'll be back with
those kinds of videos for this video I
would say that much only for this video
and if you think that this video was
helpful for somebody make sure you share
it and I'll catch you up in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
