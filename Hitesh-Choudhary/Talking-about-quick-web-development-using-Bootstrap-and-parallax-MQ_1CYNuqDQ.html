compare to see if we can successfully do
that this time okay looks like we are
live but we are having some traveling
some connection issues there okay
so videos is life but some of you might
be facing buffering actually nobody is
there yet I just received a special
request there to go live and talk
something about web development quick
web development actually let's just see
if we can do that and I'll be waiting
for a few seconds so that I can see if
we get enough audience there were
actually even well not it's there if
this life is going so let me know if you
can see me I'll be waiting here for a
few second before I get started and yep
at least 12 people are watching now that
is one good sign
okay and I know the quality is not the
best yet okay so yep this is real and we
are going to live and no we are not
going to talk about the big data yet
this video is actually live because I
wanted to talk about quick web
development and we shake asked me that
hey it was having some issues he's a
student in front-end development course
and let's just see if we can talk
something about this is going to be a
good life stream for you to learn about
the quick web development and quick
things there I hope everybody will be
able to do so okay so let me just get a
few settings there right
and I think this is good so far okay
things are good my screen is little bit
big okay looks like it is good now can
we go live now and talk about the web
dev okay it's buffering let me know when
it's stable I think it's going to stable
within a few seconds I'm not on the
fastest connection on the word but it
will work for sure in a few seconds okay
let me know when they can start okay so
let me open up a browser there and let's
talk about the web dev quick web dev
actually and we're gonna create a
front-end web site really quick in here
and using the bootstrap and everything I
hope everybody is able to see me please
come in if you think this is going to be
good okay I'll have questions are there
any project we can make and right yes
surely we can go about the live on the
end Reuter everything right now we are
talking about we are talking about the
bootstrap and in case you're listening
all of you out there I have just pushed
some of the good nice github repos for
the react GS in case you are learning
react GS you can use there okay so
surely we can start now okay that's good
news
okay so web dev let me give you a few
quick things there I'll be using a term
editor I have recently shifted from
brackets to Adam because I think it's
much more powerful and much more easier
to work around with and I'll create a
new folder on my desktop
I'll be calling it as simply mmm
let's call it a site I don't know why
but let's call this okay what I'll be
doing is I can open up the atom there so
let me have just open a file open and
it's on my desktop and there we go site
let's open up there looks good and
command n to create a new file I'll save
this file as simply let us call this as
index dot HTML there we go
and by the way if you are not aware of
that I always use Emmet so let me just
quickly go to the Preferences there and
my packages and one of the packages that
I always use is Emmet I don't know if
I'll be able to find it there we go
Emmet and in case you don't know what
the Emmett is its web developer helper
and you can install it on pretty much
every editor Emmet and there we go it's
a fast pace I do have a free course on
the Emmet in case you are not aware of
it make sure you go there and check it
out it's really really fast so make sure
you download it for your particular
plugin it's available power supply madam
coder eclipse text me whatever that we
are using I'm pretty sure you're using
one of them okay so let's go there and
what I'll be doing it is let's just use
an exclamation it the tab and there we
go we have written a lot of code a lot
of code just within a few seconds so
this kind of approach you should have in
case you want to learn about the
development okay
so let's use the bootstrap so go to get
bootstrap calm and let's just directly
move on to the bootstrap it's really
easy just click on the get started and
there we go we can see some of the
syrians are there Siegen is actually a
content delivery network and you don't
need to use offline CSS offline
javascript you don't need that you can
just use this guy in here and can
directly go there no need to do so it
gives you a lot of pre-packaging
stylings jQuery is JavaScript a lot of
that you can use okay so please keep
commenting down let me know that if it
is going good okay hey this you have
awesome knowledge hey thanks thanks
buddy
and keep commenting down it will make
sure that it will give me a good boost
there that yes I'm doing great so far
and especially from Yorba shake I keep
chatting me there on the Facebook I can
know that you are there so keep doing
that okay and I know some of you might
be following there so I'll be pausing in
between so that you can also follow
along with me okay
so the number one thing that we need is
a minified CSS yes we will be adding our
own CSS as well so make sure you do that
but I'll be needing this one as well now
I can just copy-paste this or I can just
use a simple style there so let's just
copy this guy and there we go and let's
just add it in here and I'll simply say
link columns CSS and there we go it adds
up the things right now I'm just
pointing out lower default CSS no we
don't want that I'll be getting the CSS
this 1min dot CSS yep copy this and go
to this guy and instead of this I'll be
just pasting it in here okay so there we
go we have added the bootstrap CSS we
don't need to download any single thing
okay that's good now in the meantime
let's create our own customized CSS for
sure we'll be editing a few stuff so
let's just save this with the name of
style dot CSS of course I should have
been creating a new folder there
structure is really important so let's
just do that it's it's a good approach
CSS and we might need one more folder
for GEOSS that's always a good approach
you should not be going there you should
be going there why are you not going
there just by the way will be just
adding CSS there I think we need to do
it in here and inside the CSS I can just
cut this guy and paste him there
why are you not going come on okay you
can just go there now it's good so index
file is there our CSS is there or GS is
there
that is good so far so good and now
let's do a quick test whether the CSS is
being a test or not right now it's not
so let's just do a quick link oops
call them CSS by the way if you are
again wondering why this is producing so
much of the code Adam and M it is
responsible for that so link is not
correct here CSS collar-style doc CSS is
correct link and it's a very good time
to just test out the things so I'll be
doing simple body and let us call this
as background color too and I'll steer
ed I know that's not a beautiful color
on the planet but we will work on with
that so I'll go into the index and I
have installed the app in live server so
that I don't have to do a reload reload
again and yes please allow okay it's
taking a few seconds to launch my
Firefox surprisingly that's my default
browser I don't know why that okay so
the red color is there that is good so
that means our CSS and everything is
connected that is one good thing that
you should do every single time I know
red is not a beautiful color I'll just
come in this line by the way command and
slash for me for you should be
controlling slash for a quick commenting
writing quick quote is everything
everything okay so that is one thing
that we have done now we need two more
things we need Java Script as well and
in order to run this JavaScript we need
jQuery as well okay
so we don't need this optional theme
we'll need this minified javascript but
let's just copy this guy copy this and
this is going to be our script so let's
just place this script just just at the
end of the body you can place it after
the body is no problem I'll just add a
script and we'll add a source there okay
and there we go oops did I forgot to
copy there and there we go
so our script is ready of course
going to work because we need a CDN for
jQuery so CDN for jQuery and I always
look up for my favorite CD and GS comp
one of t trusted guys okay and let's
just go there and there we go and I
think we can we can go with the three
point we need this guy Jake when he
touches or jQuery minified would also
work there okay so let's just copy and
script at six at some time and make sure
you add the script before your bootstrap
because it requires okay now things are
done things are done almost let's go
into the body let's just add it there
and now what I want is in here is let us
have an h1 tag and inside the h1 I would
like to have some lorem ipsum text okay
save that and see how does that look and
you might already be noticing that some
of the stylings are already being
applied there the text is not what is
the default text it has got some font
abilities and everything so that is
approach number one and let me quickly
ask you there because I hip nobody's
going to be there there's no point of me
getting light there okay okay so okay so
can you please make a video on dentistry
no not yet I'll be answering a few
questions in the meantime and let me
just quickly how hard is programming
it's pretty easy damn easy but don't get
stuck with see if you get stuck with the
C you will be stuck in for forever so
don't do that
okay so this is going nice this is very
nice Abhishek is still light
and there are a lot of other people who
are learning surprising Lee that oh by
the way I can just post it on my
facebook as well so that other people
can go there and let me just post it on
the Facebook as well so that I can get
benefit of this I just made up second
guys hey there I am live on YouTube
talking on quick
where they're supposed to link out that
as well youtube.com slash - I -
surprisingly that's my username okay
that goes on to YouTube I know it's a
little bit slow their streaming is a
little bit slow internet is not fastest
on our country there okay but let's go
back there and let's continue our
development there okay and ok let me
just before I go on there there are a
couple of things that you need to aware
before you go on to the development
they're one of the most important thing
is images and fonts that is what makes
your website stand apart again I repeat
that images and fonts so we'll folks
first picks up the font and I like to
use google fonts font stock Google comm
I think that is the URL to the car okay
and make sure you use a good nice
looking font font is everything on the
webpage font and images okay and let's
quickly find out a good font and
straightforward I think I'll go for
something something let's quickly choose
let's not waste much of the time they're
all a big fan of serif fonts but I think
I'll go with this this is nice and slim
and let's add this there and on this guy
oops too much of the zoom and this is
the link we need okay so they just copy
and paste this link okay
copy this and we need to go back into
our editor and paste that and I always
like to face these kinds of stuff at the
top so that later on my stylesheet is at
the bottom I can edit that that is good
as soon as I save this this is not going
to make any difference there we see no
difference at all so we need to add our
font family disk area as well and
wherever you want to use this font
family you can just go there okay so
I'll go into my stylesheet and in the
body I want to use this style font and
immediately you might see that the font
is not changed looks beautiful okay so
looks good now one thing is fixed that
is our font and you can choose your
fonts make sure you use styling forms in
different forms everywhere if you are
going for the competition there Abhishek
okay that's step number one you can note
um that by the way okay and the next
thing is images now images is pretty
much everything and one of my favorite
websites is axels a lot of start photos
completely free with a license up to
whatever you want to do and you can see
some lie and nice and lovely photos make
sure whatever your theme is may be
computed of the mint or maybe the desk
selling or maybe some construction site
lookup for the specific image it's not
just random images okay and by the way I
do also upload free photos to here as
well and another one is pixabay that I
use rarely but still I use it there are
a lot of others as well which doesn't
have any and all these websites are
Creative Commons so nobody's about the
copyright as well that's that's lovely
thing
okay so font is done photos is done and
maybe maybe in your competition that
you're doing a bee shake you might need
to edit those photos and your software
or your system might not have some
photoshop or any software so in that
case you can use canva comm again an
online awesome web services that can
edit your photos in any size and they
have a lot of pre requested ie I have
used them quite a lot and this is how
you do it just create an account and
notice I use them quite a lot there with
the designs and them all of these you
can see them and they have got a lot of
template if I open this up it opens up a
lot of things by the way you can use of
custom dimensions as well in case you
need that but again a lot of pre-edited
templates are there in my early days of
the youtube might um they used to come
from there but now it's not the case I
use sketch now okay I hope everybody is
enjoying keep a posting
comments there so that I can know that
you are everybody so I'll say hi there
okay and now it's time to use the
bootstrap okay so we have set up our
things like our font is done our images
are done now let's go ahead and use the
bootstrap okay let's go into the CSS and
everything we are gonna do is gonna be
in here
and the first thing that we need I hope
everybody is aware of the grid system
that the bootstrap is in case you're not
let me quickly walk you through what the
grid system is bootstrap actually
assumes that your entire screen may be a
mobile screen or however wide your
screen is actually divided into twelve
equal parts okay if you want to divide
your screen with two equal parts then
you will be separating it with six
column and six column okay
if you need a full width column you will
save my column that would be 12 okay I
hope you are with me and in case you
need a slightly bigger one here smaller
one here you'll be saying this column
bit would be six and this would be three
again make sure that you understand that
the sum of this should be always twelve
there okay okay choose your desk photo
featured in there my desk photo got
featured there we'll use that okay that
would be nice okay and let you see if we
can search for Apple desk and I think my
photo should be there somewhere okay
okay let me just see if we can find out
my desk there it's tough a lot of desks
there okay okay there we go this is my
desk
so we'll use this this photo there okay
there we go and let me just download
there are a lot of sizes that you can
download let me download a large guy
right there and I'll download this one
and I'll save that on my desktop in the
side I should have created any folder
known as images structure as
they put that in the images especially
in your competition now let's go back
there now I hope everybody understand
what this actually this row and column
thing is you'll always have one row
inside that you will have columns you
can have n number of rows but your
column can be some up to 12 only okay I
hope everybody is with me so far
I hope everybody is enjoying as well
okay so people are asking me I see hey
I'm live everybody can see it
y-you mean the permission for that okay
free knowledge thank you very sure now
that is some time freeze not all the
times but quality knowledge comes with a
little bit price sometime okay now let's
go into the components and quickly
design a website okay and I like to give
a background color to this so let me go
on to my editor and I'll go over the
background color as well BGC and I'll
use something like ca ca ca I think that
should be little grayish and there we go
I know a lot of colors in case you know
I don't know what that is that color
would be a website from which you can
flat UI colors if you want some flat
colors
okay Blanco is quite well I don't know
that's how the framework was designed
honestly I don't know why they have
chosen that well there but that's the
number they came up with I know that's
weird
but that's how it works in the framework
we have to play by their rules
okay I hope that ask your answer your
question so there we go you can ask any
color from in here let's use this guy
you can just copy there and I can go
where is my editor er if I can find that
out you can just paste it there and
there we go you will have the nice black
colors I love the plaid colors there are
lots of other websites you can go with
them as well coming back onto our topic
components let's use first of all and
that part okay so there we go
there are a lot of nav bars you can go
with I'll go with this guy so I'll click
in here press my shift key click again
copy this and go to my editor wherever
that is and
having here suggests we know the body we
don't need this h1 now so we'll just get
rid of that and I'll delete this guy we
don't need you and I'll write a comment
there so that I can know where my navbar
is so okay navbar goes here and again
I'll use command slash to quickly come
in I don't write manual comments ever
and paste that save that and we should
expect a navigation bar with nice colors
and nice fonts there okay that is one
good thing now but we don't need this
kind of our navigation bar we need to
edit it a little bit let's quickly do
that it's pretty damn easy so here we
say the brand we can just change the
brand to what should I make
YouTube like YouTube live is gonna be my
brand name say that and YouTube live is
there looks nice okay
I'm credible India says I have to learn
seeing my it's in my curriculum what can
I say
and the curricular needs to get updated
and now after that we have got link link
and a drop down I guess we don't need a
drop down in here so I'll get rid of
this drop down beer are you drop down
okay this is drop down ul and this is my
Li notice everything is into the Li so
I'll select this Li and I'll get rid of
you say that how does that look it looks
nice we don't need this search box as
well I hope I'm not going too fast there
okay hey what a little do you use a page
I use atom nowadays I used to be a big
fan of brackets but bracket is not
updating and right now quite a lot okay
so this is our form that we need to get
rid of this this is a reform actually
the input and the submit in case you
need that you can just keep it there
I think it's not good I'll just get rid
of this we don't need it right now okay
and it should be updated so link link
there and now we need to use this alloy
there is one link I'll call this as let
us call this s home and this will be
like services
that command ship D that duplicates my
line in order to editor it might be a
little bit different if you are using
bracket that's command D in my ad of its
command ship D in sublime as well it's
command ship D and the home services
about us I'm just putting a random links
there I'm not really sure why I'm doing
so home about us and products in case
you need a drop down there you can
anytime go back to to this guy and you
can copy a drop down there you will and
this is the drop down there you can just
go for this is action another action
something else in all these so I hope
you understand that as well
so let's just say that and notice this
is going good by the way I like this
color in case you don't like this again
notice in the drop down your guard
actions and everything and okay so let
me just go back onto our editor okay and
I'm pretty incredible in yours where do
you stay hey oh you want that sounds
creepy okay and I'll get rid of this
link for now I'll work on one drop down
command X to cut that and where where is
my editor I need to arrange the things
it's getting messy okay this looks good
and this looks good in here okay not
only things are better okay
now things are better I can see my
navigation bar at the top in the drop
down notice it says drop down in here
instead of drop down I'll say account
save that notice it changes to the
account we don't need a action or other
action we'll just add two links there
and I'll say sign up sign up and I'll
say log it I know that's fictitious but
I think that is good for us come on
reload okay sign in sign up and log in
you can add something else separated
link and there is a
as well right now I'll get rid of this
we don't need divider in fact let's just
keep the divider there I'll command X
and I'll just call this as okay like
admin login it should not be there but
let's just call this as face shows
unlocking just just making something fun
here okay and sign up login spatial
login okay come on that's what we have
in here okay and it says most probably I
guess it's exclusive no it's not
exclusive it's for everybody who wants
to learn quick web development there
it's for everybody I'm not saying it's
exclusive for anybody but yes somebody
requested me from the course and the
people who are in the course gets
special privileges there sometimes okay
so okay Adam for Mac only no Adam is
available for cross-platform Blanco it's
available for Mac Linux and Windows it's
cross-platform I always use everything
cross-platform because I have to teach
okay and what is the best way vegetal
for Windows Linux I would say Adam Adam
that's it and you are expending great to
see yes expanding and click knowledge
you have say lalala I don't know why
Auto link nice for Adam Auto link from
menu is gonna skip the gym today I'm
gonna skip the gym today as well I got a
new tattoo and that's that's not a good
thing because it hurts a little bit at
starting so I would say yeah I would be
skipping the gym too buddy okay we are
getting keep commenting there we shake
and other people as well let me know
that everybody is with me so we have
created our what we call this simple
menu there now let me show you a quick
trick as well I'll be just opening this
up in my this editor I think it would be
better to just have one editor there and
face this and come on okay now let me
show you a quick trick there because if
you want might want to add
some color schemes there of this guy so
what you can do right click and click on
the inspect there that's quick and
nastiest way and now what you can do you
can see that your border color and
everything is mentioned there you can
just copy this entire navigation many
let me just click on this and again I'll
be selecting this and notice there is a
navigation menu move being available for
you so this is that dark glass you can
quickly grab this class and let's go to
Adam and use this for just for the demo
purposes I can paste it exactly there
I'll be calling like background color to
be red just to show you things and
notice that now the background color is
red I know that's nasty color but this
is how you can quickly edit some colors
okay and let me just show you a couple
of more things let's make it a little
bit good and I think I'm not getting
very specific with the colors but I'll
talk about the colors in a second okay
wait for it wait with me for a few
seconds and I think I can go back in
here and notice now the color is looking
good
okay and you might be looking at hey
this border color is not looking nice so
we can change that as well and we can
simply say border rather and make it
green and how about now and it's not
going to work just yet because we have
to choose a pickup another class and
also let me show you one more thing that
if you can select this guy like this is
an active link there if I select this
notice it again gives me colors there
these are the colors you're looking for
so you can select another class for
cover and everything so this is a quick
and nasty way to just edit a few quick
CSS there and I can anytime just paste
it there and I can say like color would
be all white and notice now my active
link is having white color there I have
to pick up other Elliman
says well just like this and notice now
all the allies will have also white
color so quickly I would not say the
best way to this deal out with the
Pink's but yes that's a quick way and
sometime use it and notice how quickly
we have actually edited all of these
colors so they look nice I can change on
the cover as well or selected as well so
this is a quick way a quick way to just
get around other things just saying that
okay and I think I liked the default
colors as well much better so I'll just
get rid of this and this guy as well
save that and I think this color scheme
is looking good
now also I would say in case you are
getting around with some competition or
anything like that using a color palette
is always a good idea okay and there are
a lot of websites which can give you
some color palettes maybe a material
design or anything so color palette is
like following a set of colors I thought
and just I copy paste and edit designs
but now I clearly everybody does yes
everybody does that that would be great
yep so what I was saying that you have
to use some color palettes it's about
following some themes and that's always
nice and officiated so just choose a
good color palette there once you click
on that you can just keep these color
palettes so these are the colors that
you'll be using throughout your web
pages and this is always always use okay
this makes your websites much more swing
they're much more awesome even your apps
as well so follow some kind of color
palettes and in case you want to just
give your website and look and feel up
Facebook so there are color palettes
available for pretty much every web site
like Facebook uses these color palettes
and same is available for Twitter as
well
oops not tweeting tuturro okay and
everything is available there okay what
I'm saying is try to use a color palette
that's always appreciated okay
coming back to our web page this is done
now this is looking good now the next
thing obviously would be maybe a
Jumbotron or
we can use some images there let's try
to use a slider okay that would be good
slider and slider is found inside the
JavaScript and they call it something
different like yes they call it as
corrosive I guess yeah they call that
colossal whatever that means
and you can just quickly copy and paste
this obviously quick just copying and
pasting won't be working you have to
edit it a lot and what I can do now is I
can close this
I'm just quote folding is a good thing
I'm folding my navigation bar because
I'm done with it and I'll be calling
this as slider goes here enter there and
there we go our slider is there save
that and it should give us a slider in a
second now obviously our slider is not
gonna work just yet it's not a good
thing notice because we don't have any
images being coming up from there so
that is why it's not working we need to
give it some images okay and let us see
how our slider goes in and how we can
just work it on the touch okay so we do
have three three just like two zero one
two three is good now source is empty
and alternate text is empty and this is
how our active slider goes in and
thereafter you can add just item there
so this is the division for that okay
let's use a couple of sources and I'll
directly pick up some images maybe maybe
what should I choose okay let's use this
guy and maybe I can just copy the link
from here directly copy image address I
think this is going to work but this is
not a good approach but let us say you
should always have some images being
downloaded theorem that should how it
works I notice this is looking a little
bit awkward because we are directly
picking up our image from the website we
should have downloaded it and made it a
width according to the web page but I
just wanted to quickly show you things
okay and now again I'll just copy and
paste this three times in here
in the source in here as well so I'll
face this guy again and I'll copy this
division copy that and place that again
so that we do have three crosses there
okay not the best sliders on the world
but notice how quickly we got through
that if we could have adjusted image
little bit there and I forgot to comment
down the slider goes here okay that's
that's not a good thing
Slater goes here coming out to say that
should be good now okay I think if you
want to adjust some of the heights and
weights maybe you don't like this much
and maybe you don't like this padding at
any point of time you can give an extra
class there okay you can give it a test
there and can write some CSS for that
okay I will be going into the detail of
CSS there because it's already being
there in my course complete front-end
development but I think we are going
good now okay now lastly I would also
like to talk about the parallax there
and for the parallax I would call a
pixel called parallax one of the thing
that I use quite a lot and I rarely
design these kinds of websites but
whenever I do I use pixel called
parallax okay there we go we have got a
pixel called parallax there the uses you
and everything you can see how nice
these parallax are and you can just also
go with that and we'll be using this guy
it will have a parallax there okay and
let's just download this okay it's
downloading come on
looks like I'm gonna very very slow
internet so desktop and the site and
I'll just put it in the Jes save there
open up my site jeaious unpack this and
we just need a parallax GS there okay so
I'll just drag and drop this and we
don't need anything else I guess so
but I'll still keep all these things I
can delete us okay so we'll need to add
this
our next argyus as well so let's go into
our editor and add this and add a
descriptor there and it's going to have
a source oh where is that I completely
forgot that it's inside the GS Alex
GS so I'll copy this and it's inside the
GS / parallax start GS so our GS is now
already inactive so what we can do next
is add this data attribute there and
copy this and we can actually go ahead
inside the atom and again we can just
close this which my phone is ringing and
close this guy and Alex goes here
comment that there we go
and the parallax is there of course the
data image is not going to be there I
can just give it show it apart images I
guess it's not in the / it's in the
images images and I need to rename this
alcohol this s1 dot PNG images / 1 dot
PNG and that's it that's of course it's
not going to work here yet we need to
define a few more things but again we
can just go ahead with the parallax just
like that it's no big deal okay the
reason why it's not working because we
got an empty division there we need to
put a few things inside our division
maybe an h1 tag get some lorem of five
just like that so obviously we need to
add a few things in here and right now
it's just in interestingly behaving odd
with this but again it will just go on
to the course there are just two videos
there let's talk about the parallax in
detail I cannot go into the much of the
detail we are already are the 40 minutes
of the life maybe we will do it a later
on sub par with a much more plan and
I'll answer a few comments as well
ion says you make it seem so simple yet
that's my job that's actually a job of
every teacher to make it look damn
simple okay and if you need anything
else from the bootstrap as well it's
just a matter of copy and paste you need
good buttons there we go you've got a
lot of buttons there okay primary button
success buttons drop-down scroll up so
it's just a matter of copying and
pasting the code making it look good you
make things look good with fonts and
images okay I hope you got that okay so
I hope this was a quite fun section and
everybody learned how quick and easy it
is and by the way if I'll show you all
of these things let me just show you
quickly and in my section 6 the lecture
number 33 and 34 are about adding
parallax just two lectures for 10
minutes each and you can quickly go
ahead and just go with that okay so okay
let me just an Abhishek says let me
quickly brief what we have done him here
I know we have done quite a lot I won't
be going much further there because it's
already 6:30 I have a quick meeting
online and I have to catch that up okay
I hope you understand that I'll quickly
close that up and I'll summarize what we
have done in here now in order to make a
beautiful website or following the
convention the first thing is you need
good fonts you need good images if you
need to edit the images you can always
go to canva.com or if you have some
softwares like I use catch Photoshop I
don't use that much but I use catch that
does the job for me you can use these
kinds of things okay so get your font
and get their images and next thing is
to use a color palette and there are a
lot of color palettes available online
and just choose any of them it's always
a good idea next thing is the bootstrap
so how we got the bootstrap let me
quickly summarize that as well and we
get the bootstrap a sibling CDN so we
create a link for the CSS just with this
link make sure you also understand that
only the bootstrap JavaScript is not
going to work they haven't mentioned it
in here clearly but it requires jQuery
so gay
quenice EDM okay and then after that and
make sure you follow this in your editor
as well like I'm first placing the
jQuery link and then after placing the
bootstrap GX okay it needs to be in that
order once you have done that now the
things are easy okay you also need to
create your own CSS and everything which
we have dispersed quite a detail okay
and just grab this and you can grab a
navigation bar your trouser sliders and
and everything everything in here and
adding parallax and I would always
recommend this pixel called parallax you
can see these are so lovely panel X and
again this is beautiful because they are
using good images I hope you understand
that okay and watch those two lectures
and you will be ready to rock and roll
with the parallax and for a competition
I would say grab a navigation bar grab a
good slider add a few section and just
use parallax and that's it that's what
you need to do okay so I'll maybe launch
a few of these so how do we resize
images quickly I would say go ahead and
use canva to resize the images it's just
a matter of uploading those images there
is the canvas and you can use your
custom dimensions there use custom
dimension and whatever the height and
width you need there you can just enter
their uploaded images adjusted there try
to use canva it's it's month okay and
you can quickly resize that so that's
one thing if you have any
where are your courses available okay
that's interesting question let me post
it that I'll give you a link I hope
everybody gets that link okay let me
just quickly show you what lecture you
need to learn here is link you might be
familiar with the curriculum so far
happy shake and there we go adding
parallax part one adding parallax part
two that's it and we are building up
building a project there as well just
like all the ways we do we never skip
anything without the projects okay and
this is what you need to do just learn
these parallax two things we have also
talked about the color palettes from
canva as well but again just to remind
you quickly adding parallax one and two
okay that's what you need to do let me
just go back in here put it there okay
how can I put it
okay looks good okay any more questions
you also talked name who written the
comments thanks more people to come okay
I'm not gonna call up your name because
your name is very funky a number that
and yes I would surely like to thanks
everybody who has come to up and join in
I'm about to release one more video on
the YouTube I hope everybody's gonna
love it because we are also going to
have this okay
and I think if you have any more
questions you can quickly ask or can I
just go now
