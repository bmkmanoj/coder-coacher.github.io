missed the tag in fact I did miss it
quite a lot talking to you guys making
videos that help you to learn
programming and everything but I was on
holidays in the Jordan and Egypt and I
was completely on a holiday mood no work
at all I did learned about the shootings
videos and everything but this was just
the update Tech is completely back and
if Nick is completely back let's roll
that intro now in today's video we are
going to talk about something
interesting I'm going to give you just
one yep just one perfect tip that every
programmer needs now how I came up with
this video first of all this is
important to know and this is something
interesting and tedious talk so let's
get a little bit closer this looks good
okay so today morning I I was talking to
a person I again don't want to name
anybody but I was talking to that person
and he was very confused he was learning
programming getting the syntax
everything good but he was not able to
deliver the project whatever he was
working on he was getting stuck quite a
lot and he was saying I'm confused with
my syntax sometimes sometimes I'm not
able to understand how to do particular
thing and I think a lot but I'm not
getting it now this video is going to
help all of the people out there who are
trying to learn have almost done a
pretty good job with the syntax but
still are not able to deliver the
project or to apply it
whatever the thing you are trying to
apply now what is this one quick tip yep
that's just one now I would waste much
of your time that one simple tip is
google it like crazy
yep again google it like crazy like
nobody else have thought about it just
do how to how to how every time whatever
you want to do just do Google it now a
lot of these people will say that hey if
we are going to Google it every single
time how we are going to learn
now I hope many of you don't know that
because a lot of time you just learn by
googling and when you saw the syntax you
think that hey this is a good way of
doing that and that's how you learn now
a lot of people say that hey I am
working on something great something new
and how that can be possibly on the
Google trust me my dear friend on on
entire web here whatever we are creating
is just a recreation we are not
reinventing the wheel whatever you are
thinking you are doing has been done by
somebody else in the past now a lot of
you might be thinking hey this is not
true that ubirr came up for the very
first time or the Twitter came up very
first time or the snapchat came up with
a very new concept how they were able to
Google and do it now let me tell you
this they are not at all a new concept
now think it on an on a very broad scale
they are not a new concept at all what
do you think the snapchat thing when you
post a story and when you hit back and
just get deletes think about it broadly
it's just the things which are
triggering on some event and things are
getting deleted from the database is it
a new thing no it has been done hundreds
of the time with the presentation and
the use case scenario is a little bit
different what do you think the uber is
a new concept getting a location sending
your location to someone else and
showing that person on to a map is it a
new thing not at all it has been done
hundreds and hundreds of the time but of
course the presentation the use case
scenario where the utility is being
modified is completely new but the
concept itself is not a new thing so
think in a broad way what you want to do
whether you want to delete something
from the database whether you want to
add something into the database want to
design a login system or maybe whatever
you want to do just Google it like crazy
and make sure you focus on your project
back again and I think this tip will
help you don't listen to the people who
are saying hey googling everything is
bad no it's not trust a random guy from
the internet who has been coding for so
long and still codes every single day
don't be afraid to google it
google it like
crazy and this bit will change the whole
scenario of your world okay so this was
a very very quick tip but very essential
to that everybody should follow up now
just onto a quick tip and apart from
that I want to give you a quick updates
as well now since I'm back into the tech
programming encode you can post down
your questions below in here I will try
to answer them or try to make a video of
it so that it can be more productive
more helpful for the people and if you
want to learn anything specific or
something do let me know and as of now
right now I am working on to a very good
project printing based project on to
react native so in case you want to
discuss something else as well do notify
me drop me a message out there and I
would love discuss about that in case
you want to just say hello drop down in
the comment section I checked them all
of them and with this I would say if you
