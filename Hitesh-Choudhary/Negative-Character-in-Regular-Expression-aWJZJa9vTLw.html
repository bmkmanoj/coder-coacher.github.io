regex training so in this video we're
gonna talk about one more character set
and we'll understand how it works now
this is very very simple compared to
what we have learned in the previous
character this is known as negation or
negative character set now it is exactly
similar if you have programmed in any
language whether it's a C JavaScript
Ruby Perl Python we do have this symbol
which is used for naught so if the
condition is like true and if we place
this negative character or the negation
character there it just turns or flips
the condition so it is true but now if
you'll see this as a whole it will
become as a false now similarly in the
regex we do have such kind of character
which is just placed above your 6 so
play a so press shift + 6 and this is
the tiny I don't know what even to call
this but this is the negation character
set here and the only thing that you
have to understand here which is do take
care of this always use this negation
inside the square bracket so always use
this in a square brackets or character
set if you want to use it as negation
character or negative character I'll
give you examples in a minute but again
there are a couple of other meanings of
this negation as well but right now
let's just keep things simple okay so
first of all our examples so let's just
say we have road we have code we have
bowed and we have wrote something like
this or maybe just toad and what else
can be it can be like oh dude I'm just
coming up with some words here so what
we want to do is obviously we want to
just select some of them so let's just
say you want to select we all know that
OTE is gonna be there now we're looking
for a character set okay so in the
character set we just say that you know
what I'm looking for either R or either
C okay and just to give you more a
little bit on this it's not gonna select
this guy notice it's not selecting it as
a whole it's selecting a part because
it's just looking for either C or either
are very important word here okay so
notice
here it's just selecting two things here
or in this case the third one here but
this negation character can help you to
select don't select this guy select
everything else okay and how you use
that first of all remember you have to
use it in the character set and then use
this tilt sign there so it just says
search for everything but if the search
gives you all or C don't select that
apart from that everything is accepted
and when I say everything do take care
everything okay just to give you some
example notice it selects a bowed toad
dode and it is also gonna select one oh
de because remember everything
everything apart from RC okay and it is
also gonna select space and oh de
because space is also a character there
and if you want to put something special
characters like for example a person and
oh de it is also going to select that so
be very careful when you are selecting
that a lot of people try to give an
example of a couple of first words and
select all of them apart from these
vowels and consonants so you get that
that's a pretty easy example so so you
can have these kind of example select
everything every letter but it shouldn't
should not be starting from these AEIOU
so you get the point this is very very
simple very basic don't worry this
entire series will be completely breeze
and you'll understand enter a regex
that's it for this video and I'll catch
you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
