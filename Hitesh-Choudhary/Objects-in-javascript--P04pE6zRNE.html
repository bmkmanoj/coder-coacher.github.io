it says 37 degrees Celsius it's
ridiculously hot and the future it's
gonna be like 41 degrees and in
Fahrenheit it's like 99 it's
ridiculously hot but anyways let's get
started with our JavaScript series and I
hope you're enjoying it so let's just
move forward further into the series
first of all welcome to the new section
now so far we have learned about the
most basic stuff and the intermediate
stuff about JavaScript but this point
onwards we are going to be moving on to
some advanced part and if you'll ask me
that what is the most important topic in
JavaScript for any whether it's a
node.js react angular whatever it is the
most important topic is what we are
going to be covering here objects
objects are the most powerful and most
used data types in here we have learned
about the simple variables and the
arrays we will be visiting them again
but right now it's a good point and good
time that we start learning a little bit
about objects and I would highly
recommend you to pay special attention
here so let us get started and create a
new folder and I don't want to create it
here I want to create it here in here so
I'm gonna be just starting that and I'm
gonna be calling it as zero to inter
mediate there we go and yes of course I
want to move it outside
come on why does it always creates us
inside I don't know and in the
intermediate we're gonna create and
we're gonna start a new file and I'm
gonna call this as my objects dot GS of
course and there we go so how do we get
started with these objects so just like
we have seen previously that there is an
simple variable in which we can store a
string or a number no big deal we have
seen that we do have our arrays as well
so let's just say let's call it as my
array and we have a data type like this
in which we can store something like
this a simple name maybe a number or
maybe a boolean value which is either
true or false that's okay
but usually what you will realize that
in the in the real world most of the
data is not like this it comes in a
different patch and that can be handled
easily by object whether you want to
handle any API data base call you
usually some with some of the databases
like firebase and some of the API calls
or a lot of things usually comes up in
the form of object so let's see how we
can declare that so let's just say I'm
gonna be calling an object for YouTube
let's just say I want to handle a single
video from YouTube so let's just say I'm
gonna call this as my YouTube video just
like that and how do we declare this
object first of all now that's an
important question we use these curly
braces and hit enter there okay we have
seen these curly braces quite a lot in
the FNL statement in the loops and
everywhere in the functions as well
usually it has got a name or some
condition and the starting but in the
object it just gets started like that
simple curly braces nothing at all now
this object is made up of some values
here so there are some R keys and values
onto it there are variety of names of it
you can completely argue on that but I
would highly not recommend that so let's
just say there is a my YouTube video
which is an object so first of all every
video has a title and there we go and in
this title let's just say this is gonna
be like loops loops in JavaScript that's
the video name here separated by comma
there we go
so this is our first entry in our object
we give it a name and we get give it a
value now this value can be string can
be numbers can be boolean's can be date
whatever you like to have it's just
really simple to have it like that then
the second value what you would like to
have for example I'm gonna calling it as
a video length and there we go video
length is like probably 15 minutes so
I'm gonna just say it's in minutes and
probably 15 minutes and then it has a
description as well this corruption or
it would be better if I just say it has
something like video description okay
that makes much more sense the more
elaborative you are it's gonna be easier
for you in the later on field okay so
give your variables and everything very
descriptive elaborative name so a video
description why do you have a problem
okay so we forgot to put a comma there
there we go thank you vs code video
description and just let's just say this
is video description and a long one
let's just say okay so there we go our
title is ready and this is coming up
from my YouTube video okay so there we
go we have learned how we can declare
that now let me walk you through a
couple of mistakes that everybody does
whether it's expedient programmer or the
new one the first and common mistake is
missing this comma whether you're
working on reactor jeaious this is a
common mistake and nobody's everybody
does that so missing a comma is the very
first one the second one is missing this
semicolon and instead accidentally
putting up something known as equal sign
that is not gonna give you an error
right now just like we as code didn't
give it but in the run time it's a
problematic situation so make sure you
check out these two if you're working on
that okay so there we go
our first object is being declared and I
can declare as many objects as I like
probably for my courses for my videos
usually everything is stored in just
like that way okay so there we go we
have learned how we can declare that now
the problem is how we can access that so
it's really simple first of all let's
access the whole thing which is my
youtube video save that and open up our
terminal and there we go probably we are
on to the wrong directory yep we are not
into it
so let's just move into this zero to
intermediate and ctrl L to clean that up
we're gonna run that node my object is
and make sure you know how to travel
into the directories so there we go
it has printed out exactly same things
these curly braces and then inside that
we have these title video length and
description there we go
no problem at all now in here notice
that we have given this 15 as a string
not as a number but in case you're
worried little bit about it nobody's at
all you can use your numbers boolean
whatever you like to have no problem at
all okay there we go
so it's completely optional to you and
now let's just get rid of that now if we
want to access any specific value out of
this object then it's all
so really simple we can simply lock that
and we'll be calling back our friend the
tickle guys and we are gonna be saying
something like that hey new video on
title by and I forgot to have like I
didn't have an author here so video
creator should be a new one so let's
just say video create or there we go
and let's just write my name here there
we go and don't forget to put a comma
there so there we go video a new video
on title a new video on and title by and
author so this is our string that we
want to give but obviously we want to
fetch this data from our objects so
instead the title what we can do is we
can just use a dollar sign instead use
these curly braces and can call this
okay which is my I can just copy it so
that I don't make these mistakes my
video my YouTube video and as soon as
you're gonna put a dot then you can
access all the properties which are
inside this object so in this case a new
video on and I want to access the title
here and video by author in place of
author I want to say Video Creator so I
can just delete that use my dollar sign
curly braces and then I can just paste
this my YouTube video dot and Video
Creator so there we go there's a little
bit longer but I hope you can see that
okay there we go so this is what we are
having so this is really the simple and
the most basic stuff about the object
obviously we'll be going into the
advanced one later on so let's just run
this and there we go so it says hey new
video on loops in JavaScript by me so
here we go so this is the most basic one
and eventually when we'll be working on
firebase or some api's you'll be
noticing that you will be getting an
object just like this and eventually
what you have to do is simply fit these
things and work on that now I want to
show you something more things apart
from just having the temperature here so
let's just have an API API from
random random API so let me just walk
you through that how this is gonna be
useful for us so there we go notice
these curly braces I hope you can see
them properly so there we go notice we
have got an API and in which we have got
these key value pairs of course it can
be in the string as well no problem or
can be like simple variable stuff and
the sense we have to let us say we have
a whole list of api's we have to get all
these products so what we can do is we
can call that API can run a loop on this
and can this print out whole stack of
whatever the item is being like
purchased or anything like that so yes
it's pretty easy stuff after that and
eventually we will be doing that no
problem but again as I always say move
always in a step-by-step procedure so
that you can understand everything okay
so that's it for this video we will be
exploding a little bit more about these
objects in the upcoming videos as well
and I highly recommend you to pay
attention now comes of the fun part
which is assignment assignment I hope I
wrote that correct a sign meant there we
go so here's a quick assignment for you
you have to create a simple object the
object should be about my course let's
just say I have a Java Script course the
JavaScript course has a name has a price
as well as has a description okay
so make sure you create an object for
all these three points which I mentioned
and also write a console.log simply
saying that hey there is a new course
with the course name by author at a
price this and has a description this
okay so I hope that's a pretty simple
assignment I hope everybody will be able
to do it so that's it for this video and
I'm going to surely catch you up in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
