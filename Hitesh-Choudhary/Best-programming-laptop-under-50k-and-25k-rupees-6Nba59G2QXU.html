again with another video in this video I
want to talk about laptops so you're
watching this video because you really
want to buy a new laptop now there are a
lot of constraints that you take care
while buying a laptop and obviously
you're on this channel that's why most
of your interest is about programming so
you want to make an app for iOS or maybe
an Android maybe you want to go with the
game development or maybe you simply
want to go with web development I would
be addressing all of those guys as well
as will include the budget constraints
so people who are having the budget
issues people who are under 50k and
people who are under 25k so there is a
lot more to discuss and in fact too much
of the topics need to be discussed in
just one video so without any further
ado let's get started and talk about
laptops for programming first and
foremost there are laptops for different
configuration for different kind of
specific people people who want to go
iOS Android and a ton of thing first of
all let me address for the people who
are having no budget issues therefore
simply saying that they really don't
care whatever the budget cost is they
just want to make a one-time investment
and that said they want to do all kind
of development on that regardless of iOS
Android game web and pretty much
anything for those people who have no
budget issues I would recommend either
two of the things and yes you guessed it
right there I'm gonna talk about the
Apple products there so don't bash me
over there yes it's kind of a thing now
if you have no budget issues I would
recommend you to go for an iMac
if you can afford go with the big one or
in case you don't want to go with the
stable things on a desktop simply go and
look out for a laptop and that would be
the recent 2017 model the space gray one
in the Apple now yes this is an
overpriced laptop but for the amount
that you're paying you are actually
getting quite a lot of things and in
fact you are a guy who is like me who
produce a lot of code on Android iOS web
as well as do a lot of rendering of
these videos to upload on YouTube
I think that is your answer and again
making sure that you don't have any
budget constant because these laptops
are quite heavy on the pocket so that is
for those guys who have no budget issues
at all now let's address to the people
who are having a big budget issues now
if you have a big budget issues then
therefore there are some compromises
that you have to make now it's not like
that you are gonna get in just ten
thousand or fifteen thousand the best
laptop on which you can do everything no
it's not like that if you are cutting
the cost you have to cut up into some
features as well now in order to get
started I have categorized things into
three things first of all people who
want to do iOS development Android and
web as well and especially when I
include the variable here with the iOS
development things get changed because I
have to again go for the Apple product
now the second category that I have
categorized is for the people who just
want to do Android as well as web
development and third and the last
category in which you only really want
to do just web development
now obviously the cheapest one is the
last one which is having just a web base
category just where nothing else and the
most higher than that is Android one and
the finally the Apple one I have written
all this information in an amazing blog
so go ahead and visit the website a
learn code online Darton which is major
website here and go into the contact us
and I have a link to the blog here so we
do regularly write out a lot of blogs
and I recommend you to check out this
just 25 minutes ago I have written this
check out the top five programming
laptops under 50 K and 25 K so click on
this link and here are my recommendation
so for the iOS development I would
recommend to go with the MacBook here
now this is a MacBook Air not the
amazingly expensive one it can just do
the job so just click on this images and
they will take you that link and I'm not
saying to buy from these links or from
other links just note down the model
number and just look out wherever you
can find the best deals so this is the
first recommendation and this laptop is
good enough for all kind of iOS Android
game as well as web development for the
Android users there are three options
that I could have picked up and the
first one is Lenovo IdeaPad and this
the one which I have recently purchased
it's an amazing laptop and but the only
problem is it comes with a das base so
your Windows expenses is totally on you
so click on this guy and amazingly you
will notice in the bottom here is that
there is a newer model now make sure you
keep an idea of the specs here as well
because this guy comes with a 2gb of
nvidia graphics and this guy comes with
integrated graphics so that means
although it's a newer version as the
amazon is saying but still it's a little
bit lower in the configuration so I
would recommend this guy and this is
really amazing this is under forty five
nine nine zero which is under 50k so I
think this is a good stealer deal but
again your windows expenses are not
included here now I also recommend this
guy because a lot of people just want to
go with their Linux one or the das 1hp
now I haven't looked into much on the
what is the brand here I'm just looking
for the specs much here so you can go
ahead and look for this guy and this is
a 6th gen Core i5 a GB 1 TB does to 2 GB
graphics the only thing that I would say
the difference between this Lenovo and
HP is the HP one has a better screen so
in case you're looking for the graphic
design and I think this represent much
towards the true colors and the colors
in the Lenovo IdeaPad is not so amazing
in fact I don't recommend this laptop if
you're looking for the graphic design
and this one is much more again both of
them are good but nowhere near true
color just as the Apple produces on its
screen ok and the final one is the Linux
it's really optimized with the Linux and
it's a 7gn Core i5 processor 8 gigs - it
gigs of the graphic cards look out for
the more specs here this is again in the
40 1990 it's kind of a stealer deal I
would recommend you to check this out
once in a while ok so these three
laptops are perfectly good enough to get
you get started on Android as well as
web as well as on the game development
as well and the final one which won't
break your bank but is not the best
laptop on the planet you won't be able
to do any kind of Android or game
development easily on this but for any
kind of webbing
loading a front-end react angular
php.net django whatever you want to go
for any kind of front and back-end web
this is kind of a stealer laptop and he
will be surprised that this laptop is
just twenty four thousand nine hundred
ninety nine ninety and it comes with a
sixteen core i3 four gigs of ram 500
gigs of storage a Linux and integrated
graphics more than enough for any kind
of web developer but again I would
recommend you to check out this blog for
more information I have written kind of
a detailed blog here for giving you all
the information so these are just my
recommendation check on this links and
note down the model number as well as
other specs and make sure you just look
out for wherever you can get the best
deal just grab it there now these are
some of the selected list that I have
selected for you for the best possible
laptop I could have found and as I
mentioned yes there is one which I have
purchased recently now over the months I
have actually avoided this topic of the
best laptop because of a very specific
reason now usually when I recommend
somebody to just hey you can buy this
laptop people just come at me and say
why not Dell why not this one why not
this one hey if you are looking up for
that laptop you really want to buy that
go ahead buy that I don't have any
problem with specific laptops or a
specific brand or anything just go ahead
with that but people usually come to me
that hey why are you recommending this
one why don't you recommend the
Alienware
or Dell this model or Acer this model I
have no problem at all with any brand or
laptop just go ahead buy that one and
the second biggest issues that I have
faced over the years is usually my
friends and some of my relatives usually
take me to buy a laptop and I just give
them whatever the best they could have
in that budget but the problem arises
after a few months because those people
that really don't know how to handle a
hardware like computers and over the
times by usage of the pirated Windows
and a ton of pirated software not
maintaining their machines nicely
eventually there's laptop starts slowing
down and they just come again to me hey
you have given us a laptop which is not
amazing not good why you have done to
this now I haven't done anything to that
I have just suggested you it's totally
your decision to buy it or not now I
would reckon
all of you to check out the link on this
blog as well as to just note down simply
the model number and the specification
wherever you can find the best deal just
buy from there it can be Amazon laptop
or maybe your local vendor all I'm
saying is these are just their
recommendations ok so that's it for this
video and I'll surely catch you up in
the next one
