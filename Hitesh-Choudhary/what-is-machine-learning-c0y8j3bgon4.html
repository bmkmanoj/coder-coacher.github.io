with another video in this video we are
going to talk about the machine learning
why it is getting so much popular and
what are the steps to get started in
machine learning what are the
prerequisites and clearing up some myths
and doubts about the machine learning
stadiums let's get started about
in this channel we talk about the
programming technical and everything
related to the computers and technology
so if you are new here consider
subscribing now let's talk about the
machine learning so first of all what is
machine learning and why it is getting
so much popular now let me be clear up
with the fact that a lot of companies
are actually implementing or they're not
actually saying it but somehow they are
creating this message to the users to
give a little bit hype to their
companies that machine learning is
actually artificial intelligence II now
AI is actually slightly different and I
would call it very much different from
the machine learning machine learning is
very close to the data mining now this
might be a little bit new fact to you
but yes that's the truth in case you
don't know what is data mining let me
clear that up too
now data mining is really simple we get
a lot of data and in fact you might be
already familiar with the recent hype of
the terms like big data and a deep
learning and machine learning now the
problem with that every company and
every software industry now is data now
first of all every company was after
collecting the data at Google Facebook
and everybody was collecting the data
now once we have that data the problem
is how we can get results from the data
because that data is gives iliyan
bazillion in the amount that it's not
easy to predict patterns in that data or
to predict or to filter out some of the
advantages result from that data now
here comes the role of data mining in
the data mining with the gazillion
gazillion of the data set we apply some
rules at some of the algorithms so that
we can predict some good amount of
information from the data because a lot
of part of that data is actually garbage
and we want to take out that information
part the good part of the data now this
is known as the data mining and it is
not a new thing it has been around for
so many years a lot of research scholar
have done their masters and their
doctorates in the data mining so it's
not a new thing now what makes it
popular in nowadays because now the data
is actually a
quite a lot and every company wants to
utilize that data and here comes your
machine learning
now machine learning is again a kind of
an advanced version of data mining and
in that you apply basically it goes on
with our two types of learning the
supervised learning and unsupervised
learning what you are doing is you are
taking the data you are defining a model
that hey this is how you need to
recognize the pattern and then you apply
that to apply that model to your data
set and once you apply that you try to
find out what is your error rate and try
to reduce that error rate now again you
- you do these things again and remodel
the data a little bit to increase the
higher percentage of success rate
reducing the error rate again and there
you go it's a river a continuous cycling
process that you do in the machine
learning now why it is get sparked
getting popular nowadays now since a lot
of libraries have come around in the
Python and that actually makes it so
much easier to do all kind of machine
learning now by no means machine
learning is not going to be like the
Terminator movie that you might have
seen conquering the world artificial
intelligence in moving into the world
that that's not like it machine learning
is very different now you have been
already being affected by the machine
learning quite a lot because the
suggestions that you see on IMDB or
maybe at Amazon that you should look out
for these products are actually all part
and results of the machine learning they
look out for a huge number of data sets
about you're looking habits what kind of
product is good for you what kind of
products should you be looking for and
what sales can they make if they show
the product to you this is all machine
learning this is all advantages to the
company you might have already seen that
in the Facebook newsfeed
Facebook gives you these news feeds
based on what kind of scrolling you are
making where you stop your scrolling and
what post you are liking which friends
you are searching for more so all kind
of these things are actually already
there and that's how the machine
learning goes now let's come on to the
learning part by the machine learning
and how you can get actually started
with the machine
in learning now getting started with
machine learning is competitively easy
now because of the two giants the R and
the Python now I'm not a big fan of our
although it's a very great language it's
a great mechanism that you can utilize
but I since I'm already into Python
quite a lot and I have been programming
in the Python for quite a long time
that is why my favorite choice obviously
would be to just started getting started
in the data mining and are the machine
learning via the Python and I personally
believe that's an easy choice because if
you look out for the libraries that you
can have are actually much more in the
Python so that is one of my tip would be
just get started with the Python and
eventually you can go with them our
machine learning now what kind of data
models are applied now a lot of people
say is that you don't need to be a
mathematical guru for the machine
learning and somehow to some aspect they
are too you don't need to be but there
are some prerequisite that are
definitely should be there now in most
of the courses and most of the books
books they give you these prerequisites
like the base theorems noodle noodle
network classifications and the linear
network classifications and all such
predefined algorithm which come to the
synapse and all such libraries in the
pilot in the Python so you can apply
them quite easily but definitely a
little bit knowledge to the base theorem
and all these things are definitely
required while learning the machine
learning now again it's it's a growing
field definitely it has got a lot of
future but it's not the easiest one it's
it's not really it if you compare to the
app development and web development it's
actually above there because there are a
lot of prerequisites but again if you
are comfortable with the Python and this
feels really impresses you quite a lot
and you are a newbie there are
definitely you should give it a try it's
not that matured and since especially in
the and the libraries are like a Sai kit
there are a lot of pre built in things
that are given to you and if you're
getting worried about the tape from here
we are going to get the data set the
psych it is
good library definitely look out for
that and they give you a lot of
libraries like I like predicting the
flowers of iris and hang a lot of things
that you can play around with them so I
hope you find this video interesting
about machine learning it has cleared up
a lot of doubts I believe so if still
you are having some doubt about the new
and latest technology and more about
machine learning or anything like that
feel free to ask them in the comment
section below I'll make sure that I make
a video of that clearing all of the
doubts and making sure that you get the
right guide in getting started in that
particular technology definitely go
ahead check out the machine learning
breed more blogs and get more knowledge
about that that's always a good way of
getting started in your technology okay
with this video I will say if you are
new here consider subscribing and in
case you think that this video can be
helpful for somebody then definitely
share that on your social media accounts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
