again with another video and let's
continue our JavaScript journey now in
this particular video I will not be
writing any code I just wanted to give
you a few points and how we are gonna
move forward in this JavaScript series
so when I was making this JavaScript
series
you obviously know that eventually we
actually moved and we took a path which
is not usually taken by the JavaScript
courses it's usually like create an HTML
file create a JavaScript file
attach the both of them and thence
create a pop-up it's a usual approach
it's not like this is a wrong approach
this is completely fine but here we took
an extraordinary approach of moving node
and tried to look at the JavaScript in a
way that nobody has actually taken a
look in this way so I hope we were able
to catch it up so far now when I was
designing this entire curriculum I
reached at this point when I was writing
all these things and it took it got me
that how we should move from this point
onward now this is the point where we
move forward into two directions
actually both of them are true and both
of them are correct it's not like one is
wrong way another is a right way both of
them are correct so what are these two
ways now right now you are at a position
that you can design any application in
simple and regular JavaScript so the
option is one we can have a web-based
interface probably like a webpage and
can attach some of the files create
to-do applications or anything like that
or there is another approach that we can
take which is moving towards the
advanced JavaScript stuff like what is
it raters generators arrow functions
some syntactic sugar in the objects and
stuff like that so obviously you feel
free to just move on to any part
wherever you like I have decided that
I'm gonna be moving into the part of
advanced JavaScript so that first we can
learn all those concepts there's a lot
that we can do nowadays in JavaScript
obviously you have seen that in the very
first video so now as the series will
progress we are gonna move into the
advanced part of the JavaScript and then
probably we will move on later on about
building the application and stuff in
case you want to just right now go ahead
explore the libraries or build
application on the web right now you can
surely do that but with this series
we'll be moving into the advanced part
the advantage of having the advanced
part right now is you will
able to get or you will be much more
comfortable in the applications like
node angular or react electron or
anything that has a JavaScript framework
modern one then surely you will feel
much more comfortable from this point
onward so far we have had the basics
that's it we are not going to be talking
about how to loop over an array or how
to write a basic function the argument
move into advanced part that is actually
much more fun and actually creates a
rock-solid JavaScript not like the
previous one which you are pretty much
aware of the web this is gonna get
interesting now right now okay so now
that you are clear about what is going
to be the feature plan with this series
I think it's a good point
then we that we move into all these
advanced stuff in the next video so
that's it let's just go ahead catch you
up in the next video and of course don't
forget to hit the subscribe on my
youtube channel as well as visit learn
code online dot and there is so much
amazing stuff going on there so catch
you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
