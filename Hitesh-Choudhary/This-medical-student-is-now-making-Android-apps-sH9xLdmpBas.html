code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey there everyone
today share back again with another
video and in this video I'm super super
excited because we are going to talk
about one amazing person who is
inspiration to me to you to everybody
who is watching this video are even not
watching this video
this guy has proven that patience hard
work consistency can beat down anything
in this world whether you want to learn
programming want to go gym want to learn
guitar whatever that is it's possible
and can be done by everyone let's get
started this question is quite common at
this channel a lot of time a lot of time
people ask me this question hey I am
from a support group I want to join into
development thing can I do that
I am from a development side of Python I
want to switch into mobile development
can I do that a lot of part-time people
also ask me that hey I am from a
commerce background can I learn
programming now I want to say all of you
you need to read this email this e-mail
is a simple and super example of
consistency hard work and it doesn't
really matter what your background is
anybody and everybody can learn to code
so let me walk you through what this
email is and actually let me read this
email in front of you so this email says
hello hey sir I'm glad to tell you today
that I completed my first app I've been
learning since last nine months I wish I
could underline this last nine months I
am a medical student but I have a
passion for coding so being a med
student I have a lot of studies to do
leaving me no time for coding but thanks
to you thanks for telling me that coders
don't quit thanks to you that I knew not
to be emotional about programming
languages so here I am presenting my
first app it's the version one a really
pathetic one but as you said version 2
comes only after version 1
so I'll be learning consistently it
feels good to know that there is someone
who can understand my passion for coding
now this is really an emotional and an
amazing email as an instructor I I
really don't know how to express my
feeling as an instructor this is the
best gift that possibly anybody can give
to me nine months of dedication can you
even imagine nine months it takes a lot
of patience lot of consistency and lot
of hard work to stay on just one thing
for nine months people do complain that
hey I'm learning web development from
last three months I'm not able to make
my website can you even imagine this guy
has dedicated nine months to create a
simple app now I'm not gonna release the
app on the screen here because I think
it would be an insult for this person
because nobody can judge his app nobody
can say this app is good or bad because
the amount of work that he has put into
this app that is the most important part
I am pretty sure this guy is gonna be an
amazing programmer in the future because
if somebody can put nine months
alongside with the studies the family
problems which everybody does have and
all these things just keep aside and
focused on coding for nine months and he
has learned Android for nine months and
finally he has sent me an email saying
here is my version one it's bad but it's
my version one a few years ago I did
trade a construction worker from London
and he's working in a computer based
firm who is all about designing website
a couple of years ago I did train a guy
from Thailand who was a cook and he
decided that I'm gonna change my life
and is now working and as an iOS
developer and this year this is just the
start and a medical student is trying to
be transformed the things by knowing how
Android works obviously he can use his
medical skills into the Android app
development and he can come up with an
amazing app idea which nobody can ever
think because once you mix your
professions of medical of your computing
maybe your economics maybe your
accounting stuff what you can create
cannot be even created by just
programmers
because you have an amazing extra skills
lying around there now I want you to
take a pause I want you to think for a
second how many excuses you are going to
make before you are gonna make your
first app first website or first project
that you really want to make how many
more excuses do you need I think you are
running out of the excuses so leave all
those excuses aside sit back onto your
computer and show me what you have got
as your project one it can be pathetic
it can be bad but what you have got is
version one show me what you can do with
the power of coding let me tell you one
thing today just to summarize this I
want to say one thing to you my dear
friend you are running out of excuses
if this medical guy can do this I don't
know what's your excuses is if you are
saying hey my attendance is an excuse
that's not gonna work if you are saying
my field is different obviously that is
not gonna work - so leap down all of
that excuses get back on to computer and
write some amazing code and remember
always coders don't quit and version one
is always gonna be pathetic but
regardless of that that ain't stopping
you so get back onto a computer and
write some amazing code I will catch you
up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
