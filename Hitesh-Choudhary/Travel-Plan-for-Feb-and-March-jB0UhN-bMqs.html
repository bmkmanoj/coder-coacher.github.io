the down on the video and this video is
a laid back video chill out and I just
wanted to give you some updates about my
upcoming travels so this video is not
about learning anything this is about
like update like I do Facebook updates
too so this is like a video update on
YouTube kind of a new stuff so this
video I want to talk about the upcoming
travel plans because some of you are
interested in meeting me having a coffee
or just say hello just like that so if
you are nearby obviously I would
recommend you to come come on to the
place where I will be hanging around so
this entire month is already booked
February
I'm having some plans for March as well
and then I am having a couple of travel
to London Paris and Spain as well so let
me walk you through on the 3rd of
February that is tomorrow I will be at
ganvie her for a conference I will be
there around 11:00 ish a little bit give
or take based on traffic around 11:00
till maybe 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock
because I do have a meeting at 6 o clock
in the evening so I'll be back before
that and then tomorrow this is the plan
for tomorrow then on 8th of February I
will be an in global university I guess
I'll update more on the Facebook page in
the global university again back in
Jaipur and then on 13th of February I
will be in Bengal I will be at st.
Xavier's College they have done my
tickets haven't send it to me hey guys
if you are watching this shoot me an
email I know the tickets are already
done everything is already set up so I
will be there in Bangor and then I will
not be available in the country from I
guess 15 of February till the end of
February I will not be available here
then ah then I will have a meeting on I
guess 27th of February in Bangalore I'll
be back and so far March first week is
free and then but I'm pretty sure
colleges are approaching me and probably
it will get a little bit busy and then
16 17 and 18 I believe so I forgot about
the dates I will be in Vellore so it's
pretty jam-packed I do have other
colleges approaching me but again I
cannot travel that much of course I love
to but again who will be doing my work
here so I'm I'm trying to travel as much
as in the Universities so that only the
travel I'm accepting is those guys who
can accept or can beer my air travel as
well as I can land directly in their
city and can just come back on the same
day because obviously my work suffers
when I travel so yes this is the current
plan and I highly highly recommend all
of you guys to join me up on Instagram
and on Facebook as well I do post most
updates on Facebook so join me up there
and in case you are joining up for these
conferences in Gambia and global incense
savers in Bengal and in Vellore a couple
of other colleges not there I'll reveal
that very soon so yes these are the
current plans for right now just hanging
around laid-back chill out so that's it
for this video and go ahead enjoy keep
writing some code enjoy the weather is
getting pretty awesome and if you are
joining up these conferences don't
forget to say me hello there I would be
waiting for you that's it and catch you
up in another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
