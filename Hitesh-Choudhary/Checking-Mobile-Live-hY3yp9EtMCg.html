okay there we go and let me just try to
do things okay i think that was good and
I think we're live in here okay i didn't
knew that we can go live on face on this
YouTube as well usually I go live on
Facebook only this is a good thing that
we can go live in here as well the
lighting is not the perfect in here but
we can it just okay that is good and I
think there are some settings that i
need to play around so don't mind me
this is just a test that i'm doing that
whether i can go like from my mobile app
because going from life from mobile app
is a good thing because the youtube guys
have optimized a lot of thing and you
can see life without any buffering in
good quality this is nice i like it okay
so where can I read the comments in case
somebody's people are posting comment
where can I read them okay so there are
comments there hi hello hi hi hi
everybody there are a lot of people
anonymous pronoun hi everybody how are
you doing I think this is a good way of
answering your questions going live I'm
talking to you guys and because they say
sir you are my inspiration thank you so
much i love it and i think a lot of you
watch the last night video that we gone
there okay this is nice I like it I like
it what I need to rotate the device I
think so can you see me properly let me
know in the comment section if you can
see me properly there and is screen
rotation good there let me know this is
my first time there okay yes rotate the
device I think I think they don't
support the landscape thinks how is it
now is it okay now okay video is
vertical okay now is it good let me know
you are the only guys who I can watch
yes it is good ok so I think they do not
support the landscape mode yet but hey
this is good ok
this is good okay a lot of questions are
coming hey hey hey hold on hold on I
need to answer a few of them I cannot
see myself the screen is full of
questions let's try to answer a few
things anilkumar says how is the carrier
in Android development it's awesome in
fact I am about to release almost 10 or
12 apps in the android store it's
awesome in case you don't know about
that you can now learn android without
java as well you can only switch on to
everything with javascript as well which
is far more easier than java and go
focus on JavaScript and very soon you
can you will be able to put android apps
native android apps using doubt okay and
you can put your question i'm trying to
answer a lot of you sir make video about
j/s i do have a full fledge it curves on
GS but i'll put a few videos on
JavaScript on youtube as well don't you
worry I'm here to talk about programming
ok ok ok if hold on guys and people how
was the carrier in testing testing is
good but make sure that you focus on
automation of the testing as well manual
testing is not gonna last you longer
with that so in case you are looking for
the testing things you can switch onto
selenium or penetration testing these
are good things how future of iOS
developer is developers are always gonna
rock so my views about iOS developer
it's awesome thing and it's going to rot
even more in the future it's so much
controlled environment and usually
people don't like control environment
but one of the reasons why iOS is
rocking is because of the controlled
environment ok this this is something
crazy this is far more interactive and
better than my facebook lives I'm really
happy about it that YouTube has finally
launched it I can talk to you guys
directly going live there this is
awesome ok ah videos on Android making
uh yep that's our gonna come up soon but
but I have some travel plans in the next
month and that is why things are going
little bit slow but one mood
announcement hey guys announcement
announcement that I am traveling in the
next month and I think everybody
should stay active and subscribe to my
channel and hit that a balikin because
I'll be going live from a lot of places
in the world so I'm on to a little bit
of kind of a vole tube and you are all
going to enjoy this okay so a lot of
people serve might wealth is over what
can I do I have interest in hacking
hacking is kind of an advanced
programming focus a lot on programming
you will become awesome hacker okay so
hackles needs to be programming it's not
like you can become a hacker without
programming you need to learn
programming focus on that quite a lot
okay so uh sup bro okay remember me yep
I remember you been testing with spirit
you were thinking to change the name I
think go ahead some other name would be
awesome how is catered in game
development what kind of game developer
you want to become 2d 3d with unity with
any kind of game engine or just mobile
games it depends on that and again on
top of that how much collaboration you
are doing with the games okay somehow
the comments gone I'm not able to read
them okay my hand is not tiring I need
to grab something maybe I should order
something from amazon so that I can hold
this device like that I can talk to you
guys okay well said we need to learn
programming first and yes i will change
my name to pw sec a feed of the SEC is a
cool name why do I think you should do
that Pete of the SEC is is awesome
actually okay I learn bsci t or CS I
don't know what that BS CIT acronym is
for I'm not very good in acronyms daily
texts remember me yes I remember you
from the email guy which one is great
iOS or Android development do you want
to really start a war in here for
android and iOS is that it don't do that
it's it's not a good question android
arias both are awesome it depends what
you want to do where your audience lies
and so don't start a war on mac and
windows or iOS or android don't do that
it's not a good thing okay and there is
a super chair option as well i think the
testing went really really awesome and i
would like to test out that how the
things are going on
best mic for canon a TD for YouTube blue
Yeti or something else okay let me show
you can you see this this is the guy I
use I have two blue Yeti Mike's this one
is you might have seen that in video and
I think no other Mike can match up the
blue Yeti let me show you i have a
couple of other mics as well i don't use
them regularly there is one guy you
might have seen this road I don't check
it out regularly it's not an awesome
Mike still I do have a couple of other
mics as well I want my audience whether
T to be super awesome I would say go for
blue Yeti little bit costly little bit
expensive but it's worth it okay a
bachelor eh ok ok ok ok comments are
just going ups and downs I want to
become coated so how to start ok where
that goes means viola neechal step I
should take ok where is it going laptop
macbook or windows if you want to go for
iOS development you have got a budget
then for sure i would say go for go for
mac if you don't have a budget windows
laptop works really fine you can do
everything on that no problem with that
so how can i start my youtube channel
create account on youtube and there you
go you have got your youtube channel but
really youtube channel really depends
what kind of thing you want to serve to
people what is your content like if i'll
make entertainment videos and joke
videos that's not going to work for me
if i'll make programming videos people
expect me to write code people expect me
to talk about laptops people expect me
to talk about programming language or
mac or windows so that's what my channel
is about make sure you figure it out
what kind of channel you are going to
have and you can have it ok your course
is very helpful for me thank you so much
where that coming goes out ok coming so
just growing out I am a college dropout
student and have good command on web
development and should I start iOS
development because iOS is my favorite
if that's a favorite there is no other
way that you need to look out if you
like I us get started with that that's
all about it and I hope you don't mind
if I turn on my air conditioner it's hot
it's hot ok
I think it's awesome okay there's
there's a lot of lot of things going on
I don't know where that comment has
comments are going on it is very
interactive and I promise you one thing
all of you that i'll be doing a lot of
life going on there because this is one
good way of interacting with you guys
okay what do you think about material
design in Android development Maori
honestly and not a big fan of material
design I like the material design colors
by the way the flat colors I always use
in for all of my clients app and
everywhere they all liked it but
material design in itself needs a little
bit work specially the forms you can see
when you design the form in material
design it just a flat lines and it's not
the best UX and UI practices because use
it is little bit confused whether I
should put my email there is a form
there or not so I'm not a big fan of
material design it needs a little bit
work according to me again okay okay
okay guys hold on there hold on there I
cannot see any comment there it just
Scrolls down with a lot of comments okay
can we create user interface with C++
coding Bravo I would call this a very
very bad idea you can even create
websites in C++ do you know that but
will I be creating a design in C++ no
not not at all it's not a good idea
there are things specially designed for
something and you should always pick up
that for example for designing purposes
just only for designing there is a
photoshop and sketch but if i'll do that
designing in let's just say HTML and CSS
in initial phase that won't be a good
idea so all I'm saying in here is there
is always a special tool designed to do
the things okay so make sure you go
ahead with that so Trick Trick knology
hub says which app you are using I'm
using facebook at a bar which app is
this YouTube app I'm using just a
youtube app that's all youtube gave me
just a notification that you can go live
from your app and I thought it's a good
idea to just test it out I didn't expect
it this much of the user to show up and
there we go and I've done your course on
udemy and that was cool
and helped me so much thank you so much
I'm really glad that the core served you
really well and his iphone is necessary
for iOS development no it's not
necessary you should have an iphone it's
not necessary but Mac devices you should
have the only thing that I would like to
say you pratik is when you have an
iphone all I'm saying is you should have
a little bit experience with iphone so
that you can see what our views how the
settings look like how the icons look
like in the native iphone app how things
goes on all I'm saying is you should be
aware of the things that are there in
the I us you don't need an iphone ok PHP
our node which I should go for I would
say go for node I think javascript is
rocking much more but if your work is
moreover WordPress related then go for
PHP but if you don't like to go into
WordPress know what is the next thing ok
ok a lot of questions are coming up a
lot of a lot of co ship which video
editor you use ok ah the video editor I
like to go with final cut pro and I'll
tell you the reason has well why I am
going with a final cut pro for editing
all of my videos first of all color
correction and color coloring everything
you want to do a color correction or
color saturation anything is easy in
Final Cut Pro again a one solid reason
why i chose final cut pro / premiere is
once you pave the final cut pro three
hundred dollars and that's it you don't
have to worry about anything but if you
go for adobe premiere pro it's a monthly
payment that you have to go on so that
is that was one of the main reason i
chose Final Cut Pro to edit all of my
videos ok ok a lot of a lot of comment
ok I don't know what the going on so how
to improve logic I am very poor in it
logic is something that you need to
spend time with it i would say spent
almost a year or two years with
designing the logics and everything and
eventually it will go on sameer asked
which mike you use or right now i am
using my phone Mike directly its know
any other Mike but I use privity i use
rode mic and sometime
some lapel mic as well I like the
shotgun mics they are pretty cool but
most of the time I like to use my a
bluidy okay okay just now my phone is
ringing okay I got a phone in there and
I I need to turn off this I need to go
there is some work I have to do finish
up but definitely i'll catch you guys
this life is really awesome i'll catch
you later on I have some urgent work I'm
really sorry for that i have to leave
now and i will surely catch you up later
someday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
