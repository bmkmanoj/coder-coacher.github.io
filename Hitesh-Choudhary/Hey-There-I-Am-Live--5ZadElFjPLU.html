everyone waiting here for people to show
up and yes I know I do live without
notifying you before but sometimes
sometimes I get much free time and I'm
live again so hey everyone I'm waiting
for more people to show up and yes
people have actually showed up I know
this is a little bit low quality because
sometimes internet is not in that much
good situation so yes I can understand
but I can read all of your comments and
this is not a 1 0 h8 0 live this is 720
only this is what only my phone can do
right now ok so let's go and talk to
everybody hey hey there everyone
how is it going on ok so I got just a
recent update by shivani's that thought
hey it's working so I was working on
fixing a bug that happened recently on
the website I uploaded the facebook
login and the Google+ login features and
the Facebook one was not working
properly a lot of students reminded me
that and finally have fixed that so
that's that's one good thing that we
have done okay so one zero one zero hey
one zero one zero ha ha ha that's a good
theory you should always follow up
what's the video I can't find the title
hey cancel a kin slay there is no such
title on this life and and here to talk
to you guys you can ask you the
questions I can share some updates you
can share some updates and that's that's
it nothing nothing much here just say hi
or maybe something interesting comes
that we can talk about that okay so I'm
gonna deep hey mr Deep South neeraj the
iOS or Android to start learning for
fresher I'm a big fan of is because
is developer ed get little bit little
bit little bit more paid then Android
developers and also your app really
sells out pretty good because people in
Iowa's tends to pay more for your app
compared to the Android guys because
they are most of the time looking for
the free apps just saying that I could
be wrong but I prefer iOS development
for an app usually but it's not like
that some time clients demand for
Android as well so I do that as well no
problem okay sir I'm to weaken Android
programming please give me some tips I
can give you one tip here
Femi that yes Android courses right now
they're it's it's being working on I am
working on few good apps so that I can
teach them flawlessly right now I am
into the animation section I'm trying to
make sure that you understand about the
hub how the images are animated in the
Android so I'm working on that app and
more app will come up and that will make
you really good in Android development
okay
very inspirational always ready to hear
from you thank you so much always try my
best to serve best knowledge possible as
well as to get rid of those things which
doesn't allow you to get properly in the
technical education so I try my best
always VFX effects no I'm not good in
that okay so let's talk about for iOS
should I start learn Swift and
objective-c hey Nikhil I would say don't
don't just get started with objective-c
because it's not a good thing to start
at least in 2017 may 2017 okay so I
would suggest you to go ahead at learn
code online dot in I have awesome
bootcamp on iOS where you design eight
or nine apps along with me that Swift
course is also included so everything is
covered there but again by no means I'm
saying only by my course you can learn
wherever you wish to but I would say go
and get started with Swift wherever you
can find that just learn there ok web
designing or WordPress course in future
of WordPress a wordpress can be there
but I'm not a big fan of WordPress yes
it's awesome to launch a quick website
and everything but yes not a big fan
because a lot of reasons are there but
yes there can be WordPress core course
not of web design any time soon because
everything is piled on so a lot of
things are there like Android of the
point then I have to do a react native
as well then note a recent has came on
so I have to learn node as well because
a lot of my projects need to be updated
of node as well so yes please provide me
job I don't provide job buddy
what's your name let me my egg I don't
provide job I provide best technical
education so that you don't have to hunt
for job job hunts for you so that's what
I do okay ah okay let's let's pick up
for more good questions okay
make videos and things used in technical
Giants picking a chance use regular
stuff like node.js and Facebook is using
react a lot a lot of apps are using like
a Pinterest and uber are using Kotlin so
Tech gents are no big deal they just use
regular stuff what you need to
understand is that any product that has
been launched is not not so big at the
very first launch it has just got
started
eventually the feature comes in just
like in our website it's not like from
the day when it was a massive this is a
product that has been launched and
eventually with the time it will grow
with your support with more feature and
more time I give to that so tech giants
is no such big things they just use
normal technologies like react node Java
Swift
C C++ everything like that what you use
okay let's pick up more questions more
questions okay where can we find that I
know this is this little bit shaky when
I touch this phone but yes I'm trying to
do that okay looks like you're facing
difficulties yes it's a very difficult
situation to read all of the comments
because
when I just touch it it just shoo it
just goes like the heaven
I just miss a lot of them and I know a
lot of people get frustrated with that
maybe angry with me but I can understand
that it's okay
okay is it good to drink something well
code and who asked that who was that I
did they okay is it good to drink
something while coding it is super super
important and this is coming up from a
guy who have experienced problems and a
lot of doctor visits because I was just
busy in coding and not drinking enough
water so it is super important keep all
this you might have seen in a lot of
videos my desk is usually piled up with
the water bottles I usually get my iced
teas and my water bottle everything
ready here so it's a good thing
everybody should does that okay now
let's carry on with more common okay
which is a better option to learn after
Python okay so you have learned Python I
would say there is more one of my github
repository where I did word or an
information security project on Python
and you can check that out that's a good
project if you want to continue with
that or want to just have a look on that
that's a good point to get started on
Python and also I would suggest to
explore more libraries on Python because
there are a lot of them and recently the
big data and the data analysis is going
pretty crazy with the Pisan so go ahead
start with that okay can we drink coffee
while coding yeah that's that's also a
good option but water should be there
that is the essential part if you don't
want to be like me who have faced a lot
of doctor visits keep your water bottles
around with you all the time okay when
you are coming to Delhi no such plans as
of now I want to focus on the project
itself and a couple of courses as of now
but yes I'm frequent in Delhi because a
lot of my flights just goes from me so
I'm pretty
fairly regular there okay okay the
watching you from Rwanda that's that's a
good country I do have a couple of
friends there a couple of students from
there that's an amazing place Rwanda
maybe maybe I can visit there sometime
does the web designing effect website
okay so I miss that okay where does that
okay does the web site web designing
gets affected because of the web site
like wakes no not at all not at all
these automation things like a page
cloud if you are not aware of it or
makes their brothers and sister know web
designing skills doesn't really get
affected by these people they just are
there to solve the problem of of the
people who are not into web designing
and also don't want to get into it but
still want a website quickly so that's a
different thing but for web design their
coders they they would never like to use
something like wakes or page flood
because they might want to get more
control over their website and want to
design them properly according to them
but I'm not completely against on Wix or
page cloud because they are solving a
completely different problem and we are
here on a completely different problem
on this channel so definitely they
doesn't affect much okay front end or
back and first front end front end for
sure first and in fact I would say that
everybody should learn front-end
development regardless you had an app
developers IUS Swift Android because it
gives you more idea let me tell you more
about on this because when you design
and learn about the front-end
development you learn a lot of things
like positioning of the element
on the webpage or something or animating
the things using CSS and those same
things are helpful in android
development as well as iOS development
just just say that in Android of the
penny has got options like variable dot
helmet dot fade or anyway dot translate
x and y which moves object in x and y
direction or fades out the object so
these are things become so easy when you
know about the front-end development ok
so that's that's one thing everybody
should learn front-end development ok so
I like to ask how many hours do you code
daily that's it that's the tough
question because most of the time I'm on
computer and I write that but still I do
take time to exercise and French the
family stuff and that's it and most of
the time I'm writing the codes it's
something that's fun to me ok auditor
and no response from you uh Sicario
v-log I'm really sorry I'm not able to
read all of your questions I am trying
my best you can post your questions
again and again because I'm trying my
best to read all of your comments but
I'm really sorry that sometimes it just
goes like that and and I cannot do
anything about it sir can I learn
Android studio parallel to Cortland yes
you can
no problem at all ok Android or iOS our
that that's a question for a for Android
or iOS Windows or Linux Windows or Macs
that that equations were war ok any book
from you ah yes I have been approached
by a couple of publishers in the past as
well right now I'm also in between the
chat with a publisher who wants me to
write a book on NS 3 on Python on
Cortland a lot of things the reason why
I don't like to write much of the books
because I have kept that kept that for
later on period of my life because I
want to write my books when I'm a little
old how I'm fine no I'm I'm being too
optimistic but when I get old I want to
write book and
that point of time because right now I
can make good videos and it just a means
of transmitting education whether you
transfer it viable core videos but I can
I can deliver the knowledge in person
why should I write a book but again
books are not bad they should be there
their knowledge for that I'm trying my
best to write a couple of them maybe
this deal goes good and I'll be able to
write books
okay Java or Python to start with I
would say get started with Python but a
lot of people may go after me
hey how dare you to say not to start
with Java and with Python but I python
is so easy to learn okay wish me gee
thigh your Kotlin course is free or paid
my catalan course is paid but not
heavily priced coding Bravo it's
reasonable just enough so that we can
maintain a website community things like
buying these guys like these lenses
they're not cheap they are expensive
when you make videos of this quality
what I do I have to spend some time and
that's why I reasonably reasonably prize
them which language would you prefer on
server side yes I don't need to read the
options at server side I would prefer no
doors our fire base or something I would
prefer J's because it's fast and robust
gone are the days when people say hey
PHP is more powerful than J's it can do
a lot nowadays GS has evolved quite a
lot and those people who are saying that
it's not haven't read about the node and
especially the feature that nobody is
giving in the latest version of the node
so go ahead check that out I would
prefer Jas any day it's far more smooth
stackoverflow usage es at the backend
and see how how cool is that to just
rotate everything so so it's awesome
but yes I am NOT saying that PHP is bad
and everything for small jobs PHP is
completely ok I would not overkill my
website with Jas because let's just say
I need a website that just have an email
contact form which goes onto the email I
would never use JavaScript there because
that's that's wrong thing that's an
overkill if I leaves no js' or react or
something like they're at there I would
definitely go with the PHP so for
small-scale many many many projects it's
okay to go with PHP but for for little
heavy and user things I would go for Jas
okay difference difference between
computer engineer and software engineer
interesting why why would I think about
it even I just write code and that's it
so why would I think about things
Facebook uses PHP hey hey mr. Wilgus are
not aware about the react
I highly doubt you should be aware you
are there are you're just pulling my leg
there mr. Berg is yes Facebook uses PHP
for quite a lot of things but Facebook
is now a mixture of a lot of
technologies and the reason the reason
why they are trying to move on to the
node and to the react is simply because
of the speed and performance I hope you
are aware of it I don't expect that I
think you're pulling my leg that's it so
but okay that's okay
web development or mobile app
development which is going to have a
good future scope both of them they kill
both of them
neither the web sites are going anywhere
neither the mobile are going anywhere
yes things are shifting towards mobile
app development but that doesn't mean
web sites are going anywhere they're not
going anywhere so it is going to be
still there and in the past things have
showed that if you if you'll be shifting
totally on mobile it's a bad move
websites like Myntra has already proven
that that moving completely mobile can
decrease the sale of course it cuts cuts
out the expenses but it's a bad move and
Myntra has showed this to everybody okay
so let's just start with a little bit
more questions how should I start making
projects I have discussed that in the
previous one of the movie video he liked
to call them video that yes do anything
in your project design app for your dad
for your mom for your friend or maybe
fill in the course we always do a couple
of projects like a at least five or ten
projects so that they can give you base
some handsome get started guide so Sahil
projects are important you should do
that whether you are learning from me or
not it doesn't matter doesn't matter
learn from anywhere but do projects PHP
or JSP I would go for PHP but you can
you can yell at me for that but I'll go
with that you asked my opinion I am
giving you that ok Bunty and what
programmers listen while programming
programmers listen to tick tick tick
tick tack tack tack tack toe that's
happening on the keyboard that's what
usually program and listens to and their
programming ok so I want to buy a
macbook which were to buy I would say
MacBook Pro because if you are going for
the Apple products I think you do have a
budget little bit but I would not go for
MacBook Air because they do have a
little less features and little less
hardware's I would go for MacBook Pro
and it doesn't really matter that you go
for the latest one with the touch bar I
don't know if you want to you can go
with that
but I would say for programming purposes
the last year MacBook would also be fine
but you can buy this one this one here
as well but I'll go for MacBook Pro and
if you are tight on the budget Mac Mini
is also good might be lying somewhere
here if I can shake a desk there might
be lying one not two Mac Mac Mini maybe
I will do a studio dude somewhere then
you can find out what are the gadgets
lying around here and you will be amazed
to see the amount of laptops like stock
and things that I have here the amount
of lenses camera the half here so maybe
maybe someday I'll do a tube here and he
will be amazed to see what is lying
around like just now I can grab a box of
this lens and within here I can grab at
rode mic which is expensive can a lot of
things that are in my reach right now ok
so let's go there and talk about a
little bit GEOSS Crennel thanks for
applying always welcome ok ok ok let's
let's pick up questions should I learn
more than one programming at once or
one at a time one at a time because
there is no such thing as multitasking
because you are switching the task and
if your experience program and then it
will not matter much but at the
beginning I would say go for go for one
at a time okay you can post down your
questions how much time should I spend
per day in coding per day if I start
with Python now ah I would say at least
minimum three hours that's on a minimum
side but I think you should push that to
four or five hours because you are in a
beginner phase and you have to face a
lot of problems lot of searching on
Stack Overflow for your problems so I
would say minimum of three hours is is
something that you should be doing and I
think within a week or fifteen days at a
max you should be able to do basic
projects in Python that's that's all I
can say okay what programmers listen
while writing the code they'll tell you
this these things you can see this is
what they listen okay so let's just see
future of firebase it looks good to me I
don't think any any doubts about the
firebase it's a fantastic service but
there are a lot of other services
similar to firebase if you haven't heard
about the earth zero that is also a
fantastic service for login and
everything for database management there
is a back-end list so there are a couple
of competitors as well but I think
firebase is the one all-in-one solution
I used it for quite a lot of things
cannot tell you where but yes I do use
it quite a lot
okay so please explain JavaFX how can I
explain that in a live video JavaFX is
okay okay now let's go that's it that's
interesting question I saw there which
one is better traditional hosting versus
a SS cloud hosting eight of the West's
cloud hosting would be a little bit
overkill if you are hosting a website
which I usually call as a brochure
website where there is just some text
and
that's it so if you are hosting help on
the Amazon Cloud or CloudFlare that that
would be overkill so if that's a simple
website not much traffic maybe maybe
thousand visitors or ten thousand
visitors that's okay if it's not doing
much but if it's doing a lot of things
like log in accessing all things then
move to AWS or CloudFlare or a lot of
other things are there so you can go
there ok please shout out my name sir
hey Varun god I'm shouting out your name
do you want me to say it louder ok hi
there
ok how to do live streaming on website
hi Bunty you can there are a lot of
options with the live streaming one of
them is using the API of YouTube but I
doubt they have made it public yet or
not
I doubt about that but there is a live
streaming website as well let me show
you the name of that I use I have used
that in the past something named with a
D or something I forgot the name there
okay let me let me try that and darkest
yes I remember that dark ass DAC ast is
being used for the live streaming but
that's paid service of course you are
doing a live streaming that means that's
like that ok quality tricky content on
my channel must watch ok promoting your
channels as well here ok don't do that
come on to make your home crowd there
currently I'm working on Android app
using Java files and 35% work done
should I know switch to Catalan or to
complete this app now you don't need to
switch if a 25% work is done Shreyas
keep on doing that in Java push that app
to the Android store and maybe maybe
later you feel that you need a little
bit performance enhancement or you want
to design some feature in the Kotlin
then you can move on there right now you
don't need to switch just carry on your
work ok and there's some message is
being popping around ok I have commented
again and again for a lots of time but
didn't get any reply hey I'm ready
Goswami I'm sorry about that
I read your comment now and I'm so sorry
I couldn't read your comment maybe maybe
teachers AI there is no plan for AI
right now because a lot of things had
done being doing in here so thoughts on
J's framework genius frameworks are
awesome of react angular view or a lot
of others are there of there is one
known as electron is there so I would
say that's going pretty good and I am
amazed I'm thrilled that it's going so
where MacBook Pro late 2016 13 inch
touch bar with far I 5 8 GB RAM perfect
go for it no doubts please do JavaScript
life yes I can do that JavaScript life
would be awesome we can build a quick
app if you do remember once we build a
live react app that fetches the YouTube
videos continuously from my channel if
you do remember we have that on YouTube
channel it's freely available you can
check that out video that's awesome
video and let's go there ok ok ok come
on come on
ok one where do you live
why you want to come to my home for a
copy thumbs for jeaious course thank you
thank you feel awesome I really like I
appreciate your efforts their time of
year Scotland will take to rock it in in
market I would say within a couple of
years within a couple of years Catalan
will be quite a lot into it I think so I
could be wrong and no God there what is
Jason and how to use it I cannot discuss
these kinds of tech things like Jason
how to parse it how to fetch data as and
objects from it as synchronous requests
I can I cannot do that Karthik right now
that's included in the course usually
you need to check that out are they
worth learning jazz frameworks yes of
course if you are into front-end
development now you can quickly move
into back-end so I would say if you are
already know or of
of the JavaScript yes JavaScript
frameworks can worth learning okay so we
are being forged by hundred people and
that is something amazing so thumbs up
for you guys
hundred people i am streaming live at
from my home and addressing hundred
people this is this is something amazing
power of internet I respect that
okay I have purchased your ethical
course bootcamp course you know what
it's really amazing it is goodbye
good idea to buy a complete carry box
why would you buy it first of all thank
you so much for purchasing why would you
need at Kali box to purchase Kali's
available for free Virtual Box is
available for free and tutorials are
included in the course so no need to buy
anything now
you have bought the course and that's it
okay okay is it good first start
learning web development then move into
learning mobile app development
yes Nikhil I would say perfect strategy
there the more you will understand about
the things how they work on the screen
whether it's a small screen or large
screen I would say at least learn
front-end development and that would be
a good approach to getting started a lot
of you might disagree with that but I've
seen the students who have been into my
front-end development bootcamp have
actually moved into the iOS and
everything quite easily and flawlessly
because now they do understand how the
data is being transferred or how the
request is being made so a lot of things
they do understand about positioning
elements how text is being changed and a
lot of things so I would say learning
web development is a
thing it's a word spending time apart
from that you can also earn pretty good
change there with with web development
skills maybe hundred bucks a hundred
dollars or fifty dollars quickly and
easily by doing freelancing so I would
say it's a skill worth learning okay do
you think I should monster on jeaious
first and then move on to node GS of
course of course if you are moving into
technologies like node.js react GS
angularjs view or anything anything I
would say learn JavaScript first how to
start our us programming and Xcode is
the only platform for that but not
completely true what's your name I
forgot about it
okay Jas governor again there is one
more IDE for coding for iOS apps that's
by JetBrains not highly recommended not
highly although it's a good thing you
can just explore that but people too
will do recommend Xcode it's free with
the the machine that you buy it's
covered by the Apple there and I think
that's enough you can just jump into iOS
development course with a MacBook and
that's it you don't need anything else
yes but there is one more issue I do
need to buy a license to push your apps
into the App Store and that's for
Android as well no big deal okay uh what
you want to be what I want to be that
that's a strange question what I want to
be I'm happy what I am and I just want
to grow as a what I am being doing right
now I want to grow in that balloon Lee
okay uh how to create fast logic valve
coding it's no one day thing you cannot
just go and think like that and go to
code it's not like that sometime you
have to look on the Stack Overflow spend
hours of time and then just like that
okay
so just like that I need to turn on this
this is getting hot it's hot I have
given up a lot of time in Android
development can you give me tip about
not quitting now
you should not quit codex don't quit
programmers don't quit if I would have
been like a quitting person I would have
never run this YouTube channel never
would have been talking to you guys
because at very first I failed badly in
running a YouTube channel I thought hey
that that's not I'm not a quitting
person either you should be if I would
have been a quitting person the website
that you see there it doesn't mean lying
around there learn code online on any
website everybody faces problem so don't
quit please don't quit whatever you are
learning from wherever you are learning
don't quit this is the first thing that
you can do okay okay
okay wish me luck Ankita Mahajan
best of luck for whatever you are doing
my wishes are all this video okay is is
campaigning with other coders good and
programming yes it is yes it is
sometimes you might want to compare your
code with other person how they have
done is your code is better or their
once so yes that that's a good thing
hi this should I master up first
object-oriented programming first for
larval I would say yes it's literally
required but object-oriented programming
is not a big concept maybe I can do a
video series on object-oriented
programming just on the base overview
maybe since some graphics and some fun
stuff without writing any code to make
sure that you understand what the basis
is lying around with object-oriented
programming or maybe we can use a couple
of programming as well so I'll try okay
how much time it takes for your channel
to grow ah my channel has a different
story of growing because the channel is
pretty old I didn't work on it it was
just an account to subscribe people i
watch a lot of comedy videos so a lot of
stand-up comedy's I love them these guys
in fact socket con and every
I love them so this account was just
only to subscribe them and that's it and
last year I tried to give it a shot on
the YouTube channel it didn't work
really well because I was having no idea
about handling cameras lights mic and
everything so it feels really badly but
after that I joined up a couple of boot
camps about cameras filmmaking and all
these things I learned quite a lot I
fathered a lot of good youtubers who
actually do something good with a
youtube not just posting the videos but
actually color correction cinematography
how the shoot videos backgrounds and
everything like Casey Knight stab and
all these guys in fact I do have a
student who was working for a couple of
projects for Casey and I said who has
worked with him I learned from him as
well and then in the last three months
my channel has seen a 300% growth and it
has been growing since then so last
three months are actually the serious
one three or five months which has been
serious on YouTube but that's just for
making the community here not for making
money on YouTube of course the YouTube
doesn't even pay for this mic so that's
not for something here when you will
publish course for Android developer
your website is so good hey technical
soo breath ahh I don't want to be I
don't want to publish the course in a
hurry I want to do a complete polishing
of the course all apps should be perfect
all codes should be perfect so it might
take a month usually takes a month or
maybe month and a half to publish any
course because first I do a lot of
research about how the course should be
laid out how structure should be done
and then what topic should be introduced
at what time and also I do make separate
apps for the testing purpose because I
cannot make a full fledge adapt and just
throw it in front in-phase appear I have
to make small chunks of the apps and all
these things so these things do take
time so yes definitely it's going to
take a little bit while for the Android
but it's going to be the best I always
am about performing and producing best
quality possible-- courses so it will
take time but yes it is going to be the
best of course the price is going to be
very very affordable
your complete web development course
will I know industry standards and where
is that where is that and will I be able
to apply for jobs I yes for the complete
upfront in development you will be
learning about the industry standards
you will be making 14 websites that you
can upload on github and can approach to
any person on the planet that hey this
is my work see my work how I have done
and do you think I should get a job and
that's that's what all you need to do is
so it's a pretty fantastic course ok is
there a need to learn app design for
Android development uh in the study
phase you don't need to go for the app
design much because usually there is a
separate team who is going to be
designing assets for you but it's always
good to have multiple skills so a little
bit skill some sketch or Photoshop
Illustrator will surely help so that's
what you can do okay if you are good
enough understanding the syntax of
language how much minimum time are you
where where is that how much minimum
time you you could spend learning one
language a high meg merchant I learned
quite fast now because I have learned
the programming languages for which
there was no courses no tutorials no
books I have done that a multiple times
like I have done that for Swift which
was when the suit version came out I was
one of the among first persons who
learned that introduced courses on them
I being approached by a lot of
publishers to write book on it so
usually within a week I'm able to
understand the language and make
products with them this is super
important make products with them
because when you make products then only
you know that how much you know the
language learning the syntax is pretty
easy for me but making products is
something different so usually takes a
week to design my first working product
and around 15 days to make a miniature
of social media website each thing that
you can post the things basically
connecting with the database
everything so usually takes a 15 days to
jump into a new language
cybertek did you left this live
streaming no I haven't left that I'm
still here you are inspiration stay
blessed thank you so much thank you so
much I really appreciate oh my god
looking nice thank you oh okay how to
start is programming and is Xcode the
only platform for that yes I have
mentioned that in the previously as well
Xcode is not the only one there is one
from the JetBrains as well but it's
recommended and it's the fantastic you
don't need anything else and for
starting the iOS development visit learn
code online . --an okay when is your
birthday who was asking for my birthday
a la vie bro hello technology Elsa my
birthday is on 2nd of August it's coming
near by maybe I can plan some trip for
that maybe I can spend my birthday in my
favorite city in France or maybe one of
my favorite city in India as well
and maybe I can see I can make up some
fun you reminded me and I can fix some
plan for my birthday
ok where do you live I live in the
beautiful city of Jaipur it's awesome
little bit hot but it's awesome city ok
message number 47 okay I need to read
this okay
please reply it's important sir I want
to do BC s ok whatever that is can it it
is good option towards programming job
Hey I don't comment about these things a
bcs or a bc a or b tag it's a personal
decision in order to learn programming
that's that's an educational curriculum
in order to learn programming you have
to put in your efforts okay it's not
like oh this is going to teach you about
making apps or something
that's something you have to do on your
own so it doesn't matter what course you
opt in or very often so it's it's okay
whenever you are doing it whatever you
are doing it that's okay
programming is something that you have
to learn on your own and let's just see
so your great job for us hats off to you
thank you so much BJ ended it
I appreciate always your efforts
associated root developer certification
is worth it I don't know I don't know
about that college learning versus
personal learning have a balance there
College learning it's good for grades
and getting past their personal learning
is something where you achieve something
on your personal like making apps making
websites making some data modulation
things a neural network or AI or
compiler whatever you're learning so
hip-hop music distract me from coding
don't listen to that if it distracts you
don't listen to that okay make a project
of making a making a social network in
front-end it's already there such in
what is it there or not no it's not
there in front and but social network
would not be much fun if it is just on
the front end it's no fun
okay okay till how long will this stream
go on
if you're bored from here that's okay I
can understand you can just leave no
hard feelings there if you are bored
from this live stream you can turn it
off because I do have some free time
things are getting actually uploaded on
my other computer and I do have some
free time that's why I'm here and if you
are getting bored with this live stream
and Q&amp;amp;A session you can you can always
turn it off my name is Felicity I'm from
UK Derby amazing amazing place have been
to UK once I want to visit it again
because I
have a couple of friends they're
Facebook friends and I just want to meet
them
the Akshar is the place I think where
they live and that's nearby to London I
think it's just a one hour drive I think
so so I would be visiting UK very soon
okay I hate YouTube so don't don't be on
YouTube if you hate YouTube just go up
from internet delete your account just
go up if you hate you do sir is
internship from India Indian Railway in
Oracle or Android is beneficial I have
know about no idea about what kind of
product they develop or what kind of
thing to do so I cannot tell you a bitch
Kumar please reply how can I link my
YouTube videos on my website sir if you
want to link your YouTube videos to your
website you can use iframes I think
that's that's the easiest way to do best
Linux distro I think you can choose
between a Ubuntu or Fedora if you have
done any kind of raided certification
obviously will be choosing Fedora one
two is also good but a lot of people are
Fred a fans of open SUSE so choosing a
Linux distro is really a tough job but I
won't be going into that because that
creates a fight okay so okay I am 13
year old which goes to by Kotlin for
upcoming Android development if you are
13 I would highly recommend to get
started first with web development yes
you can always get started with Android
and everything but what web development
does it gives you more confidence that
yes you can build something you can
upload that son
show to the people I always recommend
kids to get started with web development
first because HTML CSS these are the
things you are you can get and learn
pretty easily so for kids web
development is something that you should
get started but anytime every kid has
has a different potential and based on
that you can do so so your channel
content is awesome thumbs up thank you
okay are you from IIT no I'm not why
would you bother for that I just bought
your awesome Kirkland course on udemy
thank you so much feedback for buying
the course if you face any problem do
let me know it's an awesome course being
well thoroughly being planned out and
it's an awesome course you'll love that
it's got a nice good for Linux es Kali
is good but it's more over like a
penetration testing oriented distro not
for the regular use I would say okay so
we have streaming live for 42 minutes
that's that that's something amazing
okay so let's take some more questions
eleven code online is awesome and
affordable yes that is the de moto about
the website that I want to make this
high-quality education affordable to
everyone on top of that I have to earn a
little bit so that I can keep
maintaining that website as well as I
can keep doing what I do and these
things are not cheap so I just charge a
little bit amount not that much these
are just the amount of charge of two or
three movie tickets that you can spend
their friends so I try my best
our YouTube sucks you evaded my
questions like ten thousand times the
real hack okay so I have evaded your
question ten thousand times I have to
check out whether the ten thousand
comments have been made on this stream
or not he can check that out okay I have
already learned HTML CSS and J's but if
you have learned that what you have
created with that that's important
how to start career as a freelance for
Android development and web development
how to get clients maybe I can do
someday a video on on freelance ok
hey - I have completed your C course as
first programming language which codes
should I join next I would say that if
you want to join next a joined front-end
development or you can join JavaScript
as well because the front-end will help
you to quickly earn money and get
started with that because then you can
make website and everything you can
aren't pretty good money easily in on
websites like Fiverr freelance of
working there so it helps quite a lot so
I would say go with the front-end
development then you can move on to
back-end and other languages now you
understand programming basics and
everything so things like jQuery and
JavaScript will be fun to you and you
can join complete front-end development
that's an amazing course it doesn't
really that's interesting when there
doesn't relationship distract from
coding sir what can I say about that um
first the preference I would say if you
have your other partner then I'm doing
come on this is this is not a Love Guru
channel go let's give that okay oh oh my
goodness I do mix type of website will
kill job of web developer no not a
chance
even the Vics guys these developer to
host their website like Rick so and then
nowhere near the website like makes a
page cloud they're nowhere near of
killing it forget about the killing of
jobs a lot of people are not even using
them let me tell you one thing host a
website on the mix and try to move their
domain on different hosting you will be
swearing and you will be you'll be
getting a lot of pain but still you will
not be able because they don't leave the
clients
people try to stay away from those guys
and yes they do sponsor a lot of channel
maybe someday they can approach my
channel as well to brag about wigs I'm
not gonna do that I'm not going to do
that okay bro do you know what is sleep
because you are a programmer developer I
do sleep very less very less ah and a
behind scene v-log ok behind the scene V
Lord could be awesome I can try that but
it would be most of the time sitting on
this this desk and job maybe maybe I'll
try behind the scene D log who are your
inspiration to code I mean who inspired
it to code there is not one person who
inspired me to code the first and
foremost person to inspire who inspires
me to code is you guys because when I
see you guys struggling to learn to code
this is what makes me inspired to code
learn code and each code as well so
number of inspiration are you guys there
are a lot of other peoples that we can
discuss later on Sunday should I
perceive a tech or not completely on to
you will not do anything and there's a
highlighted comment as well I have an
internship in Android but I want to get
into machine learning with that cursor
easy to find that should I get in
machine learning jobs ok so you have got
an internship Android and you want to do
machine learning why even you have
applied for Android if you want to go
into machine learning I don't get that I
don't get that if you're interested in
machine learning don't waste any time
time anywhere just do that ah ok can you
give me a discount and friend in web dev
course ah it's just 100 rupees in India
if you have credit card you can get a
little bit more discount as well but I
think that's fairly price I cannot do
much more than that which language to
learn for pentesting hacking there is
not one language by which you can do
penetration
testing and stuff of course things like
SQL and PHP JavaScript and Python really
helps where there is not such one thing
okay why again and again asking does
relationship is tracked another love
guru here I'm not going to answer that
how can I motivate myself by watching my
channel I do upload a lot of
motivational videos 1204 front and Dev
yes that's it
ah okay okay come on stop asking that
relationship question I have bought
friend in development course it's also
my name I'm enjoying thank you so much
you will enjoy that even further when
we'll be moving towards the little bit
detail project okay what are views in
instant apps android instant apps are
just a wrapper uh instead apps are just
a wrapper around HTML CSS NGS not the
native apps if if the instant builder is
not being built in a rate react native I
have to think a lot about it okay
we need more motivational videos I'll
come up with them more soon surely so we
have stream quite a lot and I think okay
my upload work is done I can get back to
work now and it was amazing it was fun
with you guys talking to you okay you
ignored my question hi got okay I'm
sorry I'm sorry if I ignored a lot of
questions for me I'm trying my best but
again please don't complain about it I'm
trying my best so okay so that's it for
this video and it was amazing it was fun
talking to you guys bye-bye everybody
I can see some pie from there come on by
by the way now and I can turn out this
guy and if you have two more question
you can still post them and I'll surely
come up later on we'll try to answer
more questions we'll try to produce more
awesome courses for you so that you can
learn and that's it for this video bye
