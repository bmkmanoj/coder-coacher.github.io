back again to JavaScript series before
we proceed on to this cities let me
mention that I made a mistake in one of
the earlier to earlier video and thank
you so much Armour for reminding me
I highly appreciate that I actually say
that it's document URL it's was not
documented well it was document dot URL
silly mistake but I really am sorry
about that thank you so much Amir for
mentioning me that and correcting me
there I really appreciate that
so please read the documentation that's
why I always recommend them that
sometimes even I make mistakes and
everybody makes mistake so read them and
it's always good now let's come back to
our topic here and let's fix up the some
stuff that we made a mess first and
foremost in our particular case it
really makes sense that we don't use the
script tag at the head because we are
doing stuff which is manipulating these
paragraphs and stuff which is only
possible if these are loaded first so
let's cut that and paste it at the
bottom and there we go now they are
loaded and we can manipulate them okay
so and what we can do is we can just go
on to the script and the goal of this
script is how we can change the content
inside this paragraph tag okay and that
is pretty easy so I can just we can have
you have seen all this stuff so we can
just comment that out no big deal and
what we can do now is we can we can use
this query selector and can benefit
first of all one paragraph once we have
learned that we can apply our knowledge
and can change all the paragraphs so so
let's just call this as Const and we're
gonna call this as my P elements
elements there we go and what I'm gonna
be using is document dot query selector
so first of all I'm gonna be using just
the query selector and since I'm only
interested in the paragraph tag and
since I already talked about it this
query selector is very eager to return
you the answer whenever it's gonna spot
the very first element that you're gonna
looking up for it's gonna give you the
result back so the question is how you
can change that obviously we have seen
that if I print this my p element go
back on to this clean that and run that
again it gives me the entire P tag which
is not at all possible to change
directly by saying this P tag equals
some title it's not possible so there
are other properties in this my P
element which I can use automatically
and as I put a dot notice we have a lot
of things that we can do this outer text
and there's a lot remove attributes
there are a lot of things that you can
do probably you can add introduce new
CSS into it remove some of the CSS
remove some of the attributes can use
some Charles there's a lot you can do
the one that we will be using in this
case is which is text content and yes
it's self-explanatory that you can
change the change the text inside this
element by using this text content and
it's really simple all you have to do is
just make sure it's equal to some string
that you want to change and I'm gonna
say I am being changed using J s so that
make sense so as soon as I do that we
don't need to see anything in the
console log you can see that directly at
the page it says I am being changed
using J s now this is for the one
element that we are using this is for
query selector for paragraph it works
exactly same for h1 it works exactly
same for any other tag however you want
to manipulate it now that we have
learned that how we can use this I'm
gonna comment this out again so that you
can have it later on for sure I want to
use my looping knowledge that how you
can I can look through this entire
paragraphs and can change them all of
them at once so let's just see how we
can do that we're gonna say cost and
we're gonna say my P elements and that
is gonna be document dot and I want to
this time use query selector all now
notice this query selector all returns
you an array in which all the elements
of similar tags or IDs or classes that
you're looking for is there so in this
case I am just looking for all the peas
surely I can select all elements which
has same IDs no IDs don't have usually
are not same which have the same classes
or anything like that you got the point
you got the point okay so how I can use
my looping knowledge I can simply say my
P elements and I can use a for each loop
now since this for each is looping
through each element of it I can just
use it so what I can do let me do
something and I'm gonna give you one
assignment for you okay so I'm gonna be
using this function and there we go my
function body so what I can do in this
function it is gonna be going through
each paragraph element I'm gonna be
selecting that paragraph I'm gonna be
calling it as P and on this P I can use
this text content and can say I am
changed using loop in GS so now as soon
as I save this this is gonna get
converted into all the paragraphs will
be converted into I am changed using GS
loop let's just save that and see that
and notice all of the paragraphs are
being changed okay so you can see we
have learned loops a long while ago and
now we are using our knowledge to
manipulate these things now similarly in
the upcoming videos we can surely learn
about how we can create some elements as
well and can delete some element now a
good thing about removing the elements
is actually it is really really simple
all I have to do instead of this I can
do is that you remove and that's it
that's pretty much it and of course it's
a function so that's it I don't have to
do anything I have to just save it and
you will notice immediately that nothing
loads up on my page even if I hit a
reload because my JavaScript is now
removing all the elements so it's
completely possible and we can do a lot
of fun stuff with that okay let me get a
command C because our goal was not to
remove our goal was simply to change the
things okay
now here's a quick assignment for you
can you convert this easy-peasy function
into an arrow function that would be
really an amazing and challenge and you
can perform all of this in just single
line so here's your quick assignment in
the comment section please please change
this function into an arrow function and
notify me there okay so I hope you have
enjoyed this video and we're gonna talk
a little bit more about the DOM and
manipulation of that in the upcoming
videos so that's it for this video
please don't forget to hit like and
subscribe to my youtube channel it's not
really hard to find it's just my name
hit ho3 and I know it's a little bit
hard to spell and pronounce but anyways
hit that subscribe and I'm gonna catch
you up in the next video
