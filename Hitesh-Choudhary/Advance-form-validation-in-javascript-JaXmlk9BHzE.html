JavaScript CDs so let's just get started
and move forward in our HTML document so
so far we have seen a lot of stuff which
is like input and buttons and all of
those tags now let's go ahead and create
a few more elements in this HTML
document and understand how these
actually work and this is gonna be super
helpful if you're gonna move forward
into node react angular whatever that is
because some version of this exact
concept they use that in there and so
far we have learned that we can have an
input and can have a button but in
reality most of the time this is just
being used for a search box or something
like that
Mindy when you create a login or a sign
up we use an actual form there now this
form has a default action we don't need
to worry much about how the action is
going to be and what you can do with
this form is you can have multiple
inputs and when you hit the submit
button there it actually submits the
entire form you can have multiple inputs
and all these things you have seen that
quite a lot so let's just have an input
so there we go we have an input there we
go now right now
I do have an input of type text there
but I need a couple of more elements
inside it when I use that inside a form
previously I was not using any name ID
placeholder anything like that but now I
need to use that so let's just say I use
a name and usually when you have this
kind of email or anything like that then
we use something known as email or maybe
password or maybe username okay let's
use a username for that and for the
placeholder we're gonna say something
like username there we go
and I think that is it and you can also
target an ID or something like that but
in this case we don't need it and then
you can have a simple button and there
we go button and we are going to simply
say button column I need this submit one
okay there we go type equals submit now
when you have this submit kind of button
what you can do is you can have multiple
input and it's gonna submit all of that
information to wherever you want once
you click the submit it doesn't submit
each one of them rather it submits all
of them you can have multiple inputs so
first and foremost let's just save that
and see how
looks on the browser it is not
drastically different it's just a simple
username and you hit the submit but when
you hit the submit notice it just uses a
browser thing in the URL which says
username equals blank and if you write
something here let's just say you write
the John there why do I type Oh capital
in the John office so hit submit and
notice now the username equals John is
being submitted now it is not being
submitted to anywhere because we didn't
mention it where to take this action and
obviously we don't need it right now and
especially with the evolution of the
newer chairs and stuff like that we
actually don't need it much so what you
can do is we can just place a class
there just for fun because previously we
used an ID so we're gonna call this as
my form okay now we want to simply write
a simple JavaScript validation here and
I'm gonna be giving you again some
assignments there and what we want in
this that whatever the user is typing
inside this input form we want to grab
that value and as soon as the user hit
the submit we want to reset this form
and that's it and also we don't want
anything to be happening inside this URL
this thing which says username equals
John this should not appear on the URL
so how we can do that and honestly this
is actually super super easy so what we
can do is whenever user hit the submit
we are gonna be performing that action
so we're gonna be moving on to this
validation and I'm gonna be simply
putting a comment which says form
validation next video or something like
that so what we can do is we can use
simply document dot again you can use a
get element by ID or something in this
case query selector makes sense now
again in programming there are hundreds
of ways doing the things probably all of
them are correct and it's always
dependent on where you are more
comfortable and since we are using a
class this time so we're gonna be using
dot my form there we go so we have now
selected this form yes surely you could
have placed IDs into this input or stuff
like that
that is also totally valid but I wanted
to show you one more way of doing the
thing so we are selecting directly this
form and this form can have multiple
inputs so we're gonna be looking at for
that so now this for
is gonna be useful for us only and only
when we add an event listener to it so
let's just add an event listener there
and it requires you to pass on first of
all the event and then the function
which is a callback the only event which
is usually used in the forum in almost
all application is submit because that's
how it is being triggered and then we
can use our error function which is just
like this arrows and there we go
now this error function also has an
access to something known as event there
we go and once you have an access to
this event what you can do is couple of
things first of all we're gonna log few
things and this is gonna be event dot
target dot and then you mentioned after
the target you mentioned the name that
you have given to this in this case it
is a username but it can be another one
let me just show you for the fun stuff
that we do have another tag which has
not user name something like real name
okay and placeholder would be real name
it's really hard in the world of
internet that anybody would be writing
real name but hey let's just assume that
and how does our HTML looks like it says
user name real name and submit now first
and foremost I would like to show you
without saving this validation that how
it actually works
onto this URL so user name let's just
say it's gonna be Sami and real name is
gonna be Samuel there we go and when I
hit submit notice everything is being
displayed on the URL so this is the
thing we want to get rid of now okay
there we go
basic stuff also let me clear this up so
how we can do that we want to grab both
the values now so event dot target dot
and then you mentioned the name here
okay so we're gonna copy this username
and we're gonna paste that and of course
we don't want to get that we want a
value of that okay so there we go
and I'm gonna hit command shift D to
grab the this time not the username I
want I want real name okay copy that and
paste that so we'll be printing both of
them and it should be absolutely fine
let's just save that go back here
clean that up and username is gonna be
Sammy and the real name is gonna be
Samuel and hit submit and there we go
Sammy and Samuel are being printed okay
step one is sold and notice that
automatically when we submit that our
form gets refreshed or we can say it
gets empty that's okay now we want to
get rid of this guy from the URL now
this is the default behavior of the URL
so we definitely want to get rid of this
default behavior of the URL and for that
we do have this event and it comes up
with a method which says prevent default
and notice it just says prevent defaults
and it's self-explanatory nothing much
whatever the browser is doing as a
default we just want to get rid of that
so save that let's just go back here and
hit reload clean that and we are gonna
say Sammy and Samuel and hit submit and
obviously it doesn't did the job because
I forgot to clean that okay it is
actually doing its job but I forgot to
clean that from the URL so there we go
this is a fresh web page now and let's
just do something like it's gonna be
let's use something else we are gonna
say Hulk as a username and real name is
gonna be Bruce so hit submit notice
nothing appeared there we got everything
on the console but we created another
problem that our form is not getting
refreshed pretty okay
since the browser default behavior is to
push everything on to this URL and then
clean that up and we start that behavior
so that's why it's not printing up so we
have to write one more line of code in
order to do so and what we can do is we
can simply say event dot target dot user
name dot value and we're gonna just
clean that value just like this with an
empty string okay so I hope you are able
to do it now let's just try that one
more time it's gonna be Hulk for the
username and Bruce and hit submit
and notice our username got cleaned up
but Bruce didn't got cleaned up okay and
but still everything we are getting into
the browser so here's a quick challenge
for
you now you should be able to clean up
this real name as well so I hope
everybody will be able to do it that
should be pretty simple and I also want
you to click I also want you to create a
simple form which is a signup form which
asks the user for its user name its
email address its password and the
repeat password again and also I want
you to create a simple validation that
checks whether the password is equals to
password 2 which is gonna be notice
medes sometimes on the website ask for
password and repeat your password so if
that is not true we want to print a
simple paragraph there so create a
element at that time and simply print
the password there that password doesn't
match ok I know this is a too much of
the work but this is how everybody
learned so don't be lazy create all
these assignments and submit them as
well so that's it for this video and I'm
gonna catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
