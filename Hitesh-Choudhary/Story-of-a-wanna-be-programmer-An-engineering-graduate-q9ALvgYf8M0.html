that another video today I have a
interesting story for you this is story
is about softness but it doesn't really
matter it might be Swapnil it might be
Jane Doe or John Doe the amazing part or
the interesting part about this story is
what he has gone through in his life and
finally have achieved something now for
this story I want you to just assume
yourself as Swapnil try to assume what
everything has happened to the Swapnil I
want you to exactly feel exactly same it
can happen to your it might be you so
just try to put your feet in Swapnil
shoes and try to imagine all the
scenario that happened to the Swapnil
and finally he has achieved something
something big
now try to imagine in this way that you
are Swapnil and you have worked really
hard in your college try to achieve an
undergraduate degree you have worked
really hard you have done all the
assignments you have done all the exams
all the practicals and everything you
have followed all the rules that
university has applied to you he has
never asked a single question about that
regardless whether it's a 75% tenant or
some boring assignment that he has to
just copy from a book to his notebook it
doesn't really matter he has followed
all the rules worked every single day
hard enough to get his undergraduate
degree with such a hard work his
expectation was not amazing big he don't
want to become a millionaire or he
doesn't want to become the next Bill
Gates
all his expectation is I'm crazy about
the code
I want to write code for some company I
want to become an Android developer and
he has fulfilled all the criteria for
university to achieve his degree his
expectation is really simple he want to
sit in the placement drive once you get
hired as an Android developer and that's
it he wants to write some code he wants
to make some change in the world by
writing some code not a big expectation
he just want to write some code and live
a happy life it's not much that he's
asking for now he's in a situation where
he has completed his undergraduate
degree and is ready to move into the
actual real world where he is speaking
for a job let's just say like many
thousands and thousands of us he didn't
got a placement from the college and
that's completely ok because college is
not a guarantee for getting a job right
in the placement right and it's okay a
lot of us find the job on the go going
into the market going to the silicon
valley's of each country it's okay now
try to imagine you are Sapna and you
have completed your graduate degree but
you don't have a job now it's the time
that is passing on one month two months
and six months and as the time goes up
the pressure here builds up quite a lot
because it's not the pressure from the
family it's not the pressure from the
society it's the pressure from your ego
it's the pressure from your dignity that
says no I'm not going to ask anymore
from my parents I'm going to do it for
my own if I have expenses I will
maintain it if I have bills to pay for
food for electricity for my internet
I'll pay for them if I need a new phone
I'm going to pay for it
this whole dignity concept is allowing
you to just do something and earn some
money and obviously you look for a job
but you are not ready to ask any more
help from your parents and that's good
thing
now just like many of you softness is
making his resume a and trying to go
into different companies within a month
he has interviewed more than 20
companies so that he can just see who is
ready to take him and soon enough he has
realized that just the degree is not
enough to get hired and that's the
actual situation he has realized that
just by knowing as some programming
concepts it is not enough to get a job
the best part about this personality is
he's not ready to go down he's not going
to curse to his college that he hey
college has not given us the placement
and he's not going to rant about it
neither he is going to rent about his
destiny that I am failed I have failed
to get a job instead he is an electric
person he analyzed why I am in this
situation and soon enough he has
realized that I just have a degree I
don't have any practical knowledge I
don't have any project with me so that I
can show to the potential employees that
hey this is my project hire me he just
knows a few programming concept and
that's it now I'm not trying to say that
degrees are not good enough they are
really good but just having a degree is
not going to land you up in a job short
Nell's
soon realized his mistake that hey this
is not going to work and I have two
options either to rant about it or just
do something about it and he is the type
2 he's going to do something about it so
instead of just roaming around here and
there and just see and take no from all
the companies he says no this is not
going to happen to me I'm going to start
to learn I will build up a few projects
so that potential employees can see that
and I'm going to get hired he started
learning Android and finally after this
whole situation and you have absolutely
no idea how much mental
he is faced when you don't have money to
just pay for your food bills you have to
ask again and again for the money for
your parents it's not easy especially
when you have completed your graduation
and are going and looking up for a job
again and again seeing enough it's a big
mental pressure but inspir in spite all
of that he's just starting right now and
finally he has made it to the AppStore
I'm really glad the student likes up
Nell do exist to inspire all of us with
such a situation he has finally made it
to the App Store with app known as
channel ID
you
you
I'm not saying this is a marvelous app
this is going to be the next snapchat or
next Facebook of the app no it's not
going to be but finally he has something
to show up he has a product that he is
really proud that I have done it I have
build it Swapnil recently approached me
that hey after watching a lot of your
videos on YouTube and specially the
version 1 and version 2 videos finally
here is my version one of my app and I'm
really want to say that hey
congratulation you have made it to the
App Store something told me all about
his stories and everything and finally
he asked me one good question am I ready
to take all of the jobs now and my
answer was no we are not ready yet
although his app is really beautiful and
something amazing that he should be
proud of but this is not just enough
your app should be little bit more
complex should use a little bit more
features like audios videos camera or at
least assign a feature and this is the
most basic for any company to hire you
and the best part you know about the
signal is he understands the situation
he has taken all of my advice and says
yes you're correct and I'm not going to
be approaching more companies in the
next coming up month instead I'll be
focusing on learning mode I will be
designing more apps and will show you so
that you can tell me when I'm ready to
take all of those companies and in fact
you don't need to approach me anymore
whenever your apps are going to be ready
you will know that automatically that
hey now I'm ready to take down any
Android app that is being asked by the
client and I can make that see the
important part here is first of all make
some projects your college degree is
good but it's not good enough to land
you up in a job so focus a lot of on the
project be clear in your mind what you
really want to do whether you want to
become an Android developer iOS
developer web developer or maybe
something else just try to clear that up
first of all in your mind
second point never be afraid of version
1 version 1 is going to be the ugliest
thing you have ever seen or you have
ever created but without version 1 it's
not going to be version 2 a lot of
people make amazing apps and they these
all apps just sits down in their
hardware in their hard disk I really
don't want you to be that guy I want to
just go out don't
listen to the world push your app to the
App Store you will face a lot of
problems but go ahead do that a lot of
you might be studying in the colleges
and you might be facing the same
situation as he has done now he was a
very strong-minded person who has taken
down all of such a huge pressure but I
really doubt a lot of you might be able
to take that down or not so all I'm
saying to all of you is college is just
there so keep it there and manage a
little bit more time to understand the
things and learning the things in a
project manner approach I have build up
a lot of courses to help you out at
learn code online dot in take down these
courses if I'm not interested in them
look out for other resources there are
hundreds of other websites that you
might be looking up for now I'm not
saying that hey only buy from learn code
online dot in there are hundreds of
other resources your goal should be
number one create a lot of projects so
that you can show the potential people
that hey I have done a lot of work why
don't you hire me and all those people
who are standing in the queue with just
their resumes and nothing else you will
be standing out because you have worked
on some real projects while they were
busy just scoring the 95 percent in
their universities you have got at least
5 apps in the App Store and that's
matter the most
because end of the day when you will be
hired in a company the companies are
going to give you some tasks and that
only can be done by an actual programmer
not by someone who is just mugging up
the books I'm not saying books are bad
or University slavers is bad it's there
it's needed but alongside with that you
also need to do something extra your age
doesn't matter your situation doesn't
matter let me know in the comments
section below how many of you are going
to get started right now how many of you
have already got started to make
something to create a project notify me
in the comments section I will be surely
looking up for that in case you don't
know about the complete Android
developer course build an apps

section which you can check out feel
