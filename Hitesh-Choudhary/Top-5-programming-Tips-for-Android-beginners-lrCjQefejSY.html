again with another video in this video
we are going to talk about the top five
tips that every big nerd as an Android
really want to listen these tips will
help you quite a lot if you're
struggling in learning Android or you
are in the mid way of learning the
Android now if you're getting started
with the Android this is the most video
that everybody should watch now just to
give you the context with my Android
code so far in the last just four months
almost more than hundred student have
reached the Google Play Store this is
really an amazing number and I am proud
on that but still there is like small
amount of number of students who are
still struggling in learning Android and
are not able to make it to reach to that
Google Play Store this is really a
concerning situation because I want
everyone to get a success and want to
just taste how it looks like when you
reach to the actual Play Store so these
tips are gonna be super helpful for you
whether at what point you are struggling
you should not skip this video so this
video is also going to solve your
problem about the things that you are
facing about like installation of
Android studio or some other things as
well so let's talk about it but before
that we have to hold that in solfege
hold that into that
so hey Android developers let's start
with a tip number one get and stable
internet connection now really really
really you want to do this you want to
get a stable internet connection in
order to learn Android now I'm not
saying it this because you might want to
explore a lot of things on your own or
maybe you want to hang around at Stack
Overflow to explore a lot of problems
that you are facing this is regarding
the installation of the stuff now when
you install Android studio this is very
important that you should have a stable
internet connection and by the term
stable internet connection I don't mean
to say that you should be able to watch
youtube videos constantly this is not at
all a test for constant internet
connection and usually I have seen that
the mobile connection that you are using
the mobile network is not at all as
stable and at the end of the
installation of Android studio you face
the problems like Gradle sync issue the
connection was reset this means that
your internet was not good enough to
provide a constant stable internet
connection while installing the Android
studio and thus you have faced the
problem so do not install android studio
wire while you are on to some mobile
network I'm not saying this is true for
every kind of country and every possible
student because a lot of students are
lucky and able to install Android studio
on mobile network as well but this is
not the always case usually in 90% of
the situation Android studio want to
want to have a Gradle sink and that sink
is only possible when you have stable
internet connection so this stable
internet connection will solve a lot of
your problem so go ahead get yourself
like a broadband or go to some cyber
cafe or to some university so that for
few are still the Android studio is
being installed properly and a simple
hello world application of Android is
being run you have a decent and good
stable amount of internet connection
this is super important and the most
asked question on the entire internet on
the Android I have got a Gradle sync
failed issue
it says connection was reset what should
I do now get yourself a stable internet
connection and just
back again yes I said that just a few
second ago but yes again this needs a
reminder that if you are able to watch a
YouTube videos constantly doesn't means
you have a stable internet connection
from your mobile phone simply because
when you watch a YouTube videos it's not
being buffered like instantaneously it
stores a buffer on your computer and
that allows you to watch the video even
if there is a jagged internet connection
so this doesn't means you have a stable
internet connection I don't know why
this happens Android studio should pack
up everything and should be delivering
that but again the Gradle doesn't work
like that
in order to have a stable Gradle and no
problem with the Gradle sync issues you
should have internet connection stable
one again onto a side note here again
side sight eyes a lot of side notes I
always give but onto a side note
whenever there is going to be an upgrade
in the cradle it just updates all the
freaking time like two point one to two
point three three point one to three
point two it just does it all the time
like that and if you have that update
again you will need a stable internet
connection so make sure you watch out
for that the second most common problem
that everybody faces and this needs to
be addressed get yourself latest as well
as original tools this is by far the
most important thing that I can say to
you get yourself original as well as
latest things now I have seen that
people download the Android studio like
one month ago and want to install that
this is not gonna work because Android
studio updates quite frequently and
specially the Gradle updates quite
frequently so you might want to get
yourself the latest build of Java latest
build of Android studio as well this is
super important on top of that what's
important is your operating system as
well whether you are using a Mac make
sure it's updated to the latest High
Sierra as of time of recording I am
doing that it's High Sierra but whatever
the time you might be watching this
video make sure it is latest it doesn't
say any updates available on a Mac
coming on to the Windows part here where
the students actually face most of the
issues because windows just rollouts
updates insanely and crazily without any
given notice and they come almost every
single week so yes make sure that you
have fully properly updated again
a separate issue I'm not saying you are
doing it a lot of students do that okay
again I'm not saying you are doing it a
lot of student use pirated Windows this
is not at all good for Android
application development because these
pirated Windows are usually not updated
properly and are no good for the latest
release of Android studio what the
Android studio guys does they try to
make sure that whatever the latest
operating system of Windows or Mac or
Linux is they try to make it compatible
with that operating system and if you
are using a pirated system that means
it's outdated some people I have seen
are using Windows 7 that - even pirated
version and are still crying hey my
android studio is not working well it
will not it was not meant to be working
good so make sure you get yourself
proper and original tools I can also
understand that a lot of people cannot
afford to buy additional windows if you
are not able to buy that go ahead get
yourself a bun - or maybe Fedora these
are free operating system and if you
cannot afford something that means
probably you are not in a strong need of
that so get rid of that and install an
Ubuntu Android studio works like
flawless on Ubuntu as well just recently
like two or three days ago a student has
completed a course on learn code online
he was using totally on Ubuntu and has
pushed like insane amount of apps eight
apps within just two months on Google
Play Store I really do appreciate him
moving on to our third tip which is too
much of Java will not take you anywhere
now yes I am aware totally aware of the
situation that Android is totally
designed and just works on Java yes
there is Cortland as well there is react
native as well but let's talk about the
majority of people and what they
understand and what they see they they
always try to learn Java like an insane
amount of Java let me be honest with you
too much of the Java is not gonna make
you an Android developer yes although we
do all understand that Android all of
the code is mostly written in Java and
Java is used in designing of all those
apps but still I have seen a lot of
people just learning Java and Java and
Java if you are gonna be staying with
Java forever you are not going to be
learning Android if you are comfortable
with like loops
functions classes objects and a couple
of stuff like that you are completely
ready to move into Android working with
Android and working with Java are
completely two different things although
they are interchangeably used but they
are completely different things there
are a lot of things a lot of ways that
you do in the Android or like Android
ish thing and you learn them in the
Android itself you don't learn them in
Java especially the GPS thing and like
card things these are all being done in
Android itself they have no relation
with Java so don't just hang around too
much with Java if you want to become
Android developer yes by the way Java is
awesome
you can always stuck around for it like
forever but if your goal is want to
becoming an Android developer make sure
you switch from Java to Android as
quickly as possible yes many of your
solution in fact all of your solutions
will be there available in Java and
you'll be implementing them in Android
yet I am fully confident that if you
understand loop function classes you'll
be able to understand that code and do
all of your Android ish thing in Android
so again don't just start too much for
Java you are completely ready get that
confidence and take my words you are
ready to move into Android get yourself
a favor and move into Android right now
tip number four version one is bad in
fact if you have been watching videos on
this channel these are like the entire
building block of this channel and
everything what I do version one is
gonna be bad but it is the most
important thing now as soon as you learn
Android your first goal should be
reaching to the Google Play Store your
app might be a little bit crappy
literally crappy it can be a simple
calculator maybe just a button on which
you tap and changes a background but
reaching it onto an actual device as
well as onto the Google Play Store it
really gives you a lot of confidence and
again your friends or your families
might be saying that hey this is a
crappy app I don't like it but this is
super important for you if you want to
learn or work on anything any particular
app you have to spend a lot of time on
it it's not like that within two days or
a month you're gonna be extreme in that
you have to spend a lot of time with
that app work on it to enhance it
feature to enhance its like
compatibility it's working its speed and
everything but again the most important
part
version 1 if there is not gonna be
version 1 what you will be working on so
make sure you have a version 1 to a
convent now usually what the big nurse
does and there is nothing wrong in that
they try to learn and explore a variety
of options that they can found in
Android now sticking with just one app
calling it as version 1 and doing
everything in that app is not as
fruitful for this big nurse specially
the big nurse although I really advise
you to go ahead and explore and create
variety of apps some apps might be using
camera audio some of them might be using
GPS or maybe firebase or something like
that
so make sure you explore a variety of
option as a big nerd once you have
understood all the aspect of majority of
features like shake feature or maybe
animation or maybe firebase then you can
move on and design your very first mega
scale app if you really want to wish to
do so number 5 is getting out of spoon
feeding this is the most important and
actually this is the eventual part where
you get out of your comfort zone now you
might be learning Android from an online
course from a book or from any offline
store now whenever the instructor is
going to teach you something he's gonna
give you all the assignments and
everything you do those assignment you
follow the instructor and that's awesome
that's amazing but whatever the app that
instructor is teaching you whether
that's me or any other instructor it's
not gonna be flawless there will be
flaws in the app of that instructor
because that half was made for teaching
purposes these are not the apps like
learned code online that needs to be go
in the production in the hands of
hundred and thousands of people so these
app will be flawed a little bit your job
is to learn how you can make those apps
better in fact your job is to craft and
design up and create your own idea and
make that app as flawless as possible
nobody can teach you this thing in any
course any book or maybe any offline
boot camps as well this is the thing
that you have to come up by yourself and
this is known as getting rid of
spoon-feeding
yes instructor is doing best and
teaching you everything but he cannot
teach you everything no book no course
or no boot camp can
and in fact this is the truth the app
that you really want to wish this is
your creativity in your amazing head so
make sure you understand this there is
no book there is no stack or flow that
can actually give you the exact code
that you're looking up to implement you
have to pick up pieces from Stack
Overflow from experience from instructor
and have to assemble them on your own to
make your dream app this is super
important when you will be working for
the Android app maybe you are an
entrepreneur and want to design your own
idea maybe you want to work for a
company or maybe you want to work as a
freelancer whatever that case is there
will be time when you will be completely
onto your own there will be not much
help on the Stack Overflow there will be
not much help on any instructor or any
book this is not an I'm not saying this
to just scare you out I am saying you
that as early and as quickly you get the
habit of solving on your own problem
this is really good thing that you can
do this doesn't means I'm saying you
cannot post your questions in my courses
or any other instructor courses whatever
you are learning that goes for
everywhere just try to explore once onto
your own asking for help is always good
and this is the reason why Stack
Overflow is just humongous and
everybody's asking help for there but
yes again do understand that the exact
thing that you really want to do is not
available anywhere on any course so make
sure you get out of the habit of
spoon-feeding
and try to do a little bit on to your
own so these are the five tips that I
wanted to give you to make sure that you
become better Android developer I want
to say best of luck and I really wish
that as quickly as possible your app
reaches to the Google Play Store that
would be an amazing moment for you as
well as for me as well that's it for
