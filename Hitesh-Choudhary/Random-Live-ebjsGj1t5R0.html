especially about cameras and stuff I'm
enjoying it a lot but yes this is a
random what's the day today I have
absolutely no idea what's the date today
what we call it Sunday night no
absolutely not what what we're gonna

of course
hey Divya hey Suraj Gaurav start up info
nice name there hi Paige how's the Canon
a TD okay I'm still in a love off with
my other camera there in fact you know
what I'm trying to push myself with this
Nikon guy quite a lot in the photos
because if I can do really good an
amazing job with this kind of a mediocre
kind of camera I would be rocking and
killing it with 70d and a TD so that's
why I am doing it okay let's pick up
more questions okay Wow coming for life
yes it was a random decision and I just
I was by the way making a few notes for
the tomorrow's class I do take classes
it's these are all four machine learning
and all I usually take my notes with a
small device you might be aware of the
yeah so a lot of hatred for this guy
well it's actually amazing with the iPad
I like it let me know in the comment
section if anybody is using the devices
by the way I use insane amount of
devices here okay so love you love you
all of you guys who - take my name's hey
little - hey Samir Bangalore you know
what my second time Bangalore trip got
canceled
really not happy about it but yeah I'm
happy that my other trips are going on
actually I'm busy with a couple of visas
I I need to take a lot of Beezus I do
travel a lot so yep it's winters it's
winters it's already winters in India
the place where I stay in India is
actually extremists it's not extremists
like other extreme is its extreme and
temperature it sees like 50 degrees
Celsius in summer heavy rain and heavy
winters its Jaipur yes I am in Jaipur I
will be staying in Jaipur till and not
tomorrow I will not be in jeopardy
morrow but I'll be back by evening so
quick flight to catch up tomorrow okay
so Jeff per meter because I'm planning
but tomorrow is again my flights
tomorrow morning and I'll be back here
so hello from Kolkata hey nice thank you
so much from Kolkata I have visited
Kolkata once I haven't seen much there I
would like to come there again ah yes
you are also from Rajasthan that Canon
or Nikon any given day I'll choose
cannon just like any given day I'll
choose a MacBook yeah I get a lot of
hate for that but hey it's it's my
choice you asked for it okay a lot of
questions are coming first of all I
always want to say that thank you so
much all of you you people are great and
I feel myself really lucky that I'm able
to change life of at least a hundred
thousand people here who are now
focusing more who are learning more some
some of you have started to go swimming
just by well I just say that I I do swim
and a lot of people started swimming
that's when I realize
that hey my words actually do matter a
lot I'm really happy that I'm able to
change life a lot of people I have never
said that hey my courses are only by my
courses I've always told you everyone of
you just keep learning no matter where
you learn from my courses maybe you
don't like it it's again personal
preferences but don't forget you have to
keep learning probably you don't like
even me that's okay that's totally okay
but make sure you keep on learning you
keep on going so really I'm happy to be
such a place here so uh keep achieving
your goals yes I am about to achieve
well the very big goal in my life and it
is going to happen in December hopefully
I cannot reveal the plans right now but
it's it's one of the big goal that I
always wanted to do so it's gonna happen
in December you're going to see sudden
changes in the things here it's not
going to be very educational friendly
kind of stuff in the December just to
give you a heads up I don't work much in
December it's like a party time for me
so yeah come to Pakistan yes I have been
invited to Pakistan a couple of number
of times I may think upon it maybe later
on right now it's busy stuff so
definitely okay looking smart
thank you brother hope you are doing
well with your ATD very live in Jaipur
come to Chandigarh hey I happy to
Chandigarh twice not thrice or maybe
four times I have been to chanting at
four times
I love the path absolute place I love
the barbecue nation at Chandigarh
people eat quite a lot agenda here I
loved it I loved it plus I have seen a
card and then probably there are a lot
of photos on my Facebook account of
Chandigarh I love that place hello from
jodhpur by the way I know a lot about
Jaipur I am in the Harley Davidson
family so our one of the family parties
in the jodhpur for Harley Davidson so
yes
okay this is Prakash love from Chennai
your suseelan pic looks awesome your
pics like twin brother epic yeah that
was a very old pig when I was in
I actually moved from Paris to sister
than at that time I went to one of the
beautiful town Engelberg
I still miss it it was amazing I stayed
there for a couple of days I enjoyed it
thoroughly so yeah that was amazing
okay so please come to Bangladesh
probably very soon if there are good
invites from there I'll surely come up
there
I think feeling cool in Jaipur yes it's
absolutely cold here you have no idea
how windy and how cold it is just a
sight up just a sight if all the people
who are travel freaks like me if you're
looking forward to plan to visit Chapel
I think this is the perfect time until
Jen
because it's cold I'll be prepared for
that I just give you a heads up there
but again it is the most perfect time to
visit Japanese very touristy extreme
amount of tourists come up a lot of my
friends also come up they stay at my
home a lot of other people as well so
it's a perfect time hello from Germany
coding in flow
hello from India as well as of now I'm
in India so hello from India okay come
to Patna yes definitely I would love to
visited I have a lot of college friends
from Patna I would love to visit them
again I can I know something about your
course of course you can always ask
these questions no problem where do you
live in Jaipur I don't like social
visits at my personal home so probably
jeopardize okay go ah yes just to tell
you how big I'm a fan of Goa I have
traveled quite a lot in the world but
still I would say there is the holiday
destination anywhere in the world it's
go up especially the northern beaches if
you go up there like which is like
arambol beach and i forgot the name more
jim beach these are the perfect location
I ever whenever I feel like it's going
too much I just take a flight and go to
go up okay
will you come to Kashmir sir I have
visited Kashmir as well but yeah I would
love to what about Mumbai last time I
was in Mumbai and IIT Bombay there was a
serious chaos I almost met mr. laughs my
flight
I hope Mumbai gets better there now okay
please tell me I should go for gate or
job
I am CSC 30 if you are looking for a
gate go fully for it don't look for any
other else thing if you want to go for a
job
don't look for gate just decide one flip
a coin and decide it that's all okay
okay come to a lure for Messiah itself
okay is it photo friendly because I'm
focusing a lot on photos so if it is
I'll shortly track about it because all
of it is like what a couple of hours
drive from Jaipur I probably can come
can you come to money pal sometime money
pal university or money pal there long
way you know just there I love your
teaching style thank you so much I'm
trying to improve it I'm trying to get
you more on to the iPad because I teach
awesome on my iPad because there are
some concepts and things that need to be
taught I like for example Tower of Hanoi
or some of the cryptography concept
these can be explained a lot better when
you have a computer at the same time so
that you can write the code as well as
this guy so that I can explain the
concept at the same time apart from this
I'm not a big fan of this but again it's
good it's awesome ok multiple university
Karnataka surely I can come but not in
December and January these are already
booked hello from how am i healthy Apple
awesome I you know what I have been in
Jaipur for so long so long and still
haven't visited how am L from inside
that's bad actually I should do that ok
more course on Python yeah Python is
going to be the next course that is
going to release her but right now so
much of the things are going on it's
good Plus on top of that I am learning
something on my person and where as well
it's not related to programming it but
it feels me really good so that is why
I'm also learning it I will reveal that
very soon along with some free surprises
for everybody whatever
I will dedicate it like entirely free
for the community so I'm focusing on
that a little bit okay
how does preparation for jobs differ
from preparation for higher studies for
a computer science student I would say a
lot a lot a lot because for the higher
studies you have to go for it either
LTS or TOEFL or something like that or
maybe gate and for the job interviews
they are more of a code oriented that's
it but for the higher studies it
involves like previous studies things
physics and your EC and a lot of stuff
so yes it's it's different thing okay is
testing have jobs in future of course
testing can never go out of the way
whether it's a normal testing using
selenium or a PM or whether it's a pen
testing it's always going to be secure
as long as people are creating stuff it
need to be tested out please come to
Japan I really wish this is for in one
of my to-do list please be in contact
with me I am looking forward so that
somebody can host me there I know
somebody there before coming to Japan
this is like Mount Fuji is like I really
want to see that so but there is always
kind of a very special time when you
want to visit Japan I'm waiting for that
blooming season so like it looks
beautiful there so definitely Japan is
in one of my list not in this year but
yes definitely
okay so let's pick up more questions
okay sir what is the technical Dave G
yeah logo looks similar here logo looks
familiar to me what is the best play in
Kolkata to learn program oh I have no
idea about that why don't you learn
online or buy some book save some time
okay
can you illustrate on bars actually is
farce is like an alternative for
firebase in fact when I once started
working on the firebase I actually just
after doing one project I moved into the
parse and honestly I loved parse quite a
lot in fact at the initial phase I loved
a little bit more than this firebase
concert but the moment firebase got
actually this are real time database it
just overshadowed the parse it's exactly
same you can host your power server on
to Amazon it's pretty easy to do so
it's like maintaining everything on your
own or your it's your own database you
have to be responsible for that for its
downtime for its uptime you want to
customize any rule you want to add any
functionality it's totally going to be
on your own just onto a site note parse
doesn't means that you have to write
anything and everything onto your you
just need to download it push it on to
your Amazon AWS or wherever your server
is and that's it
that's it it can be run like that so
it's kind of a native for that and yes
all the features like database
authentication google sign up Facebook's
on our github sign up all of these
things can be done in there as well as
easily as in firebase okay me too never
visited how am L still live close to it
yeah that's kind of it yeah poorest
thing we live here still heaven I have
seen rest of the other places but have
never seen that I don't I don't able to
see your demo course video you can check
out I'll probably I know there is one
course in which there is no free videos
available I'll fix that in a minute I'll
do that
ok so let's pick up will there be Ruby
on Rails course just to give you an idea
yes I do work on Ruby on Rails quite a
lot those people who are technically
geeky and I'll and are on learn code
online must be already aware with that
not right now right now the focus is on
something else
so Ruby on Rails is not on the next
to-do list uh but yes that will be what
what's the opportunity for front-end
developer in foreign countries like
startup hub Israel poor Israel ish
country I don't know anything about that
much but yes front-end developers always
have good opportunities every single
where so I think Israel should be the
case I have never been to Israel and I
no good friends there as well so
probably I don't have much idea about it
okay
a lot of people came up and I really
liked and appreciate that hey you can
give it a thumbs up so that I can see
you're still here make video for
interview yeah I'm trying to make more
videos for you guys so that you can see
them okay
please help and add C++ yes because I'm
not adding right now the C++ curves
because I want to add C++ course along
with ns3
which is really heavily demanded topic
my previous series on NS 3 was bought by
someone so I cannot release the entire
series now all the copyrights that I had
were being given to him right now I sold
it actually honestly so I'll make
another one very soon and not right now
but yes C++ will be very advanced and
will include an s3 and stuff like that
is all of your courses teaching by you
know there is one course that is not
being taught by me and there is a
separate batch their online code online
which says instructor so if there is my
photo with instructor there that's my
courses but the other courses are also
awesome so go ahead check check out
those free videos they are also very
awesome courses ok sir will I buy
macbook pro 13 inch with touch bar or 15
inch for software and you don't need
touch bar actually it's just kind of
mediocre thing but if you can afford
definitely go for it if you can have
that but touch bar is not so important I
would recommend 15 inch or if you are
buying 13 inch go ahead by 13 inch and
buy a separate monitor as well
personally this is my personal thing I
like big things okay so big monitor
should be there code phone should be
that big so I can easily see that
probably one of the reason I like the
big is I don't have glasses
notice that no glasses and probably this
is the reason why I don't have glasses
yet I like things to be big my phones
are always scaled up to the large code
and everything so I don't like to work
on
much of the screen I like things to with
big wood has a lot of space so go ahead
go big okay
shout out my name of Arun Gore murdered
gore Varun Gore so there we go I tried
to shout out your name okay
please visit J CRC University chap or I
can visit if they invite me like first
of all invitation and probably in this
month only because a December is packed
there is no more dates free in December
and January so you know okay so is it
okay to ethical hacking along with BTech
yes of course if you are not gonna do in
the BTech then you're gonna do it okay
it's learning Swift a good option if
your goal is to go into iOS world of
apps and extra apps of Apple again then
it's a good option and in fact this is
the only option you have okay
angular or react native I'll go for
react native I'm a big fan of react
native machine learning versus Android
development completely separate paths no
comparison at all both are amazing
please help us to start in back-end you
can start with my react.js course it's
amazing you can also start with PHP in
case you notice one of the in the
previous video I mentioned that one of
the student learned PHP from learned
code online and is now earning like four
hundred dollars per month that's amazing
for the start so I am from Sri Lanka I
love your videos please come to Sri
Lanka yes I I really want to come there
but it's very nearby I will come at
maybe drop out maybe in a day right now
I have a plan to go very very far from
India in the upcoming months can we
integrate payment gateway interface in
react native app of course of course
there is no big deal almost all of the
payment gateway are do support them
stripe and PayPal like default no big
deal just go like that paper than stripe
will be super easy to integrate if you
are looking for a country based specific
payment gateway then I cannot say
because these are different from India
for Pakistan for us
for UK for US UK PayPal and stripe just
works fine but for India it's a tricky
situation okay it's learning Swift a
good option yes visit Assam yes I want
to visit it I want to visit a lot should
we fear Facebook shutting down react.js
if it does then what are the
consequences no you should not be facing
for that
yes Darwin at first I was little bit
prickly about it that if if Facebook
shuts down the react what is going to
happen it's not going to be shut down
just like a parse is not being shut down
they just made it open source and say
that we are not going to work on it but
that's not going to be case for react
and react native as well the reason
being is their own app Facebook
Instagram and a lot of part of their
other apps like groups is now on react
native so continuous development needs
to be there there's no chance that
Facebook is shutting down an upcoming
like five or ten years at least but we
cannot say oh man Android I'm right here
but again there should be no worries at
all it is going to be staying here okay
so react and react native nobody's at
all
Kanchipuram yeah that's a nice place
sir volley or retrofit volley yeah
that's easy but yes retrofit is actually
much more fast I would prefer it on
protection but for teaching volley is
much more awesome it's easy okay iOS app
designing only programmatically using
storyboard is it good practice or not
please tell how company is gonna do it
this is a really common question and a
lot of people want to know that
designing with storyboard or without
storyboard is ditching the storyboard
good practice or not okay this is a
tricky question because it's not one
thing suits for everybody okay I have
seen a lot of people who are great
developers still are working on
storyboard it's a little bit tricky
thing to work on storyboard totally but
still I have seen a lot of people does
that now teaching the storyboard makes
only sense when you have like more than
eight storyboards
then
and yes most of the apps can be designed
like in just four or five storyboard if
you design it like properly but yes us
it's a little bit slow yes I will agree
on that that working on the storyboard
is little bit slower and little bit
tricky as well while working everything
on the code is little bit easier it's
kind of a tricky question I cannot give
you that this is good this is bad it's
not like that it's a personal preference
first of all and depends on the project
scale of course it's a big scale project
and of course there's no choice you will
be going without storyboard I absolutely
hate that but sometimes you don't have
option and apps like obviously like
linen code online and all these apps
they can be designed in a few
storyboards so I would be working on a
storyboard for that but yes a lot of
people prefer to ditch the storyboard
okay so let's pick up more questions
it's being long we haven't done that
from IIT Madras like your video thank
you so much mr. Paul I appreciate that
you are enjoying them IBM Watson not a
much topic to be discussed your expert
favorite language there's no such
favorite each language the moment I get
paid for a language I love it I love it
so I don't have any love for any
programming language I have love for
products the product that I'm Stan I'm
standing by I'm learning for that I'm
making them I love that and of course no
one language is gonna make you like at
the top of the bar just imagine if I
would have just loved the iOS only and
would have iOS app only for land code
online you probably wouldn't have loved
it so of course it's a market demand
that you should be proficient in
multiple language it's not like in olden
days it used to be like just learn one
language and that's it no chances are
high that even if you are doing a
startup or maybe you are doing your
product or anything you need a couple of
language at least couple of language so
no less than that okay oh let's pick up
a couple of fish uh you missing
something
FB uh no I don't miss FB much I enjoy
YouTube then the face we could smoke
creative I love it
case it's a random life here and a lot
of people might be watching this at
later on and say hey if they chose live
didn't informed us on Facebook or
anywhere else but yeah I just wanted to
see you guys that's why I came here just
a event welcome to the live chat
okay so firebase versus gluon I haven't
tried much on to the glue on there is by
the way there is one more like rapid IO
but yes glue on is now getting a little
bit high but firebase is far more
awesome by the way just want to say
officially unofficially I have worked
with firebase team so little bit by just
like that but yes it is worth everything
it's it's worth like that please visit
you tu University that's nice name ut
you where is that part of me okay lenovo
laptops buy or not what's your
experience I have good experience with
lenovo laptops no problem at all did you
ever work in do well no I haven't worked
officially at Google campus but I have
worked in team as an external tester or
some product beta tester with Google no
I haven't been officially like having a
desk at their campus I wouldn't like to
even I would not be going there okay
uh a lot of people are inviting me there
University yes definitely but yeah some
plans are I am free for this month only
and it's almost gone it's 25 already but
yeah I can only visit universities in
this month only
okay sorry your inspiration thank you so
much thank you so much for the love to
what extent is web scraping legal sir
okay that is an interesting question
okay let me tell you first if you are
just picking up like one element max
that may be allowed or maybe not allowed
depends on what kind of website you are
having and what kind of things are
allowed if it's a third-party website
you should not be doing it scraping is
not at all allowed even minimum if that
website is allowing you either
we'll give you like permission and email
or we'll be sending an AP is to use
scraping is not allowed it's unnecessary
load on the server nobody likes it
API is a different case so instead of
scrapping you should be looking up for
you should be looking up for AP is just
onto a site reminder if your website is
having if your app iOS app is having web
scrapping it may get thrown out of there
android may also block your account if
you are doing your web scrapping okay so
please don't do that
legal issues you know they are really
bad okay let's pick up more questions
there are a lot of coming up my name
Manish Finnish I am a big fan your name
is Manish Manish next that's like two
times just one name it's like a deja
dish but ok it's your name not making
fun of it ok ok so what happened to
Punjab visit yeah I actually canceled it
because it was too much hectic for me
the reason why I cancel the Punjab visit
because it was like Jaipur to Delhi then
Delhi - um Ritz Amritsar flight than two
hours of travel to that University and
same way back it was like I was getting
wasted like two or three days in travel
just for like 2 hour of talk and yes I'm
not getting paid for that talk obviously
I don't ask even for the money for these
kinds of talks but yes spending this
much of amount of time I cannot afford
that I have a lot of other work to do so
really sorry probably I would love to
visit it later on somewhere I would like
to spend there maybe later on ok ok
please make video on testing yes testing
is planned out and got delayed due to
some unavoidable reasons why it will
come up very soon ok
machine learning in android is it
possible in Android studio there was a
plan of Google of launching a module for
machine learning I don't know why they
are delaying it so much I'll ask a
couple of my links why they are delaying
it there is like a machine learning
module being coming up for
the Android I'll ask my friends that why
this is being delayed although I'm no
authority to ask it but I'll just ask in
like friends which book you read that's
an interesting question I can probably
make a video on this maybe tomorrow
ok that's an interesting question
Kolkata a lot of invitations are coming
up from Kolkata suddenly like my channel
is going popular in Kolkata so just like
that okay so I need to get back to study
you know I have to study for my
tomorrow's lesson by the way I teach
students personally as well for some of
the universities so yes I have to
prepare for them tomorrow's a game class
for them let's just say bye to everybody
right now and I will try to be more
consistent with the videos but again
since I'm not that much consistent you
can hit that bad like and if you wish
you know every youtuber just say press
the subscribe that's the play I can so
that you can get update you can get my
update very first not like that if you
just want to hit that
go ahead hit that if you don't want to
hit that that's okay fine trigger
already connected with me so that's it
for this video
come on let's just say bye bye goodnight
get back to work
and all of these things you can also go
back to learning I know you are not
gonna be sleeping right now it's still
early the night is young it's more
coders get back to code and I'll also do
the same but I keep enjoying and keep
learning guys catch you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
