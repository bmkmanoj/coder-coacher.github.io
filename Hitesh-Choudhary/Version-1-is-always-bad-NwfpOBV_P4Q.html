with another video in this video I want
to talk about version one version one is
always bad no it's not just bad it's
terrible it's the worst thing in the
market or even it's your worst work but
version one is super important because
without version one we cannot have
version two
so hey hit H what this all jargon is all
about this is super important jargon and
let me explain that in a bit detail
I have seen a lot of students that have
their potential work lying in their
hard-disk in their laptops in their
desktop they are really afraid to roll
out that version to public because maybe
the color scheme is not so good because
maybe the font selection is not so good
or maybe even the project is not so
expressive it's not so good whatever may
be the case and they never roll out the
version one now this is one of the
terrible mistake they always do now
version one is always bad let me give
you a few example imagine the website
facebook.com imagine the version one
will you even sign up on such a website
probably not in 2017 but if that version
one wouldn't have been rolled out at
that earlier point of time you would
have seen the facebook.com/ what right
now it is so it is very important to
roll out the version one even if I just
say an example of youtube.com simply
imagine my first video it was terrible
it was bad bad audio bad camera setup
bad background everything was terrible
about it but if that version one
wouldn't have come out probably this
channel wouldn't have survived so it is
really important to roll out that
version one you will face a lot of
problems you will face a lot of
criticism lot of trolls rock a lot of
bad people saying that hey you should
start doing whatever you are doing
but don't get stopped because that is
your version one it is bad it is it was
made to be bad it it is it's a destiny
to be bad because it's a version one and
as soon as we will progress in that
particular word you will roll out more
versions version to version 5 version 10
version 20 you will eventually get
better but it is super important
to roll out that version one without
hesitation so maybe you are learning web
development just buy a domain by hosting
yes a little bit investment is necessary
and whatever the website web pages you
are creating
just roll them out make sure people is
aware of your words whether it might be
a terrible work but eventually you will
grow up if you are making some Android
apps or iOS app just roll them out maybe
just create an apk upload it on your
website or at least make sure that
project reaches to some of the portfolio
sites like github or bitbucket make sure
it reaches to the public and I'm pretty
sure let me give you a straightforward
warning people will not like it
people will criticize it but those
people who don't stop at that point are
the leaders of tomorrow so don't get
disheartened make sure your version one
reaches out to the public and before I
start ranting quite a lot about it don't
worry don't be hesitate whatever you are
working keep on working and make sure
everybody including me sees out that
version one hose-down link in the
comment section below and I will
definitely check out what is your
version one of the product okay and I'll
