this is a late night thought vlog kind
of a thought blog that I'm doing in here
so don't expect that intro video going
to come up anytime soon because this is
something important that I want to
discuss with all of you because I
receive a lot of emails with people that
says I am internetworking job and I want
to switch into programming or maybe I'm
into programming I want to switch into
information security or contesting
domains or anything but since I'm having
a stable job I'm not able to do so I get
a lot of emails about students saying
that hey I want to learn that technology
but I'm not getting good resources or
maybe Android will be good or iOS will
be good or maybe that will be good or
not will I be getting a job in there but
will I be getting a job in pentesting
let me make this thing clear in here now
you are in your twenties maybe maybe
early 20s mid 20s or late twenties or
maybe early thirties at all now trust me
this is not the perfect time to worry
about job or anything now you might be
saying hey this is wrong because this is
the time when you get started with the
job no this is not actually what I want
to say in here this is the perfect time
to stop worrying about anything and just
move fast and learn anything that you
want to learn you want to get started
with Android don't think twice just get
started with that
forget about opportunities forget about
jobs forget about anything you want to
learn it you are passionate about it
just get started with that you are
interested in information security don't
worry about the people who are saying
hey hackers don't get job or this is the
wrong profile or if you want to get
started with web development forget
about the people who are saying that
where is old school now it's going to be
mobile and everything forget about those
people you want to learn it just learn
it now because time is just rushing out
and time is one such thing which you
don't get back you can get back your
money but you don't get your time back
and trust me this is super important
once you will be in your forties or your
50s you won't be able to switch onto
technology
that much easily you won't be able to
just change your jobs that much easily
it is the 20s or maybe early 30s the
time when you learn a lot of
technologies you just don't worry about
anything and just get started because
once you will be stuck with there and
everything is going to be going from
there and one more important thing is
get out of your comfort zone because
this is the most super important part
once you have gotten habit of staying
into the comfort zone then things things
will not end up good for you because let
me tell you what I felt about that now I
got started as an information security
expert and I was doing pretty good with
the workshops the project that I got and
it was completely okay for me but then I
thought do I really want to study in the
information security domain because I
have exploded quite a lot and do I
really want to stuck in there and the
answer was I want to explore more I want
to learn more and that got me completely
into back-end development I learned
there I stayed for there for quite a
while and that's what made me head back
in development after that I realized
that hey I want to learn about SEO and
search engine optimization and therefore
it was a booming industry at that time I
switched into that work there for almost
six months for an intern and just like
that they didn't liked it just let the
job car go off there and then at the
same time the mobile technologies were
getting a revolution by the swift's if
got just introduced and I thought this
is the perfect time to jump into the
surf because everybody is having a
ground zero experience there got in
there really performed really well I did
work for a couple of companies as a
contract basis and now those apps are
generating a kind of a thousands of
dollars in here every month so what I'm
saying in here is that don't just stuck
in there get out of your comfort zone
because this is super important now see
my youtube channel if I would have
stayed in my comfort zone and just
programming I wouldn't be interacting
with you guys and on top of that just
watch out my videos they were super
crappy at the first in the beginning
everybody is crappy and now these videos
are making so much better in quality on
top of that I don't have a habit of
staying in one comfort zone if I'll
shoot a video on
that's location and the videos are
looking good I'll move to that location
and if that location looks good and I'll
move to the next location and this is
the new location so I just try to get
into more kind of difficulties that I
can I can possibly face and that's what
makes you a good learner that's what
makes you a good achiever so I won't be
making this too much long in here
because I think you got the point
get out there and do it fast do it
quickly stop making those excuses that
this is bad this is good will it be
having some scope or not the point is
you are passionate about it you want to
do it and that's it that's it that what
it matters so get started now don't
worry about that stop making those
crappy excuses I don't have a laptop I
don't have an internet connection I
don't have good teachers I want to learn
online and all those things are just
excuses you want to do it just get
started with that the world is complete
of the online education I don't say that
by only my courses by whatever the
courses you like whatever the books you
like just do it this is the most
important part and I think that's what
all I wanted to say in this hardly large
I'll make more thought we lost because
sometimes these are important ok I hope
you got it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
