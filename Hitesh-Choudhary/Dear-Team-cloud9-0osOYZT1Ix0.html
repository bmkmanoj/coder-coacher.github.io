and in this video I am talking on behalf
of entire community of global tech
instructor people who are teaching MySQL
Mongo react node.js or Ruby on Rails for
years we had a problem that how we can
get rid of this installation problem and
can directly get started on teaching the
students what the awesome take me teach
and we were able to solve this problem
using the cloud 9 platform it was all
amazing when they got acquired by Amazon
we got really more happy that now we
will be having some of the Amazon
resources and we can make tech better we
can teach better but instead what we got
is we got a barrier of credit-card now
you're asking for students to have a
credit card to make sure that they can
verify their account and then you are
allowing the free tier to be used now I
get that as a business everybody needs
to earn money to survive in the industry
but in the recent forum I I saw that you
are saying that you are doing this in
order to prevent the abuses of the
platform abuses like DDoS or fishing or
something like this now I get that cloud
9 is an amazing platform and can be
abused easily but I think with the
Amazon resources you can do much better
instead of this credit card verification
I know you can come up some solution for
the student and the entire educational
community at least give the students a
free tier probably just one instance for
probably 30 days give them that instance
for the instructor to charge us a little
bit give them like 5 or 6 instants and
do charge them a little bit entire tech
community love cloud 9 it makes
everything so simple and so easy
installation is such a breeze and we
love that thing about it all I'm asking
in this video is think about it think
about the educational community and
bring back the awesome cloud 9 there are
a lot of students who are minor or are
not having credit card this acts as a
big problem to start a cloud 9 instance
and start learning these tech so please
please do listen to me and think about
it of bringing back the awesome previous
old cloud 9 back to all the amazing
global audience who really want to learn
amazing tech so if you are a tech
student or take instructor who teaches
the tech regardless what kind of take
you
teach or where you teach if you are
watching this video please do share it
so that it reaches out to cloud 9 cloud
9 team we all love you please bring back
the awesome cloud 9
without the barrier of credit card
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
