with another video in this video I
really do have an amazing and exciting
news for all of you I am about to host a
variety of competition at this channel
and the prize money for the
competition's have been decided from
8,000 rupees to 12000 rupees and will
vary depending on the difficulty of the
competition the competition will be
about designing a website creating an
awesome Android app or awesome iOS
application a variety of things are
about to come so let's talk more about
them
first and foremost I would like to thank
everybody because because of you this
channel is growing like anything it's
just exploding in the number of
subscribers every single day some of you
asked me that hey your channel is
growing why don't you do some free
giveaways and this will also boost your
channel now here's the thing about the
free giveaways free giveaways are
awesome and people just like it and
people just love it but the problem with
the free giveaways is it attracts a lot
of unwanted users that you want on your
channel I would be really happy with the
only ten thousand subscriber and not
with a million subscribers if those ten
thousand people are interested in
programming I don't want a million
subscriber who just sits around there
and are not even aware of what
programming is I would like to have
people's what interested in programming
and what the free giveaways does it just
attract the people who are interested in
that one particular stuff and that it
they don't want to listen to you they
don't want to just do anything with your
channel they just want the free stuff
there I don't want to do that I would be
really happy with people like you who
are interested in programming and at any
given day can fight over Windows or
Linux I can fight over Android or iris I
would prefer that audience so what I
have decided now that we will be hosting
some competitions the whole wave of this
channel is to make sure that people
learn programming people get started
just right now and want to make
something amazing and awesome people
really need some boost and morale high
up to get started there so we will be
doing a little bit extra here to push
you a little bit and get you started
with programming now depending on the
difficulty of this competition the prize
money is going to vary a lot starting
from 8,000 rupees to 12,000 rupees and
we can even go more based depending on
the people who are taking participation
in the competition and we can even post
a ranking as one two and three depends
on how many people are taking part in
this competition so now you might be
asking hey what is this competition as
we progress we will have different kind
of competition sometimes you will be
asked to design a complete website
sometime you will be asked to design a
half-cooked website and sometime you
will be asked to design an app some
just pure ass sometimes apps based on
some kind of AP is and all these things
the different kind of competition will
come up as of now we are getting started
with web development only the front-end
part of this competition now this
competition will start from a one-month
onward little after one month and this
is a perfect time to get started in this
competition what you'll be doing you
will be asked to design a website for a
corporate and you will be given a
half-cooked template for that already
half of the design is going to be cooked
up and you have to design the rest of
the parts now this will attach a lot of
your skills like how much kind of
sponsor you are using what color schemes
you are using and what are the mistakes
you are doing what are the goods that
you are doing and based on that the best
website which is going to be designed
will receive a award of a check directly
delivered to your home worth rupees
10,000 so I think this is a great
opportunity now you might be asking hey
how can I take part in this competition
taking part in this competition is
really simple just keep on watching this
channel and further instruction will
come up later on but the best part about
this competition is you don't have to be
a learner from my website only a lot of
people might have already assumed that
only people from learn code online will
be allowed to take home to take part in
this competition no it's not like that
learn code online is designed to help
you to support you if you are not having
the skill you can learn the skill there
but this competition is not only for
them this is for everybody and anybody
who really knows how to write a code so
this is really a good point to get
started if you are not having that kind
of skills go ahead at learn code online
dot and take print and developer code as
a getting started point to take part in
these kinds of such competitions now
again as I always say this is not a
competition only for those people
anybody and everybody can take part in
this competition very importantly you
might be asking hey when is this
competition launching up this
competition will take a little bit time
I'll update the more details on this
channel so do hit the subscribe button
and keep getting updated from
channel the decent amount that I have
fixed up is almost one month from now
onwards so that all those people who
really want to take part of print in
this competition and don't have a skill
can start learning right now for the
upcoming competition all those people
who are having the skills but are not
that much brushed up can practice right
now and can get brushed up take it is
what you want to do up in the meantime
you launch the competition now I want
you to share this video on Facebook and
Twitter so that more people can get
aware about the competition the more
people will see this video the mold we
are going to grow on this channel and we
can host more such competition and if
you are a sponsor or if you are a
company who is looking forward to
sponsor this competition or something
like that I would be really happy if you
can drop me an email at this email id
and we can really talk over that all I
want from you is to sponsor something
for the students not for this channel we
are already hosting this with the prize
money if you want to increase something
in the prize money or want to give some
giveaways to the students I would be
really happy to have a little bit
chitchat with you so all you have to do
is share this video as much as possible
so that we can get more support for
hosting these kinds of competitions hey
are you only going to get hosted this
competition for web development no not
at all this is not even a question there
we are not going to suck only around for
web development later on more
competition will come up on apps design
Android app iOS app maybe some Python
Tunes or maybe some node.js and a lot of
different competition will come up based
on number of participation how much we
are doing and how much we are growing
all of these are going to be available
taking part in upcoming competitions I
think this is a perfect time to get
started and start learning there is a
high chance that you can win the
competition and even if you don't win
the competition this is a perfect time
to get started and get to know a little
bit of that that how the project is
being designed how the client asks you
towards this is the perfect time to get
started in your first freelancing
project by the end of this competition I
would also like to try and be out few of
the templates that you have designed a
few of the project that you have tried
to complete and will point out some of
the classical mistake
that almost new bigness to when they
submit their project whether you have
used the choice of colors fonts and
everything this will help you to learn
quite a lot and again as I always say if
there is no version one there cannot be
an improved version too so I highly
recommend everybody to take
participation in this competition in
this upcoming competition and at least
submit that whatever you have designed
it might be an amazing website it might
be for the design but again taking
participation is pinky essential thing
to learn anything this entire
competition is dependent on your support
of participation give this video a
thumbs up and I would really like to see
that how many of you just like the idea
of forcing these kinds of conversations
again I would highly recommend all of
you and request all of you to please
share this video so that it can reach to
more wider audience and we can host
these competition in future as well
right now this is the perfect time to
get started and start learning and
focusing on whatever the technology you
are learning competitions are coming up
for a variety of different domains and
whatever you are going to spend on the
money on learning those skills it's
probably a great chance to get all of
that money back like what you're
spending on learning something you can
get to a more than that again the people
who are going to win the competition are
not only going to get just the check of
ten thousand rupees they are going to
get a lot more maybe some access to the
courses maybe some free giveaways like
t-shirts and of course the letter of
recommendation by a company is always
going to be there so there is a lot of
things that we have planned up and the
things may get improved a lot depending
on what you're thinking right now and do
you share this video or give it a thumbs
up depends on that in case you are new

video is amazing and awesome do hit the
