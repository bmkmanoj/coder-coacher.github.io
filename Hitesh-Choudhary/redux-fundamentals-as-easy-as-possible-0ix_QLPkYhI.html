programming channel in here now this
video has a specific goal in here the
goal is really simple to make sure that
you understand perfectly about the redux
by the end of this video yes that's the
only goal we have in here and really
honestly in here I promise you that if
you'll stick around you'll watch the
video till the end every concept of the
redux will be perfectly clear to you
that's my promise in here okay so stick
it out
now let's jump into that and there are a
couple of prerequisite that I really
want you to have now one thing that I'll
be doing all the redux in itself is a
separate topic but it works really
seamlessly with the react and react
native that's why I'll be using react as
our base ground in here so I have
created a bare minimum react tab by
using Create react app you might have
already heard about it in the official
documentation or if you are into the
core serie then you might have already
heard about it okay so I have created a
bare minimum application which just says
welcome to react nothing else etc is
being done and in the package I have
installed the read acts now how I can
install it it's pretty fairly simple you
can just simply run a command that says
simply like let me just show you how you
can install that I hope many of you
already know that but it's fairly simple
you just have to say npm install and
then it should be Redux and make sure
you save that so you have to just run
this command in the terminal and I'm
pretty sure many of you might be already
aware of it okay so just go ahead do
that in the terminal and I hope we are
ready to rock and roll now moving on to
the further things in the react native
let me just fix that up because we will
need this guy okay so before we move on
into the reactant here now if I'll just
ask you that if you have to rate the
react between one to ten and the rating
one as the easiest one and ten as the
toughest one you'll read the redux
between seven to eight and I don't blame
you for that relax is fairly complex
with the documentation and the stuff but
one thing is promised in here that I
wouldn't be using those block diagrams
because they make things confusing
things like payloads that reducer the
action the complete store although they
are perfect
but they are fairly fairly complex and
as a big nurse they are no good to deal
a bit okay so let's get start in here
and before I jump into the code I would
like to bring up my iPad in here and
would like to talk in general about it
don't worry I promise you I won't be
doing those blog diagrams so I won't be
doing that okay so if you want to learn
about the redux let's get first started
in here and okay so this guy is good
okay so let's go in with Redux okay so
this is a Redux in here now if you want
to make a Redux app or you're you want
to convert your existing app into the
reader which is by the way a good idea
there are actually four steps in
involved in hit okay so just four steps
and you have to follow these steps
exactly as I'm saying with the same kind
of impact that I'm trying to make in
here and you'll be ready to rock and
roll so the step number one is to create
a store okay so that's the step number
one now what is this store now we don't
need to worry about it right now what
store is what we call it what the
terminology is basically you just need
to have a store now if you want to
create a store it requires two pieces of
information from you okay just two piece
of information the first one is reducer
now don't just get in a too much panic
in here because it just determine
lodging and I'll explain you what reduce
reducer is and the second thing it
requires is a state now it in case you
are aware with the react you might be
aware with the state variables and
everything already so state is consider
this as an initial state in here now
step number two the step number one is
over and I'll walk you through with the
code as well and we are going to follow
exactly the same thing and this will
help you okay so the number one thing is
store the second thing is to create this
guy reducer so let me just write it
we need a reducer okay now how we can
create this reducer and first of all
what is this reducer now reducer is an
agent yep the agent that you see in the
mi6 or James Bond it just an agent it
just does whatever you tell it okay and
in order to create a reducer
again you need two things to be done the
first thing is it requires a state which
is again a state is like what's
happening right now okay what is there
what is the situation right now and the
second guy is action so obviously if a
James Bond guy is an action ethic
personality and he needs some action to
be done and he needs to state as well
like what is the current situation and
just deploy me there and I will perform
some action okay that's it that's our
reducer so based on some action given to
it it is going to perform and now let's
come on to the third state now third
state is subscribe now subscribe is not
like a subscribe on the YouTube but I
think you might want to subscribe onto
the channel but again subscribe is not
that subscribe subscribe is something
like getting connected to the base
obviously our James Bond is need some
order from the base like for example
when to send cavalry there or do we need
some gadgets there so all these things
are connected with the base so base
needs to be subscribed to whatever the
activity that James Bond is trying to do
okay and if I will talk about the
programming terminology subscribe just
simply means get the current state okay
that's all that's all about it and see
quickly we have moved on to the step
number four the step number four is to
take action or is also known as dispatch
so what is dispatch now this patch is
like some action is being sent to the
James Bond like for example hey get the
nuclear codes
kill the villain or maybe save the day
or save the girl just like that okay
repeat that quickly because after that
we are going to jump into the code and
you'll see that this is exactly you
might want to have all the time so step
number one is to create a store which
requires two things a reducer and a
state then we need to in the step number
two we need to create a reducer which
requires two thing the state and action
and again reducer is our James Bond and
it requires two things what state
currently it is and what action do we
need to take and the third one is to
subscribe subscribe to the base and in
this case the base is actually the state
and the final one is dispatch
this patch simply means what action you
need to take okay I hope you got that
now I'll be using an analogy up or
analog II whatever you call that analog
II of marvel universe but you can you do
that for anything anything at all now
also I would like to give it a big star
mark in here and this is star mark is
simply because I'm not going into too
much depth of the react now there are a
lot of things involved in the react and
redux as well like for example you never
change your state never mutate your
state or create everything into the
separate file but right now we are here
to understand the concept first we can
break down everything into the separate
file later on okay so now let's go ahead
remove the iPad in here so you won't be
singing to the iPad in here now this is
the bare minimum skeleton of the app
that we have in here I have got a Redux
has happened to be 3.6 but doesn't
really care in that particular case so
first of all I have created a new file
Redux demo dot J's it is completely a
blank file created in the source folder
there we go Redux demo dot J's so let's
write some boilerplate code I need to
see this okay
adjusting a few things okay so now we
are going to need a simple react and we
are also going to need components so
bare minimum skeleton their component
and these are all going to come from
react so that's the step number one now
obviously since we are going to talk
about the Redux and we have imported the
react the Redux in our JSON file we
might want to import that as well and we
are not going to import everything in
that because this is a bare minimum
example in here we are just going to
import create store from here now don't
worry about it what that create store is
we are going to follow exactly there now
you might want to take a screenshot of
the previous movie because we are going
to follow exactly that okay since I have
I don't have a real estate on the screen
to show up the iPad as well that's why
you might want to take a screenshot okay
and this is going to come up from redux
looks pretty damn good and I'm going to
fill it up with the bare minimum class
in here I have stored it in my CSUN
snippet file under my abdomen
you might want to check another video I
have made a special video for that how
to do that okay and we want our redux
demo and there we go looks nice and
again Redux demo and there we go and now
if I just go back in here and write
something like test it should be showing
up in the app dot GS and first of all
let's import hmm we want to import Redux
demo and that's going to coming up from
oops I need to add a dog slash I always
forget the dot slash part in here Redux
demo there we go and in here we are
going to say hey why don't you just
brint Redux demo in here say that and we
got some problem view v is not defined
okay my bad because this needs to be div
you might be wondering why this oops my
bad why this view is actually coming up
because this view is coming up because
this happened to be react native and I
think Dave is going to be good okay I've
saved you I've saved you and why don't
you just reload for me okay
there is not defined okay now they think
sometimes happened and okay my bad you
don't want a capital D okay bear with me
bear with me this is this is important
in here and there we go we have fixed it
now we're not going to be doing anything
in here so let's go into our console log
so that I can explain you everything so
just go to console log and I can just
clear that up okay looks nice okay now
time to step time to follow up
everything and we are going to go inside
the render and there we go we are going
to do everything in here so what is step
number one okay
so just bear with me step one is to
create store so we are going to create
store and that requires two things the
first one is reducer and what it
requires a state okay so there we go
so we are going to do the step number
one is really easily it's just creating
a constant here
this is store now in order to create a
store what you need is already defined
thing that is create store not something
that you might haven't guessed there and
it requires two things the reducer and
the state now alcohol might reduce her
as just reducer okay and right now the
state is actually paste you might want
not want to call this as a piece because
it should usually be an object which
contains a lot of things in here you get
the point and concept of the state
already in the react Coast okay so
that's the step number one create a
store what is the step number two I need
to just okay okay and then the second
part is step two which is to create a
reducer okay we have already used the
reducer so here we might want to just
get a reducer now and the reducer
requires two things it requires a state
and it requires action okay that's good
so what it takes to create a reducer
it's very simple you just have to say
constant reducer this is how you do it
and it's actually basically a function I
could have I could have created a fat
arrow function but that doesn't really
bothering us much and obviously takes
two things the first one is state and
second one is action okay I got that now
what what else we can do
now based on what action is being thrown
it just returns to the state based on
actually something like a command being
given in here and it's going to do and
perform whatever the command is for
example let me give you a simple example
that whatever the type of the action is
for example if I just say that actions
dot type and bear with me this is the
syntax that you have to follow you
cannot do anything it is always dot type
I repeat that again it is always dot
type so if the action type is something
equals to maybe like a tack I'll write
that on all in caps because it's an
attack it's Swedish okay if the action
type is a tack then we might want to
change the state a little
here okay we might want to return
something like I can return actually
anything but I'll bear with me I'll
return a specific thing in here and that
is what action you want to take now
with the action you might see this word
quite a lot which is payload now this
word can be anything this word can be
payload this word can be value this can
be new state this can be Paris this can
be London his you got the point okay so
we are going to just do one thing in
here and I'll walk you through there
would mean here because we are learning
something important in here and what is
the step number three and step three is
we are going to subscribe I hope you
have already subscribed to the channel
in here so how do we subscribe in here
in order to subscribe we just simply say
store dot subscribe there we go done now
but we might want to pass as a callback
function in here you can call a function
in here I would like to get a call that
a function just because I got to remind
that yes we can do that we are going to
log in here that store oops I need to
learn it store I need to learn how to
spell in here so store is now and we are
going to get the new state of the store
okay and that's going to be store dot
get state okay and that's how to get the
state of the store okay I know there are
a lot of step but these steps are all
worth when you're scaling your app okay
so step number three is done okay and
now finally we are back on to the
business step four is to simply dispatch
action okay good now how can we dispatch
the action now notice in here that our
James Bond is in here where is it the
step number one our store is being
created the store is actually what is
the current situation which is piece and
this is our James Bond in here now James
Bond has a function that if the thing
attack is being passed to it he is going
to just do something payload payload is
like a command or
he's going to perform at some simple
command now our base is also connected
now finally we are going to dispatch
some action so how do we do that we are
going to simply say hey just save the
day or maybe something like that
so dispatch okay this is the dispatch
now dispatch usually is an object it can
contain multiple things in here we are
going to just do one thing first one is
always type yep there is no exception
first is always tight okay and our type
is going to be attack now you might be
linking in here that hey this attack is
exactly the same this attack and yes you
are right you are exactly right this is
exactly the same so this is the attack
so we have given it a situation that hey
if the state actually changes from peace
to attack then what you need to do we
need to send some command as well and
that command is known as payload okay
now we are going to say right now that
if the situation is attack then we might
want to deploy one superhero here so our
superhero is going to be Iron Man okay I
know this is a little bit desire but
bear with me and I'm going to save this
and now there are a couple of errors but
bear with me how the things actually
works in here I'll talk you through with
that okay now we are just doing an
action dot payload but we need to do one
more thing in here that if there is no
attack then we are going to simply
return or whatever general state in here
now now although I have told you all
these steps just like that but again
there is one one small point in here to
understand this all of this is perfectly
good perfectly correct but what you
might want to do is just move this step
number to cut that and move it above the
step number one okay say that and let me
just clear up the message and I need to
just do a mistake in here so that it
just automatically reloads and I'll
clear that console and now our step is
attack now as soon as I saved this
notice in here what happens in here I
need to shrink it a little bit okay as
soon as I save this notice now store is
Iron Man okay so what is happening in
here let me just try to explain it in
here by putting one more example and
then I'll walk you through with every
code what is being done in here okay so
let's just say let's just copy this in
here that this is one command if there
is an attack or if there is something
known as green attack then in our
payload we might want to deploy holic
okay so we are going to dispatch an
action that if the type is green attack
then our payload is not going to be Iron
Man that our payload is going to be Hulk
okay notice now it's Hulk but what we
are doing in here we are also managing
our Iron Man is stories in here now
right now this is not the perfect
example let me walk you through what
everything is happening in here because
this is people's perfect example in here
what we have okay so step number one is
create store so we have created a store
using by taking the help of create store
from the redux it requires two things
reducer and piece these is our current
state okay and then we have got a
reducer which is our James Bond which
does whatever it is being told to do
then on to the step number one we create
a reducer and this reducer takes two
things what state is in here and what
action to perform in here now if we say
hey if the action is being if the state
is being changed to attack or maybe two
green attack then we perform a specific
action to be offered in here like for
example we just say hey action dot
payload or action dot payload but in
here we are saying now your payload is
Iron Man
but in the green attack we says your
payload is Hulk and in case there is
nothing being deployed like there is no
attack or anything we are just returning
the state we are returning just the
piece piece is good and we are since we
are subscribed to the store we are
getting all these things output on the
screen because the base should be aware
of what is being thrown on the screen
okay and finally dispatch is like
sending the commands
they're pretty good pretty damn good
okay now there are a few things
associated why people get confused in
the read axis because this thing this
guy this reducer guy needs to go into
it's a separate file in the folder of
reducer and this guy does dispatch needs
to go into a separate folder maybe or
maybe in a separate file at least so
that is why when you have so many file
being linked up it gets a little bit
confusing but this is actually the very
minimal example that I could have thrown
up on the screen ok I hope you got
everything with the redux I know this
was a long tutorial almost 2025 minutes
but this is the most powerful example of
understanding the redux now one thing
that you always have to keep in mind and
remember the four steps or the redux you
will never face any problem but the
important part is that step number two
always comes at the top this is kind of
convenient that every programmer follows
first always create the reducer like
first always create what kind of action
needs to be taken down in here so ok so
that's a convenience in here and I'm
pretty sure whenever you are going to
see now the Redux things it's going to
make much more sense in here ok maybe
maybe I'll create a couple of more
videos on the redux explaining multiple
files how to break down all of these
components into multiple but that is
only going to come up if I'll get enough
requests in the comment section so make
sure you do that and in case you haven't
here subscribe to the channel do
subscribe I make regular videos
sometimes I do travel vlogs as well so
