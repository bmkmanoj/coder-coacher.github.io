is a page and I'm back with another
video now today I don't have any code
video or something talk about the
technical stuff but I have something
inspirational today now yes again it's
related with the technical and the code
otherwise why would I put that on my
channel so what I want to discuss today
is something inspirational now
especially for those people who are
trying to learn code and are making some
excuses like I'm 25 and I have to switch
my job and I'm not making the code or my
college is not teaching me code good
enough and all those excuses because
today I had to talk on the Skype with
the Martin and Martin has been following
up all of my courses for quite a while
now and he on the age of 39 he was
totally into the trade business off a
pub and there he got some issues with
the health and from making a good amount
of money he got completely broke but
that's not all the case at the age of 40
he started to learn to code and just
imagine at the age of the 40 where you
are pretty much scared of doing anything
he didn't got scared and didn't set down
out there instead he thought I'm gonna
fight this and he fought really well and
he started to learn how to code and now
he's making a complete good living just
with the code so this is something
really inspirational because a man who
is doing really fine and on top of that
he faced some of the health issue as and
he is now back in life with the help of
internet coding all that he have learned
so far is from the YouTube and my
courses and this is something amazing
that I was being able to part of such
really great change so if you want to
listen to all the interview directly
from the Martin let's go ahead and talk
directly to the Martin from the Skype so
let's go there
today I have someone special with me
this is Martin here and we'll be having
some casual talk with the Martin and
we'll try to understand how Martin
switched his job from a pub to IT career
and especially especially the point is
his age so he is older than me not much
with this beard you can say but we'll be
trying to learn how martin actually is
doing with his thing where he is he
belongs and what country he's reciting
currently and a thing you know stuff
like that so let's get over to the
Martin so hi Martin hi he Tosh how are
you I'm good how is the weather there
it's actually a really nice very
thankfully and it's rather cold well
it's it's quite nice
usually this this time it gets a little
bit brilliant weather there I have been
in London not didn't why did didn't
stayed much there yeah so where you are
it right now I'm right now I'm in East
Yorkshire open the north east coast in a
place called hull which is one the
European sit are the UK sit here award
of culture which takes place next year
in 2017 I want to do a little bit of a
plug there for us it's not simply
fantastic Suzy I've lived here for 11
years I wouldn't live anywhere else
yeah that's that's great so Martin a few
days back I received a surprising email
there's one student who is taking all of
my courses and he right now works in a
very big company let's not name the
company but he right now works in a very
big company and all he's doing is kind
of a support job just answering the
calls and handling the issues of the
code that can be handled by anyone
almost anyone with a couple of months of
training he wants to switch his career
he's 25 and age but he's afraid that he
is being married and if he'll switch on
to the job it can be little bit
difficult for him that he will not get
stability much income so tell me a
little bit about yourself because I know
you that you have switched from a pub
career into the IT sector
so if you don't mind please a mention
your age when you transition that and
how you did that so please share your
story with us right well I'm 40
a lively starts in the identity sector
this year um as you've mentioned I've
been in the pub trade for 10 15 years if
not longer really I trained as a primary
school teacher I taught for a couple of
years got a little bit bored I was quite
young at the time and I went into the
Bob trade it's kind of all I've really
done for the last number of years I
became ill at the end of December last
year I worked in both business
development management as well as
running my own pub at a pretty well-paid
job I've got a wife and three children
bills to pay like as you say that poor
chap that you've just mentioned just
there and I became ill with my back at
first we thought it was sciatica but it
turned out to be something a little bit
more serious but it meant that my days
of working in the pub trade were over
having been to session what my
physiotherapist who advised me not to be
carrying barrels of beer around and you
know moving heavy stuff so I realized
you know it was 10 15 years of doing the
same kind of job and I knew I had to
make a change I've always had an
interest in IT I suppose it plays a
pretty major part of working in the pod
sector because you know you've got to
yeah a utilise certainly its social
media loss to to advertise you know when
you you've got a limited budget from
your pub company or brewery who don't
want to exactly give you a lot of money
to spend on advertising
you've got to really utilize the
resources that such as you know the
likes of Facebook Twitter Instagram
whatever the case may be okay sorry to
interrupt there Martin but at what age
you thought that you will be doing a
transition at what age did you tried
that um time I was only 39 I was I was
39 and in January of this year I decided
to retrain I can't say enough how much
YouTube has helped me I know people I
mean I've got kids my own there on
YouTube permanently watching gamers and
stuff like that well actually from an
educational point of view there's a loss
out there on youtube if you look in the
right places and pull into the correct
search terms you can actually learn a
lot you really can't any skills I've got
every day's a new day for me learning
and I constantly still watch videos and
tutorials if there's something I don't
know I go and I look it up that there's
always somebody out there on YouTube
that will post a video up on ourselves
39 years of age and that was scary it
really was I went from earning a really
good salary every year to suddenly
having absolutely nothing I'm taking
that risk I didn't have many connections
with regards to potential clients I just
started talking to people I started
networking as much as I possibly could
especially on Facebook and Twitter and
getting my business known out there I
started I've got to be very brutally
honest people say you've got tabakov you
know two or three thousand even more
money to start a business with I started
with a laptop and enough money to be
able to buy my first theme to be able to
use which is Divi which is created by
elegant themes they have recently moved
into a very good transition of library
things they're amazing I personally
would not use anything else and if I can
plug elegant themes in anyway I
certainly well they're the most amazing
company to deal with they're currently
doing a daily video at the moment for
Divi where you can just learn so much I
mean they've got a wonderful support
forum they're constantly they're elegant
themes you know and there's some really
good as well I would classes very good
designers still go on the forum forums
one in particular I know is down Wilson
downs done a number of videos on YouTube
really good tutorials in fact so you do
make website using Divi for other
people's now yes yeah
I use my content management system is
WordPress I would strongly recommend I
mean if you know yourself it hosts 80%
of the world's with websites known you
your times Lady gaga you know I mean the
big names you know it really is so I
wouldn't by the way hey everyone I'll
link down at the Martins website email
in case you want to utilize that his
skills and you you want to someone to
have to make a website if you're looking
for someone with good I know him he's
really a great guy and he is always
gonna be there so in case you want that
I'll put a link in the description below
so that you can contact him thank you
very much very much appreciated thank
you okay so one more thing what kind of
business you are doing now you have just
started a year back and what are the
services you are providing now well
right now is general web design whether
it be just a normal what I call five
page basic web site all the way through
to very intricate ecommerce I cannot
also offer the graphic design again I've
recently started learning Photoshop and
it's amazing again I'm gonna plug a
company called Blue Lightning TV
and Marty Geller the guy that runs that
there's so much that you can learn off
Marty really and truly and just if you
if you are the owner of a website at the
moment and you want to do some updates
you you think you want you you know to
get completely redone then please I'm
your man definitely definitely I am
myself a coder but I don't do business
of the web development i I know so I
know a lot of code here actually I do
all of my websites by my own but still a
lot of people ask me that why don't you
do it for the people but you know I
don't have time of that much to work for
the people so definitely I'll recommend
you for for those guys okay let's move
on to the design part because WordPress
is little bit different I would like to
call it different compared to what hard
coded people like me like to do with the
core HTML and JavaScript stuff let's
move on to the design part so you have
just got started with the Photoshop
completely scratch previously you might
be not having any idea that this kind of
soft software do exist and from there
you're learning it at the age of only
that first of all is remarkable so let's
give give us your plan that
how you get started how you manage your
time that how much amount of day you are
putting it into learning the Photoshop
right I mean a typical day for me starts
at about half-past seven in the morning
I've got children as I say so I'm up
getting children ready for school and us
I'm usually home by about nine o'clock
and I would say the first half hour is
just checking the emails and that and
then I'll spend probably about two or
three hours watching tutorials and
learning more I'm constantly practicing
and using the skills that I'm learning
online by developing myself so that I
then know I'm not just watching videos
but physically hands-on going and doing
stuff cynically exactly sorry for
interruption again all right um but
again I would like to mention to all of
the people out there a lot of people I
have seen there that they buy some
courses they watch some of the YouTube
tutorials it's not gonna make any impact
unless you do it hands-on or so let's
just say you're assigning an app let's
just say you are trying to write exactly
the same code that I'm writing so always
when you watch my videos or anyone else
with you it's not gonna make any impact
unless you practice it by your own
that's the key to learn of course it is
and after that then you know you'll take
a break for lunch and then I go back to
it and I'll start working then because
thankfully I have been very lucky I have
got quite a good number of friends
people who work in business who did need
websites a lot of my work has been
word-of-mouth I've been very very lucky
from that point of view I'm currently
working on this clients website whose am
a singer-songwriter and I'm doing her
website and I will stay up if I have to
want to little 10:11 of carpet night
working I love what I do
in fact I don't just love what I do I'm
passionate about what I do
I'm one of the few people I think that I
know they get up every morning and look
forward to starting work I really really
do I work from home I keep my costs down
all he needs a laptop really at the end
of the day for my job I don't have to go
out and spend money on business rates
electricity utilities etc I've got
everything that I need at home and I'm
at home but with my wife by myself
during the day so you know kids are at
college school whatever the case may be
so you do have a long free time and I do
utilize my time wisely and for that guy
that
thinking about change in the 35 years of
age go ahead and do it it is really
really worth it
I utilized my time I was very ill I
could hardly move at one particular
point last December in January when I
was in quite a lot of pain I didn't sit
in my backside I picked up my laptop and
I started to learn that's really really
key it really is learn learn learn
I cannot it's like the old saying
education education education it's out
there go and learn this because you will
learn that's really interesting in a
very fascinating story because I'm also
into a home business I just like to keep
my caustic just as short as possible
just like you and that's really the
amazing part of the internet that you
just need a laptop and an internet
connection and you can change the entire
world yeah I used to run an online and
offline education business and I used to
teach almost 100 or 150 students and to
be honest right now I'm my registered
students account goes on over a hundred
thousand so that that's Wow crazy for me
and just the leaving aside the YouTube
subscribers which has almost hit 5,000
that's completely a site that's
registered website on my website so you
can just do pretty much anything you
want to learn how to play and I've seen
and I've talked to the people who have
learned guitar who have learned to play
piano from IT business online website
creations app development pretty much
everything is possible with the internet
if you look for the right if you look at
the right place and you just practice it
along isn't it Martin yes of course most
definitely it is there you know don't be
afraid to utilize this I mean YouTube is
an absolutely fantastic tool I really
and truly didn't probably start using
YouTube until about two years ago when I
started listening to music I think a lot
of people probably do watching the
favorite bands of whatever I like Irish
music I'm Irish you know I started
watching some local Irish bands from
back home and YouTube and I just started
looking and you know I was amazed with
some suggestions that were coming up and
when I started to decide to make a
change of industry
I knew that YouTube was the one place
where I could probably start looking I'd
signed up to so many
it's different that's another thing
please be careful what you do when you
decide to go into the IT business or any
business really
you'll get bombarded with people that
will sign you up to very different
newsletters and the loss of them really
are just charlatans and they all all
they wanted to your money it really and
Julie is there's so many scams out there
you know really and truly be careful and
I can't stress all enough because I've
been lucky I haven't paid over anything
to anyone to learn anything I think
you're gonna do that you know it's a
complete and utter waste of time and you
are foolish if you go and pay out money
because there are too many people out
there you can see them put the videos
together they were sitting in this huge
because they've got a big Ferrari parked
outside their you know the swimming
pools the whole lost predominantly its
actors you know but they're sat in a
tiny little office somewhere in the
middle of nowhere you know and all they
want to do is just take your money you
know look out for people like yourself
attached people who know what they're
doing and you do genuinely want to help
others and I've learned a lot from you
as well you know I've taken a number of
your courses I first found you on a
website called Verona's VAR o n is calm
which is an online education course
place and that's where I first found you
and then I started looking a little bit
further to see if I could find out more
I have found you I think it was on
Facebook about maze can you accept my
friend request I really was nothing you
were and traveling around India at the
time on your motorbike yeah definitely
anytime I'm a big fan of for Harley so I
do Drive it quite often I'm even
planning to buy one more so oh my
goodness so the whole idea the point
that I would make like to make to all of
my youtubers are there and people who
are trying to learn online is spend your
money wisely and I would like to make a
point again that people will like to
take your money but you have to find a
variable to spend and where you have to
not spend the money and again you can
learn everything for free but you know
what I always say is that everything is
there on the Internet but there are two
parts always one is a little research
you can find a perfect course in a
perfect book and can go with that
that's always the easiest part but you
have to look for what websites you're
buying like obviously
the websites like lynda.com udemy
Udacity yeah a couple of EDX courses
they are pretty solid a platform where
you want to buy or if you know some
instructor personally then then it's
okay now the second part is also there
which is gonna be time consuming and
research as well but what you'll be
learning there is gonna be completely
different because you'll be learning the
things from directly from the
documentation or just by doing and
learning from a mistake it's not gonna
cost you any money but it's gonna be a
little bit it's gonna take a little bit
time so obviously both part and both
ways are with you you will be the judge
to decide what you need to go with and
what you're not what you don't want to
go with ok agree I can't agree enough
with you on that one you know you really
do have to just go out there shop around
I mean people go and shop online
constantly it's the exact same principle
yep exactly exactly and do take care of
what you subscribe as well because as
Martin said people are gonna bombard you
with the emails and and offers and a lot
of such urgency of the sales but don't
believe that there is no such urgency
and one thing I I would like to add up
on top of the Martin's our words is
don't pie rate anything it it affects a
lot so I have seen that one of my course
which used to be very popular and I
didn't ask much for it just at ten
dollars for the course but that course
got so much pirated on the hair on the
torrent websites it got almost over a
1.5 million downloads and that was a
crazy I got some eyes that that actually
I got a lot of following all over the
globe but I didn't made any money of
that and at one point I was looking to
just shut down the business because I
was not making enough to survive and pay
my bills
so don't pirate anything if the users is
asking if somebody is asking you for
five or $10 or $20 $50 he is putting
that much of the effort behind the
course so and if you if you take some
book make sure you buy that book you
don't look for that book on the torrents
because it's gonna affect the the people
who are behind the books and eventually
that business may shut down because of
your one download it
it may happen so obviously Martin yeha
is using the device so that means he's
paying for the devii and he's supporting
the TV developers if you and obviously
there are options to pirate the themes
and all of that but that's gonna
eventually shut down the device business
and that's that's very hard for them so
make sure that's it make sure if the
person is genuine and he is asking you
for some couple of bucks out there and
make sure that you spend you are
spending on your college education yes
you have spent on your school education
so why not you're spending on your
online education it's it's so much cheap
yeah of course it is yeah I mean as you
say you know the whole pirating thing I
do know people who do is I genuinely do
and I know people who will go in pirate
films to watch you know online new
movies nothing just come out in the
cinema I don't agree with us apart from
looking outside
I love gone to cinema so it's a good
excuse not to go and pirate anything
yeah that's great okay Martin let's
let's enter into your future world as
well what you're planning for next one
year let's just say and the next year
I'd certainly like to improve my my
client base because without saying one
of the things I do actually offer apart
from just web design is I offer
continuing continuing continue and help
basically to people you know so if I get
a client say tomorrow morning they know
that I'm gonna be there you know for the
next ten years if that's what they so
choose do they pay their fee upfront or
whatever you know for the web site for
the graphic design will ever it is that
they want doing but I offer ongoing
support constantly I would like to be
able to because I'm having worked in the
pub trade up customer service is so
important to me it really and truly is
you can be really really good at
designing you can be brilliant at coding
you go and be brilliant at JavaScript
whatever the case may be but if you
don't have the people skills to be able
to know that your client be it's all
about client relationships it really and
truly is I'm building up those
relationships because the better
relationship you've got with your client
the more that they're going to go and
recommend you to other people which I
think probably within the next year I'd
like to I ain't currently a
Martin is really committed to to his
work and I can understand your feeling
uh I also usually work from my home or I
stay in pattern sometime so I do work
from there as well for the companies and
I know the feeling that you don't take
Sundays off because you love your job
and eventually sometimes the health
issues get get up because you are not
going to you are not hitting the gym you
are not taking a walk because you love
you you love your job and computer is
such addiction that you cannot get away
from it anytime okay so let me just get
a little bit personal there I know that
you're married and you are having three
kids
yes that's correct yeah yeah what's the
name of your kids um Holly is 21 she
designs bracelets necklaces it's all
costumed but one-off and jewelry touchy
and creates Dylan's study in musical
technology she's 17 and he lost a whole
college and then Dharma
my youngest she's 10 and she's in her
final year of primary school okay that's
that's lovely a cute family they're
currently relying totally on the
internet and doing their business doing
pretty much great I'm really happy that
somehow I have been able to part of that
change so really that's my motivation
for uploading more videos all right well
that you have honestly because you know
when I see somebody like yourself that
does it for a living you know you've got
you think yourself for what they can do
is what's to stop me you know these
people and I would love to think as well
within the next year as I become more
competent with it with the work that I
do I'd like to start doing tutorials
myself I firmly believe in sharing
knowledge I really do and to be able to
give back to people quit who were at the
same stage as I was six months ago
you know that one to start a business
that want to do you know IIT design or
whatever the case may be but as I'm
learning I want to share that knowledge
as well and that would be one of my one
of my M focuses that I'd like to
I'm completed by the end of the year
that's gonna be really great we can
collaborate on that sometime too because
I believe certainly I believe that the
evolution of human life is certainly
like that he first learns it then he
implements it and at the later phase of
his age he decides that I'm gonna give
it back and he just put his knowledge
there so that's that's the whole human
life yes absolutely absolutely and
definitely it's it's really good that a
guy like Martin who is all he's really
elder to me and he's trying to learn
from me and just like him I'm trying to
learn the SEO s the search engine
optimization and I'm helping my family I
do have a family business as well so I'm
helping my dad in the localization of
SEO or search engine optimization for a
local business and I'm learning it from
a 18 year guy he's pretty good in that
and I do regularly talk to him and I
learned quite a lot so it's not about
the age or anything it's all about how
open-minded you are you are there to
learn yeah absolutely no that's very
very true I don't think educate
education you know it doesn't matter
what age you are it really and truly
doesn't I believe you can learn from
anyone if they know their stuff then you
can certainly learn from them I'm a
fully endorsed sauce yeah I've just
noticed one more thing while I was
learning with him that I knew have one
or two things about the SEO but I
realized that that one or two thing is
making a lot of problem for me so what I
thought that I would be sitting with him
next time but completely open and blank
mind whatever he is gonna say I'm gonna
trust him and I'm gonna go there and
definitely it has produced a greater
result for me so half half of the
knowledge is always dangerous what do
you say about it Martin yes I think it
probably is yeah you are very very true
in in in that in that respect I knew
very little about SEO I have to be
honest very very little in fact I didn't
even know when I see old stood for they
be you know the acronym exactly exactly
I would like to pick one point here from
the Martins words because I learned
exactly the same thing from one of the
professor in the NYU he is he do the
teaching job in NYU he's a brilliant
teacher but he regrets one thing and he
says it out loud
that I'm a very good teacher and I won't
call myself a great teacher those are
exactly his words he he had designed his
own mailing system just like Gmail and
he used that and he even gives that to
the students but he says that I'm not a
good teacher I'm a good at coding and
everything but somehow when I teach the
people I'm not looking at even at the
people I'm just looking for delivering
what I have designed I have no intention
in that that I'm gonna explain these
things in a clear concise manner or in
the layman terms
so yeah that's exactly if you're a
teacher out there I have been doing a
recurring coulomb design for the Texas
University and a couple of universities
in the Australia and they are really
happy now because now their curriculum
is in a simple manner where people are
learning how to code from the first year
of the semester and it's it's a need for
every teacher to understand that you are
there because somebody out there is not
able to figure out the things on his own
so it's your job to make sure that you
explain the things in a very very clear
terms so that he understands that and it
should be fun that's the number one rule
that you should have so absolutely I
can't stress enough ok so Martin let's
get started with the teachers
perspective since you're a teacher and
I'm pretty sure that a lot of audience
including me can learn quite a lot about
the teaching tips so let me just put up
a scenario for there and let me just ask
you how you're going to handle that so
let's just say there there is a student
there and he is willing to learn but
he's asking questions quite often like
every hour or so he's putting up an
email and he is putting a questions and
he's not doing any research of his own
like google searching and all the search
methods so that he can solve this
problem so how you're gonna handle these
kinds of students and what advice you
want to give to these kinds of students
oh it's here that's quite a difficult
one actually I used to teach young kids
and I have come across something like
that it's obviously in fact I used to
teach drama as well - 15 16 year-olds
for a theatre company and it does happen
it really really does happen it can be
very frustrating but it can also be very
rewarding because I think you're
obviously doing a good job if they're
wanting to come and ask you and they'd
obviously take your advice and take
everything on board that you say but at
the same time yes I do understand if
they're not actually you know taking
your advice from the point of view of
use google utilize the tools out there
and have you know attached there are
many many tools you can use and I think
I would be I'd be inclined to point them
in the right direction I certainly
wouldn't ignore them you know because
I'm trying I think your task really is
to encourage them as much as you
possibly can
there are people out there for whatever
reason just don't want to use the tools
out there and I think there are people
out there that you know and I think this
goes back to these videos that you see
online well you know I get these emails
all the time which I'm sure you probably
do in your own jump box where you get
the video saying you know let me make
you I don't know $12,000 by the end of
today you know and you go online and
people that there are people out there
who want a fast book they really do and
they think I don't have to do anything
to make any money but I'm gonna have 12
grand in my pocket by the end of today
hey it doesn't work like that
it'll he doesn't you know and the more
food not gonna happen you know to
somebody that's telling you something
like that but you know and they're about
just using that as a scenario yes but of
course there are people have like that
who wanted all hundreds of them on the
silver place but it's difficult because
I would be encouraging them to go and do
their own research I think in that
scenario yeah definitely encouraging
them I would help them along the way but
I would definitely encourage okay so
that that's quite impressive that's
that's a nice way to handle so as if
you're a teacher already definitely it's
your job to point the students in the
right direction and since you're getting
an email that's that's a proof that
student do trust you and they are very
friendly with you to ask anything that's
that's gonna be number one job for us
and yeah as a student I always teach in
all of my courses that how you can read
the documentation and since I'm talking
about a little bit code part so I teach
them how you can handle the
documentation that's written already
there and how you can handle the stack
overflows we're already there is a forum
where you can look out for your code
problems and everything but again had to
advice to all of the students that yes
there is a resource out there and you
need to do a little bit research before
you shoot that email because the amount
of the time that you are spending in
shooting that email you can spend that
all the time in research and can solve
your problem from the next time so go
ahead check that yeah most definitely I
mean I love research anyway I always
have done you know even when it comes to
buying stuff online you know I like to
shop I like to look around before I
actually you know choose something the
way the end product basically I do like
to do my research I always have done
okay so this has been a lovely
conversation here as here Martin and I
really am impressed by what you have
done with your job what you have done
with your career and how you're keen
interested in learning and I'm pretty
sure that you're gonna hit the business
in the right point and you are pretty
good in the client management as well
the one thing that I really sucked there
but yeah if I'll visit your country or
somewhere I'll definitely would like to
have a coffee with your hand and in case
you visit India definitely do visit my
hometown Jaipur it's a very touristy
place and definitely if you if you visit
