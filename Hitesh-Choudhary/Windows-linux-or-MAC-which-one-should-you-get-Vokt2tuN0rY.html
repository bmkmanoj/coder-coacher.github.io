talks today we didn't discuss a very
controversial topic we're gonna take up
Linux Mac and Windows the topic was
suggested by Anurag Srivastava and I'm
expecting a lot of people making a
chaos' comments out there supporting
some of them will be supporting Windows
you might but actually this is not a
movie about pros and cons of Windows or
Linux or Mac this is moreover a topic
about which one is perfect for your
needs so let's discuss that ok so
another going to the path where we start
a fight and say hey Mac is better hey
Linux is better hey Windows is better
let's not go into that wait is it let's
try to find out which one is good for us
now there is no harm in Windows or Linux
or Mac actually all them are pretty good
but it depends what you want to do and
at what point you want to reach is going
to be dependent heavily on which one you
buy at the very first thing and I'm
expecting you as a beginner not a
professional out there and again if you
are a professional then also it depends
on what you want to do let's start with
that so let's say you want to start with
the coding and that will be a light
front-end or back-end coding nothing
else much on that then feel free to just
explore anything out there you can start
with the Linux if you are comfortable
with that if you can just want to be a
simplified platform then Mac is it good
and simplified platform but again a
little bit overpriced you can also
choose Windows to I have used Windows
for over 6 or 7 years around and I have
pretty much enjoyed it because it's a
very easy platform for a bigness and in
fact whether you hate it or like it you
might have used it it once in a lifetime
so I was doing my front-end and back-end
coding nothing much onto that of course
I was playing games as well but again
this was a pretty light usage and why
did I switched on to Mac because I was
producing videos recording a lot of
lectures out there and the Windows
machines are actually not comfortable
with these video stuffs or edit
photoshop's or some stuff like that
because it produces a lots of heat also
it the fans in the windows are always
and always too noisy and that's was the
reason I need to switch on to a Mac
because it was performing very high on
the videos as well as a little
comfortable platform as compared to
Windows but that was my case so again
your case might be you might be a very
big nerd out there and you just want to
get started with that if you have a
budget I would say go for a Mac because
it's simpler it's easier
let's just let's distract him and things
like that and if you're on a little bit
tight budget don't want to go into the
Mac but again if you are just intuitive
about the Mac hey whether I will be able
to work on it or not just go and buy it
eventually you will learn there is a
learning curve but anyways we can just
learn it it's it's a matter of fact and
if you have a little tight budget I
would say go for Windows but if you're
planning to do something on Photoshop
Illustrator or maybe video production
when you edit things or some heavy users
like that then again don't go for
Windows because the machines are going
to heat quite a lot and them are gonna
perform a little bit slower you might
have played to 16gb of RAM or something
a very fast processor but again heating
is always gonna be issued if it doesn't
bother to you go for that you can just
buy it and again if you are in a very
tight budget you want to just start with
her let's say 1gb of RAM that would be
enough for your day-to-day life purpose
you might be writing just front end
codes and that's completely okay so in
that case you can go with the Linux as
well again there is a very steep
learning curve in the Linux you need to
get friendly with that but once you get
friendly with the Linux there is no
operating system on this planet on which
you cannot work so make sure that Linux
is a good skin now let's come on to the
skill part on one to ten what I will be
rating on the skill that you require on
one to ten I already 11 for the Linux
because definitely you're going to face
a lot of problems especially in the
wireless area your card might not be
supporting your
USB might not be getting supported and
all of these things although the issue
has been resolved in the latest ubuntu
and federal ratios but still there are
some machines with us which are still
fun compatible with that so scale one to
ten I'll rate at eleven on the windows I
would say that I would rate it around
six to seven or somewhat like that if
you are just starting out with that so
Windows is kind of a six to seven there
is a learning curve it's always there
but it's easy and compared to the Mac I
consider this as five some of you might
not get agree with that but ok that's
completely ok
I think that I have used both and if I
would have got started with the Mac it
would be much more easier for me because
these new installation process things
are simpler and it's just one menu bar
at the top for everything it's a little
simpler as compared to the windows ok
that's all about the Linux Mac and
Windows so don't just feel shy that hey
I have a budget I need to get a shiny
machine Mac no compare what you need to
do what requirement you do have let's
say you are a hot code game player of
Call of Duty so buying a Mac is not at
all a good idea for you you might
definitely want to get on to Alienware
or some good stations having machines
out there for a playing the latest Call
of Duty with some good graphic terms of
course and if you say that I want to
work heavily on the videos or write some
good codes
I want a very clean platform money is
not an issue then go for that in case
you want to just try out with that Mac
money Mac Mini is a good option if you
will just want to try out with that
again if you have a very tight budget I
would say spend some time on dozens of
tutorials on the internet and try to
learn out the Linux it's gonna be a very
friendly machine not a power-hungry
machine not a ram hungry machine but of
course there is a learning curve ok so
this was a great topic great discussion
I'm expecting you to please contribute a
little bit by commenting down sharing
the videos with your fellow mates who
can get benefit from these videos ok
with that please don't forget to suggest
the next topic that we need to discuss
don't forget to like share the video and
further for also subscribe to my channel
I really like and I really enjoy to read
each and every comment out there see you
out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
