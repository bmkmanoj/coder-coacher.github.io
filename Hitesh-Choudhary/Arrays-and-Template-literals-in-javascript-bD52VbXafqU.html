code online dot n I hope you're enjoying
this series if yes do visit learn code
online dot in and also notify me as well
so now let's just proceed and try to do
all things now we have learned quite a
lot of things we know how the if and
else works and how these things works
now we can move on and proceed something
on to building a really really small
things or like that okay so we're gonna
create a new file in this basics too and
I'm gonna call this as simply marvels
dot J yes yes I'm a big fan of Marvel's
but yes I do like DC as well especially
in the cartoons
I prefer DC so there we go we're gonna
have a Marvel's list and we're gonna
create a couple of things here so then
now the new things that we are gonna
introduce here can be a little bit
tricky to understand for first but I
highly recommend to re-watch this video
ok first of all did you notice that when
I'm writing here console dot log there
is a special pattern that I'm falling
I'm using a dot notation and then I'm
using a word here and then a pair of
parenthesis now these are known as
functions and we will be talking about
these functions later on how we can
create our own customized function as of
now we will be relying totally and
totally on the functions or methods
being created by already in the
JavaScript ok so that's the one thing so
now we are gonna learn one more data
type which is this is a really common
data type and this is known as array and
these are really the powerful one a lot
of jokes are around in the community
about arrays that yes programmers always
count from zero and all the stuff like
that so yes these are all coming up from
the array very beautiful very amazing to
work with in fact every application that
you see has some sort of array whether
that's your message list your Trello
lists your to-do list or anything at all
it's mostly about arrays lists and all
such things so let's just explore our
first real-world data type which you'll
be using quite a lot and usually for the
arrays we use Const ok and then we are
gonna go for let's just call this as
super-heroes there we go so we have a
list of superheroes now so far what we
have been doing we have been doing
something like this like we want to
declare anything we just say let one is
gonna be equal to one and then let two
or something like that two is gonna be
equal to two something like that now we
don't want to do that instead of
declaring like thousands or maybe
hundreds of variables just like that we
want to declare just one variable and
store everything inside that it saves us
a lot of time and it's very efficient
weight of working that now in order to
we want to pack multiple values in just
one variable that is it how this is how
we do it now if you want to have
multiple values in it let's just say we
want to have something like let's start
with Ironman and it's not like you
always have to have string values in it
let's just add one mode in here and that
can be spider-man if you want other
values you can surely have in an array
like you can have one you can have true
or something like that that's completely
a valid data type you can have multiple
things in here but in our case if we are
looking at four superheroes it makes
much sense that we have more the
superheros now if I would have called
this variable something like Ironman I
would be putting an information in array
format like named Ironman and then the
power aren't the true and all these
values but we have other data types to
handle that kind of situation which are
much more better than this so right now
we're gonna have just superheroes here
so I don't mind spider-man and then
we're gonna have Captain America there
we go so we have got our three values in
it so that's good now how can we access
this values so yes arrays actually are
super powerful and they comes up with a
lot of built-in functions that we can
use for example you want to access all
of them what you can do is you can
simply log and we can call this as
superhero and that's it so let's just
run this I'm gonna open up my terminal
clean that up everything and let's run
node and Marvel dot GS and there we go
so we have got all the values okay
that's nice now what happens if you want
to access any one of them so hit I'm
gonna duplicate that
and we use square brackets again but
instead of putting any comma separated
values we are gonna mention so we want
the first element of the array so we're
gonna mention zero remember this is the
classic joke that programmers always
count from zero and this is actually
this joke actually burned up in the
array and array still are the most used
data types in the world and this always
starts with zero so this is why it's it
came around so say this and if you want
to have a first element here notice you
got your Iron Man here so this is the
first case that we are having in here
now obviously you might want to access
like probably the last element in the
array and that can be a little bit
tricky situation because either you have
to count like 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so
basically you have to write the second
element save that and run that but that
can be a typical case when you have like
countable things probably it is like too
many values inside it or maybe 30 values
then it can be a little bit tricky to
find the last values and a lot of time
we just need last value this is kind of
a programming experience so how do we do
that it's actually really simple what we
have to do is we have to calculate the
length of this array okay so how do we
do that so let me first show you how do
we calculate the length of this array so
it has a function whenever you name your
array this is superheroes so you name it
and then put a dot notice there are lot
of things that you can do as soon as I
hit the dot my code editor is helping me
to find out tons of things in it there
are things like map push pop reduce
slice sort so yes these all are methods
and features that I can use with one of
them is this length and I'm gonna just
save that and let's just try and run
that again and there we go we got that
our array is holding three elements
notice it's not counting from zero one
two three it's saying it has three
elements one two three okay so that's a
pure in human language not in computers
like zero one two something like that
now once you know how you can have the
length of it you can utilize this
knowledge in finding the last
okay now notice here there are two
things our length actually gives us
human readable values which is three
whatever
array when we call it in this manner
understands the value which starts from
zero so we have to take an account that
okay so what we're gonna do is we are
gonna first of all if I mention this guy
just like this in the square bracket
obviously it returns me at three so
instead of this three is gonna be pasted
just like that it's gonna be calculated
but third value is not available in my
array so in that particular case I'll
get a special type of error here so let
me just walk you through errors are
always interesting make sure you keep an
eye on that
so notice right now I'm getting just
directly like three and it has it has no
idea absolutely what to do with that so
what we have to do is we have to get
minus one here so that we can subtract
my one from it and can just print that
out so let me just show you that what we
are getting here notice we are getting a
square here and there is a special
reason for that and let me just walk you
through with that it can be actually a
little bit tricky for a lot of you to
understand what we are saying right now
is just print this value and this is a
classic mistake peak done by everyone
notice what we are doing here on line 7
and line 8 can anybody figure out what's
the error is yes in here we are just
writing hey just print me the result of
whatever this value is which is actually
2 but in order to access the value from
the superhero we have to mention that as
well just like exactly what we are doing
so far we haven't noticed these square
brackets we are writing everything
inside the square bracket but there is
nothing from which we are asking the
value so we have to say super-heroes and
then we can simply say I hope a lot of
people get confused why we are having
two superheroes here notice one is
actually this will boil down to simply
as 3 then 3 minus 1 is 2 so we are
asking directly for the second value of
it okay I hope it is now clear to
everyone ok so now what is going to
happen this is going to calculate the
length of the array which is 3 then we
want to subtract
one from it because we know the last
value is always calculated the first
value is calculated from zero so the
last value is gonna be one less so we
are handling that situation and then
finally we are calling superheroes which
is the name of our array and getting
that last value I know we are doing
really really too much for this one
example here but I am looking forward
for the case when we have probably like
100 or probably 200 values in the arrays
and it's really hard to find out or
individually calculate any one of them
and finding the last value of it
probably you don't know what is the
length of that array so there we go
so really simple stuff now what we want
to do is we want to print out first of
all the number the length of this array
which is super arrow so I'm gonna be
saying something like this console we
can simply have a log oops command Z log
and there we go
and we want to say something like this
so I want to say you can use single or
double codes so we have three
super-heroes okay so how we can do that
now I don't want to call it like three
superheroes maybe I have added one more
in here so I want to calculate this
information from something which is
coming up dynamically which is coming up
from this area itself if I run this no
problem at all it's going to run it we
have superheroes what I want to replace
this three which is being calculated
let's just say for some fun stuff I'm
gonna add Thor here as well which is now
a new superhero and I saved this and if
I run this notice this guy is still
saying the last element which is tor but
still we are having three so we need to
learn how we can modify that and here
comes a templating string which is
almost a new feature in JavaScript and
it's gonna be super helpful so let's
learn one more thing so we're gonna be
deleting this entire stuff notice so far
we have learned about single codes we
have learned about double quotes but
there is one more guy which is known as
today's really a little bit hard to find
but they are just below your Escape key
okay so we just have them now the beauty
about having these till days
or these special characters is we can
simply write something like this we have
we're gonna mention that here super
heros and we want to place three in here
ok just after the half so what I can do
is I can use a dollar sign and after the
dollar sign I can use these pair of
curly braces and I can now add any my
JavaScript code that needs to be
calculated rest of the stuff will be
calculated as just a pure string but
here I can mention any JavaScript code
for example I can simply say 3 plus 4
and if I run this control l and I run
this notice it is being calculated or it
is being evaluated as JavaScript similar
to this I can replace it with something
like this Super Heroes and I can use dot
length and there we go so it will be
evaluated as JavaScript and rest will be
calculated as simply the string so I can
run that and there we go we have got
four superheroes and also the fun part
is actually I can just copy paste this
entire thing here and copy that and I
can paste it directly here to get a last
superhero so although the sentence
doesn't really make sense in here but
you'll get the idea what we are trying
to do so we have Thor superheroes okay
ready doesn't make sense but I hope you
got the point so these are gonna be
super helpful when you'll be working on
something known as templating Zoar
nodejs or your JSX these can be really
super helpful at time so now you know
there are three ways of printing the
strings the single curves the double
quotes and the tilde as well so we got
some information updated in our memory
database and we have learned about one
more data type how we can access some
inbuilt features and all of that
I know these can be little bit tricky
especially at the line eight but don't
worry as the time will progress we're
gonna learn more stuff with that so
that's your new information about your
arrays and your templating strings as
well and I'm gonna surely catch you up
in the next video and hey don't forget
to tell me in the comments are you
