hi my name is ash and I want to talk to
you about something something that is
going on as Twitter as well as I
received these kinds of email every
single day people ask me that hey I'm 31
can I start learning code hey I'm 51 am
I too old to start learning programming
people say is hey I'm just 15 can I
learn to code my background is from
construction my degree was in politics
can I learn to code now this is a
regular question for me and always I
have answered this question as yes at
any point of time at any given age you
can start learning programming it's all
in your will how strong your will is and
how you can catch up the code I have
seen many people and I have actually
taught many people from construction
business from school teaching and they
just wanted to learn code and right now
they are serving amazingly at various
organizations and various companies you
can learn to code and programming at any
point of time but you might be thinking
that hey I have actually talked on this
subject quite a number of times in
offline talks in online videos and in
emails why I'm bringing this up today
now today this question has actually
taken a social phenomena and this is
going on on Twitter right now right now
on Twitter it is going on hashtag
unqualified for tech which is similar to
this question these people are from big
tech giants from Apple from Google from
Firefox team and they all are tweeting
about their education background they
all are tweeting that right now they are
leading a team of engineering for mobile
devices and that is serving more than
400,000 students or people who are using
their services right now they have got a
degree in politics some of them are from
construction sites some of them are from
a military background
some of them heart just having a school
diploma and still they are at such a big
stage now I'm not saying that they are
having no degrees or diploma that means
you should drop out from a school if you
can afford the luxury of studying at a
school or studying at a college you
should never drop out I don't recommend
that ever how crappy is your college or
how crappy is your degree
is a degree everything and anything you
can manage alongside of the degree and
never being a fan of dropping out but in
case let's just say due to some strange
reasons maybe from a pressure from the
family some financial situation or
really think you can do really amazing
without that degree don't be hesitate
don't think it twice if you want to do
it just do it but onto a side note
regarding regardless of that topic let's
just leave that aside I want to say that
these people are not from amazing
backgrounds and I highly recommend you
to check out after this video go ahead
on to Twitter and check out hashtag
unqualified for tech and these people
are posting down their jobs as well as
what education qualification or
background they are having in education
now unfortunately I cannot post such
things on Twitter because I do have a
technical educational background my
engineering and masters were all in
computers and electronics so I do have a
strong solid background but this doesn't
means you also need that if you have
that that's amazing that's awesome but
this shouldn't be a hurdle you can do
programming and can do well in life
without these as well now whenever you
are going to learn something in life
whether programming or anything it's
actually tough it's really really tough
and I have experienced that recently now
I cannot say that I faced a lot of
problem in learning the tech and
everything I am good in it and I just
admit that that I love that thing and
this love actually makes me to
understand these things easily but when
I was getting started at YouTube the
filmmaking thing the knowledge of lens
camera lighting this was all bad and the
very first comment that I got when I
started on my youtube channel was hey
this is all crap this video is bad you
should stop filming videos now if I
would have got stopped at that point of
time we could have never been a family
of 80,000 people on this channel right
now this is a big journey and I had to
take that journey regardless of what
people are teach teaching me or telling
me now all I taken from them is good
part
I took their comments and hates as an
advice I started learning I started
improvising took a lot of online courses
on
making took a lot of offline bootcamps
about understanding the cameras and
everything I don't say I'm perfect right
now I'm learning a lot and I will be
keep learning in the future regardless
of what people say my language might not
be an absolute great my fear of camera
might not absolute be gone but still
I'll be keep doing it I'll be making
videos if I can be that much dedicated
about making videos why can't you be
dedicated about learning code learning
is a tough thing it is not easy world is
cruel they're gonna crush you down for
the very first code you're gonna write
in case you have been on this channel
for quite some time
you notice that how the learned code
online project went up when I launched
the very first video the very first
comment that I remember was of hate it
was saying that hey this is the wrong
move you should not do this at age this
is a bad move your website is not even
having SSL this is a bad move you should
stop making videos but still learned
code online is an amazing growing
project and I'm really excited about how
this project is shaping up this is
helping people all over the globe to
learn programming from wherever you are
learning whatever you are learning it's
gonna be bad at first not just bad it's
gonna be versed at first it's not easy
but you have to hang around there if you
want to make a difference you have to
leave all those things and all those
hate aside and you just have to keep
doing it until you do it just the right
way now obviously a few people will be
saying that hey hey - I don't get much
enough time from college or from parents
or from my job that I learn to code now
yes this is a situation but it's only
you who's going to overcome with this
situation it's all about priorities is
it good job that you really want to do
or you can afford to take a six month
off and can learn to code and really
want to switch your career it's totally
on you the last thing that I remember
that I did such thing was job offer last
time that I remembered after switching
my job I got an offer from Amazon to be
as a researcher at the United States
some of my videos of ns3 got really
appreciated by the Amazon Rhys
search team they took a lot of
interviews I was really interested in
getting a job at there and the last
thing that I remembered that was really
crazy I asked myself whether I want to
go there or not I refused that Amazon
job offer it was really a great offer
I'm not making enough money what could I
have made there but I asked myself do I
really want to do join as a researcher
and want to work on an s3 throughout my
life or at least for the next three
years I said no I want to do a little
bit more fun
I want to make youtube videos and that
was a creative crazy decision but still
I took it I have no regrets at all for
it I never mentioned that usually on my
videos so all I did was start making
YouTube videos I was getting better at
it and now I'm doing really fine at
YouTube it feels really great and it was
not easy for me to learn all these
filmmaking videos and all these things
on my own but still I did it if I can do
it who is just a random John Doe who can
learn filmmaking as well as programming
and all these things why can't you do it
it's all about priorities you need to
set whether your current job is good
enough or not or you need to do a switch
what you need to get up two hours early
in the morning it's totally about
priorities what you really want to do
you want to go outside and eat a burger
from McDonald which is delicious but
it's going to waste your half an hour
what you want to learn to code in that
half an hour it's all about priorities
what you really want to do whether to
rewatch an episode of Game of Thrones
again you have already watched it but in
that time you can learn something and
you can make your life a little better
don't be lazy and don't try to act that
not learning not opening book is cool
it's not learning is cool I have seen
this situation in a lot of College where
people say I don't read that much and
people think this is cool no this is not
cool those people who are not learning
who are not educating themselves are not
near ku the people who are learning to
make apps their app are being used by
thousands of people they have reached
the App Store they have reached to the
Google Play Store and their web sites
these are people who are cool
stop listening to those people learning
is cool
whenever you get free time just open up
a textbook or watch your videos that is
going to teach you something life is
very short and make sure you make every
second count do what you are totally
passionate about it if you are good in
making YouTube videos go ahead get it
better if you want to get started and
want to launch an app this is the most
perfect time get started and get moving
finally I just have one question to you
how can you sleep so easily if your app
is not still in the App Store and Google
Play Store how can you sleep so easily
if there is just one app in the App
Store how can you sleep so easily when
the syntax of that loop of that function
that you have been trying to learn from
the last seven days you haven't
accomplished that how can you sleep so
easy all the reasons that you have been
giving to yourself are just crap and you
know that and you know that better than
me
leave all those worries about what is
your diploma what is your age what is
your background which call it you are
leave those things aside and start
writing code right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
