bring it on please hey there guys face
here back again with another video and
in today's video I want to talk about
design so I got started as a back-end
developer or Moodle with a scripting guy
and I was not one of the best guys in
designing or neither I did have any
knowledge in the design so how much
important is the design part when you
are designing any website any mobile
application or working on any team where
you most of the time stays in the
backend parts so how much important is
it now I do have an example to make sure
that you understand that process because
I was thinking wrong and at the very
early stage of my life and I got my
second job as a Python developer and yes
I was wrong about it then I started
learning about it so let me show you
what that I have created one design here
and as you can see I don't think so you
can see so let me turn that up ok so
this is what we have a simple design
that you can see but let me show you
what do we have here
ok so come on get up there
ok so this is now the design second or I
would call that version 2 now obviously
seeing that you can understand let me
fix that up ok looks good now what I
want to say is by simply looking at
those two designs you can easily
understand that which one is looking
much more professional and which one is
actually good so yes without design also
you can create prototypes they will be
working prototypes and they look decent
like a prototype but if you want to make
anything that should look much much more
professional and people should be
attracted towards it you have to learn
design and it doesn't matter whether
you're working all the time in the back
end or maybe into the front end or just
writing the database because the more
you will have the knowledge of design
the more you'll be able to understand
what the front-end guys are trying to do
if you are working in the backend if you
are into the front-end
it's obviously a basic skill and a
little bit tweaking with the images the
tags the knowledge of the font
especially the knowledge of the colors
and color wheel like which color is
opposite to which color and if you want
to impact into that color you don't have
to increase that color you can decrease
the opposite color there and all such
things so design is pretty super
important and free usual like that now I
also tell you that when I got into this
video development and the video
education and teaching purposes I used
to make apps and all these I used to
take boot camps with that and I realized
that although I was delivering all the
things that were required for the
functionality purpose there were still a
few things that I was missing like I am
designing dbest app the easiest app
which can use the camera feature and it
was good it was good no problem with
that but the moment I added the design
feature in that app like adding of a
professional quality graphics onto that
a professional image in the button and
some good colors that I've used a
professionalism there the code was same
at the back end but students like to
involved get more into designing data
because data was beautiful and once you
are a lot of people might be saying that
hey I work into the backend
I don't need to have it much knowledge
about the design but my dear friend you
are wrong there because although you are
working into the back end but there will
be guys who will be putting your back
and work onto the front end and if you
have the knowledge of the front end you
will be able to take much more better
decisions of how the data should be
passed in into the front end and that
makes the front-end guys job easier and
will also give you a lot of knowledge
about it as well so all I'm saying is
that yes it's important to have design
skills now you might be wondering what
kind of software you should invest time
and money to learn that or to buy that
now let's talk about that now the very
first software that I personally use and
a lot of guys use and by the way this is
only for the Mac I will come on to the
Windows guys as well the software that I
use quite a lot is sketch app now this
is only for the Mac and yes it's the
page
shocker but it's a very high demanding
skills and if you're looking to get into
designer designing prototypes or screen
phases for mobile apps whether in
Android or iOS or webpages even these
are being designed in the sketch
nowadays if you are using a Mac and your
company is using a Mac oriented workflow
and pace but by no means that sketch is
an alternative to photoshop or is an
workaround for the Photoshop it's a
completely different software it's a
requirement in the programming
Industrialists kind of a thing okay now
another one which is common for mac and
Windows guys is Photoshop again it's a
paid software but it's a high level of
skills that you might want to invest
time there obviously have been less
money as well because it's the
subscription model that you have to get
and also learning is a very I would call
it a long curve you need to spend at
least a five or six months in there but
again if you are looking up to become a
one-man army who designs everything
works for the client and everything then
obviously you have to spend time in
learning that as well obviously you're
not going to learn that in one day
it takes some time and invest a little
bit time in learning these software's
and all these things now also there is
an alternative they're known as GIMP
which is completely open-source but you
won't be finding jobs for the GIMP
although it's kind of alternative for
Photoshop can do a pretty good job in
case you don't want to spend money in
there but you will never find a job
posting there that says hey we need a
professional GIMP software specialist
that can design graphics for that no it
doesn't happen if you want to get a job
you want to earn money you have to
invest in a Photoshop if you are looking
for that now also there are other
alternatives as well like illustrator
and a lot of free ones as well but these
are the popular ones now let me also
tell you that if you want to become a
programmer you are looking to become a
programmer and you might just want to
design a couple of good images just for
the learning purpose there is one very
good website known as canva.com now I
use that quite often and quite a lot
because it allows you to design a lot of
things they do have a custom option of
pixels how much width and height you
want there and
you can design some awesome graphics bid
it's kind of a drag-and-drop feature
that you can utilize so if they're
looking just to create some awesome
professional graphics you can always
look up for the canva.com
by the way this is not a paid promotion
okay of any of those website or things
that I'm telling you all I'm saying is
just these are the guys that I use them
regular in in my day to day life and
check them out they're doing a pretty
good job and good service so make sure
that whatever you are learning let's
just say you're learning web development
instead of just using any image there
try to edit your image a little bit make
sure that it's a perfect height perfect
width and some overlaying some maskings
are being done and you can do all of
them in canva as well but in case you
want to utilize the sketch app or
Photoshop that would be one step ahead
and one thumbs up for you okay so these
are some of my views about designing and
I now consider designing as one of the
most crucial and very important part of
the program at it I think every
programmer I should have a little bit
little bit knowledge about designing so
that he can make himself a version - I
would call because version one is where
you don't know about anything about
designing and version two you know about
it so I would call a B version to learn
a little bit about the color theory it's
not a big deal you can learn that about
in one or two day you cannot be master
there but in a couple of days you can do
to learn a little bit about color theory
how the colors are being designed and
try to find out some good color website
where you can find out some material
colors some flat colors can get ahead in
their industry there okay so this was my
quick words about designing let me know
in the comments section below that what
is the website that you're using to edit
your images for apps or web or whatever
maybe a lot of people can get can get
help from you and a lot of website which
I don't know I can learn a little bit
from you so make sure you post down your
favorite website on which you edit your
images okay and I'll catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
