rejects CDs so we're gonna talk more
about regex and from this video onwards
we're gonna get into the practicals so
the very first character that we're
gonna learn is wild card character now
before we move ahead and go further into
the series let me tell you that this
regex thing is all about pattern
matching and in this pattern matching
you'll find a lot of words as soon as
you open up your regex are calm the
recommended website for this code there
can be others as well you'll notice
something like plus the slashes the
paranthesis the square brackets every
one of these symbol has a specific
meaning sometimes more than one meaning
and this is regex that's it we're gonna
learn all these symbols and what they
mean and we're gonna memorize that yes
memorize that this is how the regex work
okay so I'm gonna delete this red X here
and also I don't need this so I'll
delete that the first character that we
are gonna learn is wild card now how
does this wild card character means and
how does it look like this is a dot yes
simply a dot this is your very first
character so let's have a couple of
example because regex is so simple to
understand with example through rather
than theory so we have a man then we
have a 10 then we have a Ben and then we
have a Ken these are all the examples
okay and in fact not the Ken I want a
all of that here ban and Kanna
just like that so don't worry about if
all the things doesn't really make sense
much I want to write a simple regular
expression which can match all of these
guys now the best part about the regular
expression or the first part you can say
is somehow to figure out what is common
and what is not common okay so here we
can see that a n is a common so
obviously I have to write a n that
matches but the first character is
different all the time M T B and K here
comes our very first meta character
which is known as wild card
now this wild card is just simply dot
now as soon as I wrote a dot here dot
simply means anything except the newline
character okay I repeat that again it
means anything now here is a good thing
that we are able to match that even if
you have something like Xen here it is
also going to match the
but here are some gotcha movement as
well these are like vu women that you
didn't thought about it let me and let
me tell you about the kV eights of this
metacharacter the wild card okay now
what happens is it matches anything this
means if I put a space and I say en it
is also going to match that remember
this is a very very exhaustive thing and
this is little bit like we don't want to
do that we will learn more about in the
future videos how to just skip this
particular scenario but just to give you
idea it matches anything and it also
matches one a n because remember it is
anything it can be exclamation
if I just put a space here if I put X
Clementi and a n notice it's looking for
the first word can be anything and then
the last word should be a n it can be a
number it can even be a space but again
important thing is if you put a line
break and then say a n it's not going to
match that completely and since we do
have a spatial like this dot here just
put a line break here is not gonna be
matching okay we will learn more about
the line breaks later on okay now let me
put you a couple of more examples which
are like obvious mistake everybody does
that when they learn these regular
expression for the first time now this
is a common mistake let's just say I
have a website we just say it's four
zero zero dollars and then it has
something like you want to match this
let's just assume this okay so how we're
gonna write the regular expression now
anybody who is just new to regular
expression we're gonna say hey you know
what I'm gonna write for dollar dot zero
zero and this is gonna match my regular
expression but you know what the problem
here is that this is a really common
scenario it also gonna match like four
and zero zero zero because the remember
the dot means anything it doesn't means
it's gonna match the 4.00 obviously it's
gonna match that but it's also gonna
match the four zero zero so the common
kv8 thing off regular expression is
matching these numbers we learn more
about them later on don't worry but this
is your very first wildcard character
let's keep it easy for the very first
video I
very simple to remember dot means
anything except the newline character
and that's it for this video let's catch
up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
