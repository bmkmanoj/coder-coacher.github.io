ethical hacking or of a more keywords
are being used for this pen testing
purpose people associated with security
research are quite a fan of this
backtrack operating system and there are
high chances that you are going to face
this operating system at one point or
another in your life when testing or
security stuff or ethical hacking stuff
is rising at a global exposure in this
market so we will focus on how this pen
testing is being performed what is
actually ethical hacking and all these
keywords means in this course you are
you're going to find a quiet a depth
about backtrack and lots of things that
you have never imagined so let's talk
about this my name is Satish and you can
visit my homepage
today Chaudhary calm I'm also an author
of Python video series and see video
series hosted on udemy I hope you will
visit those video series and don't
forget to add me at your Facebook link
or just drop me an email at my email id
hit Asia at the ready they show the
dot-com for any kind of suggestions or
if you want any pentesting service and
all these things so let's proceed back
what actually I'm going to teach about
in this course is all about pen testing
ethical hacking and all these stuffs as
soon as you'll op this certification you
you will get a certification of cis be
certified information security
professional that is a trademark by
Ignace technologies so I have divided
this course into various H levels and to
make it a bit interactive what I'm going
to do am I have created a fictional
character mr. H who wants to learn
penetration testing or ethical hacking
on backtrack operating system so let's
help mr. H by providing him a
certification of cis B and let's proceed
with that so the first question that
might be in mr. H mine will be what can
be the scope of learning these kinds of
things
some people might be quite unaware about
the things that ethical hacking or
pentesting or whatever you call it
whatever you name it is at a global
exposure nowadays the things that you
are seeing on the screen like Facebook
YouTube Google all appreciate the
security stuffs and to be in general I
don't want to make things bit
complicated like NASSCOM say twenty
thousand jobs are there or times groups
say that fifty thousand jobs will be
there in the market I just want to make
it simple at every place organization
institution educational corporate sector
where you will find the computer you
will need some person to secure your
data so that's all about this recent
scope so you can imagine the global
exposure you will find everywhere it's
laptop or computer and you will find
some security person guarding your data
so this is all about the recent scope so
this was all about the introduction of
this course and we will see quite a lot
about the BACtrack operating system and
all these things so see you soon in the
next video thank you so much for
