with another video in this video I want
to talk about can you learn to
programming language at the same time
and I'm also aware on the situation that
you have watched like hundreds of videos
talking about programming and saying no
you should not learn to programming
language at the same time but being a
critical thinker you always have been
thinking that when there are loops in
both programming language when there are
if and else condition when they are
available in both programming language
there is so much similarity in the
syntax why Cannot I learn to programming
language at the same time I'm really
proud on you that you have thought like
this way and being a critical thinker is
always amazing and awesome but in this
video I'll solve all of your questions
and we'll answer to them really
precisely so that you never have to
think about it let's get started
when you're slowly learning to
programming language side by side is
inviting a nightmare and I have never
seen even professionals doing it even I
myself which I don't call it as a
professional but as a decent programmer
I don't ever do that now
there is a strong reason behind that and
in order to understand what is going on
behind that we have to invite our
beloved friend which is Apple pencil
which still charges like this and hey
Apple I'm not a big fan of this although
that's a great product I have been using
it for almost more than a year I loved
it but the wait charges I don't like it
Apple do something about it so let's
move on to my computer and try to
understand why you shouldn't be learning
to programming language at the same time
so when you learn to programming
language at the same time a lot happens
now consider this piece of text has
learned code online dot n written here
as just the basic syntax of programming
loops function and classes everything
included now if I just step on over here
just consider this two things here two
colors this blue one has one programming
language and this brown one as other
programming language when you're
learning to program language at the same
time what you are doing is first you're
typing L here with a brown color then
you have to switch on to it blue and
then you're learning L here again now
similarly I'll switch back again and
I'll just see e and then I'll just go
back here and I'm just doing it here see
this is so time consuming now instead of
that if I would be doing something like
this I would select just one programming
language and I would be writing this
here completely just like that yes I
wrote it at wrong place but you got the
point but it is so much faster when you
just pick a one programming language and
go out with that now instead of
switching that programming language it's
gonna take time your mind actually takes
a lot of time to adjust in that paradigm
of programming language and hence making
it a little bit tough for every
programmer so my advice is make sure you
just don't switch your pens here and
just like that you don't switch your
programming language ultimately
programming language are just tools to
perform anything and similarly in this
case they are just performing a text
here so my word of advice is hey don't
just switch back on to fourth on
your pens stick to one player one pan
and once you are done with it then only
make sure you move on to the next man
now moving back onto the camera yes this
is my actual reason why you should not
be learning to programming language at
the same time the reason behind that is
when you are learning to programming
language simultaneously you are not
learning it simultaneously you're
actually switching the tasks you are
trying to understand one thing and
immediately you are switching to another
task and you are trying to understand it
which is really complex process instead
of doing that I would recommend you to
highly go for mastering one programming
language at least first then try to do a
couple of projects in it at least two or
three projects in it it will give you a
more understanding now I'm a strong
believer that instead of doing any kind
of competitive programming or anything
like that instead of do that doing that
try to do and build up a project on your
own it will give you a much more
flexibility and much more complex
thinking as compared to any other thing
now once you have at least done two or
three projects which are at a big scale
then for sure if it if the demand comes
on you can just move on to other
programming language and obviously your
past programming language is gonna help
you quite a lot there are a lot of
similarities in all programming language
and without a doubt I can say that if
you have learned any programming
language in the past it is surely going
to help you in the future as well so
that's it for this quick short video in
case you have liked this video do give
it a thumbs up and in case you haven't
yet subscribe do subscribe we talked a
lot about programming and tech at this
channel so go ahead hit that subscribe
button and for sure I'll catch you up in
a next video
there's always a steady side across the
river take ride did you swim an IOU
worries going away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
