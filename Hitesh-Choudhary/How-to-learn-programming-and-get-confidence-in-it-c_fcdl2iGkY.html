I'm back again with another video now in
this video I want to discuss something
very special with you now I get this
quite a lot in my email that people are
not good in learning programming and
even if though a lot of students do
learn how to program and a lot about
their syntax they don't get much of the
confidence that they are going to do
some project or they don't feel somehow
confident that they can do something in
that programming language so what is the
wrong thing that's going on out there
let's figure it out in this video it
won't be something wrong if I just say
that every month I get at least two
emails saying that hey I'm learning
programming either I'm not getting good
in learning the programming somehow or
even though I have learned about the for
loop and the function syntax I'm not
feeling confident enough about the
programming so what's going on wrong
with that now for this I would like to
share a couple of incident that helped
me quite a lot in learning programming
as well as this stuff you can relate it
with any other thing in learning
procedure whether you are learning for
maybe your school maybe your college
maybe some sports some programs software
programming anything you can apply these
things quite a lot now in the past I
have been making videos about to learn
anything there are two key factors that
is hard work and the reputation but yes
there is one more key important aspect
aspect that I haven't discussed yet so
I'm going to discuss that in this movie
so whatever you want to learn something
we all know that hard work and
reputation is the key process that
simulates our brain and we learn things
quickly whether it's shooting a
basketball or maybe learning a
programming language so let me share a
quick interesting incident of my
personal life and that will help you a
quite a lot about learning programming
or maybe game where ever you want to
apply that so I was in my school and I
wanted to learn the basketball so I was
not good at it so I started to learn
that and my team was practicing for
let's just say two hours so I was
practicing two hour more than my team I
used to come one hour early at the code
and I started to hit the chutes and even
though team was finished up playing I
used to
a-after 1r that as well now obviously I
was doing a lot of hard work and I was
shooting the things quite right so that
helped me as a repetitive and hard work
process but there is another key element
now I was doing the shoots and
everything I was looking up the online
videos and taking help from my coaches
and everybody but you know Michael
Jordan once said one good thing about
shooting practices like if you want to
be good shooter you don't need to shoot
thousand shoots from the wrong technique
because eventually if you are shooting a
thousand shoots a day and your technique
is wrong eventually you're getting
better in shooting from the wrong
technique so don't do that
so technique is also important so your
coaches your online videos and your
reading material always helps you to
learn quite a lot so with that I learned
quite a lot so number one tip that I
want to give to you is your technique
should always be right whether you are
learning a sports or you are learning a
programming now taking the same example
in the programming environment if you'll
ask anybody to write a script for a
login eventually everybody can do that
in the PHP ASP node.js or pretty much
anywhere anybody can do that but having
a right way of writing a login script is
completely different from just writing a
script of the login there can be some
subtleties about storing the passwords
or you should store it or you should not
store it you shouldn't encrypt it or you
don't need to encrypt it these are a lot
of key variables that you need to
understand and eventually if your
technique of writing that script is good
then only you become a good programmer
so what we have learned here so far is
hard work is necessary repetition is
necessary but also the technique is
equally important so if you are learning
programming or if you're learning sports
take good advice from your coaches from
online courses from good books and
everywhere there which you can learn
don't just look on just one blog on
online or just one course on the online
take so many courses so many books and
refer to quite a lot of them and
eventually discuss with some experienced
players or experienced programmers who
can help you quite a lot in sense in
some aspect out there
now let's just figure out that you have
now you are getting comfortable in
learning and you are learning
programming or sports whatever you want
to do and you're getting better at that
now the next question that comes up is
how to get confidence in learning
programming or wherever you want to
apply that now again taking back to my
story of how I learned basketball now
within three or four months I actually
worked really hard because I wanted to
play the game I worked really hard on
the game and I was getting better in
learning the game but still I didn't
play it in the playing five because I
was not having confidence even though my
shooting rate was 65 to 70% which is
pretty good in basketball I was not
getting caught getting confidence that I
can play in the main file in the
tournament so what did I did my coach
actually forced me to play in one of the
tournament in last sessions out there
and I eventually felt that this was the
only thing that was needed I wanted to
have something real-life exposure to get
confidence in learning the sports the
same thing happened with me when I
learned the front-end development a lot
of years back when I started with the
HTML and CSS although I was having
pretty good knowledge about HTML I could
have right pretty much anything in the
HTML I could have style a lot of things
but still I was able to do them in the
chunks like for example I could have
written only a table and could have
styled it but I was having no idea how
the entire website was there and how
it's being built up so it's equally
important that whenever you learn
something you need a practical exposure
like for example in a web development
you need to create couple of projects in
order to get confidence in learning the
programming same thing goes for every
programming language whether it's Java C
C++ PHP ASP node.js so there are tons of
others you need to build something up
now a lot of people ask me that hey we
don't have any project what we should do
hey and this this is something I would
call it bull excuse this is this is not
good because let us say you are letting
a web development design a website for
your own or maybe for your family
business for your dad for your mom
for your house for your society huh for
your basketball give anything project is
on to you the more project that you will
think out of yourself and you're going
to do that it's going to help you quite
a lot in learning the project saying
these goes for a baby back end
development or iOS development or Swift
or Android wherever you want to go just
design your favorite app design your
favorite website interface anything that
you want until unless you're going to do
these projects by your own you will
never become confident that hey I can do
that and once you have got a couple of
projects under your belt this is really
helpful because it's not just something
about gaining confidence it is also
something about creating a great
portfolio so on one hand you are getting
confidence that yes I can solve my own
project either by looking Stack Overflow
discussing or just by hitting trial but
you're getting better at that and on the
other side you're making a lot of
projects under your belts that can be
showcased to a potential employee that
can look for your previous work and this
is this is a great thing because in a
lot of app development things and
interviews that I've conducted for
people to hire iOS people I have just
looked for one thing hey have you done
any project let me just show you I I
never asked for any degree or a lot of
Institute or the companies do not ask
for degrees or something they just say
hey what you can do for us and what you
have done in the past so past is
completely in your hand you can design a
lot of apps and the future is going to
be really bright in that way so onto a
quick summarization we have learned here
that years with the hard work and
repetition the techniques should be
right in the learning programming or
wherever you want to apply that and
apart from that you need to understand
that projects are very important and
don't just rely anybody that he's going
to take us in the project journey to
start with yourself in case you are
registered in some good boot camps who
are doing projects and something that's
that's really good but I don't say
that's a compulsion because it's
completely on to you that how you get
started I hope this video was quite
helpful don't forget to hit the
subscribe button and I'll come up with a
lot of such great videos in the future
do it the like button as well and share
it with someone
who can really get benefit from this
video till then bye-bye and catch you up
in the next movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
