jordan in here I know it's late in India
but I couldn't wait in here just to go
live because this video will be there on
the YouTube so some quick updates will
be there with you I know people will
won't be showing up because I didn't say
that I'll be showing life from Jordan
and as well as it is very late in India
so that's that's why but again you might
be watching these videos so yes I'm live
in Jordan here I traveled to the by and
divided the Jordan and there we go okay
so people are here good morning
everybody hits for 36 in the morning in
here I think it might be around it might
barely there as well okay hey good
morning everybody I'm in Jordan right
now and staying in my room don't don't
just see my room it's it's a complete
mess I'm staying in a pretty decent
hotel but it's it's it's Ramada there
but you know it was good earlier I made
it a mess so it's my fault there that's
good
let me show you some outside view it's
7:00 a.m. there that's that's good it's
so we are running a little bit late so
I'm in the Middle East not obviously
known as for things to do him here and
Jordan is a pretty good country let me
talk about a few things about the Jordan
I one thing announcement in here quickly
that I'll be uploading vlogs Center
guides and everything of the Jordan as
well as in Egypt but I won't be taking
any technical questions right now this
is a valid trip of the Jordan so I just
realized that my laptop is not powerful
enough here to upload vlogs and
everything so I have kept everything in
here I will be definitely uploading all
these videos as soon as I get home that
will take around 1215 days so in the
meantime I'll just go live from wherever
I can okay so I'm not taking any
technical questions just fun stuff about
the Jordan
okay this is a fun stuff time now one
thing that really has something funny
about the Jordan is their five rupee
note it says zero it gets us so much of
the confusion why the notes say zero so
this is funny why would you call it note
zero but then I realize that it's in
array Arabic so and the back side they
do call it five so that people can see
that but it's it's funny
Jordanian dollar jotting in dinar is
very powerful currency very very
powerful currency more expensive than
dollar yep
one Jordan and dinar is around 1.6 USD
so that's that's it
okay what are you doing there I'm
traveling having fun holidays this is
what I'm doing right now in the Jordan
let me try to show you a few things in
here let me just move this guy if it is
possible this is by the way my room it's
good it's it's from our rights of course
it's good and right now put come here I
can open this guy if I can open this
somehow not possible it's dark outside
let me just show you that yeah it's
completely dark it's early in the
morning in here at the Jordan so just
giving you a few quick updates that yep
I'm in Jordan wouldn't be taking any
technical questions or anything so yep
I'm I'm enjoying quite a lot in here and
this is a quick update that that I
wanted to post around in here now one
thing also I would like to mention in
here I talk to the local people in here
asked about how is it life there because
when you open up a television or
Internet you just see about the middle
east is bombing and all of these harsh
things but to be honest Jordan is
something different it's worth traveling
and the food here is alone worth
traveling I would be uploading pics and
everything I know the connection is not
the best in here that's what all I
wanted to say I'll surely come back
later on
right now this is all in the in the live
session in here maybe if I get a chance
to get life from the Hercules temple or
maybe from dead sea I'll shortly do that
but Internet is not a good in good thing
in here it's very expensive as well as
not as good so bye bye for now and I'll
surely catch you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
