but on the video and I wanted to do this
video for a very long time and finally I
got a little bit free time to do this
video this is a face of comparison
between the two major joints in the
industry sketch and Adobe XD now notice
here I'm not talking about the whole set
of Adobe lineup I'm just talking about
their one product which is XD which is
used majorly for mobile app design web
design and prototyping and stuff and
also their major competition here which
is sketch being loved a lot by community
so again they are both on to a very high
weight edge here and we're gonna be
comparing with them okay now before we
start and moving on comparing both of
them they both serve on to a very
specific audience which designs the
mobile app or prototype them or also the
web designers and the reason why I'm
comparing them is they're having a big
market share and I just wanted to have
it a fun comparison also want to make
one more point here that I have been
using sketch for almost three years now
probably a little bit more and I have
been using Adobe XD from there day one
so there have been a really great
improvement in Adobe XD but still there
are certain points that I would mention
in this video that requires a lot of
improvement and also both of these apps
now support the prototyping as well so
you can have kind of interface where you
can see whatever your design is can have
animations like fade in fade out just
like an iPhone or an Android and can
have that both of them over offer this
the sketch and that'll be XD as well but
both of them actually sucks and honestly
so we will not be comparing them
hands-down envision is the guy here who
is the winner so clear-cut winner is
envision both of them offer this
prototyping both of them sucks so let's
bring up our sketch so this is the
sketch version 49.3 which is latest as
of now this recording so this is our
very first welcome screen on the sketch
we do have certain templates on which
you can have and go through with them
let's also bring up the guy which is
Adobe XD so side by side so you can see
they are pretty much similar and one
thing also I would like to mention here
is that Adobe XD uses a lot of shortcuts
which are
common in sketch as well so it was
pretty easy for me to move into XD from
sketch not completely move I am still
mostly on the sketch but it was pretty
easy to work on a little bit XD and also
Adobe XD supports all the files that are
being designed in the sketch so it's
pretty easier to move your existing
files and just open them up and tweak
out a little bit just like that so it's
pretty much easier now okay so we can
have a template let's just create a new
document first of all in sketch and
we're gonna be doing almost the same
thing in Adobe XD to see how much both
of them are working on so obviously this
is your blank canvas area not the canvas
area this is like your blank whiteboard
ish and you just press a to get an
artboard we obviously know that most of
you and you can have your any artboard
now obviously if you press a again not
here you press a again you can see you
have a lot of sizes on the right hand
side we have paper size a lot of Apple
devices a lot of Android devices like
pax pixel galaxy s 8 you can even have
customized size as well like probably
you work on YouTube a lot you might want
to design them on your own so you have
your YouTube stuff as well you have your
envision icons stuff as well both of
them are pretty awesome in this manner
let's go ahead and move on to Adobe XD
so where are you there we go so we can
launch up our custom size as well we can
directly write our custom size here or
we can just choose from here like iPhone
they have a lot of options for Android
mobile so artboard is not a tall issue
in any of them they are pretty much the
same and obviously you can just press a
key here as well and can select a wide
range of artboards being available
customization is not at all an option
like not at all a big deal both of them
supports that so no big deal here ok
now let's compare the first thing here
which is your rectangle tool so as soon
as I press R which is gives me a
rectangle so there we go we have a nice
rectangle mostly being used now Adobe XD
provides you these corners so which you
can I'll just drag them all of them at
once or you can just press your option
key and can just drag only one of them
to create really cool shapes so that's
nice I like this feature if you
want to have like all of the icons being
cornered or something like that then you
can just move it like that to have a
nice you know rounded edge rectangle not
a big deal for sketches well it also
provides you can just press R and have a
rectangle and you just have to then move
on to this radius bar and can have like
rounded radius and just like that you
can also press your U key on the sketch
and can have a directly rounded
rectangle it's not much rounded you can
see it's just a three pixel rounded area
but it's nice to have some time it's I
mostly don't use it I mostly just like
to have rectangle and then like to
customize it a little bit okay so that's
nice now also let me walk you through
that I do have a custom bar here which
is coming up from this guy the craft
tools and this makes a lot of things for
which Adobe XD is popular these are the
craft tools available totally for free
kind of a plugin for sketch and they do
a lot of things now you might have seen
this stuff where somebody is just having
a lot of photos in the folder just drag
and drop and these photos automatically
fills up in these square areas that's
exactly what craft can do in this sketch
okay now let me walk you through one of
the very powerful feature which I like
in the sketch as well as in Adobe XD
they both are they're in the same but
serves like little bit different so
let's have an artboard first of all in
this guy and here are a quick nice trick
so press R so we're gonna have a
rectangle so there we go let's have a
rectangle like this I think this I can
double click and can convert that into
vector images and I would like to have a
little bit like longer vector at the
bottom like broadened and I think at the
top it's like a little bit dished like
that so it's okay hit enter so I do have
now custom shape here I can just select
this and I can use rotate copies in case
you are is not there right click and
click on customize toolbar they have
pretty good options here so what you can
do is you can select this I can click on
rotate copies and can hive have like 13
copies of it click OK
and there we go my cog led wheel or my
setting I can is completely ready I can
just even customize that a little bit
however I like so this is one of the
feature which
I absolutely love there are a lot of
such neat tricks that sketch do and one
thing which I really like about the
sketch is let's just say I want to have
a rectangle here and let's just say it's
size is 67 but you know I wanted it to
be 30 but then I realized that no I want
it to be like 3.5 times of 30 so I can
just simply say 30 multiplied by 3.5 and
it's gonna do the math automatically I
hadn't have to worry much about it this
is one of the beautiful feature about
the sketch but it's not like that that
Adobe XD doesn't have this feature
not exactly this feature but something
like a little bit like that okay so what
we can do is let's just say we have this
shape and we're gonna fill that up to
something like dark maroon ish or this
flat ish color okay and now we are gonna
have a circle and oops delete that and I
needed okay so come on okay so let's
just have another rectangle here we can
we do have another options like ovals
let's just have an oval here you can
always press your shift key to have a
perfect oval so let's just say this is
my shape and I'm gonna just color fill
them up with the colors all of them and
by the way we do have shortcuts for all
of them these are like B for select
following up from the illustrator and
all these and all that so let's just
select this guy and we're gonna fill it
with a little bit bluish like that okay
and we're gonna have this guy a little
bit smaller I know it's a random shape
but you'll get to me in a second just
wait with me bear with me so there we go
and for all of them we're gonna remove
the border because I don't like that and
for that as well border okay so now
these are all things so what you can do
is you can select all of them and you
can just click on the repeat grid now
this repeat grid is really powerful and
can create like immense amount of shapes
or if you have like the bars of the chat
icons you can just always
that same can be done in a sketch as
well but this is like something really
amazingly powerful so you can just drag
and drop and can repeat these shapes
like really quickly but the first time I
saw that it was like something magical
and you can see the possibilities are
really endless with that you can create
like immense amount of shapes with that
let me give you a quick idea of that and
also the best part about this is like
you can have something like twice of
that and then you can just reduce down
the areas here and that's gonna help all
of them so you can have like crazy
shapes you can just have something like
this which is absolutely insane so this
is one of the most powerful feature in
the Adobe XD that I think has a lot of
hackable feature you can just customize
it however you like so this is what I
loved about it okay
now coming up on two very important part
which is this pen tool so they call that
as a pen tool and you can design
customized shapes with it so let's just
say you have a shape you can have it
something like that okay so notice here
on the right hand side I don't have much
of the options here obviously can press
down your option key or to have these
things you can just get a shape back
something like this okay so have a
random shape now I think just to let you
know this tool was totally redesigned in
Adobe XD I don't say it's not powerful
it is powerful it has a lot of options
like these things can have inside stroke
outside stroke and stuff like that it's
much more it will make much more sense
here so you can have it like shapes and
all of that I like this but you know
this is one feature which I like better
in sketch so let's move on to sketch and
let me show you what I was talking about
so if I just press V for a vector tool
here and I just start pressing something
like this now notice my bar is now
getting all curvy all of that now what I
can do is I can press my command key and
notice it gets straightened out these
are the small things which sometimes get
really really handy if it is available
in the wrist XD I would really like to
know that Poznan in the comment section
but you know these things options like
straight and disconnected symmetric
these are something which is
really one of my favorite tools in the
sketch and I love that part okay
apart from this there is one thing which
I think there is a room for improvement
in Adobe XD so just select this image
let's just say we select that and what
you can do is you can have a shadow on
it so that's nice
not one of the best but it's decent but
you can also have like inner shadows
which is less visible but sometimes they
can do remarkable jobs and you have
absolutely no idea how powerful they can
become because it doesn't consume
anything outside the area and you can
still have amazing looks in that now
this feature is not so really handy in
Attaway XD I think it's gonna come up
very soon so you can have it yes you can
have shadows but having an inner shadow
is really a tricky part
as of now you have to use variety of
hacks to do so I would love to see this
inside shadow thing in that will be XD
for having it okay one more thing which
impressed a lot in Adobe XD I loved
about it is this text tool so let's just
say we have okay first of all let's get
a new artboard so have a text tool and
you can just write a text and it's
really really small right now so I'll
just have it something like a sample
text hit enter or just like that so we
have it there we go so now what I loved
about it is they have an option of
directly just scaling it right now I
absolutely love this part and also the
texts are actually of two ways or of two
types come on down to that of two types
in here and I absolutely love the two
types here the first one you can see is
this guy which is point text which you
can increase that and another one is
like your paragraph text I don't know
what they call it never hold it area
text or paragraph text means the same in
which you can actually scale that and
now you can fill more areas on to that
it's pretty amazing so I love that part
but one thing that I'm missing is I can
just right-click on to it and you know
there is no option here which I am about
to show you in the sketch but I would
love to see this feature in the sketch
as well like this point and drag and it
just scales up it's it's awesome
love that okay so one thing that I would
like to show here is in the sketch so
let's have in another artboard you can
have as many artboard and let's just
have a text and this is gonna be like
sample and let's just have a sample text
okay so obviously you can just click on
the size and can increase that so it's
kind of a alternative for that but I
loved the other way when it's really
cool so what you can do here is you can
right click on this and notice there is
an option here which says convert to
outlines this is really powerful once
you convert that as an outline what you
can do is now you can select any
individual world and can play it as a
vector so let's just say you have a text
and just an instead you can convert that
into a simple kind of a customized font
or maybe logos or something like that so
let's just say I select this and I want
it to be something like going like this
and there we go your customization is
all done and just within a few clicks
and you can save that as a simple as a
symbol and can you reuse that obviously
the symbol feature comes in Adobe XD as
well so you can have something like in
this guy and probably can have something
like this I know this one doesn't really
look cool I just liked it in just P
there we go so pretty easy I like this
one part and again on top of that you
can have some of the shadows on to it if
you want to have it or you can have the
long shadows there's also an option of
Gaussian blur which I use quite a lot in
the images to give that blurry feel on
top of that login screen I love that yes
it can be done in Adobe XD as well but
there are things you have to worry about
ok so this was my quick comparison again
both of them offer this prototyping
feature where you can have the
prototypes and can see that you can run
that but both of them actually sucks and
invision does a better job in having
that now also if we have this sample you
know they have this duplicates on the
grid vertical and all of that so if you
want to have it vertical probably like 4
you can duplicate that and you got it
directly just like that
so these things can be done using the
craft
so come on you can go back and we do
have other options with the craft as
well it's really powerful plug-in but I
just wanted to talk about the core
features available in the sketch in XD I
didn't want it to go into like and
obviously we have features like let's
just he want to fill this so you can
just click on this and just fill it with
something or you can get something
images or something like that and it's
gonna fill that up so it's available you
can also have Getty Images search for
images and can have replaced it so
pretty easy stuff available in both
Adobe XD and in this one as well so I
think that's pretty much enough I really
enjoyed making this video between a
side-by-side comparison between sketch
in Adobe XD I hope you have enjoyed this
video and by the way I love both the
software I am looking forward to working
both of them so that's my comparison if
you liked this video give it a thumbs up
and hit that subscribe button and I'll
surely catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
