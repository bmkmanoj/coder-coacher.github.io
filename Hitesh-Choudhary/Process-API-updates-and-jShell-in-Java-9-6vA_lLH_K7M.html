with another video and in this video
we're gonna take down the subject which
has been requested quite a lot and I
haven't talked about it which is Java
online and yes a lot of people think
that I don't have any time to talk about
Java but that's not correct actually I
am involved still in a couple of clients
who are still working on the Java and I
had to cope up with them so definitely
when it comes to has somebody's paying
to you Java looks amazing Java is
awesome with that case so let's talk
about Java 9 and I would be talking
about some of the upgraded feature that
I personally liked because these are
some things which I was doing somehow
using the third-party modules or some
native code so some here and there kind
of a thing but now these are being
involved directly in Java and I'm so so
so happy for that now again just onto a
side note in case you are interested in
learning Java let me remind you that you
can learn Java directly no need to learn
C or C++ you can directly jump on to
Java every language is independent in
itself yes definitely C and C++ code
helps but it's not a compulsion anybody
can start directly in case you're
interested in learning that go ahead
jump on to learn code online dot and
there is a Java boot camp going on that
includes algorithm bubble sort and all
kind of stuff amazing stuff go ahead
check that out coming back onto the
point the Java 9 has recently being
released and just like always are you
and for a common people who are just
starting the programming they are not
amazing groundbreaking things that you
will be directly spotting there but yes
there are few and I'll be pointing them
out and obviously if you haven't yet
updated go ahead and go to Oracle
website and download the latest version
of Java Linux Mac Windows wherever you
are and let me just point out a couple
of things which are added
now of course are the things like jigsaw
and everything requires a separate movie
which we are going to talk later on
right now let's just focus on J shell as
well as some process handle updates
because process handle updates are my
favorite ones ok so first thing which
I'm not quite impressed with the Java
and in fact they have actually got a
little bit late and including the J
shell thing but still
whenever they come up with that I'm so
happy glad they finally came up with
that so just open up your terminal or
command prompt wherever you are and all
you need to do is type J shell and hit
enter now this is going to open up a
runtime now it's not a runtime it's like
a lightweight Java which you can run
quickly like for example you want to say
hey I want to just print out the system
dot out dot print print Ln and I can
simply go ahead and go with that like
hello oops hello world there and just
like that you can you can surely do that
it's it's pretty easy but again let me
remind you these J shell are not a new
thing they are already there in Python
from the day one and they are known as
idle in the Swift they are known as
playground in the Java they are known as
J shell these are not meant for writing
the entire code or entire programs just
because they are not saved and all these
things they are not a reliable way of
writing the code yes they are amazing
way of testing out of your code for
example let's just say you want to write
a simple code for bubble sort and you
forgot that whether my code is gonna be
working or not you can quickly declare
an array and can sort can write a bubble
sort here and can check out hey it works
and then you can move on and write that
exact logic in your Intel J or Eclipse
or whatever you are using so very quick
way of testing your code but not a
complete way of you should not always
write your code in here for the bigness
is actually pretty good I would
recommend beginners to just write some
code for fun stuff there okay so this is
all basic stuff not impressed much with
the J shell but what has impressed me
amazingly tremendously is the process
okay now if I'll I'll first Google out
some things for you on the Stack
Overflow and let's just call me this
finding PID inch of H so how do you find
a PID in Java 8 this includes a couple
of things like for example here's a
quick quick answer for Java 8 I think
yes this is for Java 8
and it says you should have a GN a
platform Dodge are third-party modules
again and then you will be able to write
this much of the code again for the UNIX
based platform you have to declare these
kinds of things and have to find these
kinds of libraries to find your PID
which is a process ID now what happens
in the Java 9 is or in fact let's talk
about Java 8 first if I need to find my
process ID of my Jaime JVM I need to
first detect whether it's running on a
UNIX or Mac or Windows wherever it's
running and then based on that I had to
find the process ID for some of the work
it's it's not good and again dependency
on the third-party modules is not
something that you should be doing in
such cases these functionalities should
be cooked up in a programming language
and I'm happy that Java has finally
listened to a lot of programmers so now
just read out this documentation here
about the PID or process ID and what
you'll notice that now there is inbuilt
class in Java dot Lang data object that
means you don't even have to say import
this it's it's gonna be there just just
like that and it you can do a lot of
stuff like here's an important paragraph
subclass of process should override Onix
in bla bla stuff to provide fully
functionally processes including process
ID information about the process
direction run direct children +
descendant of those children's all can
be easily find out using these process
ID and trust me it's just a 2 line of
code 2 line of code within 2 line of
code and it's so simple now if you want
to find more details about the process
handle I would highly recommend to check
out this documentation which is process
handle and amazingly returned just like
always all the Java documentation it's
clearly returned in fact one of the best
documentation these article guys always
just write out all process children and
the pids and onyx it is a lie it's it's
very important these kinds of things
like is alive info for info you have to
obviously use this guy but it's it's
fairly easy and since it's so much
easier I'm gonna just create a quick
program
for you because hey who likes too much
of the talking but still we have been
doing this so let's just write some
couple of lines of code and we're gonna
write this into Java 9 make sure you
have Java 9 installed you might be
having Java 8 as well but go with the
Java 9 for this special program for rest
of the series
that is going on at learn code online
it's completely okay with Java 8 or 9
it's rich for this program again big
codes there Java 9 only and let's just
click on next
no need to check mark that and we're
gonna call this as process handle
process API would be good process API
I'm gonna copy this because I want to
create the class with exactly same name
and I would like to place that not this
here I would like to place your next
stop on my mmm too much of the messy
techstop Java exercise and just like
there and open that up and I would like
to name this project as process API or
Java 9 would be good name actually
because I can write more code in that in
future videos finish that up
ok Java 9 we have got a source let's
just put this in directly in the source
nothing to create a new module for now
we need a Java class and we are gonna
call this as process a API okay there we
go
pretty cool basic stuff not gonna be
going into much of the depth of that but
it's gonna be really simple
oops command Z come on don't do that
public static wide oops
main oops what am i typing main and it's
gonna be just like all the way is pretty
boring stuff you have done that pretty
much like hundreds of time args and
there we go now the interesting comes
interesting stuff comes up with the
process handles so what you have to do
is just call this guy process handle
okay and as soon as you have a process
handle notice there is no import
or anything it's gonna just work process
handle just the usual stuff how you
declare a variable process handle and
you have initialized it so this is
amazing this is good but what we're
gonna entrust it in here is is we're
gonna say process handle dot current
okay now what this is going to do is let
me show you the documentation again this
entire thing yep this is where it is and
we can use a things like this PID here
to find out the process ID we can also
find out things like is alive or info
basic stuff but let's just use this PID
here okay and what we can do is I think
we can directly do a s out and I can
simply say here that process ID or in
short PID and I can concatenate it with
process process handle dot PID there we
go two lines of code exactly two lines
of code to just get you the process ID
it will work like a charm on Windows on
Linux on Mac but make sure that you are
on a java line just to prove you the
stuff I'm gonna just run this out and
it's gonna throw me a process ID there
we go no big deal it's the process ID of
your current JVM that is running this
program super helpful and this is just a
like tip of the iceberg and go ahead and
check that out like it's it's such
amazing and so simple when you want to
get a children there is a nice program
and a lot of things written so that you
can find out yes there is a it throws in
security exceptions there sometimes
there is a permission process and all of
that so definitely you have to take care
of that but no big deal we can manage
that so this was my quick update on a
Java 9 on J shell as well as a process
IDs and especially the process handle
for sure I would like to make future
videos in handling the Java 9 what's new
has come up and also jigsaw projects and
a little bit more discussion just like
this one so I hope you have enjoyed this
video in case you have
enjoyed this give it a thumbs up in case
you haven't yet subscribed to my youtube
channel go ahead do that as well and in
case you want to check that out amazing
Java bootcamp for beginners go ahead
check it out we have making awesome
university programs and a lot of lot of
stuff is about to come up this is just
on the way boot camp that's it for this
video and I will surely catch you up in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
