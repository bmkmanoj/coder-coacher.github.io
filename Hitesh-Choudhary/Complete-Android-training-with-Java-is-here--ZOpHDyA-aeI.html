development training build ten apps now
I know many of you might be thinking hey
I need to learn first Java and then need
to learn Android nobody's at all this
course also consists of complete Java
training as well so you'll be learning
Java as well as Android in this course
my name is cetacean I have been
programming for almost 10 years now I
have created some awesome and successful
boot camps in iOS development web
development penetration testing and
finally I'm here with a comprehensive
training on Android build 10 apps my
speciality is to teach the toughest
topic in a fun and engaging manner so
that learning becomes a fun experience
and you get the subject as well in this
course I'll watch you through with
building the process of 10 different
apps each app is completely different
from the other app in one app we are
going to focus on animation that other
app is going to focus on sound and
audios and videos if one app is focusing
on audios and videos another one is
going to focus on GPS and navigation and
so far and so forth in every app you
will have a complete different
experience and will learn new knowledge
about the Android development process
and life cycle of the Android this
course is perfectly designed to make
sure that people who are completely a
big nerd can learn Android development
I'll walk you through with installation
to the firebase step by step process
none of the step is being skipped in any
video all the videos are sequence ly
arranged so that you can understand
right from the scratch to the end
process of developing and designing a
complete app the best part of this
training is firebase now I know a lot of
you want to learn about the firebase
which is the most demanding back-end
skill and technology firebase makes it
easy to maintain authentication login
from Google login from Facebook and
other such things we will also learn
quite a lot in detail about the firebase
authentication database storage and all
the other things that you require at the
beginner level to create your app and
push it
is a Google Playstore a common question
is what is the prerequisite for this
course now although this course comes
with no prerequisite at all but I do
require you to have basic knowledge how
the Android device works not
programmatically but simply how the feel
and look of the Android device look in
your hand any device will work now you
don't need any specific device for this
course because Android gives you Android
studio gives you the emulators in which
you can run all of your code in a
virtual device the only thing that I
expect with students is open mind to
learn and determination that I'm going
to finish this course if you do have
prior programming experience that is
good but that is not at all a
requirement as we are dealing up with a
Java from the scratch completely as a
bigness perspective now in case you are
interested to check out what is the
curriculum of this course how the course
looks like there is a link in the
description below check that out check
