again with another video in this video I
want to talk about Internet yes a very
special thing about Internet which is
giving you another chance now I haven't
seen that Internet has given like much
of the open wide right arm open
opportunity to anybody - just relaunch
or anything it's really a harsh place
now what I'm saying will make a lot of
sense once we move on and jump on to the
topic itself so I was reading the blog
of Mozilla website and I read that
Mozilla has actually launched or
relaunched their browser completely with
new design new fresh design and
everything like that
it was interesting in case you are also
connected with me on my Facebook page or
Twitter I have posted that as well now
the reason why I make I want to make
this video is I want to give you the
first look of the complete redesign and
revamping of their product here now the
reason why I am so excited about this
new Mozilla product is what I think
about the Internet is it really gives
you a second chance just to prove my
point there was a website first of all
which say is hi-5 then myspace came into
existence then or could came into
existence and then after Facebook came
into existence and still now one of the
biggest social media website social
networking website and now twitter is
gaining popularity and once people
actually moved to Twitter they really
come back to Facebook and things happens
on the internet like that once you move
on into that doesn't give you a chance
back to roll on similar thing happened
that first of all it was Internet
Explorer almost all cyber cafes and
everybody has Internet Explorer there
and then things came upon into mozilla
firefox'
a long era came on for Mozilla Firefox
everybody used it then came into
existence chrome now on the side-by-side
there were a lot of browsers like opera
and Safari which tried it really hard
there but actually struggled in becoming
the people's favorite choice and chrome
did it and somehow it becames people's
friendly choice yet everybody knows that
chrome is actually faring a lot onto
your RAM it's a ram
browser here and that's not a kind of a
fact that I'm telling you which you
didn't know already you already knew
that it consumes a lot of RAM while on
the other hand Mozilla Firefox got a
little bit odd outdated they're now
bringing up this this blog here I was
reading that surprisingly I was reading
it on Chrome no big deal there so they
have actually didn't launched a new
Firefox here and being a being a person
who actually loved Firefox in the early
days I would be someone who actually
would like to give a chance to Firefox
again as compared to Chrome again chrome
is a really RAM hungry browser I really
don't want to use it but there was no
good option there it was the best and
again so they have promised that they
have redesigned everything there is a
nice video here as well and then a lot
of things are coming up here so I
thought why not to give it a chance to
download the latest Mozilla Firefox and
in front of you I explode all the things
here so I give it a go I installed it
for many Mac users it's really fine just
drag and drop it it's just installs like
that okay cool so now let me just try to
launch the Firefox and once I launched
it at the very first time I was amazed
at how fast a browser can launch so let
me open up my launchpad and let's click
on the Firefox I can ready three two one
go
clicked and it's up really fast
not the fastest on the planet but yes I
would say it I felt it must move faster
as Chrome and everything yes this is not
a comparison like setting a timer and
everything but yes I do feel that it's
really faster now one thing that has
impressed me here is the amount of
Liberty that this browser gives to us
for example I want to search for me and
oops
I want to search for here if I can write
my name properly come on now this gives
you a Liberty to search directly from
your in URL that's good and also it
gives you the Liberty maybe you want to
search on Google Yahoo Bing directly on
Amazon dr. go Twitter or maybe Wikipedia
I absolutely love this freedom it should
be totally in the hands of user that
where you want to search yes
typically everybody searches on Google
but maybe it can save like two or three
seconds that I'm looking for a laptop I
can directly type laptop and can look
for Amazon and can directly search on it
like this feature right now most of the
time we all know we are gonna go on to
the Google stuff but yes it's blazingly
fast now let's also explore the option
of this menu yes we have a private
window also known as incognito mode in
Chrome but we all know the truth about
how private the Internet is regardless
of that now one feature that they are
bragging quite a lot is the customized
feature now what's impressive about this
customized feature is let's just say we
want this fullscreen option to be at the
top you can just drag and drop it at the
top
voila you have your new menu bar of
course you can include a lot of features
directly your plugins and add-ons can be
put up there that's awesome that's cool
but unlike the way how the things can be
rearranged just wherever you want it
maybe you want a preference thing here
at the top or maybe a download thing you
don't like it it's it's so cool this
kind of Liberty I like it I absolutely
love this okay there are a lot of new
new options here like you can go into
the Preferences can check out that what
should be your default browsers or what
can be a default search engine current
page and whatnot rest of the stuff is
really good and this also brings us to
our one thing back that yes Internet is
brutal place it doesn't gives you back
much chances that you can try again to
be the famous and the talk of the town
again but I think I personally think
that Mozilla did it again and very soon
in the future I think with this
blazingly faster speed
it's gonna be really the most favorite
browser again for all the people and yes
the 90s kid who are programming still
will absolutely love this because it was
the browser which was the most popular
in that era like 2000 ish I absolutely
love that in that era so these are my
quick words not quick words a long video
about things that I loved about
mozilla firefox i would highly recommend
to give it a try the new mozilla firefox
i think you'll love it and as a
developer programmer as well it's not at
all again a nightmare for developers and
designers actually web celeb websites do
run really smoothly on it and actually
it's much more faster even with hundreds
of tab being open as said by mozilla so
with this that's it for this video - hit
the subscribe button in case you're new
at this channel and just like always
I'll surely catch you up in the next
