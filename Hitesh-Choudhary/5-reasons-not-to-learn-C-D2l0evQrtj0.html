have some serious problem but see no I
don't have I just see the things in
reality so I would like to discuss here
the five reasons not to learn C
programming as a beginner this is very
debatable some of you might take a side
of the C language and say hey this is a
great programming language you should
start learning from it and blah blah
blah bout that but today in this
controversy I'm gonna take against the C
and I'm gonna stand against it so let's
get started with the seat and before we
even get started with the five reasons I
would like to say that I studied C as
them as my first programming language
and if you'll do masters or your dog
trade you might already be familiar with
the concept of designing your modern
compilers and C is inevitable for that
so I studied see a lot I have designed
compilers in it and even some
server-side codes I have that I have
written in the C so I do know the C
quite well and I have taught the C for
let's say over 10,000 or 20,000 students
out there I do like the language but not
in this era so let's get started with
the five reason you should not get
started with the C so the reason number
one my first problem with the C is the
memory allocation and I'm not talking
about the people who have just written a
hundred line of code or I just have
taught C for their whole life I'm
talking about writing thousands and
thousands of lines of codes in the sea
you know what I'm talking about
don't just avoid it you know what I'm
talking about them memory allocation
sometimes you just allocate too little
sometime you just allocate too much and
base to memory and all the time you are
just worried about the memory memory and
the memory there are various toolkits or
frameworks that are written totally
dedicated that are all the time just
worried about how much memory you have
God and how much memory are freed upon
and sometimes you just free the memory
twice and even if you have a memory
freed up some time you are always
worried whether I should initialize it
whether eyes
and up to the zero or maybe I should
free them or when should I pre it up so
memory allocation is really fuckin in
the sea I have many other problems to
get worried about sometimes my logic
even sucks so I have to I have different
problems to get worried about and memory
allocation is not the thing that I
always want to look around it and if you
have designed any debugger or maybe
simply a unit testing program or
something like that you know what I'm
talking about memory allocation really
sucks and even I would recommend that
the guy who have actually designed the
automatic memory allocations and
deallocations just give him a price he
deserve that
the biggest problem in the sea is the
memory allocation the problem number two
that I have with the C programming is
multi-threading now we you won't get me
much if you haven't heard about the
terms like deadlock or something like
that
and if you'll study a little bit deep
about the C maybe in the masters or
maybe a higher education than that then
you will realize that multi-threading is
not at all something that is meant for
the C yes it was those good ol days when
there was no parallel programming or
parallel machines in which you have to
run a lot of code and if you've written
those codes in the C your life is just
like a hell believe me it is really at
that deadlock Hal okay so
multi-threading is something that you
should never ever try in the C because
there will be conflicts you cannot avoid
them and it doesn't really separate all
the threads so concurrency will occur
deadlocks will occur and you cannot
avoid them maybe you might be thinking I
am talking too much technical stuff out
there but yes this is a problem
multi-threading is not at all a piece of
cake for the C programming
I don't even recommend other high as
some of the higher languages like Java
is also not at all good in doing
parallel programming stuff like that I
have tried it on my machine it doesn't
really work unless you are using the
latest Java X dot concurrent and stuff
like that but
let's not get too much of the technical
stuff out there I don't want to brag
about it but yes multi-threading do
sucks in the sea problem number three
that I have with the sea is the pointers
and you know what I'm talking about if
they were so good why didn't all their
the programming language like Java
Python didn't adopted it because they
were evil there is no good way of saying
about it and I don't like them honestly
they create so much of the chaos that
you cannot avoid it
sometimes you're worried about what kind
of value you are gonna get and is it
gonna be referenced outside the memory
allocations and things like that so I
don't want to brag a lot about the
pointers but yes they are evil they are
the some people say they are very good
very marvelously but no I don't consider
them just try to write a debugger and
that uses a lot of the pointers or even
write a compiler that uses a lot of
simply same pointers you will really get
frustrated with that I did that I tried
a lot of pointers astatically arranging
them the things and sometimes I do
return a random value see if there are
programmers which are pretty cute pretty
handsome in the programming with the
pointers but yes I do have a lot of
other things to get worried about I do
have a lot of choice in the present
scenario and that is the reason why I
don't like pointers reason number for
that I have a little bit of the problem
with the C is premature optimization yes
I don't like it much the C programming
is a great language don't get me wrong
here but sometimes there are some
premature optimization in the language
specially in the case of the loops now
you might have already heard about that
sometimes referencing to the pointers or
referencing to the array we try to get
the value as quick as possible and who
haven't tried to run the loop fast in
the C you might have tried it the upside
loop or the downside you just in the way
just in the sake of writing it faster or
just running it faster we all have tried
it don't get me wrong but yes I do know
that the helga rhythms are actually the
key to right the past two loops there is
memory there's a data structure that I
need to follow up some loops are faster
some mechanism are faster some are not
but again talking in general if you make
any benchmark press out there I feel
sometimes that the plea is a little bit
premature optimized language and
sometimes especially in the case of
loopings it does fall a little bit back
and the loops are not that much fast as
in the other language but yes again I
completely agree with you that this is
totally dependent on the algorithm and
what kind of machines you are working on
but yes little bit things could have
been optimized in the C if you talk
about the optimization of the line now
the reason number 5 that I don't like
the C is the unit testing ok let's just
start it with from you name the favorite
unit test framework or editor or tool
that you have used to debug your C
programs or just to do a unit test in
the C program ok I know there isn't even
any out there that is my problem with
the C now unit test I do agree that unit
test was not at all a concept which was
there in the early 70s but nowadays it
is an essential requirement if you want
to design any anything out there unit
testing is something that everyone
should understand everyone should learn
without that there is nothing gonna be
good for you so if you want a good life
just go ahead and learn some of the unit
testing which are damn easy in languages
like Swift or maybe Python and there are
tons of other languages which deals up
with the unit testing quite easily there
are tons of frameworks and tools which
can talk about and do a lot of stuff
about the unit testing but in the sieve
it's a complete headache even if you got
through it I didn't got to there and I
limped the language out there ok so
these are my top 5 reasons why I don't
like the C and I don't recommend the big
manners to at least get started with the
language in the early days we didn't
have the much option to learn other
languages but in the present scenario we
have tons of options tons of good and
great programming language are there so
you can get started without wit there
I did started with the C because it was
there in my curriculum and I enjoyed it
a lot but I could have done a lot better
if I would have some other knowledge of
the other programming language okay some
of you might be talking about the stuff
that universities do recommend to learn
C as their first programming language
don't get me wrong but when did those
university actually updated their
syllabus or the curriculum probably five
years ago or probably 10 years ago so
judge it by yourself that you should go
with them or not
tons of universities are moving towards
the modern languages and that is
actually a very great move according to
me but again it's totally on you decide
yourself whether you should follow those
universities who have updated their
curriculum maybe ten years ago or maybe
fifteen years ago even at that time the
programming languages like Swift or
maybe C sharp or maybe the Python but
not even born so decide yourself where
you want to go so these are my top five
reasons why you should not get started
with other C but feel free to just
comment down below I would like to
really have a debate on this and maybe
in the future I can dedicate a video for
five reasons you should learn C but
that's gonna be dependent on you don't

going with the technical talks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
