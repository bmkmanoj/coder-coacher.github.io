with another video and in this video I
want to talk about an incident this
incident recently happened to one of my
student who went into a starter for the
interview of a front-end developer
although this specific topic of
front-end developer was not mentioned in
the email so I am just assuming it based
on the context but you're gonna learn a
lot in this video about what is the
scenario of working at a start-up
front-end development Photoshop Adobe XD
and couple of more stuff as well as well
as I'm gonna try to give you some of the
hints and tips about the job interview
aspects as well so this video is totally
dedicated for all the students who are
into college right now or are seeking
for their very first job for all those
people who are already working at a
company or have passed this phase this
video is not for you so let's get
started
before we even begin to start reading
this email I want to mention that this
student is being touched with me for a
long time through the email conversation
I'm highly active on my Facebook page as
well so he messaged me quite a lot on my
Facebook page as well let's comment on
my video that's why I just remember his
name and he he thoughts quite a lot
interact quite a lot with me so that's
why it was really easy for me to pick up
his email and talk about this particular
situation now let's go ahead and first
read this very interesting incident
about the start of job interview so this
is the email and once I read the email
I'll point out some of the things you
can underline here so today I gave
interview in one of the startup company
they say if you don't know Photoshop
then you cannot deal with a client how
can you show website design and I say it
Adobe XD and I'm learning it they say I
am from another planet is this right sir
and my question is can i edit photos in
photo Adobe XD now a few points you can
underline here right now is startup
company Photoshop website design Adobe
XD so now let's go ahead and first of
all move on now first of all answering
to your question no you cannot edit your
photos in Adobe XD Adobe XD and sketch
are a completely different thing they
were never meant to edit the photos okay
now clearing this up this is not just
the whole answer for your question
now let's discuss little bit about your
situation as well as the situation of
this company as well whatever that
company is before we even talk about
this company let's move on and talk
about interviews in general now
interviews can be sometime little bit
harsh and the person who is taking the
interview can say some of the mean stuff
to you I highly recommend to be prepared
according to that so prepare your mind
according to that that yes some
interviewer can be absolutely mean to
you and that's okay that's fine and I
would also like to mention that it's
gonna be less humiliating as compared to
your college-y ba now yes I although I
really appreciate that some people
really thinks that yes we were at one
point of time just beginners like who is
sitting in front of us and they give
equal amount of respect to their
if they want to say no they just clearly
mentioned that no we don't want to hire
you and that's okay but some people like
to be mean and you cannot just change
the whole world there they are going to
remain like that so make sure you are
prepared that some people can be
absolutely terrifyingly mean to you and
you're ready for that now moving on to
the point where we are saying that these
are the couple of points which I
mentioned to underline first of all it's
a startup company now when you are
applying on a startup then I hope you
everybody knows that you will have a lot
of responsibilities on your shoulders
it's not going to be just like you will
be getting hired for a website design
front-end or probably just back-end or
probably UX UI design because startups
cannot afford much of the people so they
like to put a lot of responsibilities on
a very less number of people probably
your front-end designer is going to be
handling your UI UX part as well the
front-end part as well maybe a lot of
back-end part as well as well as the
client interaction as well so depend on
what kind of scale the startup is
growing so you might have a lot of
responsibilities and probably the
interviewer here is trying to give or
seek a person who can handle his clients
UI you expert the website design
interaction with the client might be
some of the database part as well so
again if you are not ready for that kind
of stuff obviously you should not apply
for these kind of specific startup as
well but not we cannot simply say that
we cannot judge all the startup based on
this some startup are really like they
do understand that for every aspect of
this type of work there is different
person meant for that and there should
be different jobs for that now as I
always say the more technologies you're
going to have under your belt it's going
to be easier for you to get hired but
again projecting any person based on
that hey you don't know Photoshop and
you know you're trying to learn dobe XD
I don't think so it's a good valid point
to judge anybody because if you want
somebody who can work on Photoshop and
illustrator probably you're looking for
a designer not a programmer because
usually programmers plays a different
part if you can get like who can do both
of the work that's marvelous that's
amazing but again these are two
different kinds of people designers and
programmers
just onto the sidelines there is another
question waiting for us in this
particular contest which is is Photoshop
enough or you should be learning Adobe
XD or not and if you are learning Adobe
XD are you from another planet or not
now I would be saying hey what what you
are talking about in here
if Photoshop could have done all the job
which were meant for Adobe XD Adobe is
not at all an idiot who would be
launching another product just to
compete with Photoshop know Adobe is
really smart company there are a lot of
tasks that were meant to be done by
Sketch and Adobe XD and Adobe saw that
and they realized that Photoshop is
really an overkill thing for these kinds
of stuff like website designs app design
and all these stuff so that's why they
have launched a separate product and
it's not the fault of the person who is
giving interview to you that he's aware
about these tech stuff like sketch and
Adobe XD and you don't know about that
you're still living just on Photoshop
now this doesn't means I'm saying that
Photoshop cannot do website design and
all these stuffs yes it plays it's very
vital and crucial role in that but now
industry shifting towards sketch and
Adobe XD for website design and AB
design because it saves a lot of time
for everybody so that's why it's doing
it so all I want to say to this person
is first of all don't get disheartened
interviews can be sometime mean and I
have seen a lot of them yes they are
mean but on top of that there is nothing
to be disheartened here at least you
have learned one more thing that how it
can happen so nothing is there to lose
you only have gained one thing which is
known as experience so don't get
disheartened work a little bit harder
build more of your portfolio and
remember what you have done most of
people haven't done that most of the
people are still on even on the learning
phase they are thinking about to learn
you are really advanced as compared to
them you have learned the things you
have prepared your portfolio and you
have even given your very first
interview that means a lot so don't get
disheartened if somebody couldn't
understand you just go ahead move on
apply for more companies and I'm pretty
sure pretty sure that you're gonna nail
down to this interview what is coming up
afterwards ok so let's just summarize
quickly the
what points we have learned here the
number one point we have learned it's
amazing that you have went out and have
given your interview that means you have
learned something you have prepared your
portfolio and you have given you a very
first interview so congratulation on
that a lot of people just fail even to
do that so we have learned that it's
better always to go out and get
interview and learn more things the
second point that you have learned that
yes if you are looking forward for the
front-end design things like Adobe XD
and Photoshop are really important I'm
not saying you probably always should
learn Photoshop but a few basics are
okay but don't listen to that interview
on this particular point go ahead keep
going with Adobe XD or sketch it's
really amazing it's useful and I'm
pretty sure that somebody would
appreciate this knowledge and the third
and the most important thing that we
have learned here is don't ever ever get
disheartened with these kinds of main
words that people just say in the
interviews yes it is less humiliating as
compared to the college drivers and some
of you might be getting connected with
me there but anyways regardless of that
don't ever get disheartened there today
probably might not be your day but it's
gonna come up very soon so keep going
keep giving this interviews and I'm
pretty sure you're gonna send me an
email very soon that yes I got my very
first job so that's it for this video I
hope you have enjoyed this video give it
a thumbs up in case you have enjoyed it
