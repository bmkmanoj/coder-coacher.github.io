exciting new course code chat app where
we're going to design three Android
application to take your Android
development game from level 1 to level 2
my name is Satish and I have been
programming for over 10 years now I have
created some of the best and
life-changing online boot camps on web
Android and iOS thousands of students
have so far reached to the Google Play
Store Android App Store and have created
countless website my speciality is to
teach the toughest topic in a easiest
manner so that learning becomes fun and
engaging and I am back with an another
exciting curves to take your Android
game to the next level in this course
we're gonna design 3 Android application
the first application is going to be a
chat application where two or more than
two people can chat together of course
we are not going to be creating any
rivalry for whatsapp or any other such
chatting application because that kind
of project take months and year to
design but of course this is going to be
a working prototype of chat application
using firebase database since a chat
application involves a lot of elements
such as the workflow of designing a
simple chat application the speech
bubbles as well as how to have a custom
ListView and adapters therefore we're
going to take a break from this
application in the middle of the course
and we'll be designing a dummy phone
application where we are going to learn
how this custom ListView and adapter
works together after this easiest
implementation of ListView and adapter
we'll be jumping back in our chat
application so that we can finish it up
this second phone book application is
just designed so that first you can
implement the things in the easiest way
and then can implement that in a big
scale like a chat application in the
third app we are going to design a very
unique thing all social login this app
will be able to allow you to log in
through your email your Google accounts
your Facebook account your Twitter
account as well as we're gonna do a
phone authentication as well yes you'll
be able to send a code to the phone and
based on that code you'll be able to
authenticate a user this is a really
relatively a new way of authenticating
using firebase it has been done in the
past but with the firebase this has been
recently implemented the
is a really exciting course the workflow
of any project really matters a lot but
apart from workflow we will also be
digging together into the documentation
and I'll be providing you a lot of such
ahead resources so that you can learn
before me also you're gonna spend a
little bit time on the Stack Overflow
and hunting for the solution as well as
the debugging process of an application
the ideal student for this course is
somebody who is having the basic
knowledge of Android development for all
the students who are still struggling
with installing the Android studio this
course is not for you as the
installation part of Android studio is
not gonna be covered this is a course
which takes your level from level one to
level two not from level zero to level
one so make sure you do understand that
how to create a hello world application
in Android as well as to run that on
emulator this is a course which is going
to challenge you challenge here to
become better developer you will be
reading a lot of documentation you'll be
spending a lot of time in Stack Overflow
for debugging your application this will
take you to the next level for sure and
let's also answer the most important
question here will I become an absolute
pro after taking this course no not at
all you'll be just taken from level 1 to
level 2 you will surely a better
developer but this doesn't means you'll
become an ultimate pro developer
becoming a pro developer takes a lot of
efforts lot of hard works and of course
a lot of debugging skill but this is a
step in the right direction link to the
course is in the description section
below and I'm looking forward to catch
you up inside the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
