the WordPress series now this is not a
video where we discuss something about
WordPress is technically it's about the
WordPress but it's not actually learning
something it is about dealing up with
some of the issues that you will be
facing if you have installed the
WordPress on the localhost okay now if
you're following along with me with me
in this series you have installed a
WordPress on your localhost and you
might be facing a couple of issues which
are really really common with the latest
updates on the Sam I have been hanging
around on the Apache friends a page and
the discussion forum for quite a long
time and I am aware that these are
situations and I will tell you how we
are gonna deal with that first of all
what is the situation now the first
situation is you cannot add any images
or you cannot actually update any kind
of thing here like for example if I just
look for the all post and go up here and
maybe you want to add some media to your
things obviously the obvious thing is to
click on add media and you might want to
drag and drop something here now I have
this lovely image which I have just
assigned in canva which is my first post
by the way canva.com is a free resource
I often used to design and edit all of
my images so there we go
and if any drag and drop this image it
will not take this image just because it
was not able to create these directories
and folder because of the permission
issues this is not the only issue since
our WordPress on the localhost doesn't
have enough permission to create folders
or add some files it will also not be
able to create the folders like test and
upgrade and in resultant after this when
he'll go on to the dashboard and we'll
try to hit the update and even if you'll
try to update a from a wordpress version
X to Y it is going to give you a problem
for example if I just hit there and
update it is first of all going to ask
you for the host name and the password
and all these things and even if you try
to proceed further somehow you have
figured out the username and password it
will not allow you to create a folder
name a test and the name damp the EMP
sorry DM
temp there and a folder named as upgrade
without this your theme or your plug-in
cannot be upgraded okay okay there are a
couple of situations by which you can
actually handle that and let me just
show you that even if you have launched
your lamp here and let's just say you
are technical geeky into the Linux world
you have went into the EDC and you have
opened up this pro AF TBD config file
and let me open that it up in my sublime
text there open that up and there we go
if I open that up you'll see there are
options here where from which you can
actually do that but again why am I
telling all of it is the number one
reason I'm telling you this because as
instructor I feel that my job is not to
just teach the thing my job is to teach
the things in such a fluid and easy
manner that everybody should be shouting
hey that was damn easy and somehow this
is not possible in this particular case
I have to throw up a commands like chmod
and explain your permissions which will
deviate us from the topic of learning
WordPress so as a solution what I
present to you here is just ignore all
of these updates and adding up the
things into the WordPress on a local
host website as of now and later on we
will be moving on to a real actual
domain where we'll be learning how to
install these WordPress how to add
images and how to update all of these
things in plugins very soon we'll be
moving up there and these things are not
even an issue on to a real web server
right now due to some like non
thoughtful updates in the Sam please
issues have been created but they are
actually good for us okay so this video
is just to tell you that yes these are
issues I am aware of them and you don't
need to worry much about them as of now
let's just learn as much as possible on
the localhost and then we will be moving
our entire work on to an actual website
actual web server and I'll walk you
through with the process of installing a
WordPress website on a real server as
well as how we can add plugins and
images there and as well as how we can
configure the entire website as kind of
a real job for a client okay so this was
the only thing I wanted to convey to you
through this video so
worry I am here to take care of
everything don't worry just keep on
moving and now let's just go back and
carry on with our actual learning stuff
or what off WordPress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
