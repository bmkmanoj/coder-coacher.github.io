again with another video and I have a
big update for all of you ladies and
gentlemen we are finally moving into
version 2 of learn code online dot Ian
you might be asking what is version 2
now in case you have watched my previous
video I have always told you that
version 1 is always bad it's not that
much polished it's not that much awesome
feeling and all that but as soon as you
progress you work on onto a product keep
going on with that it automatically gets
involved it becomes beautiful it becomes
so much amazing and on that particular
track we are finally onto the version 2
of learn code online I'm not saying this
is the most perfect version obviously in
the future it's gonna grow up quite a
lot but with this I have a couple of
announcements to make so let's get
started with the number one first update
is a big update in our Android app now
you might have seen that previously I
have rolled out an Android app that was
ok not good but it was just doing its
job not so much perfect but again it was
just a beta test and nothing is awesome
at the version 1 so finally we have a
better updated app this app is faster
much more awesome and performance much
more awesome in UI UX and readability
perspective as well within this app you
will be now able to login with the
Facebook with the Google and your
regular email login will also work yes
I'm aware that a lot of you faced some
issues with the Google login and yes I
do hear a lot about all of the things
that you are saying and a lot of people
just post their reviews a lot of people
just message me personally or post on my
facebook wall I read all of that and
that is why we have much better and all
the problems of Google login are now
being resolved apart from the login we
have now also introduced the in-app
purchase from the Google a lot of people
who are not from India are also being
saying that hey we want to make a
purchase we are not able to do so so yes
finally from within the app using in-app
purchase you can do your purchase and
everything yes the debit cards and
everything on the website will remain
exactly same so yes the topmost priority
was to solve the problem of Indian user
that is
still here and we have already worked
quite a lot on it and finally the Indian
users will be able to just purchase like
whatever they were doing existing ly
that's completely okay but now all the
other people will be able to purchase
those courses from within the app as
well
and apart from purchasing things
everything is flawless and smooth you'll
be able to see what is the course
content what is the validity of the
course what are the common FA cues in
the course as well as you will be able
to watch videos make notes as well as
discussed in the discussion section
the discussion section in the app has
been improved quite a lot and this means
I'll be able to hang out into the
discussion section of all the courses
more often because it's now in the app
and while traveling or on to the airport
I'm able to just see the discussion
section and I'll be able to answer more
frequently and more often there this
simply means more awesome courses and
more support and I'll be personally
there with you in case you already have
the learn code online app that's awesome
go ahead do the update and in case you
still don't have the learn code online
app leave a link in the description as
well as on the screen go ahead download
the app make sure you throw some kind
ratings it's because all of your support
that we are moving into such a big
update update number 2 finally we have a
brand new website for learn code online
dot in this website is much more
optimized for the mobile users and
you'll be able to find links easily like
the links for the blog links for the
Android app or other such things is far
more easier on the website version the
next up version of the website I have
introduced the learning paths so that
you can find out that hey I want to go
into web development or I want to learn
Android development which are the most
courses that I should be taking up so
all these things are making much more
senses also most important part is the
FA cues I have included a lot of epic
use that were the common questions about
the platform about some courses common
questions like Mac vs. Windows or should
I buy which Mac laptop which Android
laptop or Windows laptop all these
things are actually sorted out and are
placed at one single place that is FAQ
now these are not just the only epic use
this will get evolved as we progress and
prob
we can do something more bigger than
this so this will be a common place to
hang out and see most of your common
questions so that you can get answered
quickly by the way the fa Q's are also
being added into each and every courses
so that most of your common question can
be answered directly there whether it's
a common question like for the iOS users
or the Apple course user it's a common
question that can I take this course on
Windows and my honest answer is no I
don't recommend that so all these things
are already being added in each and
every course into the FAQ section third
and update for all the iOS user I know a
lot of iOS users were complaining that
hey in the very very quick span of time
you have released two updates for the
Android app but still not even a single
app for the iOS yes I have been hearing
for you and I have actually finally
replied it by saying that yes it's gonna
come up very soon I have already started
working on the iOS app and very soon
you're gonna see the iOS app as well I
promise you it's gonna come up but yes
things actually take sometimes a little
bit of the time with work and all these
things to manage around but new excuses
for that I'm working every single day
for it and very soon I'll make a video
updating all of you that yes
iOS app is also gonna come up wait for
it it's going to come up learn code
online dot in is a successful project
that is all being successful because of
you and really I want to give you some
of the inside stats that are going on at
learned code online and finally at
learned code online we have crossed
almost more than 10,000 registered users
and these are all students were crazy
about learning they spend a huge amount
of time on the website and with that I
see almost every single day at least
2,000 regular visitors are there on
every single day and if I'll just take
on to a weekly stats it becomes insanely
high now all these 10,000 registered
user I I really don't care what kind of
course they are purchasing what is their
choice of learning whether it's Java or
JavaScript or Android or iOS all I care
about is they are very keen and very
interested in learning and I have proved
it here that at learn code online I
don't
impose any kind of fear learning I
impose inspiring learning when people
are inspired to learn they learn
actually I'm not imposing any 75%
compulsory attendance or I'm not
imposing any kind of compulsory
assignment still every single day I
receive at least 50 assignment
submission whether it's a web
application just a simple code or maybe
a screenshot of iOS app or Android app
every single day more than 50 this is a
big number where I'm not saying that hey
you have to compulsory attend your class
or I have to I don't have to say hey
it's compulsory to submit that
assignment and still students are
learning that is the difference between
the fear learning and something known as
inspiring learning so I request all of
the teachers all around the globe all
universities hey don't impose the fear
learning student learn their best when
they are inspired not being feared and
honestly I can say in your face
attendance rule we have actually imposed
a successful learning system here at
learn code online just with inspiring
things I'm really happy to see that
students are making such a big progress
students are reaching to the AppStore
student are reaching to the Google
Playstore their own website their own
portfolio getting jobs only because of
their skills and not making any
placements or anything here but since
they have their knowledge they have
something that they can show to the
users they are getting jobs and
everything I'm really thrilled and
excited to share all of these updates
for sure we have to grow up quite a lot
and there is a long journey to carry out
and I'm pretty sure all of you are gonna
be with me in this amazing journey this
has all been possible because of you
