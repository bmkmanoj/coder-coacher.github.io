months I guess so
but moving apart from that happy Diwali
a belated happy Diwali to every single
one of you and there are a few quick
updates that I wanted to share with you
and I will be waiting for a few people
to show up we will be building up the
audience and then I have few amazing
announcement regarding the Sunday live
so people for those who people are will
be watching this stream later on let me
start with that that Sunday live is now
moving to Sunday trainings and there are
a few things that we need to set up here
but the good news is that we will be
coming up with Sunday trainings now what
is going to be happening in those Sunday
trainings in those Sunday trainings we
will be hosting sessions that will be
working out on building up some products
products like designing a simple Android
app that will give you some insights of
how the Android apps are being designed
some web applications some PHP code some
front-end some back-end some iOS app a
lot more some node.js application
react.js application yes of course it
will be previously announced that what
is going to happen and a lot more will
be updated later on so that's all I I
think I'm not going okay there is
something wrong going on I guess with a
live stream because I cannot see people
showing up okay now it's suddenly is
going up and it is going back down just
like that so let's just wait for a
couple of more seconds to get up on to
life and then we'll see what is
happening okay let's just wait for a few
more minutes here before we get live
here okay so now our life is actually
working properly yeah I can see you
people now I wish our a Hayek shirt I
Gurmeet okay so now I can see hey
everybody how is
going on I'm from Hyderabad big fan of
you thank you so much I would love to
visit Heather about someday okay nice
haircut okay thank you you noticed it
just got it thank you so much only gray
yes of course
what could be better than this you know
hey everyone hey hey hey everyone you
can hit like button now I can see all of
you I would be telling up one update
again I have already told this update
but looks like there was some glitch in
showing up the notification of my
livestream first and foremost important
thing we are fixing up the time of
Sunday life not Sunday like basically
it's going to be Sunday training so what
is the topic for today the topic is
important updates that I wanted to share
with you for the upcoming things for
Sunday life okay so let us start with
that so first and foremost update is
Sunday live is moving into Sunday
trainings now what we are going to do in
these trainings we are going to learn us
some topics on that it can be as simple
as HTML or as complex as designing a
full-fledged app in Android or iOS so
this is an important update and I think
you should keep in this mind that we
will have limited seats for that kind of
Sunday life and of course it's going to
be initially it's going to be free for
everyone but since we do have limited
seats it's going to be little bit
troublesome you will get all those
notification and everything in advance
on my channel that what we are going to
come up examples of something could be a
simple login page a simple login system
on Android a simple login system on
maybe iOS app react.js app nodejs
bootstrap it will be it will be like
this so every Sunday will be much more
productive yes I will be hosting these
kinds of sessions where I can talk to
you and can have interaction can solve
your problems can answer your questions
and everything like that but yes kind of
in the in the future we will be moving
on to Sunday trainings
and the whole idea of this channel is to
be as productive as possible so within
just spending one hour or two are with
me on the Sundays you are going to learn
something that can be simple as a login
system on Android on iOS on web or maybe
a lot of projects that we are going to
deal up with that okay so now with this
update I will be sharing more updates
like that later on in the future now
let's take up some questions okay should
I prepare for gate if you are looking up
to prepare for gate just start doing
that stop everything else new t-shirt
nope it's it's old one I do have many
great t-shirts some are full sleeves and
some are like shorter ones okay please
tell about node.js node.js is kind of a
modern back-end system which is almost
kind of acting as an alternative for PHP
not exactly a detonator for PHP but it's
it's a kind of a complete setup for
server-side setup and yes that's
basically your node.js if you want to
learn more about node.js visit learn
code online dot n and you will be there
are you from Bangalore nope I'm not in
Bangalore right now I'm in jabber right
now and I am from Jaipur thank you so
much for Android courses I bought it
yesterday a sampreeth just quick updates
more some awesome courses are under plan
they are going to come up very soon
right now we are already having a Java
bootcamp already running which is going
at really good speed but more awesome
courses on Android as well as coming up
can you show us how to create Android
app using Python just to answer you
Ganesh there I would not do that
so why simply because Python is an
amazing language but doing all the
things with Python is not a great choice
so what I would recommend you is going
to be simply that learn the language
which is made specifically designed for
that purpose Android works really great
if you are using like Java Kotlin or
react native or xamarin these are
platforms which are designed for that
Python doesn't really serve that well
okay please tell me I learned first
Python or Java and which version do I
Python 2 or 3 Java 8 or 9 you can start
with any of them there is no such a big
deal with that if you're starting with
the Python there is only one choice that
I would recommend to you Python 3 no
question asked no question answered just
go for Python 3 that's all if you're
starting with the Java it doesn't really
matter with the which from which version
you are getting start at 8 or 9 because
the Java 9 is like just a additional
over layer on the Java 8 all the
features like your functions your loops
your variables your classes objects
polymorphism abstraction everything
works really great in Java 8 as well as
in 9 doesn't really matter the
additional feature I probably probably
think that you won't be using that at
initial stage so don't be like that much
guy who just keep on thinking just start
with any Java version you will be ok ok
please tell about the spray scope of
spring and hibernate I don't work on
spring and hibernate I don't like those
platforms doesn't means that they are
bad they are great but I feel that for
web development and something other
things are really awesome compared to
spring and hibernate things like a react
Cheers no Cheers angular they're pretty
much amazing grow beard bro you look
good in beard I think this much is
enough because last time I started to
grow a beard it just grows like that I
became Santa Claus I don't want to do
that again ok
what is reactive Java we will talk about
the reactive implementation in a lot of
programming language maybe in some other
videos not right now what about the PHP
scope let me tell you one thing PHP I
started my things all of the things with
PHP and MySQL stuff PHP gives you a
great amount of base in getting started
in web development once you have the
thorough knowledge of PHP and MySQL it
would be so simpler and so easy to move
on in any other platform it can be ionic
it can be angular it can be react react
yes No
because the concepts are same the
concepts always remains the same so I
still considered as PHP is really an
amazing background to get started with
and of course when you need to create
amazing small-scale websites or maybe
you want to create some plugins for a
wordpress or something the knowledge of
PHP is kind of essential for every
programmer if you are moving trying to
move into web search completed front-end
successfully Imran congratulation first
of all that you have made it through a
very very small amount of people
actually made it through the complete
course you are one of them you should be
really proud on that but don't stop
there move on to my react.js course you
will be amazed that varies in just small
amount of time you are a full-fledged
web developer so don't stop there
keep on moving and check out my react.js
course you will love it how to survive
as a developer in USA in USA there is no
such thing as you'll survive you will
enjoy a luxurious life with the
developer profile no GS vs. firebase hey
Prasanna if I would have to get started
on my project as a small scale I would
have used firebase but if I have to move
on to a larger scale firebase actually
grows a little bit expensive as you try
to scale it up so I would have moved on
on to node.js for pigness firebase is
amazing and I highly recommend that but
if you are planning to scale up a
project at a big big scale like learn
code online dot in I would not be using
firebase for a longer period of time can
I meet you in Jaipur surely we will try
to have a jabber meetup very soon and
probably I'll offer coffee to other the
people who are coming up I will plan out
that very very soon right now it's kind
of a very busy schedule here I have to
kind of Adonai a lot of invites that are
coming up in my inbox and email recently
I said no to one of the TED talk I
really wanted to go there but you know
that time is actually very very short
here and
I have to manage everything in that so I
will try to manage that very soon in
case you are already here do hit that
like button you haven't hit that can I
see some love through that like button I
would really really like to see that
okay so come on okay now I can see that
love is coming up and it's going up so
let's answer how to create animated
splash screen in Android
anyway the splash screen are not
recommended actually because it consumes
a lot of memories slowdowns your app but
in case you want to do that it's
actually easy the same way how the
animations are being done on to a main
screen it can be done via the same
methods I don't recommend that honestly
to you it slow down your apps okay is
your course our lifetime access hey
Kiran let's first talk about this in
this entire world there is no such thing
as lifetime and unlimited everything has
kind of a it's it's somewhere hidden in
the terms and condition always all we
just there there is no such thing as
lifetime access but what mycourses comes
up with is a three-year access and if
you want more access you can always drop
me an email with the received and I can
extend your validation for the course no
charges no fees for that but I think if
you are not able to learn in 3 years I
probably thinks you will never able to
do so so but again if you want more
access than that feel free to contact me
I have no issues in that but again think
about it three years you're spending
three years in learning just one single
course I think it's a bad thing that you
are not completing it so I hope I was
able to answer this question how was
your chin a trip amazing amazing I
absolutely loved the Chennai I loved the
authentic and original dosas big fan of
that I loved it absolutely loved there
waiting for bus and watching live hey
parish and that's actually a very good
utilization of time very soon very soon
we are starting up the Sunday trainings
you will love that quite a lot
let's pick up more questions what's at
the back at you at that poster this one
this is a lot of social media website I
hope you can see them okay can you see
that and there is one more here I have
recently installed them they are pretty
pretty good and nice I like them videos
on Java videos in Java he shan't are
already getting uploaded at learned code
online dot in there is already a boot
camp going on and as we talk some videos
are getting processed and edited and
they're going to get uploaded today what
can we do with C++
with C++ probably you can design a game
in unity with c-sharp or something like
that so C++ I'm not a big fan that okay
so please talk about PHP I will be
talking a lot about PHP in the upcoming
training sessions Sunday live training
sessions whenever you come to Kolkata
for Meetup
I haven't been invited by any college in
Kolkata I have visited Kolkata once that
was just like twelve or thirteen hour
layover so I've moved around the city a
little bit haven't visited much about
the Kolkata and having hard time
understanding recyclerview probably
probably I can help you in that I'll
look it on today I think probably I can
upload some more videos in my android
course I will think about it
I'm studying Java bootcamp in LC or once
incomplete what can I do next you will
get notification in the videos that when
you are ready to move into Android yes
the course will go beyond that as well
but I think the next good move would be
to start learning Android development
thank you so much for joining at Java
bootcamp
Vignesh I will update up these videos
are getting actually edited as we talk
talking right now and this will get I
will get you notification but Android
can be the next good thing okay
oh hello sir can we link machine
learning with cybersecurity yes of
course you can in fact one of my friends
company I for
the name of that is actually doing it
already they are using AI and machine
learning in their cybersecurity space
it's amazing product recently they have
opened up an office in Paris as well
they are Bangalore base forgotten name
how can i how can I forget the name his
name is Rahul Sasi the owner of the
company I forgot the name how bad am i
how bad am I I'm making a Fitness Dex
desktop application wish me luck sir
wish you very very best of luck Gaurav
Naga I would love to see your app don't
forget to notify me on the email or on
the Facebook I would love to see that
app it's if it's amazing I would love to
make a video on that okay why you quit
from cybersecurity and similar stuff I
didn't quit totally from cybersecurity I
still do a couple of projects in that
but not much honestly speaking the
cybersecurity the community in the
cybersecurity space versus the developer
community let's let's put it in this way
that I loved the way how people were in
the developer community actually react
and the the way they behave the way they
help each other I preferred the
developer community so I moved into it I
loved it every single moment while on
the other hand the community in the
cybersecurity space it's actually good I
wouldn't call it at amazing that was one
of the reason I moved into development
and I am absolutely enjoying it every
single stuff and if you'll ask honestly
to any particular person who is into
cybersecurity Steve say this criteria he
would be saying that the number one job
is to create something and to secure it
and the more knowledge of the
development you will have the more
amazing you will become into security
space as well so that's kind of my
answer okay is go language is far
superior than Python there is no
language which is kind of a superior or
backwards all language have their own
specific purpose so you got the
there's no such thing I like that okay
so let's pick up more questions
CSS versus bootstrap GS versus jQuery
which is better if you are creating any
web application
I cannot say much about the jQuery but
you would be using CSS and bootstrap
both at the same time it's not like that
you have used the bootstrap and there is
no need of CSS yes definitely you will
need customization of the CSS so
bootstrap is going to be there and if
you're using like basics of animations
and something like that jQuery is going
to be due this year so there's no such
comparison between ten that you can use
one over the other you have to use all
of them okay
I am plus one C as a student programming
is very tough for me I would be talking
to the school students specially from
plus one and plus two students very soon
in one of the very serious video that I
really really need to talk to all the
school students it's coming up very soon
okay Red Team versus Web Apps which one
and why that's an interesting question I
won't be going much into the red teaming
I would be going more into the web apps
I absolutely loved it how the way their
web application are scaling up and how
they're competing with the Android apps
and iOS app I am I'm actually enjoying
it so no red teaming would be not my way
I would be going for web apps no
specific reasons but I would be going
with that weakness says I don't
understand alley columns not eligible to
get into the programming I would highly
recommend to check out my boot Java boot
camp I have included a lot of algorithms
and I try to explain them as well as to
write the code at the same time for
those algorithms I think this is going
to help you quite a lot ok is JavaScript
future I think so I personally think so
but I know a lot of people are going to
rant on me
that hey it's not good but I absolutely
love it I absolutely love how the
JavaScript is shaping up the future and
specially the way the es6 version is
coming up I absolutely loved it I think
J that javascript is going to shape up
the future quite a lot if not completely
it is going to affect quite a lot Java
complete course based on eight or nine
both it got started with Java 8 and
thereafter when the Java 9 was released
few updated videos are there for Java 9
as well but it doesn't really matter my
code is going to work absolutely fine in
Java 8 in Java 9 no problem at all
already being checked ok
ok in this subject should do mtech data
mining or machine learning can be good
ok what language to learn first it
depends if you are having a Mac device
kind of Apple thing I would recommend
you to get started with Swift if you're
on a Windows or something I would
recommend to get started with Python
it's really simple it's amazing and you
create really good and fast product but
I have seen a lot of people getting
started directly with Java they are
making amazing Android apps so Swift
Java and Python can be really good for
you
does the LCU Android course covers
offline complete app development I am
interested in in the course yes you are
going to create 10 apps in the Android
course but there is no such course or no
such book that is going to complete like
everything that can be possibly done in
Android but yes it's a pretty
comprehensive course I highly recommend
to check out the content it is
transparently available for everyone to
check out what you're going to learn in
that course so go ahead check that out
if it suits you
welcome mumbled ok let's pick up more
questions 1 lakh
sub soon yes I read distro we are moving
on to the final phase of the 10k phase
where we are moving from 90 k 200k and
still one video is pending of the 70 K
Q&amp;amp;A
really not very proud on that that I'm
missing that video I will upload that
very soon yes thank you so much we are
moving on to the hundred K phase okay
so sir how is iOS development career
it's amazing amazed it's really highly
paid compared to Android yes you can
bash me for this all the Android lovers
but let me tell you iOS developers get
little bit hired and not little bit very
more high paid compared to Android
developer so you know it's like that can
you make a video in wpa2 vulnerability
crack I was thinking to make it really
soon
I would be preparing some kind of slides
and animations for that so that you can
understand what is four-way handshake
and how where the payloads are actually
it's it's kind of a typical wonder
ability which is already being mentioned
in one of my cryptography video there is
a thing known as one time padding if you
are again going to use that one time
padding it is going to be dangerous so
check out my cryptography video which I
posted like they back but yes I have
mentioned that there as well it was very
a way before when the crack actually
came up it is it is way before that may
I know your age nope sorry for that
come on how can I be that so how many
languages did you know no idea no idea
never counted it will quarterly replaced
Java entirely in Android development no
I don't think so it's going to happen
very soon but Kotlin is amazing there
are few modifications that you can do
quickly and easily in cut length so yes
it is really good but I would say it's
not going to replace Java anytime soon
but it's a new alternative for all those
people who don't like Java finally you
cut your hair
yeah finally I did that I got time to
actually got some haircut it's looking
decent happy with it hi this is Prakash
love from Chennai absolutely thank you
thank you thank you
so much I love chili ok did you hide
luck without yourself with Apple I am
about to share and record a video for
the entire incident which is happening
right now with the iOS app it's like
13th or 14th revision that I have
submitted to the iOS guys they are going
completely crazy I'll explain each and
everything about the things that are
happening right now and I'll explain the
details of that there are some things
which are bad on my side as well I did
those mistake I accept that but there is
a lot more mistake that Apple is doing
on their behalf this is not expected
from a company like Apple but still they
are making it I'll share the entire
explanation Pradeep with all of you guys
on on this YouTube channel so that it
can be helpful for other developers as
well I will be posting that video you
are doing a great job appreciated thank
is so much nizam money thank you so much
finally got a haircut else so much
comments on my haircut thank you so much
you noticed
will you come at MIT ah MNIT is it from
Jaipur MIT or a lobotomy nighty surely
if I'll get an invite I will surely come
so how you started I started with a
computer sorry I'm being so sarcastic
nice haircut appears Thank You Vignesh
thank you so much
when will Java boot can finish planning
is to finish it up within like next 15
days but you know let's see how it goes
on
let's make up more questions how to make
a blog wordpress would be really really
good
why don't you upload your iOS app on
your website so who needs it they can
download it really that's not a good way
to distribute the iOS app because that
will be installable only by the people
who have like jailbreak devices and not
by all those people who are not having
the jailbreak devices
because iOS only allows you to have the
app from the app store if it's not a
jailbreak your eyes so that is why I'm
not uploading it there but yes I can do
it maybe okay let's pick up more
questions what was your first
freelancing project and how much did you
get paid
please tell the figures I usually don't
like to tell the figures but legislate
for a be shake such they was me request
my first project was not highly paid
I just got only 60 dollars from my first
project it was just simply to design a
website which had a contact form running
up that said that that was like a basic
thing
it was a cleaners website it was from a
lady Angela I still remember that and
she asked me to design a website on my
freelancing portfolio for a simple
website that has a contact form running
and all his numbers and contact ma from
being displayed and that said I got paid
a $60 for that it was an amazing
experience I had a lot of issues in
finishing up that project but finally I
did made it there it was an amazing
feeling of you can tell it by my eyes it
was an amazing feeling ok sir I gave
made an AC on YouTube I had no view why
I don't know what you're saying sorry
about that I'm really sorry hey Tish you
have been dodging at midnight yeah I
don't sleep much I don't like to sleep
much honestly I like to be wake up doing
stuff creating stuff making videos all
these amazing stuff so it's really hard
time for me to sleep even in the
Midnight's it's it's sometime I just
wake up and move on to my computer's $60
isn't it much yeah I usually charge like
a 150 dollar for that kind of website
but yeah I got paid under paid
like $60 that's it but yeah it was first
earning $60 it was good it was good at
that time it's being along and I would
say that yeah web development was really
high paid at that time of that time but
now it's it's really underpaid how
people are doing that kind of job even
for $20 now but again what can I say I
got paid $60 that's it okay
okay ah there is an interesting question
by Shubham Bajaj role of math in dev dev
life please answer okay let me clear
this up first of all that the developers
life if you are looking forward to go
into machine learning this is very very
hot topic if you are planning to go into
machine learning make sure that you are
amazingly good in maths
not just any maths amazingly good
especially your four year Fourier
transform your discrete maths your
probability Bayes theorem neural network
and training data models all these
things are math P or math I know machine
learning rooks looks really really
amazing and shiny mountain that you just
want to climb but it's not it's not that
easy
make sure you need to be amazingly good
in math if you're getting started at
least in machine learning for rest of
the programming like Android and iOS or
web it's decently required not that much
like any student who have studied like
till 8th class or ninth class or 10th
class in India is absolutely totally
fine for programming for that kind of
math but if you are looking forward for
machine learning make sure you are
really good I am Sivarama back again
with another Sunday live thank you I
completed your front-end course which
course to study next for back end from
LC or either node or react I would
recommend react first you will love that
for sure you will love that course so go
ahead start with react and welcome on
board
Udacity versus LC oh I would say
affordable courses at LC o unis it is
charging like what
4,500 per month for a course and for
four thousand five thousand you can buy
like four or five courses at LCA so it's
all affordable they are teaching like
just like like three or four apps in
Android courses and I'm teaching like
ten apps you judge it by your own you
can take both I also want not to sleep
like you how but it's bad it's bad I
know I'm doing bad to myself but this is
what I am 100 K is near yes it's very
very near we are very near there what
are the limitations of react as of now
now not much of the via limitations of
the react I have been like able to do
absolutely anything and everything in
react and now react have recently
launched an AI module as well I am
looking forward for that what Nagi what
that module is able to do sorry sir I
made an account on YouTube but I have no
views why probably because you haven't
uploaded a video or your video is not
that much amazing that people are not
watching it but have patience you have
just uploaded might be one or two videos
have patience okay do you use contact
lenses no I don't use contact lenses a
lot of people ask me why you don't have
specs but I don't have okay should I
spend time and learning in Java I want
to learn Android yes of course
absolutely that's kind of recommended so
are you satisfied from your education I
keep learning I'm never satisfied with
my education I just keep learning
education doesn't means you have to do a
kind of a degree like BTech BCA or M
Tech or PhD I just keep learning
everything is education for me a new iOS
thing or maybe a newly argyus thing that
I have learned just right now is
education for me okay
oh so let's pick up more questions it's
getting repeated now
Hettich can you say hi to my friend
minge eater Raj hey Minji - Raj hi how
are you hope you are doing great Shukria
up kobe shukriya love from gym shaper
thank you so much doubt cleared thank
you
do you remember me yes and untie
absolutely remember you I your photo is
there so I do remember you easily let's
pick up more questions can we make
android apps using Python yes you can
but I don't recommend that use Java
JavaScript or Kotlin that would be much
better options hey tej are you
interested in cricket I'm watching India
vs. New Zealand I don't watch cricket
much I think it's it's very boring now I
prefer Kabaddi
my watch it I prefer most of the time
basketball games I love it
can't skip that stop talking and start
Sunday training now itself
you don't need to be that much rude
never these are like talking sessions
yes the training sessions are going to
come up but let's see who are going to
make that because right now somehow we
are just able to make up hundred seats
for that so definitely can you hire me
as a web designer are surely very soon
as of now there is no requirement of
there is no job opportunities for web
designers as of now there are other
positions that are about to get opened
up at lco let's see how that goes am
do you prefer react native or Android
studio both are great actually
this is a really tough decision there so
let's pick up more questions
these react.js can be used for back-end
if you'll ask literally their react is
not a back-end thing but yes it can be
fully adjustable with MySQL firebase or
anything like
that so I would say react if you have
heard about the model-view-controller
react is a pure view it's it's kind of a
view thing it can be plug and played
into any kind of thing any kind of
database but yes it can be combined with
some kind of back-end technologies like
firebase or rapid i/o or backhand less
and yes it can be used like that once
cani cani be internet LCU as Android
developer yes definitely
we are looking up for some of the
Android developers for finishing up like
few projects at lco I will notify a few
of you I have already selected actually
two of the students who have already
submitted have done the courses at lco
and have submitted two or three apps so
they are already being selected I know
this is this is not so good because I
have selected them like back in job or
something but yes two of the students
are already being selected definitely we
will plan up more how to join Sunday
courses it will be updated on the
channel do hit that subscribe button and
the belacan and you will get more
details very soon okay does learn code
online provide certificate yes of course
all paid courses comes up with
certification what is Sunday training
you might want to watch the video from
start there because I have already
talked about the Sentai trainings ok can
I use firebase and SQLite boot together
in an Android app or MySQL Plus firebase
yes you can technically use that but I
think you're making yourself into a lot
of trouble big deep trouble so don't do
that either use just one or just create
your own databases something like that

name
yes SEO will come up very soon right now
