the WordPress training now in this video
we are going to focus on the post
especially on what are the hidden things
that are available in the post now in
the WordPress there are hundreds of
things and you should always be aware of
where to find one where to actually
click on where to finding one so in this
video let's go into the post and click
on all post and we have created one post
which is ten qualities just click on
this and we'll be working further on
this blog post here okay now before we
moved on yes we did talked a little bit
about these blog post in the previous
video but right now let's just go ahead
carry on and talk about this now
obviously the first thing that I want
you to do is click on this toggle
toolbar and always make sure it's open
and available because most of the
interesting and important tool are lying
just here
okay that's point number one but now
let's just go on to the top and click on
this a screen option before you even
click on this screen option notice that
the bottom part is completely empty this
is because there are a lot of options in
the screen of screen options which again
we have talked about in one of the
previous video a lot of things that you
can enable like SERPs here here track
box custom fields or maybe discussion
slugs are there author is there a lot of
things that you can do it that are going
to be enabled at the bottom part here
okay
now also you can make sure feel free to
be comfortable in either one a one
column layout which is really good on a
small screen but I kind of feel like the
two column layout so that's why I keep
it there okay you can also have send
track box and everything I usually don't
like that now let me show you what are
these things and it are what are these
available now again a format and all
these things are available onto the
right-hand side and let's just first
talk about the right-hand side there are
options like publish save draft and
preview now preview will take you to
whatever you have written so far it's
gonna give you a live preview that how
your blog post is gonna look like when
it will be published
obviously it makes sense and then you
have options like a visibility for
public or everyone maybe you want to
first give it to your editor to check
that out and want to publish that later
you just want to publish it right now
move to trash is also a good option here
now for the format options I never used
that because it's it's so much makes a
problem with the other themes that
you're using so always keep it on the
standard don't use anything from here
all the things that you are looking up
choosing up from here can be done
directly here and that is much more
reliable compared to this so my tip is
don't use format it's it's not good it's
just makes problems every single time
now what are the post you're gonna be
writing make sure it comes up with at
least one category yes you can add more
categories like all I just call this as
programming and we're gonna add the
second category there we go
now all of your blog post technically an
ideally should belong to at least one
category it can belong to more than one
category but it should be at least one
category there so it's it's most useful
there and then we have got tag which is
really important because a lot of search
engine still works on the tag and
especially some part of the Google
search is coming up from the tag itself
and also on the website when you make a
tag cloud it looks amazingly good just
like I have on my website if I can find
that there's a tag cloud which gives you
what is the most search tags and all
these things so it looks really good and
you can also find a lot of categories as
well I'll show you that in a moment but
this is all of what you have now
featured image is the image which you
will not see on the blog post itself but
you'll be seeing that on the index page
for example right now we don't have it
but if you'll go back you'll see that
these are the images now it depends on
what kind of theme you have applied this
is actually being used on this this is
your this featured image here now
obviously you can set a featured image
by dragging dropping which is not yet
available on the localhost we will be
surely doing that onto the latest things
later on okay so this is our right-hand
part pretty easy now the bottom part is
actually again super easy now excerpts
are simply being dependent heavily on
what kind of theme you are having for
example I'm having a theme which can
utilize these excerpts here
but not compulsory that the theme you
are using maybe using it so that's
completely optional thing now you can
allow the comments or just allow the
comments based on what you really want
to do usually the discussions the
default discussions from the WordPress
thing is itself like being bugged quite
a lot a lot of people spam there I don't
recommend to use that instead of that
use like discus or Facebook post there
I'll show you how you can do that later
on at LCI websites also we use these
Facebook kind of thing these are the
Facebook comments which are actually a
nice way of handling your interaction
with the readers of your thing okay so
we're gonna do that later on so these
are the basic things about this right
now I'm gonna again I disable them okay
all of them so let's just go back there
and talk the most important part which
is the main section where you'll be
spending a lot of time writing the
content so first of all this headline
here or this title of your blog post is
going to be your heading one this is the
most important part notice ten perfect
qualities this is your heading one it
always remains like that and almost all
kind of theme so make sure you are aware
of that and after that you can have your
content now you don't need to select the
entire content you can actually whatever
you're writing just click on there and
you can change this to heading one or
heading two or whatever you like to do
it's completely doable just there you
don't need to select that now just like
here I'm gonna show you a couple of
things I'm gonna hit enter there if you
need a content just copy and paste from
this I'll see your blog post as of now
not on the live website as of now okay
so let's just see what are the available
options given to us obviously we have
add media options which we'll be seeing
later on that how you can add media like
images and all these things on your
actual website then we have regular
stuff which you're already aware of like
bold you have got italicize pretty
awesome you are already aware of them
you have got your bulleted list and you
have got your numbered list now week
daily you can just select anything you
can make it a bullet list or you can
make it a number list no big deal there
the important interesting thing is this
block code when you'll keep that notice
it's just formatted a little bit
different and on all the devices where
people actually use text readers it is
going to be read it as quote and then
it's gonna read all of that so very nice
feature you have all your alignments you
have your links so if you want to add an
insert a link for example you want to
refer to this article you can always
select any word or any line and can
click on this link button and you can
paste your URL here obviously there are
more settings options here where you can
paste the URL can open it in a new tab
or in the same tab or you can also link
for any of the post or page that you
have already created on the same website
and we have hello world and sample page
here pretty easy not a big deal and you
can also remove the link here as well
and then we have insert read more tag
now this is entrusting let me show you
how does that work now let's just see
just like here on the website you can
see on the main website it automatically
gives you a read more tag here you can
add this one intentionally on any
paragraph here just you have to click on
this read more tag and there you go your
read more will appear just there it's
actually easy to have it let me just
show you the preview there and this is
how it is going to appear
it doesn't appear on this page the read
more only appears on the index page okay
what removing this is a such a pain
thing you either can remove it or
directly from here but sometimes
sometimes it doesn't work just like that
so let me show you a more reliable way
of deleting that is going into the text
and make sure wherever this mode is just
delete the entire code here this is
actually far more better way of doing
the thing sometimes the visual aspect
can be deceiving
and does not serve that good okay so
coming back on the personality you can
make a strike to you are already aware
of it you can have a horizontal line
nobody uses that I I don't use that any
many more often but maybe you want to
use
for some reason and maybe you want to
change some colors here obviously let's
just have a nasty red here you can have
that or you may want to bold this
italicize this now the great part comes
up you can just select enter text notice
S is not having any formatting you can
select the entire thing here and there
is a eraser button which says clear
formatting and it always reset
everything here for us okay so these are
things now we have again a very
interesting option which says paste as
text okay let me show you what it does
now when you open up any paragraph maybe
from a word document or maybe from these
things if I just copy this these things
copy them and paste them here notice
these are bringing up all of the
attributes like bold and italics along
with them sometimes you don't want to do
that so I'm gonna hit command Z what you
can do is click on this paste as text
just make sure it's enabled drilled a
little bit down there and now if you'll
paste it all of the things will be
pasted as just text it's a beautiful
thing I really like it and now you can
just enable that pretty easy and lastly
you have indented an unintended thing
just like you have in your code editor
shift that to a little bit right or a
little bit left just like that
and undo and redo so a lot of things are
just drilled on in this small two bars
yes I'm aware of it now let's just see
that whatever you have written maybe you
want to add a little bit formatting to
that quickly I'm gonna select that and
I'm gonna say this should be heading 2
not like that command Z I need to hit a
paragraph break there I have to make
sure it's there paragraph heading for
maybe and be confident I'm gonna hit an
enter there I'm gonna move you as pretty
far matter just like that okay the best
thing is you can always move into the
text part and can see what is the code
that is being written like it's a pre
formatted tag this is an h4 tag so this
is actually how your browser sees there
okay I'm gonna dismiss that for a moment
so this is the basic of how
the posts are being run and how you can
utilize them pretty easy and pretty
useful now before we end this video let
me show you how you can embed a YouTube
video on your post as well this is super
super simple so what we're gonna do is
go onto your favorite video it can be my
channel I'm not saying but it can be and
then what you have to do is simply go on
to this a share button just click on
this embed yours might be just sheer
click on the embed and just copy this
okay then go back to this and you don't
have to actually paste it there but you
can actually if you'll paste this here
it will not work just the way you you
liked it okay
command Z again go into the text mode
and wherever you want to add it maybe I
want to add it just after the block code
I'm gonna paste this here okay as soon
as I go into the visual aspect now this
is embedded as an iframe okay which
means it's gonna it's gonna be like
embedded into your website okay and
still being rendered from the YouTube
itself okay so I can always hit as
preview and it's gonna show me all of
the webpage okay if you wanted to be
much more bigger or smaller always you
can go into the text and can see the
width and height of it you can adjust
that but make sure you keep the aspect
ratio same okay make sure you read a
little bit about it before changing the
height and width of this but it's
completely doable not a big deal so
quite a lot of talk about just post here
so WordPress is the hot match deep and I
would say this is all the information
that I wanted to give you as of now on
the post and you have exploded quite a
lot but ultimate exploration will be
done when you'll be actually writing a
blog post so go ahead right on onto your
favorite subject and I'll surely catch
you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
