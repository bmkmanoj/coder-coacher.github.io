office although it looks really dope I'm
actually loving it more than other set
up it's actually so cool hey there
everybody this year back again with
another video in this video we are going
to answer the most asked question which
is talk something about job or job
interview or coding interviews so today
we are going to address that and let's
talk about the job interview and coding
interview now before we proceed on to
this video I want to mention two
important and very important points if
you're looking for a job or if you are
about to just graduate here and look for
a job and anything make sure you
understand two very important things
number one's job doesn't land
automatically on your email it doesn't
happen although I'm assuming here that
you always keep your email completely
clean your email doesn't say 3000 unread
emails because if it says so you are
missing hundreds of opportunities that
are being thrown at your inbox so please
don't do that that's kind of the worst
thing that you can ever do so one thing
is really sure that the automatically
job doesn't land up on to your inbox no
matter how hard you have tried you have
made your account or NOC recom or maybe
indeed.com or other such hundred website
it doesn't happen automatically so get
that now second thing is again it's
actually sad to see I have seen a lot of
emails coming to my inbox that say hey
I'm about to graduate from this this
University with this this person I have
a family pressure or whatever it that
that might be the case I'm ready to do a
job and I'm ready to do anything now
really it really breaks down the moment
you have said that I'm looking for a job
I can do anything that means you have
defined yourself that you cannot do
anything you're good for nothing at all
now you can take me these are harsh word
and some of you might not like that you
can give it this like if you don't like
it but hear me out this is this is
important now when you say I can do
anything that means you don't have a
specialization in any technology and all
I'm here talking about is the computer
related jobs the programming
working and all stuff related to
computer now let's just assume I have an
app and I want to hire other developers
who can design and can work in extending
the feature of those apps now my app is
on Android let's just assume this
scenario now the moment a candidate
arrives to me that hey I am from this
this college and I need a job I can do
anything
and the other person arrives at my
company and says hey I am specialised in
Android if you have an Android
opportunity I would really like to give
it a try and want to give an interview
for that now you get that person who is
specialized in some technologies and
have a little bit idea about other is
much more ideal candidate in getting a
job but this doesn't means that this is
all about the job getting hired is again
kind of a strategic process that you
have to follow so let's talk more about
it but first let's throw out the intro
so moving further talking about the jobs
let me also clear that getting a skill
and getting a job are completely two
different things yes they are closely
related but they are completely
different it doesn't happen like that
okay so make sure that you understand
that if you have bought any book or in
video course this means you are buying
that book or video course or whatever
that is to get some skill not for the
job yes your skills will be useful once
you have got the job but in order to get
that job you have to work a little bit
different approach I am nowhere saying
that you don't need skills skills are
the most OP important part because what
you're gonna do in your job is that
skill okay so once that out of the park
you have got the skill maybe an Android
or iOS or whatever that is then thumbs
up your job face okay
and I have actually given a lot of job
interviews just to give you a site
context here I have worked as an
information security trainer and
information security auditor after that
and then crack down an interview at
amazon.com I were I was offered a job at
Amazon yes that includes a round of
interviews then I have worked remotely
with two new york-based starter I have
also worked with renoir medicals which
is a big giant company in Canada apart
from that I usually go with other kind
of small jobs like SEO and everything
just to keep this your context that yes
what I'm talking about is I actually
know about it okay so let's move further
so now that you understand that skill
and your job are completely two
different things also I have seen a lot
of people just looking for a company
that says hey now that I have figured it
out that I want to become an Android
developer they look for Android
companies take out their carrier dot
something.com email or maybe jobs or
something email or info and just throw
up there resuming things doesn't work
like that chances are high that you will
never get a reply back from those
companies because you are just spamming
those companies they don't have time to
just look anywhere so be precise make
sure the company that you want to work
where wherever you want to work make
sure you follow that company on all the
social media website and
everything everybody every company needs
skilled worker but there is always time
it's not like all the time they are open
for the job so make sure you target that
time whenever that company is posting
opportunities for the job that is the
time when you hit with them with the
email and everything that is the time
then where when they are searching for
somebody throwing around just your
resume a is your based of time so please
don't do that
apart from that when sometimes companies
actually oppose their jobs that's
actually the peak time to apply into any
company but there are some time links
into the company that works quite good
so you're seen as from your college your
links your friends on Facebook or
LinkedIn or Twitter can help you that
are saying some inside things that hey
there is an opportunity there and you
can try out that I get these kinds of
things quite a lot because I do have
friends at Google Facebook Intel quite a
lot so I usually get opportunities like
that so yes it's a good thing make more
friends that's one good thing that you
can do now I know this is a really vague
talk and probably in the future I will
take more videos on this very specific
and great subject but now let's come on
to the interview part where the
interviews held on for coding interviews
now in the coding interviews there are
two special things in usually the
companies are looking for now the one is
are you a good fit for a company and how
good are your coding skills okay
now how good you're fit in a company are
usually handled by HR and you will see
some bizarre questions being thrown
around and I honestly say it is that I
have given like bizarre answer to these
questions but still it doesn't really
matter
questions like where you see yourself in
five years or something and what are
your good qualities and bad qualities
these are the questions people are not
judging you that how good you are in the
coding skills in those questions people
are judging that whether you are right
fit for a company and existing employees
of the companies or not so these are one
phase of that another big chunk which
really matters a lot it's like 80% of
the thing is your coding skills now I
can guarantee you that even a programmer
is like two years or three years or
maybe five years of experience cannot
crack down
interview unless he has prepared for it
okay get that again a worker who is
being coding all around his life cannot
crack down an interview of coding job if
he has not prepared so that requires a
separate kind of preparation no matter
how good you are in Android or iOS or
maybe no chase you have to prepare for
interview usually these coding
interviews are held on to a piece of
paper or maybe onto a whiteboard usually
there is a whiteboard okay
sometimes I have seen that people take
like side by side approach and they give
you a task sit alongside with you and
check out how good you are at coding or
searching on to the Stack Overflow or
anything like that and you just need to
finish that task that also happens but
usually the majority of the cases are
you will be seeing a whiteboard and you
will be given a task to complete now one
very common task maybe in the future
videos I'll talk more about that but one
common task is fizz bills if you haven't
heard about that interview questions
I really am really sad about that but
hear me out fizz bills is the most
common question that is being asked in
most of the interview it's very simple
print out numbers from 1 200 using any
look that you want and you have to print
fizz if the number is a multiple of 3 so
instead of 3 print fizz and base if the
number is a multiple of 5 really common
questions but these questions are not to
be meant to be handled by any person
these can be answered quickly only by
the programmers who have actually
prepared for these interviews okay and
another quick question is give me a
Fibonacci series and print that out
using recursive logic ok a really common
question but I believe it's not easy
it's fairly tough not extremely tough
but fairly tough can be done easily if
you have prepared for that interview
cannot be done if you have made like a
hundreds of application so yes
everything really matters here there are
points for everything your project has
really a good point your experience has
really a good point but apart from that
you also have to prepare for these kinds
of logics and everything yes I know this
video is getting a little bit longer but
this is a very interesting subject that
I can talk quite a lot
and there are common questions that you
will see in the interviews of Google
Amazon and everything so preparing for
an interview can be done easily and
questions when it is being thrown to you
like recursive logics and bubble sort
and merge sort and heap sort and
printing out them in Java or maybe Java
Script maybe see maybe Python really
will come handy only if you have that
skill so yes
skill is the most important part you
should have programming knowledge you
should have project you should have
github repository but you need to
prepare for that coding interview oh
that was quite a long talk I know maybe
some of you want to hear more about
about these what kind of questions
appears in these coding interviews and
everything how the scenario is maybe I
can talk about it in the next video if
there are enough requests in the comment
section so if you think that I should
talk more about it go in the comment
section and do hit the like to this
video subscribe to channel and just post
in the comment section hey do you want
to listen more about this I'll surely
make a video ah
this was quite a long and breathtaking
video so that's it for this video and
just like always I'll strongly catch you
in the next video
okay bye
your strength</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
