code online dot n and this video is
brought to you by this amazing cute
super awesome bottle just kidding just
wanted to show you this bottle this is
so amazing and so cute I picked it up
today from the store just wanted to show
you so anyways let's get started and the
whole idea of how we are moving forward
now let me tell you the strategy of that
now as you'll be working with the
JavaScript has a solution from front end
to back end or complete set of chances
are high that if you have something like
node angular react or anything that
you'll be handling a lot of ApS whether
directly from your own personal server
or maybe you are using API from other
third-party services so the more you get
friendly with these arrays and objects
it's gonna be much more easier for you
to handle all these api's and of course
a lot of things comes in JSON and
eventually will even be moving into the
actual production environment something
like learn code online you will be
realizing that it's so much easier and
fun to do all stuff with Jason okay so
now what is the goal of this video in
this video we want to launch a Trello
version 4 which is gonna be a small
Trello version you notice that in the
entire series we have been making this
fun Trello apps kind of a to-do apps and
the goal is to introduce the searching
feature in our app now yes I know my my
app this Trello app is right now not
having any kind of user interface or
anything but that's gonna come up later
on right now let's see how we can
introduce this search functionality so
let's go ahead and just create a new
file Trello version 4 I hope everybody
can does that no big deal so we're gonna
have a simple might reduce let's just
have my two dues and this my to do is is
gonna have a few array objects and they
can be all string as you know so we're
gonna have something like buy bread and
we're gonna have one more this is gonna
be or something like go to gym which
really happens nowadays it's happening
quite often and record YouTube videos
come on do that ok so this is our basic
array and you obviously know that if you
have read a little bit documentation
that finding anything inside the array
is pretty easy so what you can do you
can simply log it and whatever you are
looking for you
can just simply say bye to dues and
there are variety of features to which
you can find out what you're looking for
for example you can just simply say I
want have an index off as soon as you
put it it tells you that you can put a
search element and it is going to return
you the index of that element for
example let's just say I'm looking for
is buy bread and it's gonna return us
the index of it so let's just run this
and we're gonna say node Trello version
for Jas and come on you can do that so
we got a minus one again now why is that
a minus one I'll come back and move on
to this a little bit just deliberately
wanted to do this mistake so that you
can realize that how application should
be shaped up okay so notice here that
the B is in the capital one here but
here I have deliberately returned that B
as a smaller one so either if I change
this as bread then I'm gonna get a
proper index but if the particular
element is not being found then you use
a minus one so whenever you are taking
and expecting an output from this index
off make sure you handle the case of
minus one again most of these things is
already mentioned in the documentation
as well I highly recommend to read that
okay so this is all fun stuff no big
deal and later on how we get the return
of that we can actually just have this
or we can see do something like this my
two dues and we can wrap this up into
this guy and now it's gonna directly
give us instead of giving us the index
value it's gonna just directly give us
if that element is found it's gonna
throw that in front of our screen
because it's returning that value okay
so let me undo that because it's much
more easier there we go so this is all
good and this is all fun stuff now let's
move on to something which you will be
handling pretty a lot so let's just say
we are gonna have a simple array and in
that array we will have a few constant
few objects this is pretty common and if
you look on to this random api's random
person api's these are like filler API
is just like lorem ipsum text for HTML
these are ApS to play around and test a
few stuff
so there we go we are gonna create this
object so we're gonna say new - duze new
- deuce there we go and this new to do
is is gonna be an array but array filled
up with objects so let's just say we
have our first object we got our second
object and we got our third object still
remember this array is an array and you
can still use index off and all these
things but you know in programming there
is always a better approach of doing the
things and solutions is always right but
there can be a less optimized solution
more optimized solution so don't worry
if you don't get this at the first time
but totally believe me okay so we're
gonna have just like three ones now
since this is an object I can introduce
new features in my application like is
done it can be true or false just like
you see the check mark there almost like
that so we're gonna give it something
like title and this title is gonna be a
string and I'm gonna use the same by
bread I'm gonna use caps again because I
want to show you a couple of more stuff
and it's done
is gonna be a boolean value so let's
just say this is gonna be we're gonna
start with false actually so there we go
and just for housekeeping purpose I'm
gonna put a comma if you don't put a
comma here that's fine too but I like to
so this is our first object then we go
and we're gonna put our second object
we're gonna have a title and this time
the title is gonna be go to gym put a
comma and we're gonna say is done that
is gonna be false let's just assume this
is a start of the day and again let's
just have a title and this is gonna be
something like record YouTube videos
come on I can write that videos and it's
done is gonna be let's just say true
okay so I put a comma just for
housekeeping purposes okay so that makes
sense now we have new - dues so how we
can look for anything in these kinds of
- dues now although we have variety of
options being available and let me just
show you a couple of stuff here so
gonna go onto google and we're gonna say
array j s MDM all these best place to
look out for the things that you're
looking for so notice here we have a lot
of options in here the one which we
talked about is index off but you can
see there are you can do even sorting
shifting and all those fun stuff
but let me show you what I'm looking for
there is one find there is one find
index so these are the most popular ones
and if I just look at the find index one
notice it returns the index otherwise
its returns -1 obviously that's awesome
but this documentation actually doesn't
give you much of the idea how things are
gonna be although it's pretty clear let
me show you and walk you through how we
can utilize these things ok so we're
gonna be creating a simple fine to do
function so that we can reuse that
whenever we like so we're gonna go and
utilize that okay so let me first walk
you through that how this find index
actually works so we're gonna call this
Const index and this is gonna be a
simple legend says near to do's and on
this array we can just use this method
which is fine index okay so it says you
have to put some options here now
basically what the whole idea is that
this fine index can take a function as a
parameter also known as callback
functions so you can just and remember
callback functions are just simple
functions they don't have any name so if
we're gonna call this as function put a
pair of parentheses curly braces there
we go it can take it now in this
function you have to pass on to do as
well as a kind of a title that you're
looking for in this okay so let me just
walk you through that what it takes now
also let me remind you that we did use
this for each loop remember that the for
each loop is automatically gonna go onto
each array and just takes that at a time
so our first variable here is gonna be
to do notice you can you can name it
anything whatever you like it's kind of
a variable name in here and it also has
an access of index
okay now this to do just like in the for
each loop are moved on to each array
this function find index also move on to
each array and then it has also an
access to this index okay so what you
can do is you can return based on your
search for example we're gonna return
you have to look up for something as a
title so we're gonna say that in here we
are looking then to do dot title notice
here we have this title we're gonna say
when the title is go to gym okay
so we are looking for this exact gas so
we're gonna use equals to and in the
codes I'm gonna give go to gym okay so
what I'm saying here is that wine index
actually moves on to every single array
as soon as it's gonna find go to gym
it's gonna return that and notice what
we get in the return that's the
interesting part so let me lock this and
we're gonna have an index save that and
open up our terminal and clean that up
and have it so notice it gives me one so
I can comment double line actually so
that we can have a better approach and
now clean this up and run that so notice
it gives me one which is obvious so one
more thing that everybody should be
aware of that how this fine index
actually works okay and in order to have
a look how does it work we have to log
every to do and this is a good thing
about the fine index probably so let me
run this notice now as soon as I use
this fine to do it just printed out
these elements as well so what it does
it moves on to every single array and as
soon as it founds whatever you are
looking for notice we are looking for
this go to gym title it just stops there
and returns back that particular element
okay
I hope now the find index is pretty
clear so now when it is much more clear
we can just comment that out and based
on our knowledge of the fine index we're
going to create a function in which a
user can pass on to do list like in this
case new to dues and
particular title which it is looking up
for okay so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say Const and let's call this as
find to do and this is gonna be a simple
function pair of parentheses there we go
function done
so what we're expecting in this function
that user should pass on is basically
two things his to do and a title so
we're gonna be saying something like my
to do's and a title title and also
notice I have commented all the about
two lines of the array so that we don't
get confusion of that so that's it okay
so this is my function it's completely
ready now what I have to do is based on
this might reduce I have to use this
knowledge which I just gained using the
fine index and have to return this index
okay so what we're gonna be doing is
first of all let's just have a variable
index okay and on the index notice I
have absolutely no idea what the people
are calling there are to-do lists here I
have called this new to deuce but it can
be any two deuce and if you get confused
you can always write any here any
tattoos in case it is confusing you I'm
gonna go with the my to do it makes much
more sense for me on the my to dues I'm
gonna apply the method off of this find
index and there we go make sure you use
the capitalization correctly and this
fine index expects a parameter to be
passed on which is a function call back
function so let's just write this
function pair of parentheses and these
guys okay now this function this
particular function is dependent on this
my to do this okay and on this my to do
is it's gonna loop through every to do
so what it has an access off is this to
do as well as the index okay there we go
and we are also gonna fix up one more
thing if you remember from the very
initial part of the video we did made a
mess with this by bread okay this B was
making a mess so we need to fix that up
as well so what we're gonna do is we are
gonna return what we are going to return
we're gonna simply say to do dot title
notice this to do has an access of all
array objects we are looping through
them we are accessing the title of it
and we're going to convert
- lower case there we go
and done okay so now everything is in
lower case and we're gonna compare it
with the title this title which is being
passed on by user and we're gonna say
title and of course user can also pass
it on and pretty much anything so we're
gonna just use to lowercase here as well
notice problem solved but a lot of
people get confused at this point
now notice I told you previously that
function automatically as soon as it
returns the value that's it function is
over but notice this return is not for
this function this return is for this
function so we haven't actually
technically returned anything we do have
couple of options that how we want to do
probably you want to do something like
this
return and return this value here so we
we do have now off access of this so we
can simply say something like this my
two dues and we can have an index so
it's gonna return the exact element that
you're looking for in case you want to
just return the index you know what to
do just return the index okay so this is
pretty good whatever we have learned so
far using this find index so let's just
use this now we are going to be using it
with this new two deuce so notice when I
say I have to actually get this new to
do so new to dues and I can have an
access of dot find to do it expects me
to pass on not basically like that I
have to actually log these values okay
because right now this is being designed
so that we can not just apply it
directly on fine to do so what we are
gonna do is store that first in two
variables so let print me something like
that and we are gonna now call this as
simply find to do there we go it expects
to parameter which is my not new to dues
need to do is and also we need a title
and this time we will be deliberately
messing around with this go to gym and
we will be messing around with the case
sensitivity so go to gym
the G is gonna be smaller 1t is gonna be
camps notice we handled all of this in
this lower case and simply just log this
in to me just like that
save that and let's open this up clean
the screen and there we go so this time
it has returned the exact title that we
are looking up for go to gym regardless
of the case sensitivity okay so this is
fun and notice this is one way of
dealing the things this is find index
okay this is deliberately used when you
only need an index but there is another
option which can directly give you
element itself as well so what we're
gonna do is I'm gonna just comment this
out I'm gonna say method one notice
again in programming there are probably
hundreds of ways doing that I'm just
sharing a couple of them okay so let's
just comment that out okay now we have
explode this what is this find index
let's go back and this is the one stuff
that we have explored come on find index
there is also an option of find which is
comparatively easy but it's it's almost
the same thing it expects a function to
be passed on it's almost exactly same
and I think we shouldn't be having much
problem in understanding that if you
have got this so let's just say we're
gonna say Const and we're gonna say find
to do and that is gonna be simply
function pair of parentheses and there
we go so this is now a function now what
we have to do is we have to again we are
following the same strategy that we want
to create a simple function which is
fine to do so that we can find on any
element so what we are expecting in this
function to be passed on again my two
do's and a title okay exactly same what
we are having here now let's just have a
constant and we are gonna say title
returned notice in the find index it
returns your index but in just the find
it returns you the exact element that
you are looking for and there is no easy
way it all depends on use case what you
want to you really use so it's not like
hey if we have fine why should we use
fine
no it's not like that it's always a use
case scenario and there is a usage for
everything that's why they are there
okay so we're gonna say title returned
and we are gonna simply say my two dues
we're gonna use find on you find ask you
to pass on callback functions so just
use a function there we go and there we
go okay so what it has an access once
you apply a function of that it has the
access of same thing it will look
through every single element so to do
and it has also an access of index yes
it has okay so what you can do you can
directly use a return here and you can
simply say to do dot title dot lowercase
not lowercase to lowercase to lower case
we are going to lowercase that and we're
gonna match it up with this title okay
we're gonna say title dot to lowercase
there we go again we have done exactly
the same thing and notice a thing which
a lot of you get confused this return is
for this function not for this function
so technically we haven't returned
anything and now we can we have two
options actually we can use return title
returned either go with this way or you
can just use directly return here
totally how you really want to deal up
with that okay we are not talking about
much of the optimization stuff here so
there we go and what we'll be doing is
we'll be copying these lines paste them
here and let me remove that and this one
as well so again we need to pass on
anything what you like and previously we
were printing just print me it was also
guess getting us exact title because we
were using this my two do's and then
index using square bracket notation here
we don't need to do any kind of that
fancy stuff okay so let's just run this
control this and clean the screen and
there we go he made a mess where did we
fumbled upon okay to do that title too
over case so yeah it looks like we made
a mess to do the title to lower case and
we used an equal sign what is that
come on Vivi you should not be doing
that kind of mistake you know sometimes
it's hard to teach and talk and write
the codes same time anyways there we go
we have got this again always remember
don't be shy if your code is not working
debugging is the process of writing code
don't be afraid chill out relax and
you're gonna solve that out so there we
go
regardless of the case sensitivity we
have done that so I know this video is
over 24 24 minutes long but we have
learned some crucial stuff about how
things get in progress and as I said as
we will be moving progressively into the
further of this stuff it will become a
little bit complex but I'll make sure
that it becomes easy so these are method
1 and this is gonna be method 2 there we
go so good cool stuff that you have
learned in this video already the video
is quite long and let's just keep it
short right now here and let's catch up
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
