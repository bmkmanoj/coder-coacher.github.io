Android training in this video we are
going to talk about the Android
lifecycle methods now whenever you
design any Android application it
already have those Android lifecycle
method one of the very famous one is an
on create method now whenever you design
in the Android application whether it's
a simple hello world or just a tap a
button or any complex application that
uses authentication system and all of
that uses one of the very famous methods
known as oncreate but it doesn't means
that this is the only method of the
lifecycle there are a couple of others
as well now all of these methods are
already defined in your application
somewhere in the backend sometimes you
might want to overwrite those methods
and want to perform a specific task on
that now an application usually follows
the 4-ways or it can just go through
with the four part of the life cycles
and we'll be learning about moreover
what are these functions are honking
that how you can do that now before I
move on a lot of you might be asking hey
what is the use of these life cycle
methods let me give you and point out a
few examples that you can relate from
your day-to-day life now we obviously
know that oncreate method is useful you
whether you write a hello world
application might want to select a
button or text view or edit text we just
write the selectors of all of these in
oncreate function because if they are
not being created yet how we can select
them now one of the such example can be
login method now let's just say in your
application you simply want to check out
whether user has logged in or not now
one of the very good position to measure
that change would be as soon as the
application is started not created as
soon as it has started because
application starts at a lot of time
maybe it is in the pause mode going back
from there maybe one of the example that
some of the prime apps and video based
app that uses is whenever you are
watching a video and pause that into a
background mode and you come back from
the background mode usually some of the
application try to replay that video 5
seconds back so that you don't miss any
action and you are in a consistent flow
so how you can do that all of these
things and all of such code is written
on these lifecycle methods
and let's talk about more of these life
cycle method I have got my iPad and
we'll be working on that so let me show
you what are these methods and how you
can utilize them so let me shrink up my
talking face and bring up my iPad there
okay so on the screen you can see that
we have got a few methods and basically
this is all what happens when your
application is going on there
now the first in the gray phase you can
see that we have simply a does not exist
so this is the part where application
does not exist yet it is about to be
formed it is about to be created and on
after that there is an app stop mode so
there are a lot of modes on which your
application will be going this is the
stop mode means your app is not being
tapped on the icon yet so this is the
second one we have got app stop now
after that we have got other modes like
at paws maybe you have moved your
application into the background you were
playing some games a call came up and
your application is now at the pause
mode and finally the running mode which
is everybody is familiar of what is
running mode so when you want to go from
one method to another phase of your
application you are being given a lot of
ways a lot of methods that you can
overwrite and one of the very famous one
is you have already seen is on create
okay the wrong choice of the color there
okay I'll choose the yellow one here
okay so it is on create and I should
actually write it just like how you
define them so let me just try that
again so it's on create so this is your
on create now again you have to bear
with my handwriting there okay so when
your app is non-existent and want to go
from non-existent almost at a stop
method it will use an on create method
there again all of the things I'm
writing our methods here now from the
stop if you want to go into the pause
mode you have to check out another guy
which is I will choose a green color
here which is on start here so on start
so this is the method you choose when
you go from the stop mode to the power
and that is why I'm writing it
specifically at that position and if you
want your app to go from pause mode to
running mode you use the on resume
method so let me just write it with red
maybe
so this is the on resume method now you
might be wondering that hey I don't use
these kinds of methods usually in my
application there is just on create and
app goes from the non-existent to the
running yes that's a good point but your
application is made to be going into
that phase if you haven't written any
overwrite function you don't want to do
anything it will just keep on passing so
from on create from a non-existing it
will go into the star pause and come
continuously to the running without any
obstruction if you haven't written any
code for that it is meant and it is
designed just like that way and these
are not the only methods there are still
three more three moon like for example
from running to pause you want to go
into that direction how you can go and
do that so for that particular kind of
method we have yes you get that right
it's on pause so we have got on pause so
you have got on pause method you can
just write on pause and can write some
code so for an application when getting
when it is going to be from running to
the pause mode you have to use that
method and similarly if you want to go
from pause to stop you have got on stop
so there we go
on stop method there and finally you
might want to do something when your app
is being destroyed or maybe for some
bizarre reason you might want to give a
pop-up or toast to the user yes there is
a function being there on destroy and
maybe you want to free up some memory or
might want to check out few logs or
maybe want to give some battery related
issues and all those things so yes they
are on destroy so what we have learned
in this particular video is that there
are six basic functions which helps you
to travel from one phase of the
application to another phase and
basically there are four phases which is
when your app is not existent that's one
the second is when your app is taught
that's number two and the third when the
app is on the pause mode and the fourth
when app is running and
traveling from one to each we have got
six method first is on create then we
have got on the start then we have got
on resume one of the very famous which
usually people use is on create an on
start but again depending on your
condition you might want to use on
resume as well similarly if you want to
go from running to the pause mode you
can use on pause from pause to stop you
can use on stop and start to destroy you
can use on destroy so this is basically
the whole overview idea of how your
application behaves and how you can
write customize code if you want to play
around with the life cycle methods and
again all of these are methods
predefined so you might want to hit
control o on your Android studio and
might want to search for those methods
and as soon as you find them hit enter
and the studio will write all those
codes and all just leave you'll be
seeing all of these methods and code
live in action as we go on and move on
into the course so that's all about it
so I hope you have enjoyed this video
and now let's get ahead and move on into
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
