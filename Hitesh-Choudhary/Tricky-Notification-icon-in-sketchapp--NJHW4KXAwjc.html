again with another video and in this
video we're gonna be designing just one
icon and that I can can get you in a
little bit of trouble so let me just
first show you what we will be designing
so rest of our icons were pretty simple
now we're gonna move on to this Bell
icon the reason why I have chosen this
Bell I can our notification I can is
because it can be a little bit tricky to
get this down if you are not fully aware
of how the vector actually works and
chances are high that you might be
coming up from a programming background
or any other background so that you
don't know how vector actually works if
you're coming from Illustrator or
Photoshop that should be totally breeze
but yeah it can be a little bit tricky
so let's get it down how we can design
this Bell icon so follow me along and
I'm gonna walk you through some
interesting things that I think
everybody should know about these
vectors so without any further ado get
your art board ready and we're gonna
have a 500 by 500 out board that's the
easy ones so press o on your keyboard
and we're gonna get a hold on your shift
key so that we can have circle and this
is gonna be like 160 by 160 it's always
good to have if you're onto like 159 it
makes really sense to have 160 by 160
obviously we're gonna remove the border
as you know I don't like them at all
okay so there we go now we need a
rectangle so press R on your keyboard to
get a rectangle these shortcuts are
handy and I expect everybody to remember
them by now okay so get your rectangle
like somewhat like this big which is 160
by 228 or 230 would be good now make
sure the width is 160 because our circle
is also 160 so that they can merge
easily now remove the border and just
adjust that a little bit by scrolling
that with your arrow keys and make sure
they looks like one object okay now we
don't want to just merge them right now
it would be like too much early so click
on this select your rectangle and then
double click on this now it converts
that into vector now notice on the
vector whatever the point is selected we
want all of them to be straight okay so
notice sometimes they can be a little
bit tricky so make sure you just verify
that again now we want two more anchor
points to
get that nice easy curve there so we're
gonna get somewhere like this and
somewhere like this now once you click
on this guy make sure you move it a
little bit so that these guides actually
help you to be exactly in the front of
that previous dot okay and notice these
are also straight okay now we're gonna
select this guy hold down your Shift key
and press your right arrow key four
times one two three four what it has
done is it has given us exact symmetry
there it has moved just forty pixels so
with the shift key and arrow key arrow
key actually moves it to one pixel hold
on shift key it moves to the ten pixel
so we have moved it on to the ten pixel
yeah we can do that by turning on the
grids and all of that but I think it's a
much better shortcut okay double click
again and we want this guy to be
selected and shift and one two three
four so there we go it's already looking
nice but it's not exactly like bell it
needs to be a little bit curvy now here
comes the tricky part
so double-click on that select any point
or vector that you want and let's just
call it as mirrored so notice it has got
its nice like curvy exactly what we want
the problem actually starts when you
again double-click on it and go and
select on this and you expect that hey
I'm gonna just click on the mirrored and
it's gonna work and chances are high
it's gonna get messed up now let's
explore what is the reason of this mess
up so that if anything happens like this
you can actually take it down so notice
here when I select this guy and notice
the handle bars here which are actually
responsible for these curvy shapes these
are too small and luckily or just say it
a random guess by sketch the first
attempt was really good in saying how
much longer these handlebars should be
but on the other hand these handlebars
are like very big very big this is not
what we want so just by shrinking them
down you can notice that we do have a
better shape now so this is a common
thing which is missed by a lot of
programmers not programmers like
designers who are getting started and
moving into it for all those expedience
guy in the illustrator it's it's not at
all a big deal they know it already
where the problem is and notice just by
having it it's
much better here okay the next thing
that whatever can do is select on this
guy now here comes again a tricky part
now since and make sure these corner
points are the straight ones now these
traits actually can be little bit tricky
to have a roundish edge I really would
say that don't go too far because as
you'll go too far it can get like
something like this and this is
completely okay based on the anchor
points so I would say not to go too far
always keep a little bit like two is
probably okay if you want to have like
more curvy edges then obviously you
might want to add more anchor points so
that they can just lean over it but I
think two is actually absolutely fine
for us in this case nice let me zoom
that here so that you can see that it's
nice curved but not too much so that it
just creates a problem obviously no
problem is a big problem we can just go
ahead and get more anchor points and can
just fix that up pretty easily okay now
I think this needs to be shortened down
a little bit I think it's too much big
for an icon so I'm gonna just scroll
that a little bit probably like okay so
probably like something 190 or something
is good so this looks like motor with a
bell now what is happening here is I can
just merge them as a single I can now
now probably you might want to tweak
that a little bit because this might
look a little bit more curvy to you so
based on that you can actually
straighten this down can have like more
symmetries again it all depends on
eyeballing the stuff and all of that you
can always double click and have it here
you can eyeball it a little bit more
perfect so that they look like
symmetrical or you can also move this
anchor point a little bit like downwards
or upwards if things are not feeling you
right and all of that so you know icons
needs to be more creative than just
having these techniques so now what we
can do is select them and can hit a
Union so that they becomes one object so
there we go nice and easy now the next
thing that we need is the bell of the
Bell icons so what we can do is first of
all have a circle oh and hit down your
Shift key and there we go we have a nice
circle it all depends on you how you
really want
I think I'm gonna go 404 that is nice
I'm gonna remove the border now press
our key to have a rectangle and we are
gonna have a rectangle which is gonna
lay on to just half of it it doesn't
really matter don't need to turn even
the bottles off you select both of the
shape and hit subtract so that we can
have a nice this guy here I'm gonna keep
it away for like 15 pixels or maybe it's
too high I'm gonna go for 12 yeah 12
looks much better to me then hit the R
and we're gonna have like top roundish
top of this Pelican I don't know what
even to call that so they're bigger this
is gonna look like this it's 60 60 by 25
would be good so we're gonna go for 60
by 25 that's nice
okay and we are gonna remove the border
you know me and also we are gonna round
the radius here a little bit so that it
becomes like probably we're gonna go for
all the way till the 10 and now you can
eyeball it a little bit shift it with
the arrow keys so that it's at the dead
center probably want to increase that a
little bit like 28 it all depends on you
how you want to see that totally on to
your creativity I'm gonna go for 65 by
28 okay there we go looks nice and we
can even integrate this as a union so
that it becomes like nice and easy if
you want to have like more roundish edge
you can always set one more anchor point
there just like that and can hit like
mirrored and you can just tweak that a
little bit like to have more corners or
all of that I'm not gonna go do that
because I think it's already good for me
and it looks good now I'm gonna select
all of that and I'm gonna fill that it
with the color which I've already got
here which is this guy so this looks
pretty easy and fun stuff I hope you
have learned a quick new tips about the
vector icons and how these mirrors and
the long edges and scale is I call them
mustaches along these cat mustaches can
create from problems and how to fix them
as well so that's it that you go with
your awesome Bell icon you can be a
little bit more creative with that
and that's pretty much it and I'm gonna
surely catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
