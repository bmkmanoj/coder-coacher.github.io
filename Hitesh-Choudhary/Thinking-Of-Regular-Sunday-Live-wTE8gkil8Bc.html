to come up and I'm planning for
something something is actually I'm
planning to go live on every Sunday if
possible and I just wanted to know your
thoughts what about if I plan something
like this how it how it would be and I'm
waiting for people to show up I believe
that because it is show up showing up
quickly and let's see if you can discuss
and do something meaningful here answer
a few of your questions and I can say if
you are up here
you can say hello you can say hi so
people have calmed up and let me say
hello back to everybody and there we go
a become let's build that's actually a
nice name very positive there let's
build on vevo a on and shush word Bunty
Shashi
Alma's sort of hey everybody hey hey hey
and video is lagging yes video will lag
a little bit in the starting after that
it won't be lagging much so we can join
up life and actually the front-facing
camera is in my phone is actually just
720p so that so it's not of the great
quality that you are usually that you
usually see on other of my this guy
which is the DSLR here so there's a
difference yes obviously but let us see
if any phone can offer me a one zero
eight zero P in the front camera that
would be amazing that would be awesome
I will try to upgrade my phone if that
happens so hey everybody how are you how
is it going on I know it's a lazy Sunday
but let me know your thoughts on if I do
the lights and days on every Sunday how
it would be I'll try my best to do these
things because going live is a nice way
of talking to you solving your questions
directly so let me know your thoughts
about how about if we do these kinds of
lies
on almost every Sunday I cannot promise
for every Sunday because for every
Sunday it's sometimes a day is busy with
family friends travel but whenever I'll
be home I'll just try to do that so
let's try to have a few questions and
try to answer back okay give me reply on
learn code online yes I'm trying to get
back to you on the discussions on learn
code online as quickly as possible but
that usually takes around 24 hours or
something because I do have other work
and there are a lot of courses that I
have to take up and answer properly so
yes I'm coming to everybody there it's
not like I have abandoned you I'll come
up there so definitely I'll go up there
you have an amazing content but can you
can get more subscribers and viewers if
you write your titles properly I see
that many of your titles have no
capitals just capitalize a few Lantern
yes I can I can see that that I'm
working quite a lot on the content but
I'm not much worried about reaching the
wider audience or having big number of
subscribers and I'm more over on to the
quality subscribers because eventually
on the YouTube or something I will have
good amount of subscribers but the
important part is the subscribers or the
community that I am building up right
now is of very high quality they are a
specific crowd who are dedicated towards
programming and stuff so yes reaching a
wide audience is again an important
thing but for me producing a awesome
quality content producing things in a
way that people can understand is much
far important than just doing the simple
SEO stuff like titles and descriptions
and tags and doing all kinds of hacks
there I don't think so that is so much
important for me as of now whatever I am
getting from the community the community
is sharing my video that is actually far
more important and valuable for me okay
so yes please do life's lives are
awesome please get electronic cs8 ah I
am thinking but I am NOT super impressed
by that the basalis kinda
thing because if I'll hold the Samsung
Galaxy s8 on my tripod it will just
scratch of the screen because screen is
going towards end to end so I don't know
how how that will go up in the Galaxy s8
I'll try right now the phone I'm looking
up for to upgrade would be one plus five
I'm not sure how that will go up and
also I'm not a guy I could just on his
YouTube channel read the brochures of
the fold or give a reviews on them I
leave that kind of stuff to the
professionals and not that guy who is
going to do that but yes I'm planning to
get a one plus five if it is a good one
otherwise I'm happy with my current
phone okay it would be really great and
interactive yes rod heat would be really
awesome so if you support me just like
that I'll try to do these kinds of live
every Sunday should I learn now Python
or cutlet now Natasha
learning Python cortland would be
dependent on what you want to do if you
want to go into the AI or machine
learning that Python would be a good
choice if you are towards dedicated
towards Android or something Catalan or
Java would be a great choice so okay how
do I start making games in android do
you know Android first of all because
giving is a step number two step number
one is how how you design your Android
apps and then further there are a lot of
things like unity game engines it's a
big discussion topic we will enjoy
Sunday with life okay thank you so yes
we are getting a positive response that
means Sunday live is going to happen
okay Sunday life would be a good idea
make a video in freelancing huh
freelancing I was thinking of doing that
for quite a long time that how how to
get started in freelancing and stuff
because I do that as well so freelancing
would be a good topic I'll try to do
that oh it's simply great but we feel
sad when some questions get skipped hey
chase I'm trying my best but you know
there are let me tell you this I hope
many people don't know because life
feature is not available if your
subscriber count is less than ten
thousand so let me show you this that
there is a blueish button there and
whenever you tap that button your just
scroll this goes
just like that so in that sometimes the
questions get skipped I cannot just go
one by one one by one if I tap that
button it just goes whoop like that and
all the questions get missed I'm trying
my best to answer all of you but
sometime it just goes crazy like that
okay so PHP developer versus Android
developer huh it just depends what you
want to do where you want to get a job
because PHP is also equal in the demand
for the small-scale websites is
big-scale websites are also being
developed but nowadays most of the
people who have got fundings and stuff I
would like to move into the advanced
technologies like angular node react
these are the popular name right now but
yes PHP is also good Android on the
other hand is completely different
market Android iOS these are mobile
application development very solid
markets so the bets on what you want to
do how much you earn a month by
programming whatever you see around me
is actually hard by programming only
working for the clients sometime videos
and a lot of projects that I do some of
the projects are very big scales so they
pay really good I'm being offered I
actually get a lot of jobs offer there
for working for full time sometime
contract basis still and even after
going on to the YouTube on a big scale
on a big time offers have actually
doubles so all you see around me all my
heart lei is all my trips is actually on
what I earned from programming so yes
it's a pretty decent amount okay hi bro
hi mohnish how are you doing is c-sharp
and asp.net MVC good choice for
programming for web apps okay you don't
see me talking about programming and
c-sharp more often on this channel I was
planning to make a video on that very
soon I will probably do that C shop is
actually great language and this is all
I can say right now I'm not a big fan of
darknet and there are a couple of
reasons for that but for c-sharp I would
say amazing amazing
for men's when I was working for one of
the project for game development in
unity I didn't did very well into that
I'm still trying to learn a lot about
unity
it's a massive thing but again are
working with the C shop I enjoyed it I
enjoyed it this language is pretty
amazing I'll try to make a video on
c-sharp very soon but for dotnet my
thoughts are completely bad for that
especially when the version rule out of
the dotnet and the previous version is
dumped in it's a nightmare okay so what
do you think about react native I have
absolutely an absolutely positive
feeling about react native this is one
of the state-of-the-art technology and
it will evolve quite a lot in the future
and there would be no surprise for me if
the react native takes over throughout
the web
I have no kind of a surprise at that
point I have absolutely positive feeling
about react native because I'll tell you
why because as well if you have been
working in the Android or iOS you you
are aware of the features like in the
Android based on create method which is
run as soon as the app is up and running
the method is being called and similarly
in iOS we do have methods like
viewwillappear we will disappear and all
these things have never been taken care
by any other language but in react
native we do have such things being
taken care of the states or management
of the states is being taken care of so
this was a big problem that most of the
people like in phone gaps and all were
just completely avoiding it and react
have come up in the front and have dealt
with it
so I have a positive feeling about react
native okay Rocky is Kotlin course on
sale yes absolutely it is on sale you
can check out learn code online dot in
for that I like your thinking about
quality subscribers yes that is
important because having just a billion
gazillion crowd is it's not so people
they will be not so interactive they
will be not so like-minded like
phone rang and I'll just quit that okay
so I'll take up my phones later on take
one plus five yes I'm looking forward
for that Nitesh definitely I'm planning
to buy if if my pocket allows me and if
the phone is available I'll surely try
that and even I'll do a fastest unboxing
that I do look like that so I'll try
that okay so I talked about rule of
Python in data science yeah that would
be awesome I have to make a special
video for that so yes it's a big role
that in Python is the way to going into
the data science okay so how to learn
algorithm and data structure now there
is a one very good book on algorithm and
data structure I forgot the name it was
a big book it used to be on my shelf
then I had to give it to my one of my
junior ah so yes check in udemy I saw
one course yesterday yes my course is
there on learn code online as well as
udemy you can check out feel free to buy
anywhere no problem at all ah hey I
mailed you means I want to learn
programming but I am starting with
JavaScript and I attract it with
front-end and I started learning
programming like game development I
don't think so you have written it
properly so please ask your questions
properly I'm not going anywhere
take your time write them properly so
that I see that I can answer it so
please make a video how to build a
billion-dollar app how to advertise it
and everything related to it I haven't
made any billion dollar app yet if I'll
make a billion dollar app any time soon
I'll surely surely make a video but I
haven't made any million dollar app yet
yes my ABS my websites and everything
are onto a pretty heavy transactions but
maybe not naughty not even close to a
billion dollar so okay okay I don't have
any laptop or PC but want to do
programming and build my career in
cybersecurity hey Drago why don't you
watch out my video on my zero and one
theory so if you don't have a laptop you
don't have a PC go out watch my zero and
one theory video which is on the
channel I think your answer will be will
be there I'm pretty sure okay a PHP
there versus Android okay I have talked
about it and should I focus on data
structure yes of course data structure
is important every time whenever I do a
management of for example in learned
code online dot in these things kind of
things like video management and how the
video will be rendered how the user's
data will be stored everything
everything needs to be there in the data
structure okay I want to become a great
car developer Kaba I don't know what
that language is okay please be live on
Sunday regularly yes I'll try even I
will try to fix up at time as well on
Sunday when fixing up a time for me is
very very tough oh I hope you can
understand creating videos creating
ideas filming them producing them then
writing code then writing the courses
finishing the finishing of the clients
project and doing all of that by one man
it's a tough job I have to be scheduled
properly and on top of that I'd go to
swimming I go to gym I do right Haleh so
boom so it's going quite a lot okay how
many grey shirts do you have that's an
interesting question mr. potty I if I
kind I would have actually like a round
of eight or ten or maybe maybe around
fifteen or so or maybe twelve twelve to
fifteen I do have a lot of these some of
them are shorts like a sleeve short
sleeves some of them are full but on a
total count that would be around twelve
to fifteen so how do you have all same
you don't have to look around he just
can take up anything so it's it's pretty
easy how to become exceptionally well in
Java developer if you want to become
exceptionally well you have to work
exceptionally hard you have to be
regular exceptionally and that's it easy
tree house subscription depends if you
can afford that it's little bit pricey
compared to the individual courses but
if you want surely you can buy that no
problem
Holly just keep on learning doesn't
really matter if you're learning from
tree house you're learning from you to
me or land code online end goal is learn
it and create something with it that's
that's actually the whole goal of this
channel simple just one line are good
learn from it build it
that's it they are not having a big goal
here we're not trying to be user good
word here okay
is it launched yes it's launched to my
website is up and running learning code
online dot and you can check it out okay
languages for Microsoft not a big fan of
Microsoft not at all a not a big fan of
Microsoft I do I have a Microsoft
product in my home ok I do have one
laptop surely I do have a license of
Windows 10 I did bought it around eight
eight month ago for a specific task
didn't did that still the license is
there apart from that I don't have any
Microsoft product I just have one
Windows 10 which I don't use it's just
lying around there so maybe in some of
the giveaways and give out that license
to anybody I don't use it
ah okay so no problem will we will goes
on asking questions surely you can
always ask questions that's why I'm here
okay so please tell about how to website
projects from local market as students
how to take website project from local
market though with market is sometimes
difficult if you are in some state which
is not aware of the much of the internet
stuff and website but if you do have
previous portfolio may be fictitious
portfolio that surely always help okay
see language is required for Kotlin no
not at all
Cortland is a separate language and you
can just directly learn that but on top
of that if you have previous programming
language it surely helps but it is not
required okay so how much time we have
spend let me check that out
16 minutes and almost 100 people are
watching it amazing amazing oh hi Nitish
how are you how is it going on it's it's
being a long time that we have
cashed out let's make some plan why
don't you pick me on Facebook let's go
ahead and grab some coffee it would be
amazing we haven't met in so long I have
been busy I've been traveling abroad
I've been staying abroad quite a lot but
now I'm back for at least two months I
have to go back I do have a couple of
plans in Europe so I'll be going back
but again if you can ping me on Facebook
we can have a coffee so ah react versus
angular versus view versus meteor
forefront and which would you choose I
would choose react but that doesn't mean
I am against angular or view or mature
they are again good Fritton framework
but I have done a lot of research and on
top of that after that I have chosen
react probably I'll make a video but all
of the languages all the other
frameworks are pretty nice but I'm a fan
of reactants spatially the reason is if
I now react I can quickly switch on to
react native so that is one of the way
make a C++ course I guess that's a long
time do because third C++ Co I wanted to
make it quite advanced so that it can be
used in NS 3 in case you are not aware
of the NS 3 that is pretty awesome thing
I have been offered quite a lot of job
for the NS 3 I haven't take any of them
I was offered a job from amazon.com as
well for working on NS 3 prototype their
Kindle devices research make research
based work in the United States but I
didn't took that so yes I'll shortly do
that a C++ course ok so uh what about
Java tell about Java
ok people are a lot of fan of Java ah
your super experience means it is some
good projects topic for AI and mi I
think machine learning ml that is ml is
machine learning
AI Oh actually a lot of people don't get
it about ai ai is not about artificial
intelligence e it's not about yes the
name actually is artificial intelligence
e but it's a different thing if you have
heard about the terms like noodle
network
which I did studied in my masters it's
about training a program you have to
give a training through the program
first and then it can predict doubt or
it's not like anything it will do it on
its own it's about how much data you are
supplying it to it at how much
meaningful information it can get from
that nothing is automatic if it's the
word artificial intelligence people just
see just like they are used to see in
the movies like things will be done
automatically it's not like that it's
good and doing predictions but it's not
completely automatic okay and we are
facing some connection issues okay talk
about Udacity nano degree please okay
okay I got here you know City nano
degree is an awesome program they do
have a rigorous training assets and
everything but on top of that you need
to understand one important thing that
the word nano degree is not a degree
okay that's a little bit deceiving but
nano degree is not a degree that is just
a certification they are not associated
with some UIC or a ICT or UGC or
something that's just a trademarked word
nano degree maybe in the future if I
just come up and I can say hey my
certification are known as a tech dot
degree or some artificial degree or
something like that so that's exactly
same but on top of that I would say
their program is really good little bit
costly I would say like 40,000 50,000
sometimes 80,000 it's costly for short
no doubt about that but don't just do it
for the degree nano degree if you are
doing it for knowledge purpose awesome
if you can afford forty five thousand or
fifty thousand go ahead do that I prefer
between JavaScript and Java I prefer
JavaScript a lot of people pitch me
about that but I prefer JavaScript hey
tej please make a video difference
between developer and programmer
hey whoa what what is that even a word
that's just a being kind of a thing
being made by college developer
programmer if somebody can write a code
he is a programmer and if he can develop
something he is a programmer who can
develop
instead of the person don't get into
quite a lot into the specific definition
part go into when you are doing
something big go something meaningful
don't worry I want to become a
programmer or developer no your goal
should be I want to create this this is
my end goal I want to have a job in this
company on the HP domain this is my goal
so don't just keep your goals very small
between these kinds of nonsense things
some developer programmer I'm not going
to make a video on that for sure
okay so Android development basic Java
is good enough or should I consider
intermediate or advanced course now
basic Java just if you can write loops
if you can write functions if you can
declare classes that's it that's it and
you can do pretty good in Java Linux or
Microsoft
I would prefer Mac hey Sampath and I
know a lot of people will come upon me
hey why don't you go for the Linux just
to tell you I have done three or four
certifications in Red Hat so yes I know
quite a lot about Linux I have worked
for quite a number of times on Kali
Linux and backtrack in case some of you
were not in in the information security
at that time I have worked in backtrack
two or three just like that it was a
long time ago so just to give you an
idea
I would prefer Mac because it has all
the awesome things that a Linux has plus
I don't have to look up for the drivers
every single time I plug on a device or
I have to connect to a Wi-Fi so yes I
have a Mac oriented guy because I need
reliability sometime I need to work on
apps like sketch or Photoshop or a Final
Cut Pro and these things does have an
alternative in the world of Linux but no
I'm not going there working alone is
good or working with team is good or
working for a company is good as a
programming okay but that's a tricky
question because I'm as kind of a
one-man army guy I just like to do
everything on my own and even if I work
in the companies in the past and I just
make a mess everywhere because I like
things to be done fast quick efficiently
and sometimes people are just yawning
out there I cannot be here that so I'm
not a good team player I have tried at
the past but
I cannot bear that when some when word
is lying around how can somebody be so
lazy so I don't get much into the team
player kind of a thing because I'm very
strict about maintaining time
maintaining schedule and be more
productive as much as possible so
depends on how you plays on so I'm not a
team player much okay how can I start
delivering games in Android as I'm
already working in Android application I
think a lot of applications I forgot
about the name and much but there are a
lot of frameworks which on which you can
work and can do that 2d games are
actually more popular compared to the
unity and everything because in unity
you have to work on team and things
things like that okay I'll take a little
bit break a water break bear with me you
can type your questions in the meantime
okay let's get back so where are you
from does it matter where am i from
I can be from Delhi from Mumbai from
Jaipur from Paris does it matter
we are internet people all we have is
Internet
we are from Internet we will be on
internet that's it okay best course for
programmer there is no such thing as
best okay buying a treehouse
subscription is it worthy I haven't
tried that actually so I cannot be a
good person to judge whether it's a good
or not but it's little bit pricey so
watch out for that and I don't know I
haven't seen any of my students taking
that because all they like is to get
boot camps maybe from me or maybe from
other persons so they like to buy an
individual courses and do that because
subscription at first month or two month
it looks good after that it becomes a
recursive payment sometimes you are not
able to study but still you have to pay
so make sure you change you decide these
things first of all what is your profile
sir profile in what means if you want my
what does profile means my github
accounts are my resume or my youtube
profile or my degree is what you want to
know
but hackers use Python as a first
language because it's far more easier to
write scripts in it and sometimes you
have to do jobs on automation or maybe
at a base level like for example you
have you have captured some packets in
the Wireshark you want to break down
those package analyze things so Python
is a good thing for that you can do same
things in the shell as well but it would
be really really tough so these kinds of
low-level things are done quite easily
in Python as well as number two which is
very important is available of
humongously live libraries which are
like out on the net so please put C++
LLC oh very soon I'll try my best how to
learn Cortland from sketch why don't you
visit learn code online dot in promotion
can i buy macbook or Windows I'm a web
developer I fear if I buy my I'll suck
my life so please say can I buy a
macbook yes you can buy a macbook
there's no such thing to be afraid of
plus you don't have to pay for the
subscription or to buy a windows you
don't have to buy Microsoft Word or
office every software that webbed other
buddy use is available on Mac as well in
fact they work a little bit more awesome
than on Mac on Mac then on Windows
specially atom it sucks on Windows it
crashes a lot on Windows but a Mac I
haven't seen it being crashed ok so so
how to make money with web scrapping
jasiu I don't do that that's illegal
actually scraping any web site is not
not something that you should be doing
ok so let's go up there what do you
think about free code camp ah no I don't
have such good words about free stuff
because if pricing Lee is being
associated with something it means the
person who is doing it it's more
professional he has done it more as a
serious job when it be it is being done
free it just he
deliver D but when the free when the
paid stuff is there it's more about
seriousness it's more about what you're
doing it you are doing some product for
the people they're going to buy it
they're gonna judge it they're going to
evaluate it so I'm a big fan of paying
stuff so I think okay so have you have
done almost a 30-minute live that's that
is a big one okay so
jayveer okay greetings okay okay so it
was awesome now the questions are
getting repeated somebody's asking is
very protein good for health no idea I'm
not a health expert you should probably
ask a nearby doctor that would be
awesome so but I cannot give you advice
on whey protein that was special
something amazing why girls are not into
programming who say to you that girls
are not into programming there are a lot
of girls in the work space where you
work on though there are lot of girls
yes the ratio of the boys is little
higher but yes there are girls they are
learning it lot and in fact learn code
online a lot of girls are learning
anything even have completed a lot of
project and are more serious so just say
so yes they are into programming okay
can you make a video in typescript no
not at all right now the typescript is
not in my to-do list
right now there are a couple of other
things so that script is not why we are
same colored t-shirt everyday this color
suits me I'm just kidding
yes okay so what about MBC please make
video an MVC program with coding example
last video helps me more yes last video
was more about giving a more vague
example of why the things are being done
and how the things should be done so
based on that yes that would be awesome
but surely I will try to do that in
in fact I have done a lot of MVC videos
in my is bootcamp and there will be
surely in the Android boot camps as well
so yes what's your educational
background
does it matter does it matter if I'm an
engineer or not if I have done my
Master's or not if I have done my
doctorate or not I haven't completed my
doctorate yet so it doesn't really
matter why are you worried about my
educational profile all I know is I know
the tech I can deliver the tech and I
can build products in that I think
that's it
that is the most important aspect okay a
lot of questions which is the best
laptop to buy but for a college student
first year and watch out my video on
what is the best laptop I have done that
on the channel it's not about naming a
specific brand because I'm not getting
sponsored by them but even if I will be
getting sponsored I won't be telling any
name at least not now okay so what kind
of okay tell your degrees and
universities why you need that well
people worried about the degrees so much
or certificates so much all you should
be worried about is uh how you can be a
better person and how you can write
better code that should be the top thing
why the degrees and by the way yes I
have done a lot of degree so I'm not
much enthusiastic about it I've done all
of that I have seen how the things goes
in the college in the engineering
colleges how the things are being taught
and how the things should be taught I
have seen both of them not much
impressed about it okay oh how are you
doing today bro hey I'm doing good but
and ok so I'm going to buy a new laptop
for my web design work but on low budget
what's the minimum requirement for
running out of a Photoshop CC to k17
effectively for web design okay so you
use a web photo shops Mohit's so that
means I think you are using a cloud base
for the subscription I think it's $49 I
think
so I have to check that out so if you're
paying $49 every month I think you can
afford a pretty good machine so it
should not be a big deal for you because
the people who can afford Photoshop and
can have Photoshop in their machine days
obviously need a good system at least
4gb of RAM is is nice
but yes if you are a 14 $49 a month my
good laptop shouldn't be a much deal for
you
or if you are using a cracked version
then I am not gonna support you you're
supporting piracy and I don't support
piracy 's okay so you're from India or
Pakistan I know and you know that I know
you know okay that's a tongue twister
there right now I am in India but
doesn't really means I'm going to stay
here for long so that was a nice tongue
twister
okay boot camp course is awesome on a on
Loc it's not LOC it's lco but thank you

I'm not a big fan of xamarin I prefer
react native it's far more easier and
far more awesome and performance in them
xamarin so go for react native how to be
expert in android development work for
it for five years you will be expert
okay so how do I convert Python code
into an application your Python code is
already an application if it is solving
a problem it is doing something it's an
application and if you're looking up to
convert in GOI there's TK inter tryout
that it's awesome how to set up server
for mobile app I don't know why you want
to do that that would be really really a
bad idea okay so let's just see what
more question bootstrap course is
awesome
yeah bootstrap course is four for free

join that everybody feel free to join

the question goes off something OS
MacBook Air worth it no I don't think so
MacBook Air is a good machine MacBook
Pro is definitely a good machine I'm a
big fan of MacBook Pro here is little
bit pricey doesn't do the job much for
development purposes but yeah ok ok so I
would say that yes we have spent a lot
of time I would try to do these kinds of
live on every Sunday notify me in the
comment section if you are watching this
