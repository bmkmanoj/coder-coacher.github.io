you
hated everyone they shear and we are
back again with Saturday live usually it
is ten o'clock but today I got stuck up
with an important meeting and it it was
not getting over so apologies for that
but again we're back again with another
Saturday lifer programmers the people
like you the people like me who loves to
code and there we go
yes finally I'm here it was actually an
important meeting with a client I got
stuck over there but again this is all
excuse but not at all the problem we are
finally here and we're again talking
about the stuff you're back finally yes
I am back snehal I am back okay
can you can you make a video on busting
the common myths about programming that
would be an interesting subject so this
is a moment where I can use my sticky
notes I hope everybody uses the sticky
notes oh I can just check that out and
can write it somewhere here and
programming meth that is actually nice
subject thank you so much for suggesting
this web developer say is love you love
you too guys you're awesome
the problem is remembering the code have
to look in the documentation quite
frequently police help haynam eeshwar
this is not a problem this is actually a
good thing even I don't remember any of
the code most of the time it eventually
gets to me like for example bootstrap
classes and all these things eventually
you learn it by doing it but to be
honest I don't remember most of the code
I even look into the documentation this
is not an exam this is you are building
the things for so looking in the
documentation is completely ok all the
programmers do it so nothing to be
worried you work on Saturday I work all
the time I don't take off even in
Sundays so I'm always working I take off
at the end of the year for a completely
few days and then I just go this is how
I like to work
no offs this is like the thing I love so
I just do that what is that humming
noise ok let me fix that up ok though
let me just try this humming noise let
me get rid of that
okay
is it making homey no humming noise
nice gate okay
okay
why is it making humming noise okay
is it gone now
okay so your mat is slow yeah it's a
little bit slower belated Happy Republic
day for you too as well no noise okay
it's gone yeah sometimes you know this
is this is the mic which is not good
how do you find clients rich neat says
usually they come automatically in my
email previously I used to bid at up
work and freelance as well okay so yeah
this is how I get it your net is slow
the stream health actually looks good it
just shows me on the stream health so
stream health is actually all green so I
don't think that should be no HD
I think it's HD I think so let me just
move it here okay this is better okay
any good recent project yes we are about
to finish up a chatbot project which was
using a lot of machine learning so
that's a good project we did it right
now now the LCU is international now yes
it is it's really an exciting movement
for me that yes it's it's just gone okay
okay let's pick up some question gate I
don't pick up questions on gate I
probably I'll make a video on the
questions that I will never answer gate
is one of them
I don't really a kind of a person who
can inspire you for becoming gate and
everything so I I don't talk much about
it okay how will be out to be freelancer
just work on to your own your flee
freelancer okay so sir every worked with
company variety of companies I have
worked with variety of companies a
couple of startups one of them was in
New York based startup I worked a lot in
the regex and all these things with that
then I worked as a information security
trainer for a couple of years than fear
few months I worked as for an SEO agency
as well and then for the same company
where I was working as an SEO analyst I
was I switched into their front-end
department as well because I was pretty
good in coding so I switched it from
there and then from there onwards I
moved totally into freelancing lines
okay let's pick up more question yes Jen
says hey hey yes how are you will you
please make tutorials on servlet as of
now servlet is not on the top priority
let's just be honest they are not in the
top priority as of now we were gone to a
completely different domains so server
that is not in much of demand to us so
yes why increase lco boot camp rate from
six to eight hundred are things prices
do get changes based on the things so
whenever you are getting the best just
take that ok tell us about Richie
Thompson says tell us about his journey
as a penetration tester it was good I
liked it quite a lot I I got a lot of
travel along along the India but I was
not gets getting satisfied with just the
information security I wanted to create
some things here and all these stuff so
ok so that is why this was not amazingly
great for me as a penetration tester I
enjoyed it but I was not creating
anything that didn't made me happy so
that's why I
I left that domain I worked at some time
but yeah I don't like that much
tell us about your daily routine okay
right now the routine is completely
shaken off because we were too busy in
the documentation process opening up
your bank account in the u.s. is such a
pain so we were busy with that then
holding the api's and stuff so routine
is completely bursted right now usually
it looks like I get up early in the
morning try to hit some running or maybe
some gym and then usually this client
work at the priority then in the
afternoon I shoot a video for youtube
then in the evening back on to some
courses or maybe client depends on who
is on the priority list and then in the
evening usually it's swimming so that's
like okay how many language do you know
be specific let me be specific here
I know programming that's it I don't
care about what programming language it
is language is just a tool I have never
cared much about it so whether it's PHP
or maybe Python or Java I really don't
care
I know programming and the basics
remains always same so that's it and yes
I have worked on a lot say my name Rahul
Sharma hey Rahul Sharma how's it going
on are you married nope
I'm not married yet namaste namaste
director coding nice name there
Ave I stopped Android playlist I start
and retina list because Android is now a
full-fledged course which you can find
out at learned code online website iOS
future amazing future amazing just onto
a side note have you checked out the
realm it's an amazing we I recently used
the realm in one of my project
you
okay so finally I'm back onto the
connection internet issues yeah internet
issues
what can I say I really need to shout
out on somebody and that is gonna be my
internet guy he promised me a good
internet connection and just went off
doomed like that exception thrown off
and that was really funny
Richard exception thrown off line okay
that was pretty good can we expect a
collab anytime soon maybe if somebody
wants to collab with me for programming
like surely it would be obviously I
don't like to collab with people like
who are good in mobile reviews or maybe
Hardware reviews or are reviewing such
things like cameras and stuff so not
that kind of guys but yeah why did you
sell your PSD project because it was a
good money I liked it I struggled it I
would prepare for gate I don't know you
dress more like Zuckerberg let me tell
you the moment I decided that I'm gonna
be wearing gray for the next couple of
years I knew it that it was gonna coming
up and people are gonna say that you are
copying Zuckerberg it's okay you're
comparing with me with a very very big
guy but it's okay it's fine but it's not
for the same reasons obviously okay
Digvijay is offline we are back online
come on I'm online lag I'm sorry I'm
back onto the connection the where I
live the place where I live is not
amazing on internet I hate that
okay what happened sir something
happened to my internet internet is
really slacking up here so okay what's
your qualification good enough to write
code I think so okay how can I earn a
front-end developer yes okay with clever
programmer he's a good channel probably
I'll ask him to make a couple of collab
with him when next time I'll be in the
u.s. I'll try that innocent devil says
you're ignoring me no I may not ignoring
here your internet sex I know this and I
accept it okay okay let's pick up okay
ah I found some somebody
so
okay so
just okay now it's Khan
okay can you speak okay let's pick up
career in know Jesus it's amazing no it
is still popular a lot of people are
using it so again go for node okay
but-- c'mon lco purchase the hey Raj be
thank you so much for supporting this is
your support that's keep going on with
us okay
how would you suggest someone to start
freelancing in coding Rahul that's a
very good question so how would I
suggest anybody I would suggest somebody
to first of all just work on yourself
first of all prepare portfolio like
Rahul it's Rahul so it would be like
Rahul Jim Rahul tech company
Rahul construction company maybe Rahul
hosting and selling company maybe Rahul
cleanup business so prepare website for
all these usual common stuff and then
when anybody client can show up you can
show them all the templates and your
work that this is what I have done and
it would be much more easier for you to
approach client and then finally asking
them what you can do for them so this is
how you can get started in freelancing
how is the gaming on your new new PC not
much
I haven't played much of the game I have
created actually two games on it created
them I'll share them very soon with you
guys so not haven't played much on it
even created again that's it so probably
I'll play some game tomorrow maybe I'll
do a livestream of that on gaming
YouTube okay
okay tell us about your job right now
working on a freelancing stuff and the
some videos just like this one okay
let's pick up all question
so let's pick up more one digital
marketing digital marketing is growing
like like anything I don't know we're
just gonna stopping it but digital
marketing is really really awesome going
on if you're looking forward to go into
digital marketing then surely you should
definitely try that it's going amazing
for all those people who are not
interested in coding it's not a good
thing in program for programmers I tried
that and being a programmer it was not
creative much more not like awesome
thing for me so that's why I obviously
if you're a programmer you will be
leaving that job but if you don't like
coding and stuff digital marketing is a
good thing that you should try okay oh
okay such an says I can ask my question
in such crowd may be you would not see
my question yeah sometimes some
questions to get miss but it's fun stuff
I just talked to you guys and all that
it's fun stuff okay huge fan of you sir
you're a good trainer of you are a good
trainer thank you so much
okay so let's pick up more questions
it's Java hard no not that much hard but
for a big net it's actually a little bit
complicated to understand because right
from out of the box you're creating a
class creating objects an instance and
all these things it's a little bit hard
for big nurse to actually understand it
- or maybe Swift or maybe JavaScript can
be a little bit easier as compared to
Java then you can switch on to Java but
again if I'll say anything Java lovers
will just come on to me like hey how
dare you just say something like that
okay let's pick up sir its certification
required for freshers in Java no not at
all not at all certification is if you
do have that kind of money obviously go
for certification but it's not
compulsory
you should have projects most of the
companies because I'll probably talk
about tomorrow this dump issues there
are a lot of certification dump
available and just like you corporate
also knows about the situation that
there are dumb
available people can just have dumps and
can pass these exams and all all the
people are aware of it so certifications
are not that important as compared to
projects okay
uhh
I purchased your react native design
course and its really awesome thank you
so much but when react native backand
course coming are very soon very soon
first of all I'm a little bit focused on
different course I cannot reveal you
much of that I usually don't but surely
if the friended is there obviously the
bakit is meant to be out there so it
will come up what about okay where it
can the question goes like that would
you like to visit my college for a
seminar surely I would love to obviously
you have to take care of my travel and
stay expenses I usually like to just
come on to the city and just go on the
same day but surely any long-term goals
no I don't keep long-term goals because
the future is not so stable I'm not sure
where I'll be tomorrow or maybe the next
month so I don't like to just think too
much about the future it will get
worried you so even if you think too
much about the future you'll get worried
and there is no surety what will happen
tomorrow so I don't worry too much just
focus on today just keep working hard
today today isn't our control that's it
I don't care much okay
so I am IT student which language should
I focus of totally on you want to build
an Android app Kotlin Java want to build
app for both iOS and Android react maybe
react native maybe iOS totally or new
what do you want to do don't pick up the
language choose up your projects
after lco course how to submit project
to you love from Mumbai you can post
your projects in discussion section or
if you have completed or built up
something of your own with complete
creativity throw me at email hit H at
hit H Adri calm
okay
so a lot of people angular course still
not in there not at the list yet let's
it will be there which is your mic it's
a it's a mic from blue I'm not liking it
for on the live probably I'll change
that very soon I'll get something like
for headphone or something that would be
better for us let's just see right now
I'm not happy with this mic this is good
for recording tutorials and voiceovers
and stuff like that but not at all which
phone do you use this one this is one
plus five as of now I'm looking forward
for a mobile which can give me like
water water proof maybe water not water
resistant waterproof phone that I can
record some of the awesome stuff because
I visit beaches and all these stuff
quite commonly
I want something which is this is not
waterproof okay and just to give your
answer I use one plus device previously
I was an iPhone user from iPhone I guess
3GS to iPhone 6 I have used iPhone then
I switched on to this 1 plus device I
think Apple need to do something hey th
can you call my name a Russia cash Kohli
I Kohli you could have you can add an
edge and you can become a Kohli
that would be awesome for you ok just
kidding ok ah okay suction is also
making some high section why are you
making donations in corporation success
parties during our office let's do it
I'll come from Kota perks of super chat
come on section don't do that
let's other gave the chance to ask
question okay super chat when office
guys make super chat and just okay come
on
this is one
okay
ah back-end tell us about that I will
very sure very soon come up with
something super solid super awesome on
back-end so stay tuned Sony is
waterproof but I'm not like Sony's
Android because Sony makes so much make
over or the Android I like the kind of a
vanilla Android is stuff so I don't like
Sony's that much okay so they're
internships
oh yes we have already hired one intern
already very soon we look you look sad
no not at all huh not sad and just
little bit sad because I couldn't come
up on time at 10 o'clock my internet is
was making an issue at start so that
makes me a little bit sad but again not
at all sad I'm actually super happy
super bummed up okay what was this
ejected arrow am a m79 that's good it's
Java enough for carrier relying on just
one technology and saying that it's
enough it's not a good idea you you are
having a time where you can learn
multiple things so why not to do that
just staying up with one language I
don't think so that's a good thing
go ahead and explore yourself if you are
looking forward to growing Java just
explore more things Java with Android
spraying starts variety of things don't
start with one Explorer incorporation
party yeah which is my job
oriented B Tech or BCAM none of them
it's all your skill that is gonna give
you these jobs and stuff
so I want to learn ethical hacking help
me out you can try out check out courses
there is amazing course at learn code
online dot in go ahead check that out so
okay
what do you think about HTML coin should
we purchase it how should okay
there are HTML coins come on last day it
was a fake geocoin and now it's HTML
coin and Bitcoin when are the hitters
coming getting launched I really want
them to somebody to launch hit each coin
okay do you like photography or just
coding no while love photography don't
you see this guy this is not present at
any coders desk this is present at
photographer's desk usually and on top
of that when you see the lenses like
this one which is pretty damn expensive
and it's awesome this is something for
photography not for just coders so yes
I'm pretty much serious about
photography as well I'm learning it
quite a lot okay so yeah that's it
it issues what is the scope of selenium
in future selenium is not going anywhere
it's amazing it's awesome so if you are
looking forward to learn selenium go
ahead do that don't wait you will not
regret that but again make sure you're
learning Java first inden selenium
blenheim can be used with c-sharp Python
Java probably others as well but go for
the Java one also once you have got
through with the selenium make your goal
that you look forward for a PM as well
okay so very good question they're
really looking smart today hacky head
that was good thank you okay
speak up more questions sir my caller
says there he will teach only HTML 4 but
I feel hi she'll learn html5 and css3 as
well so then land on JavaScript um
actually to be honest html5 is just the
top icing over HTML 4 so there is not
much of the difference if once you
learned HTML 4 it just learned the icing
and there we go you have learned this
team of 5 not a big deal okay love your
t-shirt I would like to give it to you
but if I have veered something inside ok
is this the end of Bitcoin probably I
think so but I don't know where this
Bitcoin stuff is going on it will get
rise just wait for the next hacking
incident to happen and some ask somebody
to pay that ransom in Bitcoin and again
it will be shooting up to like $20,000 a
Bitcoin okay so
now can I expect that he will be coming
with a cart like stuff of in future for
Android course which focuses on how to
code in for production purpose
definitely you can you can rely me on
that very soon we will be designing apps
like exactly like learned code online
video can just purchase their stuff and
can give the access and all these stuff
so definitely these are planned up
Chaudhary is your initial now let's see
okay
answer me PU Sh did you watched but
mawatha this is going somewhere
I live in Rajasthan okay and if I'll be
watching the movies like but not
probably I can hear some trouble just
outside my home so it's not that bad
actually the movie the media guys
actually just throw is like too much
often here but again I don't know what
to say on this subject this is very very
tricky subject
let's keep everything on to the code
let's fight on Java and Python that's it
okay
we're programmers guys we don't take
interest in such things obviously I
don't watch much of the Bollywood movies
so why should I be worried about one
more not gonna be watching that anyways
so I don't really care
uh how authentication works I have
discussed about authentication in my
react course as well probably we'll be
talking about that in the future as well
at what age you started coding it's
almost like now ten years or nine years
or something like that so not much far
ago but yeah nine or ten years are
pretty decent how to be a fast coded in
Java nobody is a fast coder IDE is a
fast code okay okay why don't you visit
Maharashtra I visit Shan Elysion they
say is why don't you visit Maharashtra I
do visit Maharashtra quite a lot and in
fact I am being invited number of times
at IIT Bombay I have been there yes I do
visit my Astra I love it okay so
you Shigure wall say is how to start
with web dev try out my complete
front-end developer course this is the
perfect point to get started in web
development okay do you like photography
I have already answered that are you
from Jaipur yes Pioche I am from Jaipur
my home is in Jaipur but I don't stay
here much I do travel okay
well there are so less courses on
internet about firebase I don't know but
in all of my courses for Android there's
no specific course on firebase because
firebase alone cannot have a course it
needs to be integrated with something
web Android iOS react to xamarin maybe
something else so there will be always
course on something which may use
firebase firebase cannot have a
standalone course it's not about
learning the firebase it's about from
which technology you want to use
firebase so that's why not much of the
course in firebase okay do you have your
own swimming pool no I don't have my own
swimming pool I just use the community
one there is a nearby swimming pool they
have given me yearly access on a very
very cheap rate so even in winters I'm
the lone guy who is just swimming around
so that's it had you ever been to head
robot yes recently in my trip I was in
Hyderabad it was lovely
I enjoyed the Charminar but it was
little bit like polluted and stuff so
what is react firebase I'm a newbie in
this field hey you might want to check
out my youtube videos on what is
firebase that would be helpful for you
mr. Roy nice name mr. Roy it looks like
like a Sherlock Holmes mr. Roy
don't make me I'm a jerk I'm making it
one of your surname obviously he's
turned it was just unlike like that so I
hope you don't mind that I even makes
the fun of my surname as well sometime
I'm like that okay so let's pick up more
question have you ever been Bangalore
yes of course I stayed there for a
little bit longer I posted it on my
Facebook page you want to meet me come
to this place at Bangalore a lot of
people came there your occupation start
vlog daily
oh okay is this my photo yes it is my
photo I think so sandy thank you so much
for the first time I've seen that
somebody has used my photo in this
profile picture really really it's
motivating I like it like it this is
like a fun moment somebody have used my
photo in his profile page whoa never
seen that
okay so javascript is able to handle
back-end for a highly traffic website of
course it's your database that handles
the traffic not your front-end website
okay so it's nothing roll up the
JavaScript or such and yes of course it
can handle okay answered me should I
update my mini project on github ah of
course you should be sorry I'm late just
forget completely how are you bro hey
Hassan absolutely awesome fantastic
doing great how are you okay call my
name I'm Kirsty again dot frank west
iake
okay so let's pick up more questions you
guys can give it a thumbs up this video
shouted my name Rohit hey Rohit how are
you okay the questions are actually
going really fast can you make a video
on search engines surely
probably we can design a simple search
engine on MySQL based data that would be
much more awesome it's actually very
easy if you try that out okay call my
name hey muhammad hasaan kukri i hope i
pronounced that right I'm really bad in
that if I didn't excuse me please
okay so I was just watching your github
video on YouTube thank you so much I
have put out a lot of good videos on
YouTube but unfortunately I don't get
much of the traffic because these are
very programming centric videos if I
would be making videos on geo or geocoin
obviously it'll get much more traffic
but since I don't make them I get less
traffic but who cares I get this amazing
awesome community of programmers I'm
happy with this absolutely
Adri means a child remains my surname
hey Akash I am on Android currently and
my sir is continuously asking me to do
DevOps can I go with that yes of course
you can go with the DevOps as well but
if you're already an Android and you are
interested in that why to switch DevOps
is also but it's not new it was already
there DevOps just solved the problem of
the fight between administrator and the
developer administrator says your
project is not good and admits the
project developer says your system is
not good so this is the fight that Dave
of salts that's it and I think you can
go into DevOps but I would say if you
are already interested in Android
because the question is there I am
pretty sure you are moreover interested
in Android Android is amazing it's not
going anywhere so I think you should
look forward for Android as well but if
their work is there yeah it's ok as well
ok I'm really sorry I cannot take a
slide here about how DevOps and Android
because they are completely different
domains it would be like something you'd
be switching your domain completely if
you want to do that just make sure you
are doing this switch that you don't
want to come back on to Android that's
why most of the people do this kind of
switch but if you're already an Android
go ahead yet move forward in Android ok
so
okay so let's pick up
questions
it's not Gaurav it's hit a sh how come
how can you like it scan it can be
confusion in hit H or Nitish but how can
it be confusion in hit H and Gaurav I
don't know where are you why are you
here
okay so let's pick up a rag of joshi how
are you can I use firebase for big
projects in Android ah yes but make sure
you two check out the pricing as well
firebase can be a little bit pricey with
the more traffic so do take care of that
it is a little bit on the expensive side
or do check out rapid dot IO in case you
haven't checked that rapid IO is much
more comparatively little bit cheaper
provides the same functionality as the
firebase so go ahead check that out as
well and if you're using the apps don't
forget to include the realm as well in
your apps it's really amazing so it just
reduces the traffic actually so best
laptop under 50k go ahead check out
learn code online blog and search for
laptop under 50k I have already written
a blog there so check that out
author name and his designation why you
want to know my father's name sometimes
people are just little bit weird little
bit weird how does the future of iOS
development market in Indian
subcontinent absolutely empty market you
can just learn a little bit of the
things and can get hired because not
much of the people are like that much
fluent in iOS development most of our
people are on Android so I would say
empty market super demanda because all
these apps like a zoo Metro and what are
all these have swiggy and all of them
are having iOS app but they are they
need to be maintained okay
hey damage can you please not write in a
Russian here you can write in in English
here okay
because Gaurav Chaudhary is and this is
why people may confuse okay let's not
talk about that let's keep the talks
about programming here okay what is your
occupation to make youtube videos and
make some coding projects as well okay
a back-end working with react.js and
react native is same yes it's almost
exactly same there are a couple of
places where you have to change things
like on press and react native and a
couple of different things on react but
mostly it's same if you'll talk about
the backend if you're using firebase it
is being exactly same way you integrate
and react and react native so I wanted
to include a couple of videos of that of
the I haven't shared it on YouTube or

couple of data structure and algorithm
stuff in Java bootcamp so go ahead check
that out please uh uh there was a

couldn't be oh you have read my comment
it's cool hey - yes I have read that ok
broader course and Android is there a
time limit the time limit is 3 years and
I believe that if somebody cannot learn
a course in 3 years he won't be learning
it at all but I think 3 year is more
than enough to learn any technology you
know that's the limit I don't promise
the lifetime access because lifetime
access an unlimited bandwidth and is
like something which is not so true it's
kind of a fake promise there's no such
thing as unlimited probably the company
may shut down in the list let's just say
3 years so where is the lifetime access
there and obviously similarly some
broadband lines pays you we give you
unlimited jeebies there's no such
unlimited GBS there is always a cap so I
like to be just very clear there ok
and usually in three years I update my
courses so you know
so how to be any expert in any coding
language just code every single day
create a lot of projects pretty easy
