regular expression now before we get
started and write some of the regular
expression and try to understand what
all these symbol means I want to point
your attention something here now here
you can see we have got a JavaScript
engine and a PC re server now I will
talk more about what are these regular
expression engines in a minute but first
of all we need to understand what is the
difference between JavaScript and pcre
this is moreover related to history of
pcre because pcre comes from the history
well yeah I know I do understand that a
lot of programmers don't like history
lessons or PowerPoint presentation
lessons but this is interesting this is
what makes the current regular
expression what they are actually so yes
I won't be writing any regular
expression in this video if you want to
skip this
go ahead completely skip that you won't
be missing anything but this is
interesting you'll love that so let me
talk about these pcre and how these are
actually working and yes you will be
amazed to know that a lot of even
seasonal developers don't know what this
PC re they just say this is used for PHP
and all these stuff now let me take you
back on to the history lesson and
explain from where this PC already comes
some now from the very early of the
computer stage the whole goal of
computer programming language is to make
it as close as possible with the human
brain and this is what we are doing
currently right now in 2018 we are
trying to get as close as a human brain
of a machine learning and artificial
intelligence see now there's a lot more
to discuss about that topic like Bayes
theorem and stuff but in the earlier
days around 1950s this was not much
evolved the closest thing that you have
got at that time was first developed in
a paper of neuroscience he has this
actually old reg X things came up from
the neuroscience paper now in that a
person designed a thing known as regular
sets and called it as a regular algebra
now at that time this regular algebra
was termed as regular expression the
symbols used in regular expression was
called as regular set and this is the
whole thing which was closest to
replicating the human brain because it
could have find out the things like
needle in a haystack now but this was
not introduced in computers really a
long time after that in 1970s paste like
that
date on the very spot on there Kevin
Thompson the pioneer in the computer
industry you should really Google about
him he introduced this machine learn
this regular expression thing into the
grab a grip was kind of a editor ish
thing for the early UNIX let's not go
into much of the depth but Ken Thompson
was the pioneer guy who brought us the
regular expression into the computer
from that paper really a remarkable
journey but later on this was not much
being used until like 90s 87 ish thing
something and then introduced a new
thing which is POSIX POSIX basically is
portable operating interface portable
operating system interface and XS just
for user interface because it was there
in the UNIX sub that's it so people a
lot of from various countries just sat
down that hey we need some
standardization and that exact time the
POSIX was formed and it was clear that
we are going to be having two types of
regular expression the BRE and ER e now
the BRE was like basic regular
expression and ER he was extended
regular expression what we see right now
in 2018 is er e extended regular
expression we don't use BRE s anymore
the VR is last time it was used was in
Apache version 1 which is law no longer
exists now almost no longer exists so
what we are seeing right now is a re now
you might be wondering hey this is all
good this is all great but where does
this PC re fits in now the pcre comes
into the picture now after the POSIX
formation almost exact same time there
was a guy known as Henry Spencer
he created a library in C just to make
sure that the regular expressions are
consistent now in that early days a lot
of programmers were writing their
regular expression in their own fashion
and he thought you know what we need a
consistent thing so that people can just
focus on implementation of these regular
expression rather to be worried about
redefining the things so he wrote a
library in C and we Spencer for the
purpose of consistency now just after
that like couple of years ahead
Larry wall came up and released the
language Perl which was like the shining
star of
that time just like what python is doing
right now it was really the language
which was designed so that programming
can be fun and can be much more powerful
as compared to see really the most
powerful language for early days I
remembered the days when I coded in the
portlet early time it was really the
star at that time in that Perl this
Henry Spencer library was introduced
quite a lot and this made everything
amazing and from that time this
implementation of Henry Spencer's
library was known as a Perl compatible
regular expression remember pcre Perl
compatible regular expression now this
compatibility was so amazing so smooth
that everybody every language wanted
this kind of library in their
programming language as well JavaScript
PHP Python and even Java or maybe some
of the MySQL's as well pretty much
everybody wanted this pcre in their
programming language and this is why
they're PCR he comes up now just after
that there were engines being designed
that how we're gonna process this
language and that time there were subtle
difference still there are subtle
differences in browser based and the
server base which uses the pcre engine
but as of 2018 the differences are so
subtle that nobody even care about it
all the symbols mean exactly the same in
pcre and in javascript based engines as
well so right now we don't have to worry
much about it I know this was a quite a
history lesson but with this was
interesting you came to know about Kent
M sons Ken Thompson sorry he's a great
pioneer I get so excited taking his name
even then Henry Spencer came into the
picture Larry wall came into the picture
so you should definitely read about them
but again this is what we have talking
about the current situation of regular
expression you don't have to worry about
anything of it okay whether you switch
onto pcre or javascript they're gonna
give us the exact same result just onto
a one side note here you can see that we
have got this two slashes and then edgy
I will talk about a little bit more
about modes and everything but just to
give you a little bit hint here the
program grep is actually responsible for
these two slashes it used to be like g
for global mode then a slash and then
you
something like a regular expression and
then in order to print it there was a /
B and from there that a grap actually
came into the world notice G and R from
regular expression e and then P for
printing it so grep and later on the
popularity was so high of the grab than
it it became a standalone program quite
a lot of history but this is all
interesting and exciting makes regular
expressions so good so we will be
talking more about what are these
slashes what they do and what has this
last G and all of these things mean but
let's just keep these videos short and
simple
this was quite a history lesson about
the pcre I promise I won't be bothering
you much with the history in the future
of this regular expression series at all
so let's just go ahead and talk about
these modes
what are these global and
case-insensitive and all those modes and
we're gonna start writing our very first
regular expression so that's it for this
video and I'll surely catch you up in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
