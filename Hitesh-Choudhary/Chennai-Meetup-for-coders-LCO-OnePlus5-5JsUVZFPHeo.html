exciting vlog now I know this channel is
all about programming tech and coding
and stuff but sometimes I do travel not
sometimes I do travel a lot and I
usually make me likes but just to update
you a last time and I went to iit bombay
and some other foreign trips I forgot to
make vlogs because so much of the
headaches so much of the travel but now
I thought let's make this vlog on this
trip I'm leaving to Chennai now this is
not just any blog this vlog will will
teach you something that in order to
make something to create something
amazing and awesome
you don't need high-end computers you
don't need high-end mobiles and I think
all it requires is the passion to do
something now what's special about this
vlog is at the end of the video you can
obviously drag to the end of the video
YouTube gives you this feature but hey
it is actually fun in that the fun is
when things go and process gradually and
we're gonna do the same I hope I can
expect same from you
airports are nice and lovely places and
I I usually know don't miss my flights
one thing that I recently started to do
on airport is investing time in building
games now here's a link on the screen I
have recently built up this game on
while traveling from IIT Mumbai to some
else place and my flight actually got
delayed because I there was an
unexpected drill happening on Mumbai
Airport
it was a chaos I posted that on my
Facebook page but one of the best thing
that you can do on airports is
utilization of the time flights are
always gonna be delayed or you are gonna
be early on the airport so make sure you
utilize that time I utilize that by
creating amazing games it's fun links
are in the description below as well as
on the screen check out those games they
are amazing
finally we have met say hello so he's
gonna be taking care before til tomorrow
night
yeah till tomorrow night so I'll be with
him and I'll post more updates on there
this is a private meet up event for the
University students only I have just
reached here and tomorrow is a big day
because I've been meeting a lot of
students they are waiting for me and I
love little more stuff in the upcoming
video and in fact upcoming part of this
video so I'll catch you up tomorrow good
night for now
yes
can you tell me one thing why flight is
is boarding a ton of love what I will it
now is it they look like I think so
break my record of never making the
flight and I think my flight is boarding
at ten o'clock right now it's 10 o'clock

it to the flight and we'll be connecting
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
