with other video and in this video we
are doing an analysis or review of an
experiment that I started almost 30 days
ago so let's do this some of you who
have been following me around for very
consistently from last 30 days already
knew what we started here but all those
people who are new at this channel or
didn't watch that particular video let
me tell you what we are doing here
almost 30 days ago I started an
experiment to become more productive
this year every single year we all make
a lot of resolution that we're gonna do
this we're gonna hit the gym we are
gonna become a better programmer but
ultimately the one thing that everybody
misses is consistency the plan needs to
be very strong so that you can become
more productive whether in programming
or jimang or a health like whatever that
is so I started an experiment that every
single day I will be posting on my
facebook that this is day number one day
number two and this will be a constant
reminder for you so that you can do
whatever you really want to do this year
and now these this experiment is 30 days
old and I want to analyze it how we are
going so far and who are those people
who have been following me along in this
journey and what were their experience
with this experiment in that experiment
I created a simple sheet on the paper
which is having all the days of the
month from 1 to 30 again we are not
following the month that are based on
like our regular calendar we are
following up our own whenever we got
started that's the day number one so
this is my sheet here and you can notice
that I was pretty much consistent with
that not amazingly consistent let's
let's just be totally honest about this
experiment you can see the red dots are
pretty good and in case you are
wondering go ahead watch that previous
video the lot of details are there so I
I picked up three things here the red
gleek green and the blue stars which
represent a different task and you can
see let's just be honest about how much
consistent I was I was not that much
consistent that just start by saying
that for the red dots
was pretty much consistent and the days
which I missed I actually tried to just
go on to the next day and try to do
extra work on the other day so that I
can just come up with the solution of
that day's which I missed but again I
would say for the red ones I was pretty
much consistent Green absolutely
consistent but for the blue ones I was
not that much consistent and I regret
that totally yes I have I'm having
pretty solid reasons why I was not
consistent there were some big reasons
for that but to be honest they were just
failure days I have to be honest here
whatever the solid reasons were why I
missed on those days these are just
excuses no matter how good or how
excellent these excuses us the truth is
I failed on those days so in the next
month I'll try to be much more
consistent so this is my analysis let's
talk about what you people have
experienced now I was really amazed that
a lot of people joined me up at initial
days it was just like 10 or 12 people
but eventually when the journey started
and a lot of people joined us almost now
40 to 50 people are regularly posting
comments on my Facebook post where I say
day 1 day 2 now here is a good thing for
you I think that this is an amazing
productivity boost when somebody reminds
you constantly that hey have you done
the task or something like that it gives
you more energy and more more thinking
power that I should be doing something
about it
so here is a good news for everyone we
are again getting your reset for this
new your productivity boost and we're
gonna create one more paper for us again
with the 30 days column and we're going
to be consistent for the next 30 days
whatever you have done in the past let's
forget that if you have been consistent
there so far amazing for you if you
haven't been now is the time to restart
every single thing what I also noticed
something interesting here is all those
people who were like who are not being
shy and posted every single day on my
Facebook were the most consistent as
compared to who just said this is just
kid stuff kids do these things making
lines on paper and putting your mark
every single day no this is not kid
stuff
this is actually
duct tape and this is scientifically
proven thing when you put a mark here it
releases a dopamine in your body and you
just feel good so this is all proven
theory and this is not costing you
anything a piece of paper couple of
markers and just follow me up on
Facebook every single day I see a lot of
comments on my Facebook page
people are being amazingly consistent
people who were not able to complete
like front-end developer codes or
Android course they were able to
complete that within just 15 days or 20
days as compared previously they were
struggling for the exact same thing for
months and now they are able to complete
that within 15 or 20 days this is the
actual power of consistency there is no
hard work there is consistency
consistency can beat anything in this
world on a final note I would like to
mention three things here number one
whatever has happened in the past just
forget about that let's start fresh with
this new month what we're gonna do
create a new paper follow me up on my
Facebook page the link is here and just
post every single day whenever I post
day one or day two whatever happened in
the past forget about that if you were
consistent amazing congratulation if you
were not consistent join me up from now
onwards we are gonna get started with
day one and pick up your goals whether
it's doing a gym whether you want to
learn from learned code online maybe
from other resources whatever that is
just be consistent and follow me up on
Facebook number two do hit that
subscribe button and the like button for
this video and I'll be keep coming with
more amazing videos at this channel and
the most important thing number three a
lot of people have achieved amazing
thing and have posted amazing comments
so it's really a good thing that I
should mention those comments so don't
worry I'll not be reading them you can
just watch the video rest of the videos
and you can just read yourself these
amazing comments and can enjoy this song
and yes for sure I will be catching up
in the next video
it was but to me there's no
there's only time for dreams even
see
know that we can go higher if we keep
our faith if we keep our faith sometimes
I'm like oh it's burrito riot but I grow
stronger keepin
still holding tight through every prime
cause I can see through the every day
always the same
the shirts
usually
I know
if we keep our faith if we keep our
faith sometimes I'm like a little
stronger believing me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
