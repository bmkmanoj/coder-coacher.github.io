a solution so in today's video I want to
talk about a solution that I build up
not because I really needed it but I
actually needed it so let me tell you
whenever you are designing any website
or a mobile app for Android or iOS
colors do play a big role now yes in my
regular boot camps and just like
small-scale courses I don't focus much
on the color theory and all these things
but obviously in the corporate trainings
and the big scale offline boot camps I
do prefer to use all professional colors
and I love it because and obviously I
prefer the materialistic colors that is
actually the Android design mode offer
like that but still they are amazing
they actually reduces a lot of your
efforts previously it used to be like
shadows and gradients now flat colors
are the way to go up now let me tell you
who I am all telling you all this stuff
let me tell you that when I was using
all of my colors and everything in case
you might have joined my friend end
development boot camp or any of the
other such boot camps I have picked up
hundreds and hundreds of time colors
from this website and I still love it
this is absolutely amazing website I
still do recommend it but you know this
is it this is it
all the colors are here and that's it
now the best part about this website
that I like is you can just copy it and
it just copies this stuff and you can
just paste it there whatever the color
you have copied it but you know the
stuff is it's just that's it these are
the colors and that's it I wanted more
and yes obviously I can just change the
things can go on to the color palette
and find out but the solution could be
amazing if you can have just your
customized colors that you like and can
have a website such as like this and
that's what I've created now it's not a
big project of course but it is
something that I have thought that I
should be sharing with you so that you
can also use such resources so I have
created it at learn code online so learn
code online dot in slash flat color
picker yep it's one word flat color
picker that's it so this is the thing
that I have created now all the colors
that are here are not used I have picked
up some of the colors that I like
personally I would love to use them in
some other projects so that's why I
pick them up and all you have to do is
you can click on any of them it will be
copied on your clipboard and then you
can just paste them wherever you like
you don't need to go into these boxes
you can just hover onto any of this
division or this box of the color and
you can just that's it you just click on
it and copies for example you want this
orangish color just it's copied you want
this guy reddish thing just click on it
it's copied that's it as simple as it
sounds and also what I would love to
have on the flat UI color is they say
all the colors with their names like
emeralds or blaze whole or her
pomegranate and things like that I would
prefer that there should be a color
being mentioned there again personal
preferences but I like it so I designed
it so this is what I have now in
addition to some extra colors that are
available here for all of you now I have
got some favorite social media website
now the reason these colors are so
dominant because you see them all the
time Twitter Facebook snapchat these are
so famous website that you see these
colors all the time and eventually you
like all these colors so that's why I
have kept them here so a few of the
websites obviously I might be adding a
few more as the time goes so FB color
palette is he here all you have to do is
just click on it it will be copied
whatsapp Khan Academy really great
resource Twitter Google+ LinkedIn
this one is snapchat not much visible
but this is a snapchat the github color
of course learned code online green and
YouTube Pinterest pretty basic stuff not
a big deal but I was free so thought
let's design something whenever you are
free just designed fun project it's so
good so amazing and one thing that I
would like to mention here is this is
not a kind of a con thing but still I I
like to mention it when you go onto the
learner this flat UI color website they
put up a lot of tracking things on here
not like malicious intent they just keep
a track by Google trackers and you can
find all these things here like if you
go into a view page source you can just
go back here you can see these scripts
are there like Google Analytics of
course they are used for Google and
but end of the day you will be served
more ads I don't need these kinds of
things at least on this website and this
page so that's it you can just feel free
to just go ahead no tracking no nothing
at all no advertisement no pop-ups
nothing at all just click on it it's
copied and that's it so I hope you will
enjoy this resource and the website URL
is pretty simple learned code online dot
in slash flat color picker just go ahead
and use them and if you have enjoyed
this you think that this valuable is
even teeny tiny teeny tiny valuable just
say thanks in the video I would really
appreciate that
and I'll be creating more such resources
for you so that I can make your
developer life a little bit easier
that's it and I'll surely catch you up
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
