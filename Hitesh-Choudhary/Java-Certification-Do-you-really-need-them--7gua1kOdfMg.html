again with another video in today's
video we are going to talk about the
Java certifications now I know many of
you are trying to pursue Java as a skill
and some of you are even thinking about
doing a certification in Java so how
good is that and in fact I'm going to be
talking about what I put I personally
think about the certifications of Java
this is going to be really helpful in
case you're a beginner and you're most
attracted by the Java and want to do
certification in that so we'll be
talking all about this now before we
even proceed onto that as well I would
like to say thank you so much from the
core of my heart because we have hit a
10 K sub mark there now 10k subscriber
is a big deal
especially because I have been just
focused on the YouTube from last just a
couple months and it's really awesome to
see that people really actually want
some programmers to talk about real
programming stuff or real technology
stuff there so really happy for that and
with this now let's go ahead and move on
and talk about the Java
in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps and
pretty much everything related to
technology so in case you are new here
consider subscribing so we are talking
about the certification in Java in here
and to be honest this was a youtube
comment I guess let me just show you
what we have gotten here and let me open
up that you'll be seeing that on your
screen but I have to open it up on my on
my phone so let's just go and start in
here so I guess yes this was a youtube
comment and I'm trying to answer your
question in here how it is sir my name
is Ali
hey Lena how are you I'm studying BSC IT
this is my last end I wanted to do
certification in Java but I am little
worried about scope of Java in future I
know it's an awesome programming
language and I also like it so much so
please give me your advice on my
question thank you so much you're doing
great thank you so much first of all now
let's keep it aside and talk about in
Scenario in general about the
certification now before I proceed that
I would like to make an analogic here
and would like to take you to the
another world scenario now I know this
is related be here with me for a second
there now try to imagine a scenario of
fitness world okay so I know some of you
might be hitting James some of you might
be runners there but imagine a scenario
that do you think that Nike owns the
fitness or maybe editors editors own to
the fitness without the 90 shoes you
won't be able to run or maybe in the
fitness is that the sort of thing not at
all you might be disagreeing with that
so yes a 90 doesn't own the fitness yes
definitely they are helpful when you
want to maybe run a little bit mile
extra they are comfortable they can push
you a little bit extra but you have to
be on your own runner and all I'm trying
to say in here is you can be a runner in
other shoes as well so let's come back
in here and compare the same analogy
with the certification module that
Oracle is doing and I I personally think
it's completely wrong that they're the
kind of scenario environment they are
trying to build up now all I'm saying is
Java is an awesome language no doubt
about it and you can use
for creating Android apps desktop apps
maybe some web application programming
as well so that is one great thing but
going for the certification if you can
afford that's awesome
you can go for the certification but
even if you cannot afford the
certification I don't know why you are
going behind that it's not like having a
certification is going to automatically
land up you in the job or something in
the present environment certification
are great they are awesome only if you
can afford them with the present modern
works if you cannot afford which most of
the students cannot afford still are
kind of collecting their money and
spending in the certification I don't
see any profit in that because you can
spend that much amount of money in maybe
taking an Android developer license and
can push your apps to the Android store
or maybe you can buy a Mac Mini or maybe
a other Mac Apple computer and can start
programming for Apple as well or maybe
you can buy some 0qu application server
and can launch your application there so
what I'm trying to say is save some
money with your certification are not
that much required be open-minded if you
know that programming language that
awesome put it on the github upload some
application design some apps in that and
that's all about it now on top of that I
will also like you to compare the same
scenario with Python since Java is kind
of a language which is governed by
Oracle and Oracle is launching insane
amount of certification on that now
let's just say I'm a programmer in
Python what kind of certification I do
have to pursue nothing at all
so that's the exact same kind of mindset
I want you everybody to have what kind
of certification do PHP requires nothing
at all you just need to have to learn
PHP and upload your application and
that's the proof that you know the
language creating this myth that in
order to learn Java you have to go for
certification I don't think so that's
going anywhere because a programming
environment and programming society is
getting advanced and getting smart day
by day they are not looking for
certification anymore they are looking
what kind of job you can do what kind of
skills do you have how much time you
have spent with the programming and all
these stuff so my personal would be
personal advice would be instead of
going for the certification you can buy
some other
gadgets and tech stuff which can help
you further in enhancement of your
program in Korea and again if you are
still confused to try to imagine how
much certification does a Python guy
have since there is no organization like
Oracle being governing the Python that
is why you don't see anybody just
running madly after the certification
there now again all of these I met are
my personal views I'm not saying
certification are always bad yes they
are good if you can afford them if you
cannot afford them spend that much
amount of money in learning more Skills
again completely my personal opinions my
personal advice I am not against any
company and not against any
certification they all are awesome
and you should be doing them if you can
afford them but again I hope this very
thoroughly concerts everything about
your question again think about the
Python and the job and again all of that
if you love that programming language
stick with it
the meet programmers who love some
programming language and create some app
I would definitely like to love to see
what you have created put that on the
github post that in the comments section
below I would definitely like to love to
see what you have created in there but
this if you think that this video was
helpful for somebody make sure you share
that on social media and I'm looking
forward for your support hit that
subscribe button and I'll surely catch
you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
