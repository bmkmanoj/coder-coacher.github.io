again with another video and in today's
video we are answering a very important
question how to get a job in programming
in 2017 so this is a very interesting
question and in fact I'll be reading out
an email which was actually a question
and I'm going to be answering that and
this is going to be the most useful
video for you stay tuned and let's
discuss about it by the way we have
changed the set up a little bit I think
it's always good to see different kind
of setups and by the way in this channel
we talk about programming mobile apps
web apps and everything related to pure
technology so in case you are new here
consider subscribing so I received this
question quite a lot how to get a job in
programming in 2017 18 16 whatever the
year is now the criteria of getting a
job in programming is almost the same
regardless of the language whether it
might be JavaScript Java Swift whatever
you are learning it's almost exactly the
same but let me for the sake of this
video let me just read up the question I
will be reading it from my phone and you
can read up on the screen that's much
better for you so let me just say this
that the email says so how can I get a
job in the field of programming what
language should I learn for the job in
2017 I don't know any language deeply I
know about Python has to print hello
world what can I do sir now this is not
just the only email that I received
which was almost exactly the same in the
meaning but I would like to say that are
you trying to kidding with me or I do
not see this enough in the life to think
out that how the job is being taken now
regardless of the programming scenario
let me tell you that how the job is
being secured in any sector first you
learn the skill then you show that I
know this skill and then you get the job
now since you want to get the job in
programming obviously the first step is
to learn
something deeply that is programming and
you are saying that I don't know any
programming language deeply I can print
hello world now this is the most funny
statement I have ever seen that you can
print the hello world and you want to
get a job and of course your expectation
might be some hundred thousand dollars a
year no don't do that
this is really really bad so let me take
you to the scenario hi I got a job and
I'll settle down for the peasant bite
him this time now I believe this was my
third or fourth job in the Python I
landed up there now how I got that was
pretty interesting theory because I
never applied for that particular job
now this was a pretty good job actually
it was a work from home you can take
completely work from home it was a
treatment based job they were offering
me for a full time as well I was not
interested in that so how I landed up
there now just for the first purpose I
was already good at the Python so the
number one step is to get familiar with
the syntax and pretty much everything in
the Python the next thing that I did was
I was kind of interested in the aircrack
set of the tools which are for the Wi-Fi
penetration testing and I thought hey
why not to build a graphical user
interface for the exact set of the tools
and I thought hey this would be a cool
project so I spend a little bit time
there develop a graphical user interface
totally designed in the Python for the
all of the aircrack suite of tools yes
it definitely took me a long time and
then I realized hey what I'll be doing
this with this tool so let me just put
it on the open source github I pushed
that code on the github and within two
or three months somebody contacted me
that hey I have seen your rapid air it's
pretty good interesting would you like
to work for us and I said hey what kind
of job we are looking for he said that
we are looking for some designer who can
design our interface in the Python QT
and since your project is already there
I think you can do the job and I said
yes let's discuss about what is your
project and what you're going to pay to
me and things get carried on from there
so I would be saying that landing up in
any kind of job requires a skill set
whether it's a timely based project
based a job that you are looking for
maybe a full-time or maybe a part-time
whatever it is but when you say the
things like a
I can print the hello world there I
don't know any programming language but
I want to get a job in programming hey
what are you don't even watch the first
step you need to learn programming first
of all and I would say that spend quite
a good amount of time like four or five
months or six months with only the
syntax of the language
once you have thoroughly understood the
syntax and again it depends on the
people some people will understand the
syntax within one month some will
understand it within a week some will
understand it within a six month so
obviously things we get a little bit
quirky at the more advanced level like
first you will see that variables are
easy but the loops are hard then you
will think that loops are easy but
functions are hard then you will think
that functions are easy but the classes
are hard so things goes on like that so
obviously it's the phase you need to
clear up that face so that you can
understand how the database work how the
graphical user work and everything just
like that so spend a lot of time with
the syntax and then try to create some
projects in that and the project can be
anything that you use in the day-to-day
life and just after that in the one of
the previous video I showed up you some
good projects that you can do up and
obviously it depends what you want to do
very when want to land up in the job and
that's all about it so I would be saying
that this was one of the strange email
that the person is saying that hey I can
print up a hello world there so that's
not acceptable at all now you might be
thinking hey what kind of a person is
that I was looking at for an advice and
he's just shutting me down no I'm not
I'm just telling you some truth I know I
can understand the truth can be some
time not that much good but yes that's
the truth you need to focus quite a lot
on the programming and it's not it's
completely unacceptable that you say I
can print a Hello version I want a job
the number one aspect is learn the
skills then the job and everything comes
up on the way it's the process nobody
can skip that process and if you're
expecting that that some company is
going to train you and also going to pay
you nah not that's not going to happen
not anytime soon at least for 20 or 30
years at least so my job my advice would
be simply go ahead spend some time with
the Python it's a lovely language
and create some good projects in there
and for sure you can also share this
video if you think that this video was
quite helpful and make sure you hit that
subscribe button we really need that so
go ahead do that and I'll surely catch
you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
