back to my youtube channel so what we're
going to talk in today's technical talk
now from the previous movie the last
video which I uploaded it really made a
little bit controversies because I
didn't named C or C++ in my top 5
programming language it was obvious I
saw that coming and it was about to come
it came so it was perfectly on my
expectation so in today's movie I would
like to talk about how I started my
journey now this movie is going to be in
the two parts how I started my journey
and how to be consistent over the
programming but that will come up later
on right now and just want to I just
want to talk about how I started my
journey so it was pretty nice journey
little bumpy as well little bumpy ride
but I would say this was pretty
interesting you will see and you will
learn a lot from me and I really want
you to not make those mistakes that I
made during my journey ok so let's get
started it was really my early days in
the life and really the college days the
first year out there the charming first
semester I just wanted to learn the
programming I heard from a lot of people
that it's a good thing it's a good job
opportunity so you should grab it ok so
I got started it was in my first
semester and I started with the C
programming language and well first of
all my teacher taught me that how I can
make a HelloWorld program it was too
much overwhelming for me I felt really
enthusiastic about it and I felt really
I made a computer do that it was really
really kind of a fun for me and I
thought I should start really more into
the language and I should get more into
the language so I thought I should join
some coaching's or some private tuitions
out there I did the same I went off and
tried to find out the most famous
Institute in my area to learn the C
programming language I went out there
and saw that a lot of students from my
own universities and some other
universities are also joined there so we
sat around
it was the class of 50 or 60 students
and the teacher came in and surprisingly
he wrote the entire code on a bite bone
I thought what's happening I I came here
to learn programming on a computer but
due to the shy nature I just sat down
and waited that Sunday I'm gonna write
the codes on my computer so I just
waited for the entire week and then over
a week but nothing was changed the codes
were written on the whiteboard we were
just being taught like that so I got up
and asked the teacher when I'm going to
write the code on the computer he gave
me some software's in the pendrive it
was early days the turbo C was there so
he said go ahead go to the home and
write these codes on the computer I
tried that and I failed miserably
because I was missing a lot of brackets
lots of semicolons that was not at all
cool for me so I came to the teacher
next day I asked him that I was not able
to write it why are you teaching me on a
whiteboard you should be teaching on a
projector or maybe on a computer so that
I can learn better
he said I'll do that and that's it
he didn't make make up the promise and
eventually the semester was gone I
somehow passed my exams surprisingly and
still I was not able to code that was
pretty awesome and then after the second
semester came in the C++ came in I went
through the entire same journey again
but again at the end of the year I was
perfect in the C I was good at C++ but
there was no product in my hand this is
miserable because I'm so-called a coder
by the end of the one here I have two
languages in my pocket or even have
passed greatly in the grades as well but
still I don't have my product and
actually not a programming so I have
decided I'll take the shovel in my hand
I'll take the tools in my hand and I'll
start the programming I searched a lot
and find out that there is a one
language I started out with the Python
everyone told me that it's going to be
tough for you by then is not for
everyone it's not an easy language but
surprisingly I found out that this
language was much more easier to learn
and I started out with that then I did
entire beak research on finding out the
greatest platform on which I can write
and I came up with the IDE the
integrated development environment and
on that I I was not much worried about
for the brackets missing brackets
missing semicolons syntax and all of
these things so I started with that and
finally I was able to design my own
calculator that was very very exciting
for me and I use I have designed the
calculator in the same because I asked
the teacher I want to do that please
teach me he taught me but he was
actually teaching me to design the
calculator on the console who owned this
God's green earth did write or use the
calculator on the black screen nobody
does
everyone wants to have a calculator on
which I can click my mouse click click
and can use it so I failed miserably in
the C and C++ at that time and started
out with the Python was pretty
successful and in the mean time I was
pretty much into the Information
Security as well so I have designed some
of my own tools as well that's what
pretty good
ok so what's the whole point behind this
a story that is very simple I'm not
claiming that say your C++ is a tough
language you should not start with that
that's not the point if you're getting
that that's the wrong scenario that
you're getting I'm trying to say that
the teaching methodology can be wrong
you might you might have your mindset
that hey first you should learn say
that's not the case it's not always
entirely true I have seen many
universities talking about introducing
the Python as the very first language or
maybe Ruby as the first language or I
would recommend JavaScript as the very
first language
gets stuck with any one language keep on
learning okay so let's just summarize
what I want to deliver with this movie I
want to say that you should get started
and choose a language of your own do
some research and at the end of the day
it's the product that matters again it's
the product that matters because you
will feel exciting when you will have a
product your own software designed by
you that will make you really really
enthusiastic that will make you feel
something extra so do some research on
what language you might want to get
started there is no prerequisite in the
programming I have seen many people
getting started directly from the Java
and building up some cool Android apps
so if you have the Mac I would recommend
go with a swift or something like that
then the second step after choosing the
language is to find the greatest
platform on which you can write some
code that can be any IDE like it can be
eclipse it can be pycharm
it can be brackets atom or maybe
anything of sublime text whatever fields
to you that yes this is meant for me so
go ahead spend time on that and finally
I would say that create a project it
might be a graphical calculator or maybe
a tax saving plan or maybe some DSA
project or making some algorithms that
just changes the music or clean up your
folders clean up your duplicate files
clean up your duplicate images or there
can be tons of ideas so make sure there
is a product in your hand that will make
you comfortable with the program but the
problem is how to be a consistent
learner so that at the end of the day
you delivers a product that's coming up
in the next movie I hope this movie was
pretty good for you and I would Rick I
would request all of you to please like
and don't forget to share my videos it
might help your neighbors or your
cousins or your younger ones to just
learn programming getting started with
that so please share the video as well
as subscribe to my channel see you out
there in the next movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
