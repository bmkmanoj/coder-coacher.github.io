with another video in this video I want
to talk about the dream viewer software
now in case a lot of you might not be
aware of what dream viewer is dream
viewer is kind of a drag and drop tools
that will help you to create webpages
and a lot of big nerds really fell into
the dream viewers trap now what I want
to say here is a lot of big nurse at the
very early days when they see dream
viewer software and they see hey I can
adjust my images and divisions and all
of that manually by clicking drag and
drop I don't have to worry about magic
margins and padding hey this is the best
piece of software I can get I can really
create my dream project in the dream we
work quickly without learning the whole
hazel and hustle about the margins
padding color text font and all of such
things and it's completely ok and fine
to think at a bigness point like this
but in this video I will explain you the
concepts and what are the pros and cons
of using the dream viewer software again
this is not at all a paid review about
the dream viewer these are just my
personal thought and I would like to
give you these personal and best advices
for a big nurse in web development so
let's get started
as the name suggests Dreamweaver is
really a dreamy software and whenever a
big nurse sees the dream viewer it looks
like a magic to him no worries about the
margins or padding's nobody's about the
box nobody's about adjusting the size of
the images and it just snaps like a
magic and it's okay to think like that
but I don't ever recommend bigness to
get started with a dream viewer I always
recommend to get started be hardly get
started with your favorite text editor
make sure your favorite text editor is
not dream view with at big nerd stage
I'll come on to that point so hold down
here comments for a moment and watch the
video till end I'll come back on to the
advanced and pro users as well so for a
big nurse I always recommend to get
started with things like atom or
brackets or sublime text or something
like that but not like notepad now I'm
not talking about notepad plus plus but
I'm talking about the simple notepad or
text pad now when you're working as a
big nerd it's very important to
understand the concept the more concept
you'll have in your bag it would be much
more easier to get started in web
development a person who is aware about
the CSS properties like margin text
color background colors is actually far
more creative than just working drag and
drop and finding in the huge bunch of
the options that Dreamweaver gives you
and when you do the things the hard way
you are actually far more productive now
I do recommend app demand sublime text
as the beginners editor software now one
of the very first and the very first
hurdle about the Dreamweaver is its
pricing point for which many of you just
actually jump that barrier but here is
my pointer here is my opinion
whenever the software is there I always
look at the pricing models of the
software is it a subscription model or
is it heavily priced and of course this
makes me this makes me think about the
decision whether should I choose it or
not I know a lot of people are just
trying to get it from the
and website or the cracked version of
the dream viewer because if you can
afford the Dreamweaver obviously you can
afford the very high quality training
because software is pricey but a lot of
people just download the cracked version
or the dumped version of the Dreamweaver
but that's a really really bad choice
because using such pirated software is
the bad idea I would say it's a worst
idea because these software's usually
are nobody gives you a software for free
by cracking it sometimes they attach
some malicious malware's and some
viruses along with that and then the
virus is like wanna cry hit you you are
not even able to cry so pricing is a big
issue for Dreamweaver and being an Adobe
product it's really the pricy one even
the people will say that the
subscription model is little bit cheaper
but again it's really still pricy on a
base of subscription model as well but
again let's just say you have made your
mind that hey I'm going to buy it no
matter what happens I know 60 or 70% of
the people have skipped out with the
name of that buying thing but again
let's just say you want to still buy it
and invest a little bit amount of money
in doing that now I only recommend to
buy the dreamweaver software only and
only after you have completed 10 to 20
projects manually and by manually I
means by the usage of the editors like
sublime text or atom or bracket you have
written all codes manually have finished
the 10 or 20 projects with the manual
thing and then you can move on to the
dream viewer now what will happen if you
move at dream you were at initial stage
now you will be finding yourself again
and again for looking up the options you
have no idea what the options are
actually there Dreamweaver is a software
for professionals that help you to
shortcut the things help you to cut out
the timings by giving you all the things
manually just like that but for a big
nurse it's easy to get lost into the
software itself so once you have an idea
what the margin is what the color is
what the text is it can be a helpful
software at a bigger company stage but
for the personal use I never use the
dream viewer and but it's not like that
it's a bad software it's the marvelous
piece
if you have that much of the work so
again these are my personal thoughts
about the Dreamweaver so let's summarize
what I have said here first of all it's
not a software for beginners it's a
software for pro bigness may find that
they have lost get lost into the
software and it may also lead to some of
the bad habits about not understanding
what the code is there although you can
always switch back but beginners like to
skip that work and are not so good in
looking behind the scenes so for the
bigness I don't recommend Dreamweavers
once you have finished any 20 projects
you think that I should now speed up my
workflow obviously investing some money
in the Dreamweaver is good thing if you
are doing a business with that or you
are getting into the freelance you are
getting tons of projects so it's again a
good piece of software do I recommend to
install the cracked or the pirated
version of the software not at all
because these are not safe you're
downloading it from a third-party site
which is not at all trusted it may bind
up some of the viruses with it and you
might see a lot of comments and threads
on the photos like that that hey I have
got this virus being attached in my
crack software this is a very common
scenario and when things like wanna cry
and wanna crypt hits onto your system
you're not able to even cry so always go
with the professional and the charged
software in case you are looking for
that but again there are the various
free alternatives like atom or brackets
so go ahead with that so all the
Wigner's who are taking my course on the
front end development or maybe anywhere
else they are trying to learn go ahead
get started with atom or sublime text
once you have done with the 10 project
we can talk about getting started with
the dream viewer the dreamy software so
with this I would say that yes this is
all about my thoughts in case you want
to make me a video on some another
subject or want to discuss some of the
other problems that you are facing go
ahead comment down in the below section
I would be really really happy to make a
video and create up your confusion if
you are having one so I'll catch you up
in the comment section below and yes
tomorrow is Sunday so we are going to
have a Sunday
in life so don't miss that out check out
my page I usually notify people in
advance about the timings understand a
life and let's catch you up in the Sun
