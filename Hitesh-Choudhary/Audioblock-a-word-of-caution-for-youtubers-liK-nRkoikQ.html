for some awesome audio that can really
enhance the feel and the look and how
people actually sees your videos and
it's really a good idea you should
definitely look for and perhaps you
might already have stumbled upon the
website known as audio block but if
you're a youtuber you need to listen to
me there is a word of caution for this
so let's get started here and talk about
what is audio blocks so in case you have
never heard about that that's actually
very rare but in case you haven't heard
about it then they do a very lucrative
offer about giving audios and we all
know audio is a messy business if we can
get a lot of copyrights and musician
charges a lot and that's a different
business but obviously video if you need
to enhance your video the audio is very
essential part there now you are looking
for that so you have stumbled upon the
website which gives you a $99 for an
unlimited audio that's very lucrative
deal but you need to listen to me that
once you actually get into the offer and
you are a full time youtuber or you
upload more of your more of your videos
on the YouTube there is a word of
caution but first of all I don't want to
get a rant on it and of course now let's
get start here and talk about why this
videos and let's create this entire
scenario here so whenever you look for
the reviews of audio block and
everything you always great get a great
reviews about them the number one reason
for them is because this website spends
a lot and by a lot I mean a lot they do
provide a lot of offers for the
youtubers a lot of good affiliate
programs and pretty much everything so
that is why everybody is writing a lot
of positive notes about it but there is
a one big con about this website and you
need to take care of that now the con is
simply whenever you will use the audio
blocks audio in your YouTube your video
will face a copyright infringement and I
know you have purchased the entire
subscription you are fully legal to use
the copyrighted material you have
granted the permission by the website
but still you're going to get a
copyright notice and this is really a
pain in the butt now recently I launched
a couple of videos and I I was actually
on the trial model for the
seven days trial of the audio blocks and
of course you need a credit card for
that and I thought let's give it a try
and the audios were awesome so much of
the library in just $99 is such an
insane deal so I thought let's just go
for a yearly subscription but I thought
hey wait a minute let's just test it out
for the seven days I was really happy
with the services in fact I had one of
my friend and me were filming a
documentary and we used that and it was
too good we actually got the ideal music
that we were looking for but I tried to
use that in some of my youtube videos as
well and there you go you get a
copyright strike but of course let me
just complete it there you actually can
get rid of the scope in a copyright
strikes and you can actually get rid of
that simply easily but the problem is
the money part so we are talking about
the money part let's get a little bit
closer because it's the talk about the
money guys so the meet in the meantime
when you get a copyright strike you your
video is not able to being monetized and
that is a loss of business that is loss
of money and that is not at all
acceptable
so if audio block is doing a
subscription model where we can use the
audios and with an unlimited access of
the audio for 99 bucks they should have
done something really good and come up
with a good solution so that the paid
member doesn't face these kinds of
problems and believe me
getting rid of those copyright notices
is painful and taing good thank goodness
that didn't come up on this channel that
was actually on another channel which I
run with my friend and we upload some
documentaries and stuff but again this
is pain in the butt and I didn't like
that at all and definitely I won't be
subscribing them for my this YouTube
channel and of course if you are not
uploading the videos on the YouTube that
is an insane deal I would highly
recommend that and again this is not a
paid review or I'm not getting sponsored
by any website because my channel is
small and I don't haven't written to
them or anything like that
so this is completely unbiased on that
apart from that I really like the
service it was all about music he warned
loops or some sound effects it's just a
killer deal but make sure you don't
upload anything
the YouTube the moment you will upload
anything on the YouTube you will get a
copyright strike and I thought that
nobody is actually telling this and this
is something bad everybody should be
spoking of speaking about the pros and
the concert of everything and I don't
think so that nobody even not even a
blog not any video reviews that are
talked about none of them actually
talked about it and after that I went
again and search for that a few people
are talking about this in the comment
section and everywhere but nobody is
talking about it openly you should be
very you know everybody knows that the
first step to solve the problem is to
recognizing that there is one problem
and that's what I'm saying so if the
video blogs or audio blog guys basically
they are the same if you are listening
to me please listen closely all of the
music that we are uploading even through
buying the purchase license and
everything we are getting a copyright
notice and that is bad of course you are
helping quite a lot in dropping down
that copyright notice we have to write
to the YouTube it usually take 3 to 30
days and that's really not not at all
acceptable because we are losing money
we are losing the business and that's
the whole point of being a creator on
the YouTube so again definitely I would
say it's a great service but if you are
trying to upload anything other youtube
make sure that you understand you are
going to get a copyright notice so be
aware of that I hope this video helped
you and got you a little bit things
about audio blocks I know a lot of
people are already doing some reviews
about the audio blocks they will show
you what kind of awesome music you can
get they will show you what kind of
awesome loops you can get but again I'm
not making this video for reviewing the
audio blocks this video is properly a
con just single when the copyright
notice which is a big one is all about
that so I hope this video helped you a
little bit and I'm coming up with the
more videos stay tuned and I hope you
have yet subscribed the button in case
you haven't done it yet go ahead do the
SUBSCRIBE I need it and I'll make more
videos for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
