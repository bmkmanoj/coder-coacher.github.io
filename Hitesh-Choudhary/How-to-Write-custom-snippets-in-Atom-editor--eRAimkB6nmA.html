youtube channel now this is completely a
separate video not at all included in
the Android series or maybe whatever we
are talking it is completely different
and it just came to my mind that I
should share this information with you
now many times if you are working just
like me for with a lot of web apps right
now I'm working on a react but doesn't
don't get scared of that what I want to
talk about is many times while coding on
JavaScript or HTML there are tons of
things which are there and you just have
to write them again and again for
example one good example would be
legisla if I write something like a
console dot log and thereafter I write a
lot of things in here now it's a good
thing obviously logging out a lot of
things on the console is good but let's
say you have two for the teaching
purposes or maybe for your own personal
purposes you have to write this quite a
number of times so writing this much of
the things console dot log console dot
log is not a good idea
so what I want to talk about is in the
atom which is a good editor I'll talk
about that in a second you can actually
write some code snippets just a couple
of words and as soon as you will hit the
tab it will expand to whatever you want
to be for example I'll just write CEO
for CU n for console and I will hit the
tab and it will automatically fill the
things like console.log now just like
you might have seen the things in the
Emmet so for example if I create simply
a new file there and I just saved that
with let's just save that for some dot
HTML and I save that and notice when I
hit an exclamation and hit the tab key
it automatically fills up the things for
me now I don't have to write this much
amount of the code because this is just
a boilerplate code and writing that
again again doesn't really make sense so
I like the things to be much more
shortened for myself and the editor that
I'm using for this purpose is the atom
in case you don't know what the atom is
atom is really a nice editor you can
find it at Adams IL now I was a big fan
of brackets but suddenly that Adobe guys
have started to slow down the progress
in the bracket so I've switched onto the
atom I liked it
in fact I liked it better than the
brackets because it's completely
hackable by hackable I don't mean to say
that it's wonderful to SQL injection or
so it's hackable because you can just
customize it the way you want it for
example I have customized it with the
terminal console because I work a lot
with the console so I can just turn on
this can logon into my console and can
workout with it apart from that I have
also customized a little bit of the
color scheme there so I like it it's
completely hackable so now coming back
on to the file that I was working it was
a simple just a ball of plate code for
our react application that I was working
on so what I wanted to do is I had to
write this constructor here now this
constructor is actually just a couple of
lines but it's a complete pain for me so
I want it to be some kind of hack there
so that I can just write a couple of
words there and voila it just
automatically fills up the boilerplate
code for me and just put directly cursor
in this place so that's completely
possible in the atom let me show you
quickly how it can be done go to your
atom and click on your snippets for the
windows it might be in to your
preferences and snippets but for me it's
in the atom and snippet I know the color
is not the best in the world to be for
the readable purpose but I'll try my
best to just give you a quick example so
in that you will find this snippet there
and this snippet is actually responsible
for coding out the snippets so let me
just copy this command C is going to be
for me and let's go back there and just
onto some fill up spaces
I'll just paste this so command V and
I'll press a ctrl + / - just uncomment
them quickly so how do you write that
it's really simple first of all let's
try to lie write the things for the
console dot log and then he will get an
idea about that and then we will write a
constructor snippet as well so first of
all it says source dot coffee now
whatever your source is just right here
for example if you are working for says
then you can write a dot says I'm going
to be working with the GS I can write
Jas there now it's for the console.log
this is completely for you what purpose
you are writing your
they're now prefect in this case is log
it's completely fine and the body of the
council is going to be console dot log
and it puts the cursor there I don't
like the cursor to video so dollar one
is the first place where cursor is going
to be I would like to just delete that
and I'll put a pair of parentheses there
and I'll write a dollar one there now
dollar one is the first place where
video cursor goes when you hit the tab
now for example if I just put another
just just for the demo purposes I put a
dollar two there and I save this file
make sure there are no errors there the
cursor will jump on to the second
parentheses so I save that go back here
and I like I write log there and I hit
the tab key notice the cursor is right
now blinking in the first pair of
parentheses there as soon as I hit the
tab key it just jumped into the second
pair of parentheses so that's how the
dollar sign works pretty nice pretty
easy let's just get back to the syntax I
don't want it to be there so this is the
console log this is quite useful now
let's copy and paste that again because
the goal was to write the react
constructor is there so in this case
again dot source dot J's is fine for me
and I like to write it for constructor
and there we go I would like to add this
as well
it's a constructor this is for
generating the quick constructor for my
props there in the react in case you
don't know what that is completely okay
just I'm telling you how to write the
upper fix there so in this prefix I like
to write as C un for constructor there
make sure your prefix doesn't actually
conflict with one one another there so
that's the thing that you need to worry
about now in my case it's not going to
be just one liner so it's going to be a
multiple liner so I'll add a triple code
there and I will hit enter there
make sure you indent it a little bit
it's good for reading purposes at least
and I'll go back there and I'll just cut
this constructor you can copy that as
well no problem and I'll go back here
and I'll paste that here and also I
would like to place a dollar one there
because I want my cursor to be blinking
inside so that I can
played the state of the props again
don't worry ok that sounds nice
and there we go we are done completely
ready for that let's go into the app GS
and whenever you need a constructor I
can just types un hit tab there we go
saves a ton of time for me now I do
write a lot of prefix when I work
recently a switch into the react yes we
are working on to a tons of project on
the react and this is really nice and
I'm starting to like the react quite a
lot and for sure in the later on videos
we will talk about the reacts for sure
it's really nice but right now you have
learned how to go for the snippets again
it's Adam click on the snippets and then
go to the Smith CSUN it's a CSUN file
kind of a brother of the Jason and you
got a sample snippet there make sure you
forget you don't forget to remove these
hashes there this makes that everything
into the comment and write as many CSUN
extensions or prefix as many you want
save a lot of time that's why the Adam
was made there it's completely hackable
and hack it as much as you wish to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
