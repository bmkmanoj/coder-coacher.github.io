is Mikey Mikey say hello
Mikey's responsible for all the great
audio that you are hearing so he is
always there in me with me in the videos
so let's get started out there what we
want to do today now I get this question
a lot and in fact recently I got over 10
a male's talking about how we can add a
Facebook and Google login in our app now
it's really the simple process out there
but with a couple of new tweaking in the
firebase and in a couple of years it has
become a little bit tricky now first of
all they were allowing it to login with
the Google+ now they allowing it with
the Google account so that's the one
major change and the second is that the
documentation is not updated in the
firebase that's kind of a bummer but I'm
completely aware of the situation when
you need to update the documentation for
any product out there it's not the
easiest task on the planet so I do I'm
aware of that so what we are going to do
we are going to create a simplest
possible app that will use the advantage
or take the advantage of firebase in iOS
10 with Swift 3 and is going to perform
a Google sign-in sounds interesting yes
it is it is very interesting because you
are not only going to learn only this
you will also learn how we can read the
legacy documentation which are a little
bit old and how we can perform that in
our own style so that believe me the
firebase documentation is such a nice
example to perform this kind of a
tutorial out there where we have an
outdated documentation but still the
documentation is giving us the enough
information so that we can place it on
in our own style in the latest syntax of
search 3 or 4 or whatever it is it's
really the nice way okay so let's go
there so how do we want to proceed that
okay first of all you know what I would
like to create an Xcode project that's
always a good start so file new project
and where are you here we go and sing of
the application we all have single view
application as our favorite let's click
on the next and I'll call it as G
sign g sign me you will sign me google
sign me up okay you can name it anything
pretty much let's click on the next and
looks okay I'm gonna save it on my
desktop and create it my desktop is not
that messy still okay now we are gonna
need this bundle identifier so we are
going to copy this and let's go there
and what I want to do next is just
create a new project and I'll name it as
G sign me you can name it anything it
doesn't really matter so G sign me is
actually a nice name
don't judge me on the name ok let's
create a new project come on stop this
ring and create a project for me okay
it's taking a second okay that's nice
very quick and let's go on to the app
this is my bundle identifier I've copied
it just from where I've copied let me
show you in the G sign in in the general
in the bundle identifier I've copied you
might be already aware if you are in the
so far in the course and in case you are
watching it on the YouTube to subscribe
to the channel there is a coupon in the
description as well you know let's add
this app and there is a new app nickname
in case you noticed out there it's
giving me a Google service - info dot
plist file I'll save that that's a
property list file permission list file
some people call that but basically it's
a property list file but you can call it
anything and let's just drag and drop
this guy now I'll just drag and drop
from my desktop just near the info dot P
list now I like to arrange things just
nearby that's why I'm placing it here
you can place it anywhere I like the
things to be much more arranged but
still I'm not using the MVC model that's
funny that's bummer to me but okay and
let's continue now it's saying that you
know what you can go with the firebase
core and you can just install the
firebase okay
now what I want to show you is actually
the Google Docs so let me open up the
firebase so firebase Google comm Docs
okay let's go into the docs and I want
to go into the authentication and the
Google sign-in always look into the docs
it's its best way we can see that we are
going to need the firebase auth out
there and we are going to also need the
Google sign-in so while we set up our
part files out there why not to just
give it one go and install it on just
one way we just have to add one more
line and we can do that not a big deal
G sign me where are you here we are we
need to open up a terminal where are you
and there's our nice little terminal who
did convert you into the black how did
that happened my terminal was white okay
let me just restart that I think there's
some problem with that okay let me
restart that oh my goodness now my
terminal is blue not that is little
surprise for me okay
that is some surprise for me I don't
like blue I like white wood it got you
with a solid color I want the basic one
the default how to set this up never
tried that general solid colors nope in
the basic yep and do I need to restart
you okay now it's white I like white
it's much more visible students like it
and now let's go on to the tech stop and
I'll call G sign me do a quick Ellis we
are into the right file pod in it and
we're expecting a pod file out there yep
there it is now let me open up this into
the sublime text now a lot of you might
be shouting out hey why don't you open
it open it up in the terminal yes I can
with the Nano or maybe them but it might
scare you off and I don't want to do
that so let install a couple of things
go there
approximately out there and first thing
that we need is
fire base our all-time favorite fire
base and we are also going to need fire
base odd it is important we are going to
need some authentication to be done and
also you might need I'm not pretty sure
you might need oops
fire base a data base okay although in
this movie we will not focus much on the
data base right now our focus is Google
sign-in we have already covered the data
base in the section out there I'm quite
in-depth we will also explore that in
the future movies out there in the
course but right now I think it's good
to leave that alone and we're going to
need Google sign-in
Google sign-in make sure you pay a
little attention on the case sensitivity
it's sensitive guy you know very
emotional very sensitive ok now next we
need is pod install and all green I like
green I like green it's all green ok
next step is obvious we need to go on to
where it is Google's have so many things
opened up I don't usually do that and
you know what I can close a couple of
these guys in fact I can close this sky
or not this is open twice actually I can
close this and this is good and this is
not good so let me open up G sign and
again then we want to have G sign in me
dot exe workspace so look out for the XE
workspace or we can go for the icon
which is less blue or it's actually a
bad advice don't look for the icon don't
listen to me on that don't look for that
I can go for the XE workspace that's
what we are looking for ok and iPhone 7
ok sounds nice there is our pod file
nice and lovely and there we go now next
what we need to do it says pod install
ok done now add I don't know objective-c
I have no idea how to be working on the
Swift and then a little bit objective-c
kidding that ok now what we need to do
is go into this file that says app Delek
it and all we want to do is import
firebase point number one going to the
did finish launching and you know the
drill it's for app dot configure say
that and build that building is
important very very important at this
point okay and it succeeded with a lot
of warnings which we are not worried out
here and let's just finish that okay
basic configuration is done let's move
out there now it says you have to add
install okay that's good that's good now
let's import the required headed files
okay now first we need is firebase to
add into the view controller as well
okay here it is saying view controller
as well so by the way it's a sign-in
view controller right now we are not
going to go for that much of code maybe
but still I'll add firebase no harm in
that save that and build that again no
harm in adding firebase everywhere
actually where you use that just only
out there okay and let's go on now we
need a project bridging header file okay
now this is a bummer number one because
there shouldn't be a bridging header in
the latest iOS applications but still we
have a Google sign in Google is a big
company we will allow that so how we do
that now there are a couple of ways to
have a bridging file let me show you the
easiest one click on the file new and
you want to get a new file and it should
be objective-c file don't get scary
it's not gonna be troublesome we are
gonna just create an objective-c file
and I'll call it as a mine me mine you
know and next add this and now it's
going to say create a bridging header
that's what we are looking for and this
is believe me the easiest way of
creating a bridging header so let's just
create a bridging header we are not
interested in mind dot M we are
interested in the G sign main bridging
header why because it says you need to
add this file out there copy that and
paste that and save that
okay now we need to do a couple of
things here implement Google sign-in but
before that I would like to build my
project and okay it's happy I'll build
it and save it quite often now it says a
you know what open your project
configuration and you need to go into
the targets info tab URL types let me
show you quickly where that is this is
your target this is your info tab and
this is your URL types you can read the
entire documentation I actually read it
quite a lot and I know this bold
highlighting actually helps me a lot I
don't want to read all of them
now it says click the plus button and
you might want to look into the Google
service info dot plist that reverse
client ID and this is where you have to
paste it okay diagram helps a lot okay
so let's go on to onto Google service
info.plist reverse client ID there we go
clicking it again command C and where I
want to go into the URL times click add
I want to paste it there hit enter voila
it's done while we are already here I
want to just give you one experience
guide out there but whenever you
actually use the Google sign-in or
Facebook sign-in it is a good advise
that you go into the capabilities and
you allow the keychain sharing otherwise
your simulator will not have an access
to that and it's it's not going to work
ultimately so make sure that your
keychain sharing is is enabled so that's
personal you know but always make sure
that it is there otherwise you will be
just figuring out why this app is not
working everything is going right and
you know a lot of trouble now it says
you have to add a delegate that says gid
sign-in delegate this is the trickiest
part believe me I have been through this
and it says GID sign-in delegate not the
UI delegate GID sign-in delegate now in
case this is not suggesting in your case
this is a bad situation why because you
have actually created a bridging header
file
you haven't compiled or you haven't
build your project yet this is a bad
situation this should be automatically
suggested why because we have already
have this pod out there in the Google
sign-in and in the framework so this
should be suggested out there and it
will not suggest if you'll not bring it
filled on if you'll not build if you
will not build after a creating a
bridging header file okay so I hope you
got that this is the tricky part so we
have imported the delegate out there
just like that now let's go on to the
did finish launching with options blah
blah method and we want to add these
lines we have already added this
configured line now we not we need to
add these two lines okay let me first
add these lines okay there we go now
what is doing it's taking a shared
instance of the client ID out there and
again it's referencing the delegate to
itself just like the table views you
always have to reference the delegate
that hey your delegate is here so just
work here okay let's go out there now
here comes the good part
now this method I can tell you that this
is actually implemented in the Swift to
or to point to something like that but
the great part about the documentation
is don't ever look for the copy-paste
look a little bit read a little bit the
more you'll read the more you'll
understand like for example here
implement the application open URL
options so it's saying that you need to
look for the three things in a method
application open URL and options method
to your app delegate file and this
method should call handle URL method and
methods of G ID sign and instance okay a
blah blah later on right now if you look
at this method this might be a little
bit old method but it's telling you hey
you know what you can just take
advantage of the suggestions index code
and say I'm looking for the application
open URL options let me just show you
what I mean by that I'll just add a
couple of blank lines for me I'm looking
for application open and there we go
application open URL options and there
we go I'm looking for this guy so simple
if you'll pay a little attention
now you can also go same things with the
return you are allowed there but
sometimes just copy pasting is also
going to work and in this case let me
just paste that save that and it's
saying that these dots are really nice
they always help and this is going to
change it to the latest syntax this is
actually for some lines of codes not the
entire function usually don't get
replaced so this is happy now not much
of the changes actually it has added a
dot a notation out there and this handle
URL actually became the handle so let me
show you this was handle URL and there
was no dot annotation so this has
changed nice and for your app running
iOS 8 now this is a good way we don't
have to bother about the lower devices
now most of the devices in the iOS
community runs the latest so we can
ignore this step step number 5 we are
all through quite a lot in deep out
there now ok we have to implement the G
ID sign and delegate protocol to handle
the sign-in process ok this might be
prompting some error for you because we
are not following the protocol we have
implemented the protocol but we are not
following the options from it ok let's
just try that I'm adding a lot of things
out here so the first method is actually
the sign-in and it's actually dead
sign-in for user and the next one is
disconnect with the user ok sounds night
dead sign-in for user so did sign-in for
user yep that's what I'm looking for and
the next one is did disconnect what was
that yep did disconnect with user did
this connect with user okay that's the
one I'm looking for ok sounds nice and
we haven't written anything inside that
yet declare your sign-in view controller
your view controller should be declared
as GID sign in Hue I delegate so let's
go on to the view controller will come
back there in the previous file
GID sign in UI delegate
I'm saying it again you I delegate this
time okay sounds nice and inside the
viewdidload you might want to implement
this line a simple line come on
we can do that and there we go
save that nice now add a GID sign-in
button so we are going to have that
button that says Google login you can
add that in the xib file as well or the
nib file but we're going to do that easy
vein we're going to go with the view add
a view and set its custom class to GID
sign-in button we're going to do that so
because it's a easy way and I'm gonna
look for UI view there we go it
understands my nasty casing which is bad
and I think we can just align it
horizontally and Center in the container
and give it a fixed width and height
it's happy completely happy now what
next okay
and set a custom class to GID sign-in
button okay class go into this newspaper
the identity inspector and we're looking
for GID sign-in button that is nice and
we have a view that has a class GID
sign-in okay what next
it's tool nd optional I don't want to go
with the optional now it says
authenticate with the firebase so the
method we call did sign in for the user
we are going to get a Google ID token
that's a good news we are not getting
your password we are only getting a
token from you basically let's just copy
this entirely out there copy this and
paste this into the did sign in for the
user where is that method inside the app
delegate yes I can have this save that
looks happy to me oh oh why are you
making a problem self dot show message
prompt it's okay why are you making a
problem app delegate has no member show
message prompt of course it doesn't have
let me just write something else here so
what I can do is how can I handle it in
two
the easiest way I can actually say print
error dot localized description I think
this should be happy now okay you're not
happy here and why are you not happy
here now I'm not gonna replace you with
an underscore right now I think this is
happy okay finally authenticate where
the firebase using the credentials okay
so we have to authenticate with the
credentials finally okay so how we are
gonna do that okay so basically what we
can do is we can go inside this function
and at the same time we can actually
authenticate it so not here now to go
there so once the user is actually
signed in and the token has we have
received the token I would like to
authenticate it with the same credential
already the code is written that's nice
with credential and credential is
actually the access token that we are
getting read out this code it's it's
pretty easy and it's good and this
sounds sounds nice and what all I want
to do in this case is I'm not worried
about the we have already taken care of
the sign-in process or the quiet in deep
in the course so I'm only going to say
is a user got signed in firebase
actually user is getting logged in into
the firebase this time and and user
should be logged in with the weather
Google as well I can actually come in
this code maybe I'll sign out user later
maybe maybe not
okay now what else we have there is a
code for signer but I think I think we
are done we have done till the end of
the documentation um I think we have
done a pretty good job now the moment of
the truth are we going to make it let's
just try that
okay I don't expect my code to run for
the first time I don't never I expect
some error all the time but usually I
think this is not a big deal and we can
actually get something out here yeah the
sign-in button is there that is nice
let's just try to sign in and there we
go Google Account opens up and already
it's being out there I can actually say
hey you know what sign out and okay come
on sign out I actually did try it and
test it for one of the app and did try
it login for that come on show me
something and there we go this is what
you'll be looking for something I've
already got the email out there let me
just try to log in and this is going to
be let's just say and I'll be blurting
it out because there is no way for me to
hide ID and password out there that's
nice and you will be having you have to
enter your email and password you know
that will it's pretty easy sign-in and I
got the wrong password let me try one
more time sign-in that this time we got
it right password and a V or email
address profile you know basic stuff and
allow and we actually didn't set
anything out there to go or to do after
the user is signed in and I think we
missed one thing we missed one thing and
that is gonna get us some problem we
actually didn't allowed our app to have
a sign in from the Google that is bummer
we need to save that and enable so that
anybody can get into that so you know
what let's just try that again our app
is already up and running and sign-in
this time it's let me just top this app
for a second and there we go stop this
app and user got signed in got tapped
couple of time because I tabbed it but
that was a bummer PR bummer completely
caught me off guard and that's why
I'm saying I never expect my code to run
for the first time in fact no coder
expect that believe me let's just try to
sign in this time and come on I didn't
not going to sign me in let me stop that
and clean my project or in fact let me
just delete this DC sign man
I think my app is behaving a little bit
odd but of course command shift K to
clean the project and let's run that by
the way our app is running fine we just
forgot to enable the switch out there no
big deal and there we go let's wait for
a couple of seconds okay it start out
there G sign in okay again you can just
enter your ID and password I'm not going
to do that again I have to blood it out
for a couple of times so I'm going to
just allow it and this time we expect a
user to show up into the firebase order
firebase authentication and let's just
check it out I guess I need to reload it
and there we go there we go we have got
the Google sign-in with the unique user
ID out there and the sign-in method is
now enabled you can just go same things
you know you followed the documentation
in fact we have learned quite a lot out
there okay now there is a simple
assignment for you as well now what you
have to do once the user has actually
successfully logged in and signed in I
want you to create a new segue with a
legislature blue or green color and
users should be moved on to that segue
once the sign-in has been once the
sign-in is successful out there pretty
simple job you'll be using something for
perform segue out there and you'll be
also finding out whether the user has
successfully signed in or not not a big
deal we have already covered quite a lot
of this and this is going to be a pretty
easy chunk for you so it is going to
take some time for you but I'm expecting
that you'll post the results out there
and in case you're watching it on the
YouTube again make sure you subscribe to
the channel and see you out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
