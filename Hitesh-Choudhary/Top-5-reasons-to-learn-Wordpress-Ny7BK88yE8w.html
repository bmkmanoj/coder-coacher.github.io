again with another video now in this
video we are gonna talk about the most
famous giant of the internet the
WordPress so let's get started here
so basically WordPress is a free
platform initially developed to build
blogs but nowadays is used as a content
management system for many websites a
large number of developers are choosing
WordPress as a solution when setting up
their website did you perceive
advantages of the platform the
advantages however are not always
correctly understood therefore the main
goal of this video is to present all the
advantages or you can call them as a
pros of the website building using
WordPress and in this video I'm gonna be
talking about the top 5 reasons why you
should be sticking to the website so
let's get started with the very first
and number 1 pros of getting started
with the wordpress wordpress is open
source
now many programmers share their code
online which results in ability of users
to save development time and cost by
using the existing code and WordPress
it's having all the code as an open
source and that is number one reason why
you want to really get started with the
WordPress the number two reason in is
it's convenient to use the WordPress is
made for majority of the market so that
so that the admin interface is
convenient and friendly towards
non-professionals or non tech guys
now what RIS is a simple system to
operate the webmasters hardly need to
spend any time to learn the system
before he or she can begin with working
on the website or editing some contents
on the website now in addition to the
system is super simple the soup the
system is actually super system to
install and that brings us to the next
point it's first construction now one of
the main advantage of building a website
with the WordPress is the ability to be
elite to be easily installed on the
hosting server so that webmaster can
start within no time and within a quick
short span of time he can start building
a WordPress website moving on to our
next point which is the pricing I know
we have talked about the word
open source but WordPress development is
actually very more cheaper than if you
want to design a website using full
stabbed full stack technologies like
nodejs or PR ASP it's much more cheaper
than that also there are hundreds and
hundreds of developers out there on the
web sites like freelancer who are ready
to make your project and make it live
and finally bringing up to our next
point which is plugins you need a video
support there is a plugin you need a
live chat there is a plugin you need a
map there is a plugin for that so what
press comes up with thousands and
thousands of plug-in that can do a lot
of job for you now don't get me wrong
I'm I'm a big fan of WordPress but there
are some security issues that you have
to take care on the WordPress itself but
we may talk about these security issues
in a later on videos about the cons of
the WordPress maybe we can design that
later on right now these are all the
pros or cons which you really think

WordPress now in case you are really
