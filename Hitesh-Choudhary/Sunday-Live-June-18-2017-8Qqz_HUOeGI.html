time and I know I'm a little early
three minutes early and I will wait for
the people to show up this time I made
an announcement on my Facebook page that
yes I will be going live and so I'm
little early I'm waiting for the people
to show up and let's wait for a few
minutes and hey everybody in the
meantime okay so a lot of people have
showed up although I'm little early so
hey Sachi hi presume ah hey ah well that
goes up hello sir how are you I'm good
how are you
so these Sunday nights are actually an
awesome way to interact with you guys
and show you the updates what's going up
what's cooking up in my studio what's
going on what will be coming up what you
can expect a lot of questions I know you
are filled up with the questions and
you're looking up for the answers and
that is why we have got this live and
actually the time was 12 o'clock but I
have showed up little bit early so that
we can spend a little bit more time so
let's just see hey hey Shay on hey Jake
hey Yogesh hey green oak Hey hey
everybody it's it's a lot of haze and
hellos - sorry avian what's up a day shy
how is going on at your end Arion how
are you okay so a lot of questions have
already been up hi sir please shout out
my name Cassandra Jess well and how are
you sir I'm good coach agra how are you
it's really going good this side how's
it going at your side how are you
learning what are you learning I would
be really interested to know that okay
so let's pick up some questions
what advice will you give to a 16 year
old boy interested in programming and
tech world okay a lot of
responsibilities on my shoulders if you
are asking my advice
first thing I would be saying is keep
your life balance because you are just
16 it's really important for you to not
to suck we all time with the computers
it's important that you also go out play
sports and hang out with your friends
it's important as well as never ever
think of drop out okay I know this is a
trend going on but at this stage you
need to understand that you can manage
your coding life and your call is life
everything so never ever think of
dropping out this is the one last thing
I would anybody I would recommend to
anybody okay and apart from that start
learning to code it's an awesome thing
and you are at a perfect stage to get
started and I think that's it okay okay
so happy Sunday sir Pascal programming
you have got a really nice name Pasco
and happy Sunday to you at 12 ah yup
it's it's 12 it's right Shotwell okay
please tell about Jason J query string
hibernate struts okay you have got a lot
of questions why why just have patience
one at a time Jason let's not go into
the in depth of what the definition is
Jason is basically a response from a
server or from an application that you
get and can use in your application
basically it's usually if I if I had to
give a simple example it could be like
weather API you don't launch your own
satellites on the space you just get an
API request from the people who have
already got their satellites or whatever
the calculation they are doing and you
can create a simple method up with a
JSON it's and tons of other C usage of
JSON are there and probably I use it all
day Oh sir okay so a lot of question is
there and I would request all of you to
please answer questions in English
because a lot of people from a southern
part of our country and as well as
abroad are listening so it would be
really nice so that everybody can
understand okay
so the question is should I would Lisa
is the doorway to enter into the Apple
development and yes it's the only way to
get started into the Apple development
as of now there is no such other things
but yes there is one way of getting into
it with JavaScript as well using
electron and react native yes there are
ways with the JavaScript as well but
officially the Swift is the only way
okay so what I what do I need to win in
WWE C scholarship I am learning Swift
but anything else you are onto a right
track I would say is after Swift get
started with the app development program
as well if your app is standing out they
always invite instructors as well as app
developers as well they have a separate
section now going on for the instructor
of Apple Development Program as well so
that's one way if your app is standing
out and you have produced a huge number
of app that is also one way if your app
is standing out that also one that is
also one way how much minimum knowledge
required to get a job in gs developer
there is no such comparison between
minimum or maximum or how will I get
because job is actually how you are
looking for the opportunities have
opportunities found you have you found
the opportunities if they both match
then how you are getting actually to lay
those opportunities down so it's a
relative term having job and everything
okay so it says sir tomorrow is my 6 M
final exam wish me best of luck hey of
each best of luck I am pretty sure you
are going to do awesome just make sure
you don't leave any questions and make a
lot of diagrams
okay so stream is live or not
Stream is live of course if it says
stream it's it's gonna be live otherwise
how would I be reading your questions
web app interesting from scratch it's
already there on lco learn code online .
--an okay sir what language is needed to
become Android developer hey our tech
talks you don't need anything at all for
Android development just one course
that course will come up roll out by the
end of this month and everything is
going to be covered up what language you
need from Java from scratch to app
drawer firebase to do apps sounds and
videos and audio so everything is going
to be covered out okay start about
information security experiences what
you want to know if you could be a
little bit specific I can discuss that
no problem sir please pay little
attention to my question I was a smoker
and I have quitted and now how should I
manage my study what does the smoking
have to do anything with that you just
quitted it that's actually first thumbs
up don't smoke it's bad and management
of the time just make your daily routine
chart that what will you do
okay so how to design GUI with sway with
C I would say why to start with the C if
you want to make a GUI app probably go
to little bit more advanced language and
you would be really happy that if your
product is scaling up little bit or just
doing really good in the and the market
you don't want to stuck around with the
C with that go for the Java or Python or
electron in the JavaScript so that
actually if your app do something good
you can add more feature later on I'm
not saying that C is bad but for GUI
production level app I would not go with
the C if I would be there I would be
rather going with electron or maybe Java
so that would be my choice okay which
language should I choose after learning
Java ah I don't think so you need
anything else because if you are getting
into that path of the zone with Java
Android out you just need that and if
you're going for the Android I would
highly recommend Kotlin as well keep
that in your pocket it's very efficient
and effective okay I should say is thank
you sir for being with us you are doing
a great job thank you so much this this
is the comment that keeps me going and
keep posting these lives do more for
your people so there it goes
hello - where are you based that in your
States no I'm based in India I live in
poor but it's not kind of a thing that I
stays always here in Jaipur I travel a
lot and I do have an apartment that I
have rented out in Paris so I stay here
quite a lot and hey is it good to upload
app on the Play Store why not if you
have created an app it's polished it's
finished want to just keep it with you
share it with the world so go ahead
upload it ah recently aced a college
course in data structure and algorithm
and C++ my question is that I am Not
sure that I am learning can be put into
use a practical project of some sort
some sort any advice I'm not getting
your question actually properly I think
you are asking how to apply data
structure and algorithm in real life and
probably it is it is everywhere it
writes from the start of the Google
search to your Facebook account
management at 6 everywhere so it's
important skill but it's not like you
always have to apply data structure and
guard them with Java or with C++ it is
applied to each and every language it's
rather a concept and not a language
specific things so to keep in mind is it
better to learn Kali Linux to become
ethical hacker or a penetration testing
no no no that's a myth that's a myth
Kali Linux is just a Linux it's it is
having a right out of the box it has a
lot of penetration testing tools and
that's it that's it you can also build
up your own Linux just take a bun to
install fire sure you can Metasploit and
all these things onto it and that's it
you've got your colleague so it's not
something that you need to learn Kali is
not specific to be learned these are the
tools that you need to learn these are
the methodology and the basics that you
need to learn okay so it's not Kali
so which laptop I purchase in the budget
or idk I have no idea absolutely no idea
I'm completely being honest with you I
don't have any idea what laptop cost
what because I'm not a brush reading guy
there are a lot of other useful you too
tutorials and channels that can surely
help you but buying and purchasing other
laptop is something that I really cannot
help is it good to learn xamarin for iOS
development nope I have seen serious
performing issues in the stammering I
know a lot of people are fan of Sam
rains but trust me the performance
issues are so bad in Sam rain that you
will get really really frustrated apart
from that the copyrights and the pricing
issues are again a big thing if you're
going for that I would recommend highly
to go with the native version the Swift
and iOS development that is far more
easier a headache free way of launching
your app so please tell me which laptop
is best for programming anything that
has a ram a graphic card a hard disk a
keyboard mouse pretty much any left half
is good for programming so which game do
you play sir
right now I'm playing a mobile game hit
a chai tea I like it it's it's pretty
awesome and apart from that I'm a big
fan of Tekken I play it a lot on my
playstation I'm also a fan of Call of
Duty I like to have Call of Duty but I'm
not a big fan of the recent version it's
it's not so good black ops and all those
were pretty awesome Prince of Persia yes
I do remember and there are a couple of
others as well I play a lot of these
games can you please make a course on C
language for BTech CSC students uh I
cannot make a course for the specific
curriculum of BTech because that would
include question-answer and the
theoretical concepts now my courses are
far more industry oriented so that you
can build product with that and rather
just getting passed in the exam so no
that's not going to come up but I do
have a course at learn code online dot n
please check that out if you feel that
it is something that you want to learn
go ahead and roll in that okay I was not
clear in your laptop or programming
video I don't know what advice do you
give to any graduate on how to go for
programming job in native company with
good programming knowledge full-stack
and few project done already I would say
prepare your project section from github
and approach companies because companies
are not going to come to you you have to
approach them and if you are working on
a specific domain you have some specific
companies to go into you have in your
mind so that would be really good
approach
so approach to them with your work not
with your two-page resumes okay just say
that this is the work I have done and if
you think I can get a job in your
company that's it
so what is Java good for other than
Android I don't know what you're saying
okay you can post your questions I'm
trying to answer a lot of questions here
there was an interesting question how to
start with ai ai starts with - yep and I
would also suggest you to go for iOS
development if you want to get started
with the AI because Apple have recently
launched an AI kit if you are not aware
of it go ahead search it on the google
or youtube AI kid is the far most
powerful technology in learning AI now I
know there are a lot of other courses
from big giant names another but the way
how Apple have actually introduced AI
kit in their recent iOS 11 it's far more
better than anything else that you can
see right now on the web and if you want
to go into the native machine learning
and AI - is the way but again I am
pretty sure that Swift and iOS
development will be the next game
changer in augmented reality and
artificial intelligences so AR kit is
the next thing so go with the AR AI ml
okay these kinds of things okay so
please give it to toriel for fresher
placement tips for good companies hey uh
I I don't think so probably I'll be
doing that because
and the placement head I'm not DPO for
your college sir there's a laptop for
learning what you have learned I don't
know why people keep watch eighty-three
watching no it's actually 121 count okay
and I have purchased your Kotlin codes
yesterday I am super excited to learn
hey Vivek you will be thrilled and
amazed that how good that course is
actually it's one of the finest course
right now on the Kotlin and just within
this month an amazing course on Android
is coming up and we have already built
up more than 10 apps in that still a lot
more to become up okay okay tip to earn
money through freelancer that is coming
up how to earn money with freelancing a
couple of things that I can share and I
can pass you some money that is going to
come up very soon in this show your
table view your table view I don't know
what you're saying thank you for
answering questions and sorry I didn't
know I should ask in English no problem
at all you got that any good resource to
learn jeaious yes of course you gauge
that is well learned code online . --an
was born to give you the resources best
resources to learn okay how can i create
my own personal assistant like CD that
would be that would be really far more
complicated i haven haven't tried to do
so anything okay any plans to come
bangalore yes ramen i do have plans to
come bangalore i do have a meeting in
bangalore with one of the thing that we
are using it learn code online so yes i
do have a meeting in bangalore i would
be surely coming up I have to meet a lot
of friends in Bangalore so surely
Bangalore trip is there sir learning PHP
is good or not yes of course with PHP
you can never go wrong it's not the
latest technology but it's a tool that
everybody should have in their bag
because for example if I'm building a
big a huge application obviously I would
be going with more advanced technologies
like firebase
or maybe no js' but if I have to make a
simple website one page or two page
websites with having a contact form up
and running
I would not be using node.js for that
for sure no it would be far more kind of
a not a cost-effective thing so for sure
I'd be using PHP for that okay let's go
sir it's not V it's like a B shake again
you pronounce my name incorrectly a B
shake okay I hope I did some good this
time but I'm really sorry if I didn't
pronounced it correctly where can where
we can get your courses a show you can
visit learn code online dot in to check
out all of my courses and more coming up
especially on the Android should I learn
Objective C for iOS and watch
development no nope Yogesh you should be
going with the Swift which is currently
in the market it's being a formal
announcement by Apple that we will not
be going on with further development of
objective-c
and most of the app that you see are
completely designed into it okay how to
live stream if you want to do a live
stream on a YouTube channel I think I'm
not sure but I think YouTube only allows
you to live stream only if you have
10,000 subscribers or more but I'm not
pretty sure and luckily we had growing
have quite good on this channels so
there we go okay so today is India vs.
Pakistan eddy currents yes I would be
watching the match with my friends I do
have some plans I have called up my
friends will be having lazy Sunday will
be having chips cokes and match and some
commentary on from our side it is going
to be fun we usually fight quite a lot
on that so yes that is going to be fun
okay so India will win let's see
hoping for the best cross my fingers I
really want this time to that happen but
let's see let's see very optimistic
about that
thus publishing an app in the Play Store
increase your chances for getting a good
job rather than unpublished github
projects yes of course for sure but it
depends on at that as well a little bit
of course published app are far more far
more considered as a top compared to the
unpublished github project because
unpublished github projects are not that
much polished and the only usual
difference is in the images and the
little bit polishes and the tweaking x'
if you can do that surely you will have
much more awesome what is framework
please explain me why we need this
framework okay I probably should do that
in a separate video on the YouTube
because it's a good subject okay which
language is good for beginners if you
have an Apple laptop I would highly
recommend chip is a very very awesome
language for bigness Python is also good
for big nurse I would say don't get
stuck with the C it's it's far more
complicated language yes people will say
if you can master C you can most or any
other language I get that if you master
Swift you can master any other language
if you master Java you can master any
other language as well so it's just a
saying thing Python is far more easy for
the bigness or JavaScript is also okay
which type of coffee you like I like my
coffee to be black and no milk
I prefer that uh how should one develop
a a I probably will talk about there are
you sir and live here at YouTube okay so
how much time you have spent eighteen
minutes it's twelve eighty okay how can
I become CEO of Google oh my just Google
why don't you create your own company
and buy Google Facebook whatsapp
Instagram Twitter all at a time
including Tesla as well why do just
Google just buy all the companies ok fun
stuff I love that okay hey please make a
video on how to get a job in IT
specially packed Amman why worried so
much about the job if you are if you if
your skills are so much intact and they
are very powerful
these will come after you no problem
with that okay so sir how do you how to
do livestream I want sin that does
angular to help scope in future angular
is actually one of the finest
technologies in the market right now but
the only problem is their rapid
development I am a big fan of angular
style of writing code and angular
project in itself but the only problem
with the angular is they are not giving
time to the people to apply that into a
full-fledged project or people to learn
that as soon as angular this version is
rolled out the next version just
completely breaks the previous things
then the next version rollout that
breaks of the previous thing so backward
compatibility is something that angular
guy needs to understand to imply that
project into production that is the one
thing that I don't focus much on angular
rather react because all the latest
version of the react were backward
compatible and a couple of them were not
remember that the router specially in
the in the react were not compatible
with us so yes okay
I am studying class 9 will I be able to
understand and learn Java of course of
course no problem what is the difference
between CSE and IT computer science
engineering and IT basically in college
level they do we have same curriculums
varieties motivated oriented towards
networking rather computer science is
more our software oriented basic general
overview I could be wrong
ok learning cotton from learn code
online and super excited to learn thanks
ok keep on keep on going please tell me
until 5 4 GB RAM hardest 500 GB laptop
where is your graphic card where is your
graphic card otherwise you face problems
ok ah what are your thoughts about
competitive programming I don't know why
people are so much worried about
competitive programming and stuff I
don't have any much thoughts about it
you can say completely blank yeah
and today we have answered a lot of
questions lot of questions here what is
good for bigness web development or app
development I would say if you are a big
nerve get started with web development
not for complete but at least for
front-end development because that
front-end development scale will help
you quite a lot in placing your things
getting friendly that how the buttons
are being done how the on call or on
click features are being applied so yes
it's a good thing that you first get
started with web but it's not completely
a kind of a line on the rock you can
always change that and I have seen a lot
of people getting started directly with
app development but I somehow consider
that if somebody is getting started from
the web he can do a little bit better
and easily can move on into app
development kind of a process okay
hey is Java learning good in 2017 yes of
course why not if you're going to get
started with that why not
it's a good language I don't like it
much that much but it's it's a fantastic
language specially the application in
Android is far more good than compared
to other like hibernate or struts they
are for more pain pain but the
application of the Java and Android is
easy okay any tip for building logic in
iOS I'm trying a lot but due to weak in
math I am NOT able to build complex
logic hey sergeant Patel I would say
that logic building is not so much
related to math but yes sometimes it
requires basic algebraic mind to solve
problems and equations hi - when will
react native tutorial will be up in
learned code online dot and I haven't
started to work on react native
tutorials because whenever I produce any
course I want that course to be
finalized finished version of that so
that if people are taking my course
that's it they should never buy an
e-book
never should buy any other courses or
anything once done with my course they
should be done and I haven't yet started
with the react native because and it's
not in the next to-do list
because after the Android first of all
Android is taking a lot of time because
I want more and more apps to be included
more concepts to be included
after that iOS 11 and augmented reality
kitten iOS 11 is there so I have to
focus a little bit attention there as
well and probably after that there is
going to be react native but sheis what
I want to tell you is you can check out
my course on react Jas and once you have
the react GS concept probably I think
that with a little bit effort just for
the 10% effort you can quickly and
easily switch into react native okay so
it's it's almost exactly same concepts
there so I'll just try out that it's a
good approach sir is Swift similar to
Android no it's not 111 watching yep
it's 120 to by the way push okay which
language should big nurse learn cotton
or Java you can choose with anyone no
problem with that
how much animation and programming are
related I would say no not much if you
just leave out the game development
there but all of the app development
like Android and Swift
do support little bit of the animations
but if you'll talk about the game
development they are closely related
with the Maya and unity 3ds but apart
from that no not much get a cheer for
India vs. Pakistan yeah India vs.
Pakistan that is going to be a big thing
will surely hell that so how make app
for App Store you need to have an Apple
device maybe Mac Mini MacBook Pro
MacBook Air or iMac whatever go to learn
code online dot in and there you go I
hate Trump okay who's that guy I hate
Trump javi your personal thoughts don't
want to comment anything on that
I'm also a big fan of Tekken game yeah I
am too ah okay the questions are getting
repetitive and I have already answered a
lot about them okay how long you are
teaching online is this your full time
for living do you also work for other
companies or freelancing uh no teaching
online is not my full-time job because
yes of course you can expect that
offering a course for $10 $15 $20 is not
something that you can live up for this
is not at all completely profitable I
imagine if one student is paying you
just 600 rupees or a thousand rupees how
can you actually be profitable in that
so yes I do corporate jobs as well
sometimes I do get hired on a term Li
basis like two months or six months I
don't like to stuck around for two years
or something with one company and I also
do freelancing as well but my
freelancing is not like bidding on the
projects all like that my clients are
far more specific they want very complex
projects to be done so yes I do for them
and obviously the project is complex
it's far more challenging it's far more
good in pay and luckily a bit the God's
grace I am happy to say that I do have a
bunch of clients and always corporates
are approaching me
I do get offered from writing books
writing video books quite a lot often so
yeah things are going good
okay oh I have already said I have no
thoughts about comedy programming no
thoughts at all is Jagger has coke and I
are normal on Django yes for sure Django
and Python are pretty awesome they are
being used for quite a lot of companies
yes you can go with that that's also a
way you are doing really good job kudos
Thank You Shivan thank you
they'll give it a thumbs up this video
it really requires your thumbs ups okay
so go ahead whatever you are listening
doing it's been 30 minutes okay and your
30 minutes should I have spent 30
minutes video this deserves thumbs up so
go ahead give it a thumbs up please guys
I hope you can do so okay I can see the
number counting up so in case you are
just busy watching go ahead give it a
thumbs up we need it we need it
thumbs up actually is something that
shows how much you are liking the video
how much you are liking the concept so
don't be like that hey I'll do it later
on do it right now we need it okay I can
see the number rising up quickly that's
that's awesome thank you thank you so
much okay I am just going to close
eleven and I'm learning Java can it give
me some tips some motivations I do a lot
of motivation videos so best of luck for
your class eleven and keep learning
programming as well okay how can
electronically continue work on Python
what should what should be gone to get
higher I don't know oh okay how to learn
UI for Android app development please
tell up k septum asked this okay I also
do custom kind of UI development but I
do it on Mac and on Mac I do have a
software known as sketch just check it
out it's really awesome and once the app
design is done I use envision which is
like a simulation of your images into
app so this is how I design UI for most
of my apps for clients okay we do an
InfoSec we do an freelancer Shirley
Shirley do you have Java on lco the Java
course with Android is coming up this
month at LC oh and by the way it's not
LOC it's LC Oh a lot of people mail me
hey I'm learning on LOC no you are not
learning online of control you are
learning on LC oh okay so okay which
elective subjects should I choose for my
seventh same cloud computing or data
mining or warehousing I would be going
with cloud because it's far more
interesting subject and you will be
making a cloud from an Australian guy I
forgot his name he's an Indian lives in
Australia and he has actually OpenStack
I think so I don't remember the cloud
so it's a good subject you'll enjoy
there your videos are really good
awesome and curses - can you please a
fluid course for making GUI applications
in C++ making a course for GUI
application I would probably be going
with the Python because the inter is far
more fun I did a project very very long
time ago on making a GUI for wireless
tool probably you might have heard about
the aircrack set of tools I did design a
GUI application for myself personally

a lot of information and your videos
gives inspiration to me to course and
also iOS app development ok thumbs up
shree thumbs up for you ok the feature
of GIS ah yes ah GIS I did heard a
little bit about it in my masters didn't
paid a lot of attention to it I'm not
much interested in the geographical
information system so no much not much
idea I didn't paid much attention there
although it was a subject in my masters
I didn't his Python is a framework of
PHP come on man you can answer you can
just google this question at least that
Python is a framework of PHP it's it's
such such a bad thing I would say you
should not be asking these kinds of
questions if you're getting started in
programming at least you should know
what is a framework what is a
programming language ok PHP Python
calling them a framework really bad hi I
subscribe your channel recently I'm very
happy with your videos and suggestions
thank you thank you so much nice profile

have a coffee surely we can uh can you
meet me today no today is india-pakistan
match everybody
should be busy with that coming to Bihar
no no plans of that right now Swift
similar to Android is it easy to learn
Swift after learning Android or they
both are different no it's far more easy
actually once you are aware of the Swift
Android development it's far more easy
to go into I guess development if you
know iOS it's easy to go in Android so
they are connected okay okay are you
covering courses on Cortland I have seen
your videos and cut lines so I just need
to know is it a full course in Cortland
I have knowledge okay so the what you
need to do is just go on to learn code
online dot in all your answers are there
you can check out the entire curriculum
what is being taught what is not it's a
complete transparency thing okay hip
edge there is a huge spike in enthusiasm
and just now it is very profitable now
ah I don't know what you're talking but
if you're talking is huge spike in the
in the channel yes it is okay so a lot
of questions are which PC you use I
don't use PC I use an iMac the big one I
think it's 29 inches I think so 39 on
the bigger one
with a lot of RAM I do have four slots
and each slot is having an 8 gigabyte of
RAM so pretty heavy machine I like it
pretty fast which is your favorite
player in cricket I am a big fan of such
in and after such in there's nobody was
taken actually the place of such an I
have grown up I have grown up watching
ish in every match of such an big fan of
such an no doubt about it
yes after that I liked little bit Tony
but apart from that nobody nobody
because I believe if he's a cricketer he
is an idol he has a job he has a public
responsibility and cursing on the field
is the last thing that I want anybody to
do
because you are an inspiration you are a
role model for everybody if you are
going around on the field cursing people
openly I'm not a big fan I hope you had
getting for whom I'm pointing out but
yes uh chin and after that little bit of
the only but not much
such him all the time will you watch
today's india-pakistan match yes Fran
chill I will be watching it okay where
we are doing a lot of questions okay
what's your salary enough enough good to
live a happy life enough to have some
free time to make courses for you enough
to get some trips as well so okay ah you
don't need a degree to write code I
don't know I have you just need a code
editor at the computer to write the code
okay so what's the future of angular
angular can have a great great future if
they slow down their development process
because what they're doing is they're
developing quite lot fast and this is
again I discussed it a little bit before
that the backward compatibility issue
coming to endure no not right now I'm
also a die-hard fan of such a yeah most
of the India is who do you support India
or Pakistan I know a lot of people from
Pakistan are also watching but I do
support a Nia I cannot do anything I do
support ok signed up for an iOS course
which starts next week any tips on
dealing with a swift the framework no
just you'll be good if instructed is
good therefore the iOS development you
should be good
which is better react native or Google
flutter react native as of now I would
be going for react native okay in react
course browser history of react router
is not working in version 4.0 or higher
yeah I know I can understand your
frustration because they react router
got some disruptive changes and that
made my code broke and because I worked
on version 3 I will try to make sure to
make some videos and react router in the
coming up days so that you can actually
have a fix for that but yes I'm aware of
the situation that reactor outlet
version 4 has broken other things so
these are the two videos that could
broke yeah I'm aware of the situation
okay
development or digital marketing
actually just to give you a little bit
idea Feroze I do know digital marketing
I worked for a company for six month or
so four months or six months where my
job was basically on running ads for the
client and basically it was a basic CA
SEO company so I do know a lot about it
and so that's all so I would prefer
development on to that how much hours do
you code never actually calculated
probably six hours or so because I'm
usually in front of the computer all day
long so in one language or the other I
usually am writing code best resource
for learning Python hey Salman you can
watch out learn code online dot in for
best resource and Python okay bye which
device are u livestreaming I am live
streaming from my mobile this mobile
thing is going on with the live
streaming it's I use a one plus three T
I'm looking forward to upgrade for one
plus five okay so how to make a working
application after coding an IDE how to
make graphical interface okay okay so
happy by making some jokes as well
dotnet is good for feature never a big
fan of dotnet it's such a closed
environment that I don't like okay so
you have spent almost 40 minutes here
that is long how can i record it 3:00
a.m.
you might have watched if India's annum
and know it is their time at the top bar
yes I do record sometimes late night
some time all day long so yeah I do okay
he noticed me yes some people are just
attention seekers I noticed you okay so
let's just go there ah okay I don't know
why people are just could you take a
detailed video about database firebase
server side back and SQL no SQL on iOS
shortly fire waste could have been a
subject of interest for a lot of people
and I'm getting really good requests on
firebase
so surely probably in the next iOS 11
course I'll take firebase and far more
detail what anybody have taken so far so
we'll do so okay give me your number
sorry okay complete website building
from buying a domain to publish that
it's a pretty fairly easy process Nikhil
once you have done the hard work of
building a website it's just buying a
domain from Hostgator bigger ago ready
whatever you like and just upload all of
your files onto the template of the
directory that's it
probably I'll do a video on it ah your
reputation or Stack Overflow I do have
an account but I rarely reply to the
questions because most of the questions
are already being replied and I just
search for the answers they have most of
the time okay so I think we have done
quite a lot and this was a good idea of
having a Sunday live I would say hey you
have stopped giving it a thumbs up keep
going on with that go ahead check out
don't give it a thumbs up because this
is the only way I can understand that
you're liking all these things or not
okay so give it a thumbs up yeah I can
see the numbers raising up and I would
say that I think that's it
and I need to get back on to my work I'm
making it to do app by the way
that uses my SQLite in Android that is
going to come up in the Android course
it's a full-fledged app and after that
we will also build a kind of Instagram
app with a firebase in Android that is
also going to come up in the Android
course so with this I would say bye bye
everybody
and you can write your bye bye here we
will do more of these Sunday lives on
next Sunday's and every Sunday because
that's why they are called a Sunday live
so bye bye everybody I hope you have
enjoyed I've tried to answer a lot of
your questions but I can understand I
haven't answered all of you so be
prepared with your questions or just hi
