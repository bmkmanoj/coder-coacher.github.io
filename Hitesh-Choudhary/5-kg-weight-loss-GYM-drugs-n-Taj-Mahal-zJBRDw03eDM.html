knows it and I got really fat but
today's the day when I lost 5 kgs which
is a good target but I'm going to tell
you today that why it's bad everybody
knows about the health reasons and
everything but there is one more key
element that you really lose when you
get fat but first I need to take a
shower and I'll catch you at get you
back in a sec ok so I'm back and I
really want to talk about one thing
don't get fat now everybody knows the
downside that hey it's not good for
health and everything but one thing I
can say to you that getting fat really
wastes a lot of time now you will get
lazy you will not get up early in the
morning or something and you will lost a
lot of time now time is for me
personally time is actually more than
money because I can earn a lot in if I
save a time so indefinitely and after
some time when you realize that you're
fat there will be a bug inside you
that's gonna tell you hey you need to
get loose all that fat and you need to
get slim down now it's not easy to get
slim down because it takes time about 5
or 6 month or maybe four months and
during that all four month your life is
going to revolve around the gym maybe
gym maybe running maybe cycling but for
sure your YouTube playlist is gonna
change a little bit you'll be watching a
lot of fitness videos and everything I
have gone through with it and really my
advice is don't get fat it's really bad
so hit the gym do a running or do a
cycling always get that it's really that
much bad but of course when you get back
into the shape it really feels so much
good but this video is not just about
sharing that hey I got really slim this
is little bit more because I think there
is a little bit need that I should share
my experience some of the bad things
that I experienced about it and really
it's gonna make a little bit different
so let's talk about them as well
so as everybody does when you want to
really get slim you hit the gym I did
the same and I didn't hit the gym I
should really name them but I won't be
naming them because it would be rude
about root for me but I should really
name these guys because they are doing
something wrong there and but anyways
let's just talk about the experience you
may face it somewhere else as well thank
goodness that I actually didn't got into
them so I went to the gym I asked that
hey I want to lose 5 kgs that's what I
want to do and they said ok how in how
much time you want to lose it I said I
don't know you are the trainer you
should you should tell me I am having
about let's just say couple of months
maybe two months I want to get rid of
that fat so they said ok we can do that
but we need to give you a little bit of
the supplements as well I said on the
day one he said yes definitely I didn't
thought much about it but and I paid him
for a month for the gym fees and the
pills that were they they were saying
that this is the supplement they gave me
a tablet and I took it that's that's all
about it and the next day I again went
to the gym they said hey take this
tablet and just workout
the trainer was working with me so I
said ok I'm gonna do it what did I
realized should I really be taking that
tablet from a random person he says I
asked him that I don't want to take this
tablet what's inside it I tell me what's
this tablet is for this he said it will
reduce your fat and I said ok is that it
show me the product so he bought a
bottle without the label or anything I
said where is the medical information
about inside what's inside it so I said
hey you have to trust your trainer
otherwise you are never going to lose
the weight you will never get fit you
have to trust the trainer you have to
trust your gurus I said ok I just took
the tablet kept in my pocket and I
worked out and then I went to the home
and I I just asked myself whenever I'm
in doubt I asked myself whether it's
right or not then I go to my dad that
hey tell me whether it is right or not
and then I asked for the third-party
advice so I asked myself whether it's
good or right and a question that comes
up in our mind that are you going to
take a tablet from any random guy on the
street I said no then why are you taking
a tablet from any random guy from the
I said yes that's that's actually true
and I throwed that tablet away I never
showed up the gym again although I was I
already have paid this fees and
everything I never showed up to the gym
still they tried to call me and said hey
why are you not coming and everything I
didn't picked up the call and anything
because there was some trust issues when
you are just supplementing the the
people any random guy I said no I'm not
gonna do it and then I started running
in the parks
hitting the cycles and everything and
then again the bug inside me caught me
and said hey why don't you join another
gym I join another gym and I started
running and everything he said hey you
need to stop running otherwise you're
gonna hurt yourself
running is really bad and I say okay
that's a little bit unacceptable but
okay you are trainer I'm gonna believe
you I didn't run on that day then I meet
to a doctor friend he is my dad's friend
so I asked him hey you if running is
wrong he said who told you that nothing
is really good and he said my trainer
told me that if I'm gonna be running too
much I may hurt my knees he said yes he
is little bit right but it's completely
wrong you need to run it's really good
but again don't overdo it start slowly
with a slow pace then try it for a half
mile then one mile and just like that
and you're gonna be completely fine and
I'd say I'm gonna believe the doctor and
not the trainer so I again started my
running and everything but I was hitting
the gym as well for some weight training
now after that the things become
interesting now everything really was so
smooth and in this gym I paid him for
six month in advance that was the
furthest mistake but I liked the gym and
one day things really got bad I saw that
the entire training group not the
trainer group the couple of trainers and
some people who were working out there
were tracking some syringe or something
there and I just stopped there and watch
what they are doing and there was just
one syringe everybody was taking some
liquids and I don't know what that was
I'm not affecting fitness good so they
were taking something and any idiot can
tell that this can cause they're tiny
because they were sharing the syringe
and he hid it from a village contain
that and I really didn't like that and
the traders saw my face and he say hey
it's nothing it's nothing you don't have
to worry about it or anything but to be
honest inside I didn't liked it at all
and when I was moving out of the gym I
saw a box which was having all those
empty syringes and everything I really
thought that hey although he was not
forcing me to take all of these but I
didn't like it and I don't know where
the culture is going on for the fitness
I am NOT at a fitness guru I'm just
sharing the experience but I didn't
liked it I didn't like it
so I never showed up to the gym again
and I started running I started cycling
and everything majorly focused on that
now again as you know I have to somehow
do a weight training and everything then
I joined up again at gym which was
almost a gold standard gym I a gold is
really far from my house and I cannot
show up regularly there that's why so I
joined up a good gym again and this time
I liked it and I'm continuing I'm
regular at that gym from almost two
months I don't know maybe something
might go wrong but I have paid annually
for that I'm liking the gym and all I'm
doing is running taking right food and
everything I'm feeling so much happy so
much good I'm much more productive now
doing a lot of stuff and that's all
about it
and by no means I'm trying to be a
fitness guru here but taking any random
things like protein shakes or maybe any
pills or tablets I don't do that I would
rather like to take an advice from a
doctor that hey do I need protein shake
do I need vitamins do I need some
tablets if doctor says yes then only I'm
gonna take it because from a guy he
might be just a high school pass out and
he is advising me on nutrition's I don't
trust it with that that's that's me I
cannot do much about it and he may be
good with the experience and working out
he may be having biceps or his biceps
might have biceps but I'm not gonna do
it that's all me I really need to get a
little
Whitmore I don't want to be that much
slim but I need to get rid at two more
kgs surely I can hit that within a month
or maybe two months I'm not in a such
hurry but this is really a good feeling
and I would advise all of you to don't
take those protein shakes of those
vitamins and in unless your doctor
advices and that's all about it I'm not
being a fitness guru don't watch this
channel because I shared a fitness tip
this is the tech channel but sometimes I
do share experience and I think that's
something good I'm doing so that's all
about it and that's all for this video
and by the way you can watch this great
clip time lapse that I took from the
visit of my thoughts that's really nice
so go ahead check out it's at the end of
the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
