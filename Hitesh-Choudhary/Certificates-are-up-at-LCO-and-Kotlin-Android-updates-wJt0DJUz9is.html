more awesome hey did everyone hit a
share back again with another video now
today video is not on any specific topic
neither it's something inspirational
it's just more over to talk between you
and me directly in person in here so
let's talk about that before we move on
to the topic specific things in this
video I would like to thank all of the
community in here and I know we are just
a small community but for me it's a big
thing now I've started my youtube
channel a long time ago in fact I
created an account on YouTube way back
in almost 2010 or 11 but that was just
to upload one of my interview that I
gave on some news channel and that's it
i forgot that i even have a youtube
account and i didn't have any intention
to create any youtube channel or
something but in the last couple of
years i thought that hey i should be
doing on youtube and that part really
got entire ears to just get started on
youtube and then i started a channel few
few months back and I realized that my
quality that I'm delivering the cameras
the sound the lightning the the way I
use the camera is not something that I'm
doing what I can do at my best so what I
did I started to learning and thankful
to my connections and the community in
which I teach I I know some of the
instructors which are the best in
filmmaking and all these process so I
did join their boot camp of course
online everything was online and I
learned from some of the bests and you
can see that within few months I have
grown quite a lot in the quality of the
audio the video and how the I'm using
this camera and everything and it helped
really quite a lot in building the
community because I knew that even if
I'm delivering the best quality content
if it is if it is not watchable people
will not watch it if it is not a crisp
clear along with the best audio people
will not watch it so and I have seen
that as I'm working lot in the quality
of the video
delivering more specific content
everything is just working out and I'm
really happy to announce that we are
just crossing almost 18,000 subscribers
now on this channel now I know there are
a lot of big guys that me that who are
having hundred thousand or millions of
subscribers but what connects us what
unites us is we are a community of
programmers at any given day we can
fight over Android versus iOS or Java
versus surf and that is okay to me if we
fight over that that is completely okay
with me because end of the day we are
programmers and that is the glue that is
sticking to us and I'm happy that I am
able to create a community of
programmers 18-thousand is big number
for me at least I could have never
achieved that offline creating a
community of 18,000 people specifically
programmers that is something amazing
that is YouTube's doing for me and I'm
really happy about it and all of the
efforts that I put up in learning the
filmmaking of all these processes
working out for me also I would like to
make a little little small announcement
that the project that I have launched a
learn code online dot n we have now a
community of just over a thousand people
within the days and this is something
insane i-i've never expected that this
will grow up so quickly because it's not
even weeks that have launched this and
now a thousand people are learning from
this this is this is something amazing
and very exciting for me and also I
would like to show you some of the
projects that students are building up
and I would like to remind you that it's
been just days that people have started
to learn from those boot camps and
everything and showing you just the
project of one of that courses so have a
look on these screenshots that I have
taken here and these are all from the
students
amazing amazing and I always wish that
there should be something in the
learning mechanism where student can
show off their work it's it's amazing
and many times I have seen that people
are learning something like C or Java or
PHP and then they get they actually
don't get the confidence that I can do
something they have nothing to show off
their projects or something and when
students actually are learning something
and building something from my courses
this is this is something I always
dreamed of so I'm really happy about it
now also I would like to make a few
touch-ups a few points that you have
been asking so I picked up a few
questions and I will be answering them
as well the number one question that I
get when you will be rolling out the
certificates on learn code online dot in
now from the day one I was completely
aware that I needed to roll out the
certificates I was working on that and
finally the certificates are up but
these are not just the completion
certificate which you get on various
websites these are not like that these
are full fledged training certificates
and once you take down this course of
any of the course certificates are
available with all of them you have to
by end of the course you have to take a
simple quiz and based on that analysis
of the quiz the certificates will be
allotted to all of you as soon as you
pass the minimum passing marks of the
quizzes and that is something great and
this is not just the completion
certificate these are full-fledged
training certificates personalized to
you with a unique IDs and everything
being included and I'm trying to make
this process as quick as possible the
certificates will be allotted to you
within few hours to 24 hours but I'm
trying to make sure that this time
duration really shortens out as well in
the future as
LM planning to roll out a few
certificates based on your project so
that in few of the courses you are
making some really good and potential
projects and based on the analysis of
the project that how good you are doing
you will be allotted a project-based
working certificate that yes we have
worked on beans number of projects along
with us so this is something exciting
that is coming up in the future also a
quick update that everybody who is
enrolled in the course and who will be
taking course in the future certificates
will be available to all of them no need
to pay extra so everything is covered up
so this is the one quick and great news
I have for you now also I do have some
good news and to discuss something but I
forgot so I do have my phone here
to discuss what are the topics are the
questions okay
so Carl in court a lot of you have been
asking then the code Kotlin course will
be released Kotlin course is finished by
today and still it will take a couple of
more days because the polishing of the
videos the editing of the videos will be
it will is still remaining and I have to
do all of that and you might be asking
why why'd these editing's and everything
because I want to make your learning
experience as perfect as possible
sometimes you do need to see what
mistakes I am doing so that you can
learn what mistakes are and how you can
overcome with that but most of the time
if there is some arms and some
meaningless things in the videos I like
to cut them off so that I can save your
time as well these are highly polished
quality videos and you can expect the
release of the Kotlin course I think the
next Monday or maybe just like that so
next week is going to be the release of
Catalan course and also very soon entire
course and Android building apps using
Catalan is going to be released and one
more important thing is when the Android
course will be rolling out now let me
tell you what's wrong with the Android
course that we are building and why I'm
not building it up now I do maintain a
few apps on contract basis on iOS and
Android and right now I can see the
scenario that we are in between Android
N and Android oh so I'm making updates
for existing apps from Android n to
Android oh and I can understand
that this is such a pain to just update
your code existing code now if I'll
start making any course on Android and
right now and within a few months then
Droid or will roll out and it will break
the things and he'll be again coming
back to me that hey this code is not
working that code is not working so
within after a couple of weeks and
months as soon as the stable version of
the Android OS released for everybody
I'll roll out a course on Android OS
well that will include the Java as well
so a complete Android development of a
Java will be rolled out very soon and
we'll be making some awesome and
fantastic apps using firebase some
database some clones like snapchat
clones and obviously we will not be
cloning exactly we will be closing some
of the functionality of that the base
functionality of the apps some graphics
and everything as well so that will be
rolled out very soon but I I just don't
want to roll out the courses and courses
and courses I want to produce the best
possible quality and want to deliver
best possible products from those
trainings so I'm not after releasing
courses and courses after releasing the
best possible quality that I can produce
so android course will come out along
with java along with the cortland there
will be separate courses for that but as
of now we just have the Kotlin course
that we'll be rolling out after that in
the plan there is a Catalan course with
Android and as soon as Android all comes
out there will be course on complete
Android code development with Java as
well so that's that's the quick update
but yes I don't want to break the things
and don't want to produce anything and
just want to sell it out no I'm not
after that kind of thing I'm after
quality to give and serve the student
best possible quality I know a lot of
FEMA might be waiting for the courses
and want to learn from me but that is
remember you want to learn from me
because I produce the best quality
courses not the best quantity courses
you could have done that from offline
Institute or any other training centers
as well but I'm after the quality okay
so these are I know this video was quite
little bit long and we just have talked
through it but this was just a personal
talk not a specific video so that's all
for this video just to remind you quick
updates that yes Kotlin course is coming
android with java is also coming
Android with Cortland is also coming up
I'll be sharing a few experience of how
the updates vents on for existing
clients from Android end to Android OS
well and also certifications are up for
everybody without increase in any prices
of the courses or anything available for
the previous and the future students as
well so go out and check out learn code
online button and of course I'm reading
all of your comments in the comment
section below so let's have a little bit
chitchat bill and I'll be responding to
all of you guys and I'll catch you up in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
