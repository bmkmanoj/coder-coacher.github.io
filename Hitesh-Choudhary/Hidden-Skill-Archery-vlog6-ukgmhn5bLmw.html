again with a V Lord now today was a busy
day and you might have I guess that I
always say that this was a busy day but
yes
things are getting little bit more busy
of course we log is one of the reasons
but I'm enjoying it so far so it was a
busy day I have to finish up a project
before seventh of the next month and my
traveling is not at all stopping at all
so I have to work late night and all
this stuff
now today hi it was Sunday and I planned
that I'm gonna be working all day no
matter what happens but again one of my
friends showed up and he said we need to
go to God or tower now god of tower or
GD in Jaipur is like a mini Times Square
it's a busy place
crowd E place lots of shopping and lots
of other stuff fun stuff so I couldn't
say no I said okay let's just go and
we'll quickly come back and we enjoyed a
little bit there you can enjoy some
shots in between there I'm at the GD the
hub of Jaipur and it's a little bit
cloudy you should not be here at Sundays
but here we are I'm with my friend as
well say hi so we are gonna be making a
V log here and now it is pretty pretty
much freaky about they haven't seen
anybody be logging at in such a crowded
place but still we're gonna do it it was
a fun place and one thing I've realized
in the V logging is people are not used
to about V logging it's not that much
common in Jaipur yet so when you move
around with your gorillapod your cameras
your phone everybody thinks that you are
from some media or something like that
so it's it's a fun situation they miss
and they messed around with a lot of my
shorts that are completely unusable now
I'm pretty sure of that
one thing also I find out today that I'm
pretty good Archer I can really I use
bow and arrow sometime maybe I actually
want this as well I think it's good it
looks cool
how does it look oh I think it looks
cool that the Buddha's are let's see if
I can get that or not
so this is I want in the archery game it
it looks nice and maybe you can see this
hat in some of my V logs maybe later on
as well
and after this I'll be just working
again there is a lot of work that have
to finish and I'll catch you up tomorrow
tomorrow is again a travel day I don't
know when my traveling is going to end
but tomorrow is again a travel day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
