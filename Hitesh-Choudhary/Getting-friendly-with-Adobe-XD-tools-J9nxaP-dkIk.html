another video they are very gonna talk
about Adobe XD the goal of this video is
to understand the interface of Adobe XD
as well as to get familiarized as much
as possible with the tools that are
available now many times you'll feel
that these tools are quite familiar from
illustrator Photoshop or sketch video
really have those experience but in case
not it's pretty simple and easy and also
the good news is that we can cover up
all almost all of these tools the first
look in just one video so that means
they are really like not a lot of them
and you're gonna love them so this is
the first look obviously you can just
fire that up you using your cloud and
all of that so that's gonna be pretty
easy with my Adobe XD vent up there we
go so this is your first screen they
change that quite a lot so probably in
the future it might get changed a little
bit buh but one thing that's gonna stay
here for like a really really long time
is a start new design so here you can
see it says we can directly start with
the artboard I will talk about what is
artboard in a minute just bear with me
so it says you can start with an
artboard of iPhone iPad web or custom
design now don't get jealous with that
it can also support everything for
Android as well if you click on this
small teeny tiny arrow bar it says it
can support Android devices as well or
all the iPhones for the iPads as well as
tablet surface pros all of that are also
here there's a web presets as well and
there's a custom size as well so you can
just keep a number here like probably
thousand by thousand and he can go with
that
so let's just go and start with an
iPhone that and we're gonna talk about
what is this heart pool so if I'll just
click on this guy now it's gonna take me
to the artboard screen now first of all
let's talk about what are these
artboards
now artboard are the places where
actually you design everything and it's
something like you might have heard
about another application as canvas or
it's you're actually the working area so
this is our very first artboard now
let's try to utilize as much as of the
screen real estate that we have there we
go so this is your interface and as you
can see there are not like much of them
that we have this is a really simple
artboard and you can move that so this
is the place where you'll be actually
working now this is known as artboard
you might be referring that as a canvas
another application now as you can see
on the very left hand side we just have
like a few tools very very less in
number as compared to Photoshop
Illustrator and they are not hidden
anywhere they are just that's it hey
these are only that one and the most
important one is gonna be the first one
which you'll be using quite a lot it's a
select tool the shortcut is V and I
would highly recommend to pay attention
on the shortcuts because we will be
using them quite a lot through our
keyboards it's far more efficient so the
first thing is V okay and the second one
is your rectangle tool which is our four
shortcut you can select that and you can
draw some of the rectangles there okay
now while drawing the rectangle we will
be coming back onto the rectangles and
all these things and how you can
maximize all these potential now notice
here on the right hand side now the
right hand side menu is purely
context-sensitive like if you're gonna
select artboard it's gonna give you let
me press V here for my vector and if I
just notice here I select this artboard
it gives me all the apps options related
to artboard when I select my rectangle
it gives me option for rectangle and
just below the rectangle there is in
oval tool also known as Eclipse ellipse
in Adobe XD in sketch you might have
heard about these ovals with the oh but
here the shortcut is e okay don't get
confused here if I am referencing quite
a lot about sketch so this is your
eclipse and the shortcut is again e make
sure you remember the shortcut and just
drag and drop that so notice here now
your all the options on the right hand
side are getting changed based on that
again press the V to select anything
else and just like that so this option
is quite handy we're gonna talk quite a
lot in detail about this and the next
thing is line really simple we all know
what the line does and how we can have
the straight lines and all that we will
again revisiting each of them so don't
vary too much just have a feel have a
look
enjoy this video and the next thing that
we have if I just press V here is this
pen tool now this pen tool the shortcut
is P is the amazing it's really powerful
you can have variety of designs curves
and a lot of that we will be doing a lot
of things so that we can master this
tool this is essential if you want to do
any
InDesign mastering the vector tool pen
tool whatever they call them it is
really really important to take a field
at how it works
don't worry we will be going back onto
that now here's a quick sidebar for all
of you in Adobe XD this pen tool was not
borrowed from Photoshop or illustrator
it was redesigned completely to met the
need of prototyping on a mobile app or a
web so it's written from the scratch and
it's totally worth it I like it totally
and the next one is your text tool now a
lot of people think that the text tool
is like just text tool might be borrowed
from somewhere but no this is also
rewritten completely from scratch in
Adobe XD now there are two types of text
and probably we'll talk about a lot more
about text and how we can have effective
test text in our application later on
just keep in mind there are two types of
text in Adobe XD we'll be working on
with that later on right now let's just
have something like probably hello world
most of the designers don't write that
but we do that so and you can just press
this and can have like really big one so
we'll be working on that later on okay
now if you go up here notice this guy
says artboard and this you will be using
quite a lot now when you select artboard
on the right hand side again since it's
context-sensitive it gives you a lot of
predict presets here like iPhone X
Android surface and web and all of that
now on top of that you can also drag and
drop this and if you want to have like
something customized you can have that
probably let's just say you want to have
an artboard by 300 by 300 so you can
have that not at all a big deal you can
have it anytime you can also save these
things if you are using that quite a lot
let's just say I make a lot of youtube
videos and for that I have a fixed
resolution to make so I can save that my
artboard there so this is here now the
final tool we are going to talk about is
our zoom tool now zoom tool as you all
know it's pretty powerful the shortcut
is still same as for most of the Adobe
which is your Z key or the Z key on your
keyboard you can drag and just select an
area to have a zoom like that but I
would highly recommend to remember the
shortcuts for that and the shortcut is
command zero to fit everything on your
screen there is a cam
and one as well 400% and there's a
command to as well for two hundred
percent for all those guys who are on
Windows and talking here about control
keys so control 0 and control 1 and
control 2 are the ones I'm talking about
here
you can also go into the View menu and
can check out your shortcuts like
obviously command + or ctrl + is there
command one command two and command zero
are gonna be the most useful one which
we'll be using quite a lot like like
just say you're in this situation you
might want to press command 0 to see
everything on your screen so these are
like your basic tools see I told you
they are a really really small one but
you can do pretty much anything any
shape any vector that you want to design
here now in the upcoming videos we are
gonna talk about what is the difference
between the web-based artboards and
iphone artboards and some of the advice
that I can give you that on what sheets
you should be designing what kind of
grid layouts and all of that but I think
this is a good start I hope it was a fun
video knowing about that now here's a
quick assignment for all of you if you
want to follow along with me just take
any pen or paper and just just when I
say it afterwards stop the video just
completed and didn't just write it on a
piece of paper just notice that here
that this is your first vector tool or
selection tool just press there's no
done that the shortcut is V for that
rectangle is all shortcut this is your a
clip ellipse tool this is e line tool is
L your pen tool is P your text tool is T
your artboard is a very very easy to
remember and your zoom is Z or Z so make
sure you write down them on some piece
of paper they are so smaller number you
can remember them and they're gonna save
tons of time to you so here is my advice
make sure you remember them by heart it
is really important so that's it I hope
you have enjoyed this video and we're
gonna catch up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
