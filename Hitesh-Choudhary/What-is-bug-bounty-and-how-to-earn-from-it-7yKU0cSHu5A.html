again with another interesting video
today we are going to answer the most
asked questions out there
what is bug bounty how can I learn to
hunt the bugs out there and can earn
money from it why do I get to placate s'
when I report the bugs instead why don't
the people out there don't just fix the
bugs instead of reporting the duplicates
if the bug was already reported
why don't they fix it and the most
important question how reliable is life
when you just do bug bounty hunting and
nothing else
stay tuned a lot of answers are about to
come taking first question what is bug
bounty okay so when you design an
application you just work on on a
business logic or how the data model is
going to rely how the UI interface is
going to rely and a tons of things like
that but while working on these things
sometimes some bugs or you can say some
security issues just are being left out
there not intentionally but randomly out
there because this is so much huge
gigantic application nobody can actually
talk about all the security issues so
that's why some bugs are left now what
is nowadays scenario a lot of people who
call themselves as a bug bounty hunter
or penetration tester or security
researchers they just try to analyze the
website they report them and they
sometime also expect that somebody is
going to pay for their work now let's be
clear on this subject how you're going
to earn from it then we are going to
talk about how we can learn to hunt the
bug bounties but first of all let's
start that should I expect money every
time when I report the bugs and my
answer would be no strictly no you
should not be expecting money out there
unless you are enrolled in some kind of
paid programs out there I'm going to
talk about them as well so first of all
when you are working as an independent
security researcher and you just report
some bugs out there don't expect that
the other third party person is going to
reply you politely out there why because
nobody is Facebook and Google or
gigantic website some websites are small
and some websites don't have the bug
bounty programs even out there they just
will take your reports and are going to
fix
issue and are going to say thank you and
that's actually what you are doing you
are simply allowing somebody that hey
this is insecure and you want that to be
secured
now some people do this bug bounty for a
living that's that's I would say that
it's a bad thing or it's a good thing it
just okay each thing now why now let's
come back on to the point again now when
you report bugs to the Google or
Facebook they do have a bug bounty
program and based on the severity of
your bug they're going to reward you
sometimes allows the t-shirt some time a
lousy Pendry or sometime some good
amounts like five hundred thousand
dollars or maybe even more depends on
the severity of the bug okay but not all
the websites are going to reply to you
in the same manner let's just say a
website has newly-born
got some funding and is presenting their
topics out there now if you report some
bugs out there now it depends totally on
them they can take it as a good thing
that yes you have gone ahead and
reported this bug and we want to avoid
you they can give you a lousy t-shirt
but sometimes they may they might not
have a such kind of penetration testing
programs they don't want you to test
their application right now so they can
take reverse action on you as well
it's totally dependent on them you have
nobody to talk about hey while you're
doing that no you cannot do that okay
and yes there are good ways by which you
can officially register on the website
and they show you that hey this this
this domain is for the testing go ahead
to whatever you can and just report the
bugs out there but don't share them on
the Facebook or make a publicity stunt
with them so that's good thing now you
might be saying hey Google is a big
website all the domains are out there
and we can just hunt for any of them no
that's not the case why I am saying that
because I've been on the both side of
the code he has a bug bounty hunter as a
developer as well so I can tell you all
the things out there okay so now that it
is really clear that not every website
is out there to hunt and to report the
bugs we are not going to get anything
for that so it's a time-based coming
back on to the programs like hacker
Earth or bug bounty or the bug crowd
comm are some of the website on which
you can get resist
there will be a list of the websites
some of them gives you a reward some of
them gives you a money some gives a
lousy t-shirt things like that so you
can just choose depends on your skill
and your past experience that what
website you are going to choose and we
are going to earn money from that that's
easy but another interesting question is
how can I learn to hunt the bugs out
there now that's an interesting question
we may make him full movie out there on
that but like right now let's just get
on to the basics okay if you want to
hunt the bugs first of all you should be
aware of the information security stat
it takes practice tactics you know
whatever you call that but you should be
aware of quite a lot of them now I'm not
talking about just the SQL injection
cross-site scripting CSRF and all these
stuffs you should be aware of quite a
lot of things now one great place in
fact two great place that are always do
recommend that you should get started is
dvwa dam venerable web application and
web goat now all of the experienced
hacker are going to shout at me and
gonna yell at me hey what I talking
these are so puny programs so
lightweight hey just wait because there
are big nur's are out there and I have
to talk about them as well so these are
the great programs by which you can
learn first of all go ahead on the ODA
blue asp web site o WS p dot org try to
understand how the bugs are working on
the web application then for the
practice dvwa and web goat is a great
place to get started don't just play
around on any web site that you found
out there it may be illegal and you can
land up in some troubles you know what
I'm saying behind the bars okay you got
that okay so now the two questions has
been answered how do you earn money from
it and how do you learn for a bug bounty
player now I'm gonna move on to the
different part of the code now I'm not
talking as a penetration tester I'm
talking as a developer I have been onto
a big scale development team and I know
what happens when you report a bug and a
bug submitted a bug is being submitted
out there and what
happens at the back end so let's talk
about them as well now a lot of people
report the bugs on to some great
websites first of all thank you for that
because you are trying to make a secure
world out there that's great but why
don't we fix the bugs just directly out
there no we cannot as a developer of
course we cannot why because I believe
somehow that if you are complaining so
much that why don't you fix the bug you
haven't touched the development even
from a 10 feet pull out there no you
haven't done that if you have been on
the development side you know it really
well that you cannot touch the code
directly just by going out there and
adding a function now it will break the
code and what's a good application if it
breaks while the users are using them
yes security is important but as much as
important but you know what's more
important the functioning of an
application application should be up and
running there can be security issues we
can fix them and it's good thing to fix
them but somehow it is equally important
to make sure that that application is
running and right now most of the codes
are modular you can just work out onto a
function but again we have to think a
lot about how the business logics is
going to go ahead and if we add the
security implementation how is it going
to affect the data fetching and how the
JSON requests and it tons of things
needs to be taken care so that's why
data planning is then again based on
that bug and how we can secure that bug
because right now the bugs are not just
the SQL injections or cross-site
scripting they are very severe bugs and
very complicated as well so it takes a
little bit while while you submit that
now again a lot of people ask me that I
am getting so much of the duplicates if
the bug is already being reported why
you are just making a duplicate out of
it now let me just be clear how the
functioning is working out there now
let's just say let's take CSR up the
cross-site request forgery vulnerability
you don't need to understand the
technicals out there but let's just say
you report that bug on to this domain
for this link a link and AB a link
obviously when it is being reported for
a link we are aware of that
vulnerability but if you report for the
B link as well you are going to get a
duplicate why you might be asking hey
that's for it
Lync no but the business logic how the
modular code is being designed once you
fix it on the ailing it's going to fix
on the B link as well so that is why you
get a duplicate and you're not going to
get paid or even get a lousy t-shirt for
that yep that's true and that's how the
industry works out there now if you ask
me how is the life as totally being a
bounty hunter I don't want to work I
just want to hunt the bugs for my
lifetime
ah are you sure about that I'm pretty
sure about that because as a bug bounty
hunter the life is not much secure I
have been onto that path I have reported
some of the bugs out there even when the
bug bounty programs were not there you
just got your name out there on the web
sites like Facebook so believe me life
as a bug bounty hunter as a starting
phase is really good you can take it as
a part time maybe you are working in a
company you just hunt a couple of bugs
on some legislate 200 500 dollars out
there that's okay but life is not much
reliable as a bug bounty hunter at the
end of the day try to just imagine what
you are doing for a company company has
already hired some of the security
specialists but let's just say five of
them but company wants to hire 500 of
them how they can do that just by simply
enrolling for a bug bounty program and
you know hundreds and hundreds of people
are going to test and make their
application secure and they don't have
to pay the salary as well just give them
a lousy t-shirt or maybe hundred dollars
and the work is done so that's why most
of the people who are experienced in the
bug bounties or in the security just
leave out the bug bounty things and they
get more into the development security
statics and stats designing of the data
models that's a good thing you should
move on it's a good place to get started
but you should not get stuck with that
obviously this talks this talks needs a
little bit more talk out there so for
shark more videos are going to come on
the bug boundary discussion stay tuned
more videos are going to come up and in
case you haven't yet subscribed to my
channel do subscribe share it so that
you can help your friends in getting the
bug bounties see you out there next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
