to the fresh series on sketch so I have
just finished up some of my clients work
which was a cold coding work it really
got me there and I just wanted to have
some free time with me so what's the
better way of having some free time and
utilize it by making some more videos
for you guys so in the upcoming few
video series we're gonna have some fun
with sketch design is something which is
so much fun for me I love designing the
icons and some of the app screens this
is like all the fun part for me so in
the upcoming few video series expect in
the upcoming videos that we will be
playing around with the sketch so let me
just open that up and without talking
further let's go ahead and have some fun
with sketch you're gonna be learning
some of the nice tricks on the sketch
and we'll be designing some of the
assets that all of you can use
absolutely for free this is all fun
stuff just to get started before we go
ahead this is the sketch website where
I'll be using the sketch it's a paid
product but I'm not promoting them at
all if you like that you can buy it but
it's a really industry's favorite so
this is the sketch app you'll be needing
that and yeah sadly it's only available
for the Mac guys only I will also be
using a plug-in by envision which is
craft I will not be using it much but
since its installed on my sketch I
thought a lot of you might be asking hey
what is that install so let me just take
that down first of all so it's gonna be
available at the top here you can just
turn on all the things and just it just
works like that so there we go that's it
so what we'll be doing in this
particular video in this particular
video I'll walk you through with couple
of good awesome icons and we're gonna
have so much fun with that okay so this
is going to be our screen and we'll be
designing all of this and notice the
craft is actually this only bar which
comes up here so how we're gonna proceed
we're gonna be designing these two icons
and you'll be learning some of the ins
and outs of the sketch some neat tricks
I have a lot of tricks and I am ready to
share it with you in case your top bar
doesn't look like me so what you can do
is you can right click and click on
customize toolbar let's just say you
tool your tool bar doesn't have this
rotate copies so you want to have it you
want to make your tool bar look like
exactly like me
so you can just take this rotate copies
find all the things that you need here
and you can just place it there there we
go that's it so you can pause the screen
right now here and can just make your
toolbar exactly like me I highly
recommend to have at least these Union
subtract interaction and intersect and
the difference I can here at the top
also rotate copies and rotate and
transform should be there all the time
apart from that there are keyboard
shortcuts so not a big deal so there's
this click on done so now let's just
proceed one by one we'll be taking out
these designs first of all this perfect
almost perfect heart and then we'll be
designing this full screen icon okay so
let's have an artboard first of all just
press a on your keyboard and there we go
we have an artboard and we will be
having an artboard so it's gonna be of
size 500 by 500 that's what I have here
now I'm gonna zoom it a little bit out
you can press command 1 to fit all of
that on your screen and I will be
placing it side-by-side so that we can
have it and just press Z on your
keyboard and have a zoom on these two
guys so that we just have these two
icons here okay creating icons in sketch
is the most amazing fun part so press R
on your keyboard to have a rectangle and
hold down your Shift key and we're gonna
have a nice square okay so probably
let's just go for something like you
know 300 by 300 so that's what we are
having I don't like the border so
uncheck the border at all and you can
have it just like in greyish just like
kind of a wire framing stuff now what
we'll be doing is after that we need a
circle so you can press o on your
keyboard and hold down your Shift key to
have a perfect circle instead of having
an oval and here's the neat trick part
first of all get rid of this border I
don't like them at all so your circle is
of width 300 so your circle should also
have the size of 300 by 300 obviously
it's a circle okay that's nice now we
will be making it a little bit darker so
that we can actually see it there we go
now what you can do is we are gonna
place this circle exactly so
that circles centreline matches with
this this rectangle here okay probably
can drag and drop a little bit down here
okay so there we go make sure your lines
are aligned so that we can have it and
there we go
okay so it's I think we need a little
bit bigger canvas here so let's just
select this canvas come on we can have
like a 700 by 700 little bit bigger okay
so now let's just select this artboard
and have a little bit more space here
there we go and I know but design always
goes like that sometime you just have
these stuff now let's just align that so
that center line just matches there
there we go so notice the circle and the
rectangle are a perfect match on the
center of the circle okay there we go
that's one part now hold down your
option key our Alt key whatever you call
that option key and drag and drop
another circle and just place it like
that okay notice that this is also being
aligned on to the center of the circle
here and this is also a line at the
center of the circle now just select all
of them all the three parts and you can
just click on Union and there we go now
we're gonna fill this up with something
a little bit nice red I think that is
good and then you can select this guy
click on the rotate and then you can
just rotate that like that and we want
exactly to be 45 degrees and there we go
hit escape and there we go your
beautiful icon is ready now since this
icon is actually pretty big I want it to
be a little bit short because I wanted
to have an artboard of 500 by 500 what I
can do is I can select this and first of
all I'm gonna say command G to group
that and command R to rename that and
I'm going to call this as hurt there we
go now I can click on this scale icon
and I can make it like probably like 80%
of that and there we go
no size entire everything is intact and
it's perfect now I can select my
artboard and make it like something 500
by 500
and this place this guy at the center
and just to place it Center you can
select that and then you have options to
make it Center is like you can select it
from here there we go and from here okay
looks nice
okay or probably I can just eyeball it a
little bit like that
okay so there we go nice and easy and
you can also shrink it down if you wish
just hold down your Shift key so that it
doesn't get distorted like that but
again okay there we go
your first icon is ready now let's go
ahead and move on to the second one let
me just select that and put that just
below here okay looks nice now we're
gonna go and move on to this icon this
icon is little bit tricky but I hope
it's not that much so we're gonna have
an artboard let's call an artboard a and
again we are gonna go like 500 by 500
500 there we go okay and now how do we
take down this kind of it's really a
complex thing but not much complex to
walk me along with so we're gonna press
R to have a rectangle there we go and
probably again 300 by 300 and there we
go so this is what we are having right
now okay looks nice and I'm gonna get
rid of this border I don't like that now
what I can do is I can press my option
key and I can have a copy of this and I
can rotate that to somewhat like 45
degrees there we go now make sure that
it is at the right center okay
notice the gridlines are here to help us
there we go now we can select both of
these icons or both of these shapes and
click on subtract there we go part one
is already done now let's hit the R key
again for a rectangle and we are gonna
have this bar here at the exact center
no borders you know I don't like them
and we're gonna have it now we are gonna
have a copy of it so here hold down your
option key
and click-and-drag now release your
mouse first and then your option key so
that you can have it and this guy is
gonna rotate to 90 degrees or yeah 90
degrees would be good so let's just get
a 90 there we go now we want to just
align it at a perfect center there we go
now what you want to do is you want to
select both of the shapes and we want a
union of this now what has happened just
these two bars are now just one shape
okay and now I can select this and I can
transform it to 45 degrees and there we
go it's done it's not like perfectly
just getting it there but I can increase
that at any point of time not at all a
big deal there we go so this is all done
looking pretty decent now what you can
do is press your R key and we are gonna
hold down your Shift key as well and
click and drag so we can have a circle
there probably a little bit bigger and
as you know we are gonna not gonna have
a border anytime now what you have to do
is make sure your circle this square is
selected and this shape of this is also
selected notice it's a combined shape of
X so that is also being selected and you
have to hit your subtract here and there
we go our shape is here now I can just
press my Z key and zoom it here so that
I can have it notice it's not aligned so
I can just keep on double-clicking and I
can just quickly oops
command Z I can just improve that shape
here and I'm gonna have it notice I am
double clicking to make it a vector and
I am just aligning it hit enter and now
we can do same thing here and make sure
you convert that into vector because
vectors are easier to play around and
there we go
fine twinning a little bit of that and
there we go we can do the same thing
here just like that just eyeballing it
could have done a better job in creating
these lines but anyways not at all a big
deal
and there we go and there we go and
that's it command one to have it here
and there we go looks pretty beautiful
now the best part is you can just select
your shape notice there is a combined
shape of this and this now we're gonna
select both of them and we are gonna hit
command G to group them together command
R and this is actually a full screen hit
enter and now I can just select this guy
and I can change colors a couple of
stuff like that so and I'm gonna fill
that up with something like blueish a
little bit like light like that I'm
gonna copy this color copy that and I'm
gonna fill that up with this guy
oops command Z and I'm gonna fill that
up here hit enter and there we go nice
and easy now I can combine this all of
that full screen and I can hold down my
shift key and increase the size of it
however I like there we go nice and easy
nice and easy so it was pretty quick to
design this full screen icon I like it a
lot
and at any point of time you think that
this is like too much of the square or
all these things you can just keep on
double-clicking on to it and can get
back into all of these things like
combined shape you can select your
rectangle you can move it a little bit
like that and this is gonna be all like
that so at any point of time you think
that this should be more take this
should be more thin you can always go
and work with that so that's pretty much
it so this is your two icons and in the
upcoming few videos I will be sharing
some kind of these tricks so that you
can have beautiful icons and that's
pretty much it
this is the fun we are gonna have for
next few videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
