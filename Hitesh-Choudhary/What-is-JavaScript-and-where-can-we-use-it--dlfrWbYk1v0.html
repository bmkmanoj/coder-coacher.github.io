JavaScript course now I'm a kind of a
person who always liked to get started
by installing the things in writing some
code I love that but this time
JavaScript requires a little bit of the
theoretical basics so that we can
understand what things we are learning
how powerful it is and where they can be
applied so we're gonna be answering
three base questions here first and
foremost what is JavaScript and where it
can be applied the second important
question is what's the difference
between Java and JavaScript and yes we
are still doing that question and the
third thing is what is this es6 es7 ACMA
script these are the terms which every
new beginners here is quite a lot but
don't even have a single thought about
what actually it means and why it is
being talked quite a lot with JavaScript
so first let's get started with
JavaScript now it amuses me a little bit
when I asked any experienced programmer
who has been working quite a lot but
haven't touched the JavaScript or hasn't
been involved in the JavaScript news
lately and he just says it's just a
client language client-side language and
although he is technically totally
correct but that's not it JavaScript can
be and is a lot more than what it used
to be javascript was designed simply to
run in browser but it is doing a lot
more than the time that you have the
memory of that now even the definition
on the Wikipedia is little bit vague and
honestly it's a little bit hard to
understand and it just says JavaScript
often abbreviated as JSL high-level
interpreted programming language and
further it says it is also characterized
by dynamic weekly type prototype-based
all these things are true but it doesn't
give you any sense of what javascript is
and what it can actually do now I do
completely agree here that javascript is
a client-side language and was totally
used in the browser for performing
variety of web based things in the past
but after that javascript has evolved a
lot now in the previous days if we had
to talk a little bit about the server
what we used to do is we wrapped our SQL
query we pack them into the PHP and
since PHP Python and Ruby are the
languages which are server-side
languages and only are capable to talk
to the server we used to wrap these
queries and send to the server and then
get a result back in the PHP engine
display that
onto the webpage now yes that's totally
true but now your JavaScript can do all
these things as well now the next
question that comes up is if I'll be
writing all these codes in JavaScript
and since javascript is a client-side
language and usually all of that code is
submitted to the client as well no it
doesn't javascript has evolved a lot
from the memory that you have now all of
your JavaScript code that you write it's
your choice totally that the weather
this code should reach to the
client-side or it should only serve onto
the server a quick example could be no
GS an entire web server framework or
entire thing which can handle all of
your server-side things and yes totally
in JavaScript so for that I have to give
you a little bit examples of what are
the capabilities of this JavaScript
first and foremost nodejs
like it's a entire thing entire package
which can deal up like everything in the
server-side you can write your queries
you can handle all the tasks that you
you were able to do in PHP or Ruby or
Python or anything other language it can
serve as a totally server-side language
as well and without a doubt I am pretty
sure that you might have heard about the
node.js and it's rising in its
popularity and that's just one thing so
if you'll ask me hey it can do like web
thing from the front side and back side
that's it no it's not
javascript is evolving a lot and you
might have heard about the project known
as react and using react Jas you can
design your application just one single
codebase and that can run on to a mobile
as well as an iOS Android web there is
react native too so it's it's popular
there of course we cannot deny the
popularity of angularjs your one
framework for mobile and desktop just
like almost react but few additional
things few bless things here and there
but again regardless of that you might
have heard about it and also the the
popular framework which is getting
really good popularity nowadays is
electron j/s again totally designed to
make desktop application in just HTML
CSS and JavaScript and it's gaining a
lot of popularity here and on top of
that Vijay is a beautiful progressive
JavaScript framework which can help you
to design beautiful and amazing
animations for the web totally in that
now just to extend the things on to much
for further level these two examples are
gonna give you extensive detail that how
javascript is gaining its popularity and
how is it becoming popular every single
day so notice the one here which says
react VR yes you can design your total
virtual reality experience in in simple
JavaScript and yes that is and also
recent announcement of the tensorflow
Jas proves the popularity of the
JavaScript that yes even the machine
learning tasks will soon be able to
perform in just JavaScript now as of now
we are totally relied on either Python
or R in machine learning but now it can
be JavaScript as well and very soon
you're gonna be seeing that and yes all
of this is totally possible in
JavaScript but not the JavaScript that
you have memories already have heard
about in those old books or maybe old
college curriculums javascript has
evolved a lot now this brings us to the
next question
which still we are doing is what's the
difference between JavaScript and Java
now this was probably the worst decision
the JavaScript ever made to name it
after Java and yes at that time of that
at that time of the Peter JavaScript
well Java was having a so much
popularity that it dominated and the
decision was so poor the language got
introduced in 1995 and still we are
making in its 2018 is almost gone and we
are still making the videos on Java
versus JavaScript the similarity is
similar to this example here what is the
similarity between a car and a carpet
yes
exactly no similarities at all apart
from the word car is included in the
carpet it doesn't have an engine carpet
doesn't have engine it doesn't have a
wheels or anything like that but still
car and carpet are similar in saying and
that's exactly what it is in Java and
JavaScript no similarity at all there is
no dependence of of Java into JavaScript
or JavaScript into Java it's probably
was the worst decision of naming it
after and from 1995 still we are making
videos and takes book and writing this
that hey there has nothing to do it at
all and probably for the next few years
we are going to be still doing it now
the next big question is what is es 6 or
8 my script
now this ACMA script
is kind of a standardization now in 1995
Netscape actually created the JavaScript
and on to where the sidebar here that
reminds me here is JavaScript is a
really old language in 1995 and that
time of period programmers were really
obsessed with naming everything after
coffee and that eventually came as
JavaScript it this project was actually
created on the name of mocha yes
programmers were so obsessed with naming
everything after coffee then it came on
to life script and then finally it got
changed into JavaScript so in 1995 the
Netscape actually started to working on
a project named it a JavaScript finally
and released that now after that soon
people realized that we need a
standardization over this language so
that not every browser can manipulate it
based on their needs so this European
computer manufacturer Association came
out and declared a standardization for
it
known as es won in 1997 and soon after
that the es - es 3 and all of that came
around and in 2009 or 10 ish es 5 came
up with a few good new features which
are map and for each and by the way I
just missed that I have actually
replicated in 2009 and 10 twice but it's
not so in 2009 in 10 the new features
like map and for each things came up at
initial level JavaScript didn't have the
concept of even the classes and objects
but now we have all of them so in 2015
ES 6 actually came up and in 2017 the es
7 came up and now already we are having
specs of ES 8 as well and there are a
lot of new features included now these
are the new features obviously but you
don't have to worry anything about them
at all the things that you're gonna be
learning in the JavaScript are
completely applicable obviously there
will be more version and that doesn't
means that the previous things are gonna
be gone no they are not it's just only
about adesh adding a few new features
that you can have in language and that's
pretty much it you all the language all
the things that you're gonna be learning
in this course are completely applicable
even to the newer version as well and
there will be just few new features that
you can pick up on the go and can work
with that
now also there is a good resource here
on to the github which you can find out
and can know about which browsers are
supporting which version of it and what
parameters and what options they are
searching for that this is totally for
the advanced users who have been
designing the web for a long time and
have to worry about a lot of things like
which browser support is gonna be there
or not
so this is a nice resource I found it
and you can just have a look at it
in case it doesn't really make sense to
you totally ignore it no problem at all
it has versions for es 5 and ES 6 like
what browsers are supported what are not
supported what features you can use what
you cannot but for the rest of people
just completely ignore that okay so this
is finally covered that these are the
basics that everybody should know with
what is JavaScript ES 6 Java where's the
JavaScript and all these things so
that's pretty much it in the next video
we're gonna be talking about with other
tools that we've required in order to
perform all the operations and the code
for this particular course and don't
worry I'm gonna give you enough options
so that you can just work around on any
computer at all so that's it and I'm
gonna surely catch you up in the next
