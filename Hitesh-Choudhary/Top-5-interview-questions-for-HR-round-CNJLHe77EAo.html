with another video and in this video we
are talking about the most famous HR
questions and the mindset to answer
those HR questions now first of all
let's get into the context here now
let's just assume you are preparing for
an interview here you have already
prepared for the skills that are
required in a company obviously that
company is working on Python maybe
JavaScript nodejs
angular or maybe anything else you have
already prepared for that if not he
should not be giving that interview
because what you'll be doing in that
company is working on these things may
be MySQL Python whatever that is so
first step is to prepare for that now I
have previously talked about the steps
like aptitude test and these coding
interviews and all of that but there is
one more essential interview which
usually happens in almost all of the
company is HR wrong now luckily for us
this HR round is pretty simple to crack
down and it's pretty easy especially for
programmers to just completely go
through with that but here is the
essential thing that everybody should
know if HR person says that this guy is
not at all a good fit that's it you are
out from the company regardless of how
much skills you are having or whatever
the things are if HR round or the HR guy
says nope that's a complete no so let's
talk about what should be the mindset of
the common HR questions that every
programmer in fact everybody should have
let's talk about that in this video
you've gotta step right into it
before I even begin with that here is my
tip number zero yes this is the most
essential thing first of all get all the
scariness out of your face because HR
guys have the ability to just pick up
the scariness right out of the face so
first of all get it in your mind that
this is not the last interview on the
planet and this is not the last job on
the planet
probably you will get it probably not so
don't worry about it there are plenty of
other jobs you can apply and everything
so just chill out relax and just be
yourself let's start with the tricky
questions that usually HR throws in
front of a candidate and I'll try to
give you basically the mindset of it the
goal here is not to give you exact line
by line words answer so that you can
just grab them the goal here is to give
the mindset that what you should have
while answering these questions so very
number one the tricky question is what
is your weakness
now obviously the HR guy is not
expecting you to say hey I just love to
get booze or I don't come on time office
these are not weaknesses these are the
things you should never tell to an HR
guy basically the mindset is how a
person can react when somebody is
pointing out your mistakes so obviously
you have to tell up a little bit kind of
a flaw in your life but not to make it a
flaw you have to come up with a very
clever idea so that you put up your flaw
but also make sure that it represents
simply a quality in itself as well
really really tricky to answer now I'm
not trying to fed you up with the
spoon-feeding here with those answers
but one good answer can be I concentrate
on one thing at a time now the problem
here is you're just concentrating on one
thing but that's also a good thing you
are very concentrated here so again this
can be one of the many answers that you
want to have but again the mindset
should be you are pointing out one
mistake but that is not a mistake that
is an advantage here next up is even
more trickier question reason behind
leaving your past job now of course I am
planning up to just do this particular
video for absolute beginners but
sometimes these questions are being
thrown up now the
people sometimes just answer that I want
an upgrade in salary this is the most
worst answer you can give never ever do
that it would be much better if you just
present something like I want to enhance
my skills I'm looking for better
opportunities in life this is a much
better answer as compared to saying that
hey I'm looking for more upgrades in the
salary and all these things yes of
course we know that most of people do
switch because of an upgrade in the
salary but HR guys don't like that so
please don't mention that next one is
probably the most asked question to me
and a lot of people just email me to
find a solution for that and the
question is why have you been unemployed
for a long time now there are a variety
of reasons that some people like to get
a gap or somehow they have got a gap in
their studies as well as getting onto
jobs sometimes you don't get job for a
year sometimes you are working on
something else family problems and your
health and all these things now the
worst thing that you can do is mention
that I was suffering from a health
problem HR guys don't want anybody in
their company who is weak now yes of
course that's a bad thing because
sometimes these health issues are not
under your control but remember this
that is a business going on and
everything for that HR guy is business
priority and HR don't want to hire
somebody who is facing some health
issues and probably can be a trouble for
the company later on so it's a good idea
not to mention your health problems now
in fact the better answer could be you
can simply say I have an draw I got
myself enrolled in some personality
development things or I was doing
freelancing work and all these things
usually the freelancing thing is much
more appreciated because HR guy knows
that you are not out of your form you
have been constantly doing the work that
for which they are hiring you so it's
always good to say I was doing some kind
of freelancing and I just wanted to work
with that well the most common thing in
any company that will be going on is
handling pressures because a lot of time
light wants to push you towards the
limit and they won't just work to be
done properly maybe much more faster so
obviously there is going to be a lot
more pressure on you so HR guys always
try to ask you tell me your ability
about working
under pressure now if you have
experienced in the past obviously you
can mention that I have already worked
in these situations I can handle myself
really nice and even my team so that
could be a really great answer but for
absolute beginners it can be a really
really tricky situation well the best
thing that you can answer here is I'll
try to keep myself calm I'll drink a
couple of glass of waters and we'll try
to do multitasking now this is not just
the only answer but this is the mindset
that you should be having it's really
the most trickiest question because this
is the situation which everybody faces
in the company and you'll be no
exception the fifth and the most
trickiest one of all of this what is
your expectation with this job
now obviously if you're gonna say that
hey I want to become a multi-millionaire
from this job nobody's going to believe
this and we'll it will automatically
show up that you haven't prepared for HR
interview round nobody is expecting you
to mention Monetary Fund's or monetary
advantage here although a lot of time
it's just a complete lie that most of
people are saying in this particular
question because obviously the
expectation is a good surgery and a
relief life this is all expectation but
you don't want to mention that in HR
round I have noticed if somebody says
that I want a personal development as
well as reliable future that is always a
good thing and makes a good impact on
the HR when somebody says I want a
stable future here that means you are
relying on the company and you are
totally being dependent on the company
this is the thing that HR guys love to
hear with all of these five questions I
would also like to mention one more
important thing here I am NOT a
professional HR neither do I have like
rock-solid things that I can just
present to you these are all my
experience and my thoughts that I wanted
to present to you now obviously if you
can interact with any HR honestly he or
she can also tell you much more detail
about the mindset that you should have
and of course I would recommend you to
get in touch with some guy like that
usually I have also noticed that the HR
people are really extra nice to the
programming guys because they do
understand that programmers are not like
too much talkative and too much
explainable guys they just like to work
on a computer so they do show extra
kindness to you
like to the marketing guys and all the
sales lead and all these persons so you
can get a little bit reliable on there
but again do notice here do take extra
interest in the HR interviews because if
HR interviews fails regardless of your
skills regardless of your salary offer
you're gonna get out of the company I
hope that these five questions and kind
of the answer to these five questions
have helped you quite a lot in
understanding the interview process and
all these things if you want me to make
more such videos do post down in the
comment section below that please make
