code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey you did everyone
with a sheer back again with another
video and in this video we are talking
about flutter so let's talk about
flutter again in case you haven't
watched the previous videos go ahead was
that I discussed a little bit detail
about installation if you are
comfortable with the installation as
well as creating your very first
boilerplate app that's fine we can move
further and what we're gonna do in this
video in this video we're gonna create a
stylish hello world app and it's not
just a basic text hello world I will
introduce some of the things in elements
so that we can upgrade some of our
knowledge here so let us get started one
thing that I wanted to point out is when
I restarted my computer today and I
tried to run flutter app I was tinkering
a little bit with the existing app I
didn't find my flutter command there so
I had to go into the desktop it was
already cloned on my desktop so I had to
export this path now I don't know what
is the reason behind that I had already
set my path when I checked my path
variable it was not there probably a
case only format guys because in Windows
there is no such issues so anyways
in case you are facing the same problem
go ahead export your path so that you
can have your flutter command and also
make sure that your app is up and
running this is the boilerplate app that
we talked about in the previous video
you can have a like one two three here
so make sure your emulator is up and
running and your basic app is also up
and running now let's talk about what we
are gonna do in this video so in this
video we are going to talk about flutter
widgets and in case you know flutter is
all about widgets and it's all about
widget inside the children inside the
children you'll get to know what I'm
talking about in a minute but this is
all what we are going to be talking so
the first thing that we'll be taking
down is the material component we will
be using a little bit of the materialist
design not much of the things like
drawer and all these fancy stuff just a
bit basics of it mostly the color scheme
and stuff and the next thing that we'll
be checking is the layout obviously one
of the pain in designing the native app
using Android and iOS is styling the
elements wherever we want that it
doesn't really stick there because there
are a lot of device sizes
this is the reason why react native and
obviously flutter is getting its
popularity because it's much more easier
here and they have focused a lot on that
one thing that we'll be dealing up today
is gonna be this column the
documentation is here for column that
how you can have the columns and
retarder properties available here so I
was drinking a little bit with the
column because for me it makes much more
sense if you just put everything as a
column because the device is designed in
such a way but also I highly recommend
to check out the column layout as well
and if you can just transform this
existing app into what we're gonna be
designing here into a row based that
would be pretty awesome and the last
thing that we'll be taking to hung is
obviously the text basic stuff text is
really the basic widget so this is the
all the things that we'll be doing now
we can fire up our vias code my BS code
is here and for some reason it is not
having my project opened up why why why
are doing this okay so what I can do is
I can drag and drop my app from my
desktop on here there we go
pretty easy quick stuff here so this is
our material app and also I do have my
terminal already running in case you
don't know how to run that make sure
your SDK is up and then you type go into
the folder first of all this my app
folder and then type flutter space run
pretty simple stuff you know and now
what we're gonna do is open up this guy
go into your lip folder and you'll find
a main dart and what we're gonna do is
just select everything and delete that
okay sounds a little bit scary but we're
gonna be writing everything from scratch
so that you can understand more things
here it would be really easy now your
entire focus should be on editor so
let's just have that and in order to
have it the first thing that you need to
do is you need to import your material
design and that is really easy with the
vias code I don't know if it is really
super easy with other editors as well
but what you can do is you can just type
import and can just type a few lines
like material and the first thing that
is going to pop up is this gonna be
flutters large material dart everything
is going to be a dart for
so this is the first thing that we are
gonna have let me zoom that a little bit
more I cannot zoom this more than this I
don't have real estate of the screens
here so the next thing that you'll be
always be doing is gonna be wide so void
main this is the first entry point of
your app and inside in here we do need
to pass on one thing and for some weird
reasons my tab is not working in the vs
code okay now it's working really
awesome so you can have a run app now
this takes a parameter for the app now
what kind of app you are designing in
this case we are choosing specially the
material design so that's why we are
going to be choosing that so we can
create an instance of the material app
by using new material app this is the
one I'm looking up for and in this new
material app and now first of all let me
put a call in there so that it really
stops complaining so material app and
now this has variety of property one is
home I'll talk about what this home is
this basically is a screen that will be
designing so I'll come back onto this
point and will remove this error
whatever that is so this is it this is
what we want to have in our main dart
now let's go and open this up now what I
want you to do is open up this folder
and inside the lib folder we're gonna be
creating and new folders right click on
it and click on new folder we're gonna
be calling it as pages and inside the
pages we are gonna have a new file and
this is the file you can call it as
whatever you like I'm gonna call this as
home underscore page dot dart of course
don't forget the extension extension is
super super important here okay
so we are having this let me just remove
this guy again so now we have two pages
one is main page and one is home page so
how we can focus on that now let's first
design the home page again we're gonna
be importing the material dart so there
we go
first thing is done now the interesting
part comes up which is in the dart
you'll be seeing we will be creating a
lot of classes the first class let's
just create that and we're gonna be
calling it as home page
and your class actually extends either
to widgets that are having state like in
our basic app we tap on a button and it
changes a state like 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 but some of
the widgets don't need to change their
state and they are known as stateless
widget so it's gonna extend to state
less widget this is the one and this is
going to be our basic class ok I hope
you get that come on and now let me just
show you one thing here which is really
funny kind of a funny for me not for you
so you will be overriding this and this
is kind of a boilerplate code that
you'll be writing quite a lot so you'll
have an override override and of course
it's neat so we start with at the rate
over right there we go and let me just
tell you this is the entire boilerplate
code which you can even create a like a
snippet or something or can just save it
somewhere and this is gonna be widget
and we are gonna be using a build and
then inside that we just say build
context context there you go and there
we go and new so this is up till here is
like a boilerplate code that you'll be
using quite a lot so you can even save
this kind of snippet in your sison file
if you're using atom or something and
whenever you create a class you can just
create click that you'll be doing all
the time at least this much of the stuff
okay now what we can do now here what
we're gonna do is we are gonna be
returning a widget from this of material
type so what I can do is I can return
new and I'll be returning from a
material this guy let me put a column
there now here comes the interesting
part everything inside the dart is kind
of a children of everything child inside
the child the thing I was talking about
now here it starts so material has
variety of childs as well as properties
first let's use a property which is
color and the color that we will be
using is gonna be color dot blue come on
give me blue dot blue I hope you can
give me a blue color why not let me try
that again
one more time so color
and colors of course dot blue can give
me there we go so finally it has given
me and make sure you put a comma there
okay so this is the fun stuff and we
have now got a color blue we're using a
material designs of blue will be
selected as material ish blue you'll get
to know what I'm saying in a minute now
what we can do is we can go back onto
this main door tart import this file and
can mention that this is my first home
screen okay let me just import that
import dot slash pages
I forgot what is it home page start
pages slash home underscore page dot
dart and once you have imported that
properly save the file first and then
you can create an instance of this home
page you can have multiple pages but
this is going to be able home page so
whenever the user first with it this is
gonna be our new and we're gonna say
home page so we are creating a new
object of this and save that so this is
what we have done so far I know this is
a long video but we are trying to
understand every bit and piece of code
now go back onto a terminal and hit
shift and art not just our shift and our
because we want to fully restart our app
and there we go your material ish blue
color there is a couple of there are a
lot of other colors that you can play
around for example come on for example
there is one this blue accent I like
this one as well but I like the darker
shade of the blue a little bit more this
is like a little bit lighter no there's
not even a much difference there so
there are a lot of colors look into the
documentation that you want to go I'm
gonna go with the blue okay so this is
like the basic part save all of these
things and make sure you hit a restart
of your app to make sure that the
changes are taking place now coming back
onto the stuff what are the other
properties or the children's that we can
play around with
so let's import the child here so this
is how the children's look like you'll
have some time child sometimes
children's if they're like I'll show you
what it means first of all we are going
to have a child
so now what we're gonna have is in order
to have this axis and all these columns
what you need to do is you have to
provide an inkwell okay and this is the
one I'm looking for ink well okay now
what we are having is this inkwell so
let me have this like this there we go
your inkwell is here now you can hit an
enter onto this inkwell and now you can
provide a couple of properties now
further in this inkwell you can have one
more child there you go and this child
is now going to be your layout remember
the rows and column yes exactly so we're
gonna have a new and column there you go
so this is your further now go back
inside further the column and this
column can also have child but since
this is a column that means you'll be
stacking a lot of values inside it that
means it's gonna take a lot of widgets
maybe text maybe images and all of that
that is why column layout doesn't have a
child it has a children and it takes a
lot of children separated by comma in
kind of an array stuff okay so I'm gonna
hit enter again and how you can provide
your widgets I know it is like quite a
lot of child inside child but this is
how this is designed so you can pass on
a new text here so we're gonna say new
text widget and then you can pass on a
data so we're gonna say hello world
finally and there you go who kind of a
lot of things that we are doing here
doesn't it so let's just save that and
why my inkwell is giving me all these
errors probably because I forgot to have
some comma or something and okay so Inc
will looks like when tap okay so there
is just a hint here come on don't do
that
that is nice actually I loved it I loved
it that how the way that all the details
are being shown to me so anyways let's
just save that and see if we are gonna
get some errors or not probably I would
like to have a comma here okay let's
just save that and
go back and hit a shift reload and we
are having a few errors probably yep we
are having a few errors let's just see
how we can fix those errors so I think
these errors are because of this child
and let's just see how we can fix them
up and we forgot to use a new here
I forgot that so it's basically an
instance I think now it is happy let's
just hit a shift in R and come on you
can reload that quickly come on you can
do that and there we go
notice the hello world at the very top
of the bar and yes this is how the
column stack layout is going to work so
there we go that's your first hello
world but it doesn't really look
beautiful so we are gonna move this
hello world at the center now in order
to move it into the center notice we are
using a column stack and we are
providing some children's to that apart
from the children you can use some
properties as well so most of the
elements which you're gonna create are
gonna have some properties and some
children so one of the property is main
access alignment and what you can do is
you can simply say main access alignment
okay come on
like this main access alignment and you
can use a dot Center to move that at the
center hot reloading please and there we
go so this is your first teeny tiny
hello world let's make it a little bit
more beautiful and how you can do that
now separated by comma on this text
element you can have one more kind of
the property I don't know what you want
to call that if it would be react native
I would be calling it as props but this
is the more property you can have a
style now in this style notice again we
are going to have a text style come on
give me text style and there we go
textile and again I forget this quite a
lot you always have to use new here this
is a little bit weird for me but again
we all are adopting towards letter right
now so there you go so this is your new
textile and inside that you can have
tons of properties similar to what you
have in your
CSS kind of it's tough so we're gonna
have first of all a color the color I'll
be using is gonna be colors colors dot
white I'm gonna go for that
scroll me for a little bit and we're
gonna bump the font size as well font
size too
come on give me some space font size to
let's just say maybe 30 point-0 again
though this floats need to be used here
so this should be all good and let's
just hot reloading please and there we
go
your first beautiful hello world I would
like to have one more widget here
because notice your widgets can have a
comma separated stuff so he can just
come back at the bottom here and you can
have a new text and since we are using
the column stack everything is gonna be
stacked like in the top and bottom
manner I hope you get that so then we
can say too much children okay here we
go there we go and now we can just copy
some of the styles so style new text
style come on give me textile text style
come on you can give me that at the top
okay and we are going to be choosing a
color property and I'm gonna be using
colors dot maybe okay what weird color
can I choose probably white again it
looks good and white thirty what is that
I don't know so this is the white and
we're gonna bump the font size as well
to font size to maybe 20 point zero
there we go and I'll put a comma here as
well for just for housekeeping purposes
and again we can go back here hot reload
please and we can see that how the world
to my children so I hope you have
understood that how the things are
working it's gonna be almost similar
syntax you're gonna have properties
inside properties and columns and all of
these things it looks a little bit
Messier at first but I think eventually
we all are gonna get friendly with that
