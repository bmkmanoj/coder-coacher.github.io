bootstrap full training now you have
completed in two zero one section and
basically there was nothing much that we
did in the section one but arranging our
tools is always a good idea so now we
have a little bit familiarity with the
atom as well as some family tea how the
structure should look like and this is
by the way the very basic structure like
CSS goes in the CSS folder jeaious goes
in gs folder images goes in its separate
folder but we learn all of these in the
project now right now I have created a
new folder 0 2 which is empty and I'll
be throwing up all of my files in here
now there is no specific reason while
I'll be just throwing all the files just
because we are just learning the things
we are not into the production
environment ok so I won't be following
the folder structure in here okay so
let's open up our 0 2 in our add term
and by the way where is my atom there we
go this is our atom and I'll be opening
up a file in here let's open the
directory structure there on the dextra
bootstrap 4 in the 0 to and I'll be just
throwing every file in here so I'll
create a new file and I'll save that and
I'll call that simply let's just call it
as text dot HTML because we are talking
about the text or typography at the very
first save that and I'll paste in all of
the boilerplate code that we have
created in the previous section in case
you are wondering how that magically
appears I actually already took that in
my clipboard and I saved that and paste
that okay now obviously this is not a
good practice if I'll just save the
things and go back in here on to the
browser again and show you the things no
it's not a good so what I'll be doing in
this entire thing is let's just ship
this to the right side and now we can do
a side by side comparison of what things
are looking and how the things should be
looking okay and let me expand this a
little bit how much is possible ok that
is good now let's talk about the h1 now
just like you have seen the h1 in here
and you can see there are some
predefined stylings being applied in
here we could have applied the same
things for the h2 h3 and you might have
guessed Tilda at 6 so let's just do that
quickly
for the h2 we're gonna have some lorem
off let's just say five again so this is
a rech to save that and we haven't
loaded our live server that is why it's
not reloading again package load start
live server and there we go
why is it not loading up okay text HTML
so we have to tell it that hey go into
text dot HTML okay there we go okay
sometimes these things happen if I would
have saved it with the index dot HTML it
would have been much better now I can
just replicate it or one more time and I
can show you that how the h3 looks like
and there we go by the way I'm pressing
my command key to duplicate my cursor to
quickly show these things now the first
guy is actually the big one we already
know that and it's actually 40 pixels
that it's consuming in the h1 and
similarly for h2 it uses 32 pixels in h3
to users 28 pixels in h4 it uses 24
pixels in h5 it uses 20 pixels and in
that 6 it uses 16 pixels but again these
things are not much of worry for us
because obviously we would be modifying
a lot of them with the CSS and obviously
h6 can look like for h1 and hecha one
can look like 4 at 6 no big deal in here
so nothing much specific for the
typography as as of now now one thing
that might give you a strange thing in
here is simply the paragraph so let's
just say if we have some text in the
paragraph let's just say too many words
in here save that and notice our
paragraph goes in here and if I can find
my word wrap toggle soft word wrap okay
that is much better so now do we have a
word wrap so that we can see everything
in here as I save this notice this is
our paragraph in here now surprisingly
as I thought as I told you that we have
a lot of built-in classes that we can
use and to your surprise there is again
a class that you can use and the class
name is h1 now this is going to be
surprising now the paragraph will look
like simply h1 tag there you go exactly
the same that we have gotten here so
these are classes are new in the
trap for they were not in the bootstrap
3 but in case you are just directly
getting started with bootstrap for this
might caught you with surprise similarly
we have got edge 3 as well and maybe
some for reason you might want to change
your paragraph to the entire you just
have to add a class and there you go you
can do that so this is quite fancy but
yep these things does exist now there
are a couple of more classes that will
be playing in around and bootstrap is
all about knowing all these classes this
is also known as text muted and if I
save that and go in here notice this is
less black or I'll call it gray that we
do have in here
okay now apart from this sometimes maybe
some time you might want to go very
bigger than h1 and you don't want to
play around custom styling of the things
and all these things then bootstrap
gives you another option let's just go
with this h3 maybe for some crazy
reasons you want your h3 to look much
more bigger than the h1 as well so there
is an option now as display - one if I
save this go back in here now this looks
very bigger than the h1 so there we go
we have just like a display one display
to display 3 and display for everyone is
subsequently a little bit smaller than
each guy so if I just give a display for
this is much smaller than the display
one but yes just to let you know that
yep at these guy does exist now coming
back onto the paragraph just like we
have got text muted we have got a text
lead as well and that this basically
looks like a leading text you might want
to use them in some kind of a preview of
your blog post maybe maybe not so this
is all what we have now apart from that
we have got a few other things which
might or might not be that much useful
so for example there are things like if
you want to highlight something then
there is an option of using a tag off
mark there and if I go back in here and
give it a mark and I need to close that
save that if I go back this is how the
things looks like when they are marked
and just like that we have got other
simple stuff is there as well like
delete
for de l we have got a strong tag we
have got a Memphis's tag so these are
pretty common you might have already
seen them in your HTML training
somewhere and now let's go back on to
something in trusting maybe maybe you
want to have some black coats maybe have
got a testimonial from there or some
learnings of the famous person that you
want to use then block codes come into
the road so let me just show you how the
block codes look like and they are
pretty much easy let me just copy and
paste the block code in here so
basically it uses a tag of block code it
has a class of block code and we'll talk
about these classes later on mb0 news
and all these things later on right now
let me just save that and go in here and
this is how your block code looks like
now obviously it is very very hard to
see but let me try to zoom in here that
there is a small grey line in here that
is very very hard to visible I don't
know maybe that's not even recording in
the things but yes just to show you that
it is there now let me just go in here
and now I'll do something crazy that we
don't want to talk I'll create a new
division in here and I'll call this as
container hit that and I'll move this
division to the end of the block code
save that and now it's far more easier
to see this coated line now we will talk
about the containers later on right now
just assume again this is some pre-built
classes in the bootstrap that I'm using
in here and this makes every division
give it some padding's and all these
things so now it's far more easier to
see this block code okay and this block
code is now helping us now let me just
also get in here and just after the
paragraph I want to say that hey it's
being written by some famous person okay
so in that case you can use the footer
of some person so let me just get a
footer there and let's just call this as
footer hit the tab key that closes me
footer and I'll call this as a John Doe
and there we go if I save this notice
it's not can it do anything because why
why is that because we haven't to use
the classes we have to use a class
always for the bootstrap it's all about
class
and the clothes that we need is black
coat
- footer save that and go back in here
notice it added a little bit - there and
now it looks much much more much more
awesome now just like we have got a
class of black coat we can actually
reverse that we have got a class of
black coat - reverse save that and and
basically I use this guy but you may use
the other one as well it just moves
everything to the right hand side and if
you don't like it any time just delete
that and you're back to your left hand
side orientation there okay so these are
a few quick examples how to play around
with the text and some of you might be
wondering hey these are so many classes
how am I gonna learn all these things by
the way you are learning them right now
and obviously all these things come with
the practice when we will be walking you
through with the projects everything
will become breeze so don't worry about
anything too much worrying is always not
a good idea just walking with me
practice all these curves and I'm pretty
sure I give you a guarantee that in the
project section everything will clear up
now let's go ahead and move on and talk
a little bit more about these text tags
and all these things in the next video
