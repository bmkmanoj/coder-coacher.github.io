JavaScript code now let's move further
and before we move further let me just
walk you through where we are right now
now you have a couple of features and
you have understanding about what is
arrays we have talked about them quite a
lot in our 0 to basics and you also know
what is a function and how it is being
defined now this is the perfect time
where we can move on and talk about few
things which are left deliberately in
the array section so that I can cover
them after we have discussed about these
functions ok and we're gonna be creating
a simple application as well so let's
just create a new file and I'm gonna
call this file as simply trello dot yes
I hope many of you are aware about the
Trello it's a simple to-do application
but a little bit more my friendly one
hand I just love it I use it a lot so
there we go
so let's just say we are gonna be
defining a simple Const of days and
we're gonna have some days in here so
we're gonna have our Monday then we are
gonna have to za then we are gonna have
our a witness day and we're gonna have
Thursday and we are gonna have Friday
and Saturday let's just have set no
Sunday sat ok so no Sunday is there now
what we want to do is we want that
somehow we have already learned in the
arrays that if you want to access any
one of that element we can simply log
that and we can use our days and we can
mention just like 0th or the first
element which is gonna be Monday what
happens if we want to access all of them
just assume that all of these are stored
on some website or some database or some
array and we want to access all of them
to display on our website now here comes
the concept of looping now you will be
hearing a lot about the looping
specially for loop and all of that but I
just want to talk about here just one
loop which will be working throughout
like your entire JavaScript and
especially with the introduction to some
things like react and angular this loop
has become like the most favorite
favorite choice for everyone so how does
this loop work it's really simple
we're gonna have simple days and for the
days just like we have length
we have something known as four each and
as soon as I have a fall each notice
here you can have a callback FN this is
called back function and then you can do
whatever you like to have this function
so a function that accepts up to three
argument for each calls and we are going
to talk about that later first of all
the important point is here it can
accept any function whatever you like to
have okay so how we can do that
just like here we have declared a simple
function just like this one let's just
copy this and paste that and we're gonna
be declaring that at the top there we go
so now we have a say hello function we
just simply say is and we will edit that
a little bit we don't want that in fact
we don't need this entire line we just
want to prove the concept that yes it
accepts our functions and can perform so
what happens if I just pass on any
function like this say hello save that
and let's just open our control our
terminal and try to run this so we're
gonna simply say node and the file name
is Trello yes so there we go so notice
we have got this greeting message for a
number of times if I check it explicitly
it's one two three four five six okay
there we go that's nice and this one is
coming up from this council log here
okay and notice we have one two three
four five and six yes so six times this
has looped through so we are one thing
for sure that this for each actually
goes through this each array and just do
whatever you want to ask exactly for the
array length which is six times in this
particular case for your case it may be
three times okay so that is all cleared
up now how we can take advantage of this
right now we are just passing a function
name but there can be a better way of
doing this thing so we can just remove
this and usually you will rarely find
that somebody is declaring a function
outside and using it using in these
cases we use something known as callback
means we use a function which doesn't
have any name okay so let me just see
come and see that so here we can see
that our function has a name what
happens if this functions don't have a
name
then this exact syntax can be passed on
in place up here okay so let me just do
that we're gonna just cut that from here
and we're gonna place that here there we
go
so this is completely acceptable yes it
is so what you can do is can I run this
yes of course
so let me just open that terminal clear
up everything and run that again notice
it's working fine absolutely but this is
not the goal the goal is since you can
pass on an entire function either by
name or just in this manner without name
function called as callback what you
have is you can have access of couple of
things here now first of all what you
can do is just like we have got a days
here you can simply named it as day now
here is a tricky thing which a lot of
people get confused notice first of all
we just have a day here and we just want
to print what is inside the day so
instead of this greeting message being
printed out every single time we just
want to say hey what is inside this day
and to be honest where this day is
coming up from that's a good question
but first let's run this file and
explore a few things so when I run this
file notice Monday is being printed two
times because of this one at line number
four but Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday Friday Saturday okay that is
fine so we have noticed that we have a
parameter here in the function which is
actually each individual area element
that we can printed but do I always have
to name it like that if it is calling
VRS days this should be called as day
now this is a usual practice but you
don't need to do it always you can
simply say something like a tiger and
just for the fun and you can name it as
Tiger here as well
so feel free to just name it anything
but whatever you are naming it here you
have to use it in here as well in the
line number line and just to prove my
point I can just run this file again and
I'm gonna get exact same result okay so
now that is clear totally that how we
can have it now we do have these
parameters here but again we have one
more parameter as well
which is known as index so notice we are
dealing up with this area here so that
is why these areas are also coming up
with their position as well
and usually the array index starts from
zero not usually always starts from zero
so what we can do is we can name these
days here as well so let's do some of
the trick stuff we're gonna call back
whenever we want to do trick stuff we
use to call these article guys okay so
we're gonna call something like this as
day or starts something like that you
get that starts with and then we are
gonna have a dollar sign and these guys
and we are going to use some dashes here
and then a dollar sign again it's really
hard sometimes to come up with these
examples so what we're gonna say is
we're gonna be simply using an index
here and we're gonna simply say index
plus one so it starts from actually one
we don't want to see zero and we are
gonna simply say our tiger here
I know Tiger is a really bad word I
would like to go with back with day that
makes much more sense Tiger is not
something I would like to use so there
we go so what we have done here is we
have used the index and we have added
one here so that we can have something
like starts with one and Monday starts
with two at Tuesday something like that
and let's just open this again clear the
screen and run that so there we go
now we have got one two three four five
I know this is a little bit weird
example saying starts with and then but
you got the point now always and always
remember one thing here before we wraps
up this video is well whatever the first
element is going to be it's gonna be the
element itself in the array remember
that and the second parameter is gonna
be index of that element I repeat that
again the first element is always going
to be the element itself in the array
and the second element is always going
to be the index value of it now whether
you add one to it or not it's totally
optional and completely on to you but
this is something that you should always
keep in mind so now that we have created
a simple kind of a trigger for days of
the things I would give you two simple
assignment create a simple for each loop
and create a new array where you can
have a loop over the entire
months of the year January February and
just like that so this is assignment
number one and assign now assignment
number two is gonna be simply just look
out a little bit and figure out if you
can create somehow a to-do list
you have future dues in your array and
you can just loop through them
so these are like simple real assignment
that you should really do I don't think
there should be any problem in doing
these assignments and of course I'm not
gonna be giving you solution of this if
you really require a solution for even
these kinds of simple stuff I highly
recommend to watch the previous videos I
hope everybody will be able to do it so
that's it for this video and I'm gonna
catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
