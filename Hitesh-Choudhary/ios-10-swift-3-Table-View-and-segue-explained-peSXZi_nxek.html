iOS 10 one of the video of them and
we're going to talk about iOS 10 now
whenever a bigness starts the coding and
designing the iOS apps there are two
nightmares for him at the bigness stage
the number one is the implementation of
the table views number two how we can
pass on data or maybe properties from
one segue to another or simply saying
one file to another in an iOS app now I
won't be going into the much details
about the code data and stuff because
it's obviously understandable that how
the data is being transferred from code
data to all of the files out there but
it's really important to understand at a
business perspective that how the data
actually travels in the files without
the code data so what we're going to do
we are going to implement the table view
and after watching this movie you will
never ever face any problem in
implementation of the table views with
my tricks of course and we will be
learning how the data or property is
moved from one segue to another one so
it's gonna be pretty cool let's get
started
and what do you need to do for that
follow along with me it's as simple so
let's create an Xcode project and
obviously it's going to be single View
application project first of all and
let's call it as table our test table
test table demo whatever you like to
call it we won't be using code data for
that so you can just check it off and
wrestle things looks good make sure the
language is Swift we're going to work in
the Swift three for iOS 10 of course you
know that coming okay now let's change
this guy to iPhone seven first of all
and let's get it here utilize the full
real estate out there we have a shortage
of real estate on the screen but let's
just worry about that okay so main
storyboard here comes the main
storyboard looks good
now let's implement the table view first
of all because I know it's a light
mirror and actually table V is so simple
but I don't know why a lot of people
take it too far to just implement it so
let me just show you the trick so oops
I need to learn how to type
I know okay just put it out there
anywhere and I've seen a lot of people
just dragging and dropping these things
to make it fullscreen and out there
that's a bad way to do the things in
fact not the efficient way it is good
way but it's not efficient so always go
on to this back panel out there which
says pin I know why but all you can do
is just zero zero zero and zero all the
way just pin it to all sides equally and
we don't want constraint margins out
there so I want it to be fullscreen add
four constraints that's update our
frames and there we go and I think it's
a it's a good point to just run our app
so I'll just save that first of all I
would like to build that now I do have a
habit to build my app randomly just here
and there just like ice I hit the
command s I hit the command B as well
quite a lot in fact when I do web
development as well as some time to hit
that so it's deep into me you can say
that okay somewhere our app is running I
don't know where here it is let me bring
it here and we can see that the table
view is there so pretty nice okay now
let's just adjust the code part out
there so what we're gonna do first of
all let's get rid of this did receive
memory warning function because things
what we are doing here are not that much
it wants to utilize that function
although it's a bad idea to get rid of
that but let's just say I did that hold
down the control key drag and drop this
guy and we need an outlet I'm gonna call
this outlet as table view and like that
looks good okay now here comes the
interesting part where a lot of people
get confused so I'm going to go back
here and view controller okay now first
of all before we actually get into the
details let me just remind you again
this is not a big nerd movie you should
be quite into the iOS development maybe
at least designing one app hello world
and then after you can move on okay so
first of all what you need to do is just
have your table view and call the data
source for that as self this is really
important because it helps you a lot
later on so table view dot delegate is
also going to be self but right now we
do have a problem and that problem is
really simple
we haven't assigned the protocols that
says that this is going to be a table
view now let's just do that first of all
and just remember this one thing and
everything will just fall again after
that so just remember you have to
introduce two protocols and these are UI
a simple table view delegate and
datasource what we have written here so
let's just call them you a table view
delegate order doesn't really matter
here so UI tableview datasource where
are you buddy view datasource
there you are okay and obviously it's
gonna complain to you let's just save
that and build that so that the problem
lies here and we have a problem here as
well and why is that and I think it's
making problem it should UI tableview
delegate and I think it's making a
problem we'll see that in a minute but
right now what I want to show you is how
we can actually utilize the error in
advantage to us to remember what are the
new functions that we need to call if we
are introducing this protocol okay so it
says cannot assign value of type view
controller to the type UI table view
delegate okay so you cannot do that okay
why you cannot do that let me just
oops command X to cut this and let's
just bring viewdidload
and save that okay so you need to okay
it's making a still problem to me I
don't know why and we do have no no
spacing problems let's just see if it
suggests this or not
yep it's suggesting me I think it's good
okay let's just implement the rest of
the function so go into suddenly tsk on
suddenly tis gone let me build that
again okay it comes back so let's go
into the problem area where we can find
the problems and look at these problems
so let's just expand this and we can see
that there are two functions
which are required here and is asking
for that and it's simply saying that you
simply need to just have these functions
if you are introducing the table views
so how we can do that now notice the
name here is number of rows in section
and the next one is cell for row at what
are these function let me first get them
and then I'll I'll show you that what
actually these are gonna mean so first
of all is going to be number of rows in
sections so number and make sure when
you type number of rows in section the
one that pops up is actually not the one
you are looking for because it doesn't
say table view and just below the bottom
one which says table view this is the
one we are looking for I just hit the
enter I'll come back to this code part
in a minute and the second function that
we are looking for is cell for row at so
cell 4 and notice this time it says that
he will be that's good so there we go
ok looks good now this error is actually
gone but this is still there let's just
see cannot assign value of type view
controller to type UI tableview delegate
okay you cannot do that okay because UI
tab bar delegate I introduced the wrong
function these things happens these
problems are actually a part of
development and in case you don't like
that you will not be succeeded in the
development that's pretty obvious so we
are looking for a stable view delegate
and I think everywhere everything should
be good now command B and we do have two
problem which were expected believe me
or not because we haven't actually
returned anything now let's get a couple
of room out there okay so now this guy
actually says I expect you to return me
an integer now what is this integer this
integer is simply the number of rows in
the table that you want one two three
four whatever you like to have let's
just have I think we can have maybe
twelve now that's a random guess you can
have a million there no problem at all
Apple is going to handle that for us but
this guy is little bit tricky let's see
command B I do it quite often now this
guy
I want an object a return type of object
of uitableviewcell
anyone can tell that this is not a
default data type with a little bit of
swift knowledge and obviously so this is
kind of a class and you need to create
an object for that so let's just call
this let's sell equals to UI table view
cell this is the guy we are looking for
and there we go we have created in the
object for that this is good now let's
just return this now y2 enters because
I'm going to put something there so
returns cell save that build that error
is gone okay what did we learn so far we
learned that when we introduced the
table views there are two things that we
need to remember the datasource and the
delegate once you actually implement
these of the table view of course then
you will be prompted with two errors
because you haven't specified how many
rows you want and what you want inside
each row the first function is
responsible for how many rows should be
inside the func inside the table view
the second guy is responsible for what I
should put in each of those sill now
right now for me every cell is equal so
what I'm going to say that cell dot it
has a lot of properties and one of them
is the text label so what you would to
put into the text label I want to put a
simple text inside that and that can be
I would be calling let's just say I
would call Thor okay that was not you
didn't see that coming okay so this is
good now I'm saying I need 12 rows and
inside the label or the text of each of
those cell should be Thor that's good
good for start actually so let's just
save that build that again and I think I
could have just pressed the run it could
have built that again but I did that
okay it's up and running it's up and
running
mm-hmm come on simulator you can do that
here you are and notice there are a lot
of Thor but
you look at the Avenger sheet out there
there was just one tour so this is not
gonna work but remember we have learned
how we can implement the table views and
put some data into that let's let's get
we're just getting started out here okay
so I'm pretty impressed by the Avengers
so let's just call that I'm declaring an
array of Avengers and in fact I was just
watching The Avengers it's really
marvelous series of the cartoons out
there movies is just ok so let's have a
lot of people out there of course first
one is gonna be the Thor and Thor is
always fighting with the Hulk so let's
just say we got Hulk as well now what
else we can have how can I forget
Ironman and Ironman is there who else
now we do have Captain America favorite
one who else we can put it out there
let's just say Natasha
or Black Widow ok so let's just say oops
I need to remember how to learn the
black how to spell the black and I guess
I need to learn how to spell a lot of
things ok I think this is good now what
is my goal here is I want to just grab
everything from the Avengers and want to
print out them on each line off my table
ok good enough so instead of just giving
it 12 I want to just go it on the go I
want to say just calculate yourself what
is the count of the Avenger Aries so how
can I do that you might have seen that
coming dot count and there we go now
it's automatically going to count the
number of rows that it needs to create
for us it's gonna be doing automatically
ok that is good now how can I found out
that the first guy should be the Tor and
second guy should be the Hulk and for
that we do have a good guy here known as
index path so what we can do here is
simply let me just get here and I'll be
just printing out index path dot row now
you'll be seeing this guy a lot
and what I want to show you here by
running this that this index path is
actually keeping the track of every rose
out there so let's just run this and
verify that if I'm correct you know I
wish I am correct I'm just wishing for
that okay we cannot see anything out
there right now but let me just bring
this guy up and here we go 0 1 2 3 4 so
although it's just the tour but remember
that the Falls being printing so my
point is being verified that this index
path dot row keeps the track of every
row out there now what I can do is
instead of just saying tour I can say
just grab the Avengers out there
Avengers but I want you to index the
index path dot row ok there you go
so after verification I can simply build
that again to get rid of that error
nasty error and let's just run this if
we are doing that ok where are you here
we go
no problem at all so Thor is there Hulk
is there added man is there Captain
America and Black Widow is there as well
ok so point taken
let's just summarize quickly I know this
video is getting wrong getting very long
over 40 minutes now 15 minutes actually
but just let's just focus again what we
have learned we have dragged and drop a
table view we have connected that from
the coding part we have also gone ahead
and try to just pulled out the data from
a array we have learned how we can just
put only those number of counts out
there just this guy I'm talking here
Avenger count so we learn how we can
just implement only those number of rows
which we require nothing else and
thereafter we have learned how we can
just implement these guys ok so I think
the table view is done for us now let's
just look out for a couple of other
function as well ok so let's go to the
main storyboard I know this is getting a
little bit long for you but stay with me
stay with me
okay now let's bring another view
controller out there there we go a
simple view controller and I think I can
change the color for this and what we
can do is I think this is too bright
this is good okay so I'm changing the
color here and I'll be just putting a
label here just for the demonstration
aren't there or let's just say let's put
it out there Center and I think I can
say oh let's just say Who am I
because I'm gonna just pulling the data
from this table view and I'll be putting
that here so color can be white okay no
big deal font can be little bit long or
bigger in size and let's just update
some of the constants to it so that it
looks good okay or in fact I can do just
a stack view here and horizontally and
vertically in the container I think
that's good for right now okay looks
good now for just a moment let me put
this arrow here and just to make sure
that this looks good on the screen let
me build and run this so that I can test
my next view controller is good just for
that I don't do that usually let's just
see if the screen is pulling up good or
or not maybe and this arrow by the way
is responsible for your first screen
this is kind of a start point for your
application there we go where my is good
okay let's put this guy back out here
because this is our starting point of
the screen okay good so far now what we
want to do we don't have any file for
this view controller it's just looking
for the original view controller so
let's just create a new file for it
file new we want a new file iOS cocoa
touch of course and let's just call this
as second view controller you can call
it anything make sure that the subclass
is of UI view controller it's very
important okay and let's just create
this
okay this is not done yet because you
need to actually make sure that this guy
knows about our new file so click on
this view controller go to this identity
Specter and what we want here is second
view controller now this guy's knows
about this latest file okay once we have
done this let's bring up this Olympic
sign
I call it Olympic I know it's missing a
lot of rings out of the Olympic let's
just say okay let's get rid of this
comment we won't be using the did
receive memory warning right now
basically it's just for when your app is
running out of the memory it's pretty
advanced we're not going to touch it
right now maybe we can do it into a
later movie when I'm just getting bored
okay this looks good and let's just call
this as a text label okay let's just hit
the connect this is now getting
connected and what I want to do is show
you how the data is being transferred
from one guy to another one so we can do
that in a minute in a minute okay what I
want to do is first of all create a
simple way by which I can just go from
here to here now how I do that first of
all just hit down your ctrl click and
drag to this guy and make sure you click
on the show so we want to create a segue
out there but you know there is a
problem I can just go from here to here
but there is no way to get back an Apple
Apple actually solve this quite easily
go to editor embed in navigation
controller so now we do have a way by
which we can actually go from here to
here and how can I do that now I mean I
won't be going into just crafting this
application into pure perfect I'm just
showing you how the things are done so
no big deal ok looks good now what else
we can do let's just go on to this guy
and what I'm looking for is actually not
here okay first of all let's go into the
view controller let's try
to find out a way by which we can
actually transfer the things from here
to another piece of data okay so now
what let me just show you one thing now
there are two types of things when you
just go from one screen to another one
is perform the segue and one is prepared
for segue perform for segue is
responsible for just quickly go and
perform the segue don't don't just wait
for anything or do anything just perform
it to perform the segue and the second
guy is prepare for segue it just do a
couple of preparation and is actually
much more useful so let's just say now
what I want to do is let me just show
you what I'm planning to do it might
prompt reserved warning because I know
I'm just running it on the go and where
are you here it is now what I want to do
is just simply click on this and I know
it is being selected because it's great
the moment I selected I want to just go
on to the second screen okay let's just
stop this I just notice one more thing
that this this space is actually
bothering me a little bit I'm gonna just
fix it in a second it's not going to
take much it's just to take out here at
just scroll view in sets okay fix done I
promised you okay now let's just say
when we select a particular row so let's
just say I want to say it did select
that row at so again notice there is a
nice guy known as index path which is
going to keep the hold of what is the
index that we are selecting out there
okay so what we want to do here okay
that's going to be really good we are
going to just perform a segue here so
perform segue with identifier so we need
to give an identifier to the segue as
well how do we do that we just simply
click on this guy and give it the segue
as some name so it should be really
meaningful but I'm going to keep the
meaning side for a moment one segue is
the name view controller and it's just a
string and there we go I'll just keep
this guy as nil for a moment
or I can change it to something else to
show something different to you but
let's just say nil for right now and
let's just run this now what I'm
expecting is when I tap on anything it's
going to just pass on to the new screen
out there so let's just say this guy is
here Hulk when I click on this I'm able
to perform the segue there is a back
button thanks to the editor embedded in
and there we go now this back button
we didn't code it it out we didn't put
it out but it's there okay so we can
just see this okay so we are done
halfway done now we need to understand
that how we can transfer the data from
one segue to another and for this the
prepare for segue is the guy we are
looking for and notice this is the guy
prepare for segue and we need to do a
couple of things out there first of all
go to your second swift controller I
would like to put it here you know
freaky guy okay let's just create a
function here and I will just declare a
variable out there for not the car var
Mickey
you might be thinking I'm a big fan of
cartoons yes I am and the value of the
Mickey is Donald this is bizarre but
let's just see and when the view is
being loaded actually what I want to do
is just change the text labels so let's
just say that the text label dot text
should be equal to Mickey there we go
save that okay why I have done this
because I'll be creating a guest member
in my view controller who will be able
to access this property in this file and
will be able to change that that is the
goal here so in this view controller we
are going to create a new member here
let's just call this as guest there we
go we can call it anything but let's
just consider this as a guest now you
can see there is a segue here as well
let's just utilize this so I'm going to
call this a segue dot destination so
every guest has a destination where you
want to go simply destination
and we'll be asking it where is your
destination so where you want to go you
want to go I know this is as buzz but
it's it's a way how do you do the things
so destination as now write down the
name of your second file you very want
to transfer the rights of this guy out
there so this guy will be authoritative
over there as well so kind of officer
you can say from different Department
and what we want to give it is a second
view controller that's it that's pretty
much it
now you might be surprised to know this
that this guest
do have access to Mickey as well pretty
interesting so Mickey and it can change
the label out there let's just change it
to now what we can do now notice this
guy is a sender as well have the
accessibility to sender as well and I
can change the send I can just simply
say now who is the sender actually first
of all now the guy on which you are
tapping out there the cell on which you
are tapping is the sender out there and
every sender does have a value out there
I can just simply say that I want to
send as a string out there and save that
am I missing something let's just build
that okay and yes of course I'm missing
the optional there and there we go save
that build that looks good so what we
are doing in case this is running a
little bit fast to you that I'm just
preparing for a segue and in that segue
I'm using this segue and just consider
this as a guest you can declare a guest
here and this guest is now going to have
an access to all the properties being
declared in the second file as simple as
it sounds okay and there we go
now you'll see the magic that when I run
this app now we have done it now
whenever we are going to tap on this
because we are sending the sender out
here this sender will be passed on to
the next screen and since we have
changed the label on the next screen we
will be able to see what's there let me
just show you it's really difficult now
what I'm expecting is when I click on
the Hulk the Hulk will be returned on
the second screen as well
and we got a problem this is awkward but
let's just see it got a problem out
there and it's simply saying that the
sender is unexpectedly is nil because we
are sending an ale out there that's bad
okay so how we can do that now I'll be
saying that this sender is simply gonna
be Avengers and let's just pass on index
path dot row save that and build that
and this is the sender I think let's
just see I think we need to do the same
thing out here as well so let me just
copy this we need to the pass on the
sender so copy and paste this here as
well we were not sending anything we
were just sending the nil so command B
to build that and okay so this is
creating a problem let me just hit the
command Z save that build that and see
if the things are gonna look good let's
just stop this build that again and run
that and I think we need to do it this
here as well but let's just see we are
gonna have a good time here so let's
just see and there we go so B we're
actually sending this over in the did
select as well we don't need to send it
for prepare for segue okay so now what
we are doing is very simple we are just
clicking on this and this data is which
is being passed on because of that guest
onto the second screen so we have
successfully actually passed on the data
out there that's pretty good now one
more thing one final thing I know this
video is already 30 minutes long but
what we can do is just add a swipe to
delete function as well because that is
pretty easy to implement okay so how we
can do that let's tackle that as well I
think we can do it I'll add a couple of
lines of spaces out there now it's
pretty simple to add that swipe to
delete it just a commit editing style so
let's just say I'm looking for commit
yes this is the guy for editing style
all you have to do is write a false code
so if editing style
I think editing style
is equal to let's just say dot delete
and it's not showing up why I'm I'm just
wondering out there so let's just see if
I can pull that out now it's not working
let's just see that do we need to write
completely now previously it used to
work with a simply just start delete but
right now I think I need to just go for
this entire gasps a copy and I think it
to paste that dot delete I hate this I
think it was so much cooler when it was
just delete but I think they have just
changed a couple of things okay I'll
work out with that now once you're
swiping this this is going to give you a
simple now yes this is because it's not
working I don't know how to write the
edit style and I think this is going to
work now let's just say dot delete yes
it's working now okay now this will give
you the effect of swiping and delete but
it's not going to do anything you have
to do two things at this point one is
deleting the data from the array which
is just running all the time and the
second thing is we have to delete the
row at well so let's just handle one at
a time so what we can do is let's just
call our array Avengers and we are gonna
remove and this is bad Xcode just
crashed and I think because my app was
running okay thank God we didn't
actually lost hand data the advantage of
saving it so let's just see Xcode quite
quit unexpectedly yes I can tell that
that almost ruined my video but let's
just say so let's just say we are going
to call Avengers okay and we want to
remove something at index now what is
this index it is really simple
can you guess that because notice we are
selecting something we want to remove
that from index what it can be yes you
are right
in case you guess that right it's index
path dot row which is holding everything
for us so
okay so we have popped out that data
from the array but we haven't deleted
that row so we need to delete that as
well this is being stored into the table
view and we just want to delete row and
delete rows or we can sit this guy at
index path so what is the index path so
let's just say I want to show you the
index path and with animation yes of
course let's just say do we have fade
yes we have the fade save that did we
miss something yes we missed out
something because it should be in the
array yep there we go
I liked the feature of Xcode fixing my
bugs out there save that build that
fingers crossed
every time I just willed this this seems
to happen so let's just run this finally
I know this was a long video but I was
getting bored and getting a tons of
emails from the bootcamp
people were really confused about this
table views and swiping data so I
thought let's make it I'm having fun
so Hulk it's working no problem Captain
America I would like to give it a go
Captain America is there let's just see
let's just eliminate black widow and
tada here we go with the nice animation
Hulk we cannot get rid of Hulk nobody
can but I don't then let's just try that
and there we go now I know there is no
add button but I didn't meant to just
decide to just create a full app here I
could have done that but I think I
thought that it would be really good to
explain the things that how the things
work and I'm pretty sure that you have
enjoyed that as well now in case you
have any problems about iOS development
or want to join our online boot camp may
be offline boot camp just notify me in
the email that you have seen in the very
first and here as well so do notify me
till then bye-bye see you are there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
