regex series moving further in our regex
series we are gonna learn something new
here but again we are not discussing any
new topic here instead we are just
brushing up what we have learned so far
and a couple of Cabot points that I
believe everybody should be familiar
with so I have got an example again our
web site is very familiar regex are calm
feel free to use any other as well
so we have an example dot-com dot one
calm a calm so these are the three
keywords that I have to match by writing
some regular expression and you might be
saying hey this is so simple but yes
it's gonna teach you a lot so obviously
we know that calm is a word that is
gonna be selected anyhow and first word
can be just simply just a dot and we
have learned here that dot means
anything it literally matches anything
so dot one and a is pretty easy okay
now let's make it a little bit twist and
make it as one mom I'm literally running
out of the names here so one mom so you
want to match this and you say you know
what I will be much more creative
because things can get a little bit
change on the first place here so I'll
be writing a character set and you said
okay that makes sense so I'll be writing
a character set here which says later on
we'll learn how we can write words and
numbers and all of that but right now
let just assume it can be either C or it
can be either M okay that makes sense it
is gonna make sense much more here but
let's just say for some bizarre reasons
on the planet because yes obviously
you'll be handling such situations later
on you want to write this first first
position as well as a character set and
you said you know what that's not a big
deal because there are three
possibilities here and I can literally
can write that try that okay so what we
are doing let's write a character set
here and one can be there a can be there
and there can also be a dot and notice
it is matching here but there is
something happening little bit different
and that will get clear if I write some
example that says let's just say three
and I just say com
now it doesn't match as three com so
what I really want to talk here
now notice here if I don't use these
character sets here let me cut that out
and put a dot here notice I told you dot
means anything but when you write this
dot in a character set it's not behaving
as I'm expecting you could say that
instead of one and a you can have just
write a dot that means anything but the
problem is now it's inside the character
set and this is where our things come up
which says more than one meaning in the
regular expression or regex one thing
can have a more than one meaning so when
this dot is not inside the character set
it means anything but when it is inside
this character set it literally means a
dot yes literally means a dot nothing it
doesn't mean anything
it means dot I'm gonna be only selecting
it not a dot here and notice you are
able to select the dot here again as I
told you in the regular expression the
problem is not to select the specific
world the problem is not to select what
you don't want to select okay so this is
how the things are working I hope you
have understood the example I just
wanted to teach you here
that the meaning of the dot changes when
it goes inside the character set it
becomes literally the dot and what it is
outside the character set it just means
anything anything literally including
spaces your numbers your characters
special science and everything now let's
move on to another one more example
which will be really helpful for you ok
so I want to discuss one more thing here
and these are all possible example that
can happen so maybe let's just say you
have a website design in PHP or Django
or anything else you want to get some
things or some images to be uploaded on
your website so these are all possible
examples that can happen to you as well
so let us say you have an example of
image 1 1 dot jpg you have an example of
image 0 1 oops
0 1 dot jpg and then we have something
like image - 1 dot jpg these are all
possible names that anybody can write
underscore 1 dot jpg and let's just have
one more which is bizarre 1 - slash 1
dot jpg ok
now you want to write a regular
expression that can matches all of this
now obviously we haven't dealer
with these kinds of situation in the
past but eventually as we'll be growing
up in the curves will be stepping our
game up with a regular expression with
more such examples okay so we want to
route this thing right a single regular
expression that can match all of these
things okay not really the complicated
one can be done easily so obviously this
is what we wanted the first images now
the next thing is we want something here
so we'll be writing something in the
character sets and we can notice a
pattern here that everything say is one
dot jpg okay so that's sorted out what
we want but the only issue is this row
here is little bit complicated it has
zero one dashes and underscore and
slashes okay so what you should be
writing you can simply say you know what
I'm gonna be writing one zero a simple
dash an underscore and a slash and here
we go it doesn't select anything at all
so you might be saying hey what's wrong
here we have learned about the character
set but it's not selecting anything okay
maybe switching up the position can be
even a little bit trickier so let's just
say you say is here it is selecting
everything but you know what as soon as
I put a slash it just goes mumbo-jumbo
okay so let me tell you how these
situation can be handled up
first of all do notice here that there
is a slash here - means and in case you
have studied our previous videos as well
you know that when I say zero to one it
means the range so here the slash or the
- is not just a dash it has a special
meaning and when we want to have a
special meaning being nullified or just
we don't want to have it we put a slash
here okay now it's saying okay now the
slaw the dash is not having any meaning
because you have put a backslash
character but since we also want to
select this backslash character we have
to come up with some tricky situations
here so as soon as I put a slash here we
have to also mention that this slash
doesn't means I want to escape anything
this slash literally means escape
character here so I'm gonna be putting
an extra slash here okay and then
finally we have an underscore here so
this matches up everything now yes there
can be variety of other ways of writing
this particular
in tax here but again the whole
situation is you should be aware that
some things do have special meanings and
you need to be aware that how these
things now this is not a perfect regular
expression I will not give it a 10 of 10
because this is badly written it could
have been a little bit more simplified
because it doesn't really mean where you
write the positions here but this is
making things much more confusing
regular expressions are already
confusing doesn't make them
extraordinary confusing so what you can
do here is instead of putting a 0 - /
you can write something like I want to
select 0 or 1 0 or I can select 1 and
then I want as - obviously this is not a
- so I want to escape that character
then also I need an underscore and then
I need a little backslash so this would
be better not the perfect but this would
be better because this is less confusing
later on we are gonna learn how we can
have these words and characters and can
be defined right now we have to
literally write a 0 and 1 it could have
been shortened up but we haven't studied
that yet so this is all more about
regular expressions and talks on it and
later on we'll gonna be stepping up our
game in the regular expression a little
bit more stay tuned and catch you up in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
