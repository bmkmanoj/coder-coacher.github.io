WordPress series so so far now we have
understood a little bit about the
WordPress and installation of ZAP on
Windows and Mac now we are going to
proceed and answer actually a couple of
questions in this particular video so we
have a lot of questions first of all
without any further ado we are going to
spend a couple of seconds on to the
website of Matt now Matthew has designed
this amazing WordPress and I think it's
worth spending a couple of minutes on
his website and I highly recommend you
to check out his website he has done an
amazing job by giving us the wordpress
as an open source a great great
contribution in the community so go
ahead read about it at least visit his
website and that would be kind of a very
little thing that we can do for him
amazing guy
you can find him in a lot of word press
conferences it's pretty common you can
follow him on the social networks as
well he's quite common there so go ahead
check him out there now let's go ahead
and ask a couple of questions before we
move on into WordPress first of all do
we really need a wordpress second
question is what is the difference
between wordpress.com and wordpress.org
and the third question is what we can
actually do with WordPress so first
question is do we really need a
WordPress now I would say it depends now
for all the times you don't need a
wordpress sometimes I have seen people
over using the WordPress now just onto
an example scenario I do have my website
now my website is a very very personal
basic website it doesn't have much of
the things to deal up with it only
changes once in a while not much often
and it just fetches all the YouTube
videos as soon as I upload them now this
is being designed on to just JavaScript
just onto a sidebar I have already
recorded a video on how we can do these
are fetching of the YouTube videos
automatically from a channel using
react.js go ahead find that onto the
YouTube archive my on my youtube channel
but coming back onto the topic for these
kinds of website really just have a
couple of pages like home about us
contact us pages and that said for these
kinds of websites since they are not
getting changed often using a wordpress
would be overkill you could have done
these kinds of job within a simple
couple of KB's of kind of a code and you
are using a full-fledged WordPress world
that is not an amazing job so for
small-scale websites
I don't ever recommend WordPress because
you are just over killing the things it
may reduce the speed of the website and
a lot of things like that WordPress is
now being made for the websites which
changes a lot of things quite often
and/or writing a blog or something like
that so if you're changing a website
let's just say once in a ve called once
in a month then obviously what press
could have been a good choice but really
you should really research a little bit
whether you need a plain HTML CSS
template to go onto your website or you
need a full fledged WordPress don't
overkill ever ever just because a thing
is there you don't need to use that
always okay so that answers our
questions that always it depends for
just a couple of website a couple of
pages of websites don't use the
WordPress it's not a good thing now
let's come back onto the topic what is
the difference between wordpress.com and
the wordpress.org onto a very simple
words wordpress.com is paid and
wordpress.org is totally free let's get
on to difference because it's a little
bit more to explain and just with that
wordpress.com is being managed by
company automatic the company behind the
WordPress like it's like that there is a
lot of confusion with that let's leave
that but it's being managed by the
company automatic now what press.com is
a controlled environment that means you
don't have to worry about all the hacks
that are going on or the vulnerabilities
that come up but again it's a very very
controlled environment you cannot
install any theme you cannot install any
third-party plugins just like that there
are limited set of plugins and themes
being available to you you can only use
them only and only there are certain
plants that allows you to do so for the
basic lance you don't get much to be
there and of course you check out into
the pricing of the WordPress you can see
there is a free version there but it
doesn't allow you to have your kind of a
customized domain you're always gonna
get a domain like hit H dot
wordpress.com or dot wordpress.com
something like that okay so there is the
basic things if you want to add up your
domain you have to pay like $1.99 it's
in rupees don't worry it's not in
dollars $1.99
per month which is a little bit it gives
you 6 GB of storage and you can read all
the things in the plan so this is paid
and in case you are kind of a
photographer or maybe artist or you just
play guitars and want to manage things
onto your website on their own WordPress
comm could have been a really great
thing but but again it doesn't allow you
to install n number of plugins or themes
it's very limited and controlled
environment so make sure you always keep
an eye on that
now what press dot org on the other hand
is the free version of the WordPress
that is running on there but not onto a
controlled environment you are
completely free to do whatever you want
to do you want to customize the theme
you want to add or install a theme that
you have purchased or a plugin that you
have purchased or you have designed on
your own completely free on your own how
you want to customize it it's completely
a GPL licensed general public use
license totally free what you really
want to do and it's amazing it's great
and we will be working on this we will
be downloading our own files of
WordPress and then we'll be looking onto
it I highly recommend to check out all
the links and tabs on these website is
like what are the themes available some
of them are free some of them are prayed
and I'll talk a lot more into detail
about what are the null themes and
should he be using that or not ok so now
that you understand the difference
between wordpress.com and wordpress.org
let's move further what you can really
do with the WordPress now at the initial
days the WordPress was being designed to
just write the blogs the article writers
and people who want to convey some
information just like this we also do
write blog at LC over there and there is
a nice article why not to choose the
pirated and all theme it's bad first of
all it's illegal as well as there are a
lot of lot of consequences that comes up
with these pirated themes you may end up
in a lot of trouble so just onto a
sidebar so initially it was designed to
write a blogs like this but WordPress
has evolved quite a lot and it can be a
full-fledged website can do pretty much
anything and if you customize it a
little bit here are a couple of examples
that I would like to post in front of
you girl with the camera dot coat UK is
an amazing website to follow up
she always posts up the photos what she
has
taken up his recent projects or and all
these things it's by Ashley amazing but
you can see it's a simple WordPress
theme anybody can tell that yes it's a
team customized of course a lot of
customization but again it's a very
basic WordPress team I would say again
it can be modified into her mazing thing
like this but it requires a lot of
knowledge you cannot just do without
with a click click click things no it
requires a lot of customization to move
and mold a WordPress in just things like
that
and of course the very famous tattoo
studio that the inc.com also uses the
WordPress and if I just hit a reload you
can see the customization that they have
done amazing amazing job there so there
we go so there we go and it's a side
scroll you can see the tattoos you can
see the scroll is here onto a side and
you can see how the tattoos were a big
fan of tattoos you know so you can see
all check out all the tattoos that they
are doing and all this this is an
amazing job that they have done with the
customization of WordPress definitely
definitely and check out all of that so
pretty good amazing artists as well just
leave that you also can see that how the
WordPress can be modified into a
full-fledged personal website you know
Katy Perry I hope so and all the details
merchandise all the things things are
being here so it's it's an amazing way
since the data is being updated quite a
lot about the tickets and everything I
think what press for such kind of a
website is a good choice because things
are getting updated quite a lot also it
can be treated as a full-fledged
a news website our website like Chicago
Sun Times is totally designed in
WordPress of course terms of
customization but for a news website
it's a lifesaver it's an easy way to go
and of course finally last but not the
least the Walt Disney website is also
totally on the WordPress amazing amazing
customization but again these kinds of
customization are not just with a click
click of course there are themes we're
still you need a customization for that
a little bit knowledge of PHP and stuff
is there not I'm saying it's compulsory
you can do pretty much a great job
without any knowledge as well but you
know the more knowledge you have it's
more
so that's all for this video now you do
have an understanding a lot of about the
WordPress in the next video what we're
gonna do is we are going to download
this wordpress.org thing where that went
up did I close that nope so there we go
make sure before starting the next video
go ahead and download this WordPress
it's gonna be a zip file in the next
video we will be exploring the zip file
how it works how we can install that and
all such stuff and this is what we're
gonna do so go ahead download this and
I'll surely catch you up in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
