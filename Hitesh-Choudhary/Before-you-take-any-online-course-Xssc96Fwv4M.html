with another video in this video I want
to address an important question now I
expect that you are a student who wants
to take online courses now before you
take any online course by me or any
other instructor you need to listen to
me in this video this is not a course
specific video this is a general video
so that you can set your expectation
from online courses is it me or any
other great instructor whoever that is
you need to listen to me here now I'm
talking here all about the programming
and coding courses now first and
foremost it takes a lot of effort to
create the courses an instructor are
doing really a hard work in creating all
those courses to provide you all
affordable education now there are two
ways of designing a course the fun is
the formal approach and one is a little
bit informal approach now in the formal
approach instructor likes to edit all
those mistakes that he has made while
writing the code and has solved the
problem now there is nothing wrong in
this approach but there is one key
element that get missed out in this very
very formal approach that is
understanding how the problem is being
solved now I have worked with a lot of
teams from Facebook Google and recently
on the file store as an unofficial
tester product now even those engineers
who are great and are working at the
most prestigious companies like Google
and Facebook their product on day one is
not perfect so yes everybody makes
mistake and you should always keep that
in mind in the formal approach people
like to edit out all those parts and in
the early days I also used to do it but
over the time I realize that it gives up
a myth in the mind of students the myth
that nobody makes mistake and if I'm
making a mistake probably there is
something wrong with me no there is
nothing wrong with you
just like when you love to really have
an idea of spending a vacation some
group of people would love to have a
vacation on a hill with a snow mountain
while on the other hand one group of
people would like to have a vacation on
a lovely nice warm beach nobody's wrong
but it's a kind of a personal preference
in the similar way there are two
approaches the formal way in which
everybody has edited all those power
where they are making mistakes in
solving problem and there is another
approach which is known as little bit
less formal in that approach instructor
will make mistakes in front of you and
will try to edit them there is nothing
wrong in that and I personally believe
that the instructor who shows you that
yes we are making mistakes and this is
how you solve that problem is very
essential thing
trust me whenever you are going to work
for on your own project or on to
company's project or anywhere you are
working as a job profile your number one
job is going to be solved that mistake
that is the reason why Stack Overflow
website is at the very top and is the
programmers favorite because it teaches
you how to solve your problem now in the
early days I used to have a formal
approach of writing the code and
everything was edited and all those
mistakes there was no mistake in all
those videos but eventually I realized
that I am missing an essential and key
part of the programming that is how to
solve problems and I need to show my
students that yes sometimes I pick up
color like green and later on I say the
green color is not looking nice we need
to change that to red or maybe I'm
missing a semicolon these are all
essential part writing a simple loop
declaring variables creating function
and joining them together to make make
an awesome product is easy anybody can
do that
with a small amount of training the
problem actually starts when there are
errors when you are writing a function
you're writing this function and you
want to join them somehow to create a
functionality the problem arises when
they don't sync up then when this is the
time when you actually start exploring
the things that why my things are not
working and this is known as something
workflow and I personally believe that
this workflow this showing about the
problems is an essential part of
programming now I am NOT saying that I
am perfectly right here
perhaps in in the training some of the
students expect that there should be a
complete flow there should be no
problems at all you might be that kind
of student but early in the very stage I
would like to mention this that I prefer
a little bit informal approach a
friendly way to interact with you to
communicate with you
I believe that learning is fun and
coding is so much fun
do and that is why I prefer a little bit
informal approach where I choose some
colors like green later on change them
to white or maybe make a mistake of
missing the semicolon and in front of
you try to find that out
but this doesn't means I want to waste
your time all these things are done in a
fast forward manners all these editing's
and polishing of this videos are done
this is not like I'm always uploading
unedited videos all these videos are
taken special care in audios and videos
and all their qualities color correction
everything is done so on a final note I
want to say with this video is that
whatever the course you are taking from
wherever the instructor is or whoever
the instructor is expect mistakes these
are essential part of programming and
just get the myth out of your mind
which says that hey somebody's going to
bring a computer and it's going to just
write the code tip tip tip tip like that
and if it's code is gonna work fine no
it's not like that it takes a lot of
revisions a lot of error solving skills
to make that product up and running so
next time whenever you take my course or
any other instructor course expect
mistake and the most important part
learn how to solve those mistakes for
this I would surely catch you up in the
next video see you inside some awesome
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
