I know I I don't post any videos that
I'll be going live at that particular
time I don't do that but he really that
that's my bad but I do go life really
often on this channel so hey everybody
you can just post a hi there I'm reading
down all of the comment I'll give you
some of the updates on which I'm working
on and this is finally some song I got
some time to work on the personal stuff
this is very rare I usually don't get
time to work on the personal stuff even
don't have time to hire somebody to work
on my personal stuff but finally I got
some time so let's just say - hello -
everybody hello Yvonne hello ugh
hi birthday and you can also ask your
questions as well hey everybody hey hey
hey everybody so a lot of people are
live in here I other day I mean can I
work for you yes eventually I'm hiring a
few of the people that have already
proven their potential or some of the
students from the course am - I am due
hiring couple of people's for a small
project based work it's not a full time
opportunity as of now maybe maybe in the
future we'll get that but right now I
just want to do that in fact I'm talking
to one of the very great programmers
that I do know and let's see how the
things goes on right now I'm hiring for
the react and react native basis
especially for the react domain okay so
in case you do know that contact me it's
it's a good thing to discuss so which is
the best IDE for Java I'm a big fan of
Eclipse but everybody knows IntelliJ is
much more superior than Eclipse but yes
I do work on Eclipse I I have to work on
Eclipse because until J some of the
features come as a pro and it's paid so
for me it makes sense to work on the
Eclipse so the student can also follow
me okay so how was your shift in Jordan
- awesome I would HIGHLY highly
recommend everybody to go to Jordan once
in
lifetime amazing country I was thrilled
to see what is happening there and how
the news is actually making a bad
impression but it's it's a lovely
country I enjoy it thoroughly in the
Jordan okay so what about NetBeans I
don't use NetBeans I don't like the IDE
and the feel and the look of that it's a
good editor but I don't I don't go for
that okay what type of project are you
looking for sir I'm trying to take all
of my online courses which have been so
far only available for the United States
students and mostly UK students and
trying to bring up them to Indian
consumers as well by integrating debit
cards and pay TMS and all these stuff
not much not much fancy stuff just just
a simple project not not a big deal
which video editor you use auditor I am
on a Mac so I use Final Cut Pro some
time had to become lazy and use iMovie
as well but most of my work actually
goes on Final Cut Pro and I take my work
really seriously I have spent some time
in learning the video editing and all
those stuffs so I do take this thing
very seriously and I work quite a lot on
it how much RAM required to work smooth
Android studio I would say 8gb is enough
for Android studio but depends but it
depends on how many avds the Android
virtual devices you are creating I do
have a 64 gigs of ram so everything
works really smooth for me but I think
8gb is good for you okay
what is no js' I do have a full fledged
course on the node.js it's JavaScript a
server-side framework each thing it's
really awesome if you are looking to
learn that don't wait just go there it's
it's awesome course I watched all of
your vlogs they are all amazing is
working in a service based company are
useless for CCS students and probably
based companies should be first priority
I would say it's not required to work in
a product based company yes
you do definitely learn quite a lot in
the product based company but while
waiting for a company to launch a
product you can just work on on to a
small small products of your own can
upload on to your github in that way you
will create an experience you will
create a profile and you will have a
project as well so if you're already
quite stabilized into service mate in
industry the charm of the service based
industry is you get a lot of free time
so in your free time you can just work
on your product but again I personally
do prefer a product based company but
it's its approach it's not a thing that
you should always be going on there so
tech mates how's your trip amazing
amazing I can talk through half an hour
completely about my trips I still do
have a lot of V logs to edit I'm not
getting time because I have only
uploaded Egypt day one I do have seven
or eight days of logs in the a gyp
especially my balloon ride my my balloon
actually got crashed so I do have that
also I want to join your class
please give your contact number hi
Polynesia I do have classes but they are
completely online and I do prefer not to
share my contact number publicly
otherwise you know things will become
unmanageable for me tell about django
django is a python based framework that
I don't use I'm a big fan of Python but
I don't like to work on the Django it's
cluttery
that's my personal opinion although a
lot of people and friends are using it I
like to prefer to go with the react okay
Ruby on Rails or Python I would go for
Python but again there is no such first
Bosma strong reason for that okay a lot
of people don't be rude
dinesh here if you'll try to be a little
bit show a little bit of the humble
thing in here I'll be showing the same
ok the nice so this is this is the
quality of the human nature that
everybody should have okay
what which is the best movement of
Jordan Dead Sea Dead Sea is the best
movement in the Jordan
the Egypt the crash-landing of our
balloon ride who was the movement okay
Python is a must to learn machine
learning I am for machine learning I
would any day would suggest you to go
with Python with your machine learning
please no I cannot upload machine
learning videos as of now because I do
like to upload videos for the things in
which I am working on some project so
first I do learn a subject have a couple
of five or six projects and then try to
make a video series on that otherwise
just going through with the syntaxes is
not a good thing I cannot say that I
have done it justice to the course until
and unless I have done a few projects in
that what is the scope of programming in
today's world it's amazing you can see
the entire channel is running around the
programming so yes programming has got a
lot of things okay I'll take a little
bit break a water break okay so let's
get back to the questions does the
percentage in bachelor's and master's
degree really matter no it doesn't
really matter
SST what you are saying saying about SST
what is the best platform IDE for Java
again I told you I'm a big fan of
Eclipse I go whenever I have to write
the code in Java usually I pick up
Android studio because the only case
where I have to write the code in Java
is Android apart from that I don't write
any Java code that's that's an honest
answer in here but if I had to pick up
to teach a course or something I would
definitely pick up eclipse that's that's
going to be my choice I want to learn a
coding how can I start just wait for a
few days mode we are about to finish the
project then you can learn from online
courses okay which is the best software
for Java best software for Java I don't
get you what you're trying to say how
was career in electronics engineering in
the future four years please answer me I
don't
I'm an electronics and communication
engineer moved completely into the
software domain I don't know what's
going on into the electronics maybe
Samsung is building up some new TV I
have no idea absolutely no idea okay
a lot of questions sir I aspire to
necessary for machine learning yes it is
okay sir you coded even even when you're
were holidays
no I didn't coded much when I was on
holidays but I was reading totally on
there because when I travel I do keep
kind of a documentation is in my tablets
and I do read whatever the subject I am
learning like I was reading quite
thoroughly about the native base which
is a sub branch of react native so it's
it's kind of a hobby thing for me people
read the fictional books non fictional
books I read the documentation and this
is actually part of my time management I
am a very strong person in time
management skills and this is one other
way I take down my time because you get
a lot of time while flying in our flying
and then all of this so I prefer to keep
a documentation set or whatever I'm
trying to learn and utilize my time
everywhere okay okay which PDF should
learn high speed level in Python oh I
would have to recommend any kind of
speed level learning of PDFs or such
things because you need to understand
the concept and everything very
thoroughly so look out for the big book
or big video courses that are meaningful
actually not just anything okay so why
are you not posting more videos and
Android development there is a reason
there is a strong reason for that I'm
not posting on Android development
because I'm trying to build up five or
six projects in Android first and these
projects once they are completed I will
be reposting along with some good
surprises for you so yes there are a lot
of things going on right now so just
bear with me this channel is growing
quite fast as I did in part of that but
it's really good ok so I'm a mechanical
engineering students I have
a couple of apps in Android and dotnet
now it's hard to get a job in product
company what I want to do okay so what I
should do okay I think that's what you
want to write if you have pretty good
apps in the Android I think you there
are a lot of job opportunities but
definitely depends on where you are
because these kinds of job opportunities
usually float around Bangalore Pune
Gurgel gurugram whatever they like to
call it
so these opportunity actually float
around in these areas so maybe you're
not looking it right otherwise I've seen
hundreds and hundreds of jobs every day
being posted for these kinds of
developer how to publish Android app I'm
working on an app please tell once your
app is ready you can just purchase a
license which is I think a $30 license
you should have a credit card and
everything's ready for you with you so
that's a $30 license I think so and then
you can just upload there are few
process that you have to go through but
again buying a license is the first
thing okay any new tutorial about
industry big solution salivation from
Morocco Morocco is a good company a good
country I really want to visit you it's
one of the thing in my list because I
want to go through that too of a Spain
and everything with that country I may
come upon come on to your country about
regarding ns3 that was a pretty old work
that I did during my thesis of my
doctorate and everything I do have a
couple of offers on writing the book on
ns3
my Shadle is jam-packed seriously if
you--if I'll show you a complete v-log
of how my day goes you will be surprised
and even getting a little time to sleep
so right now I'm not be able to working
on and not be able to work on ns3 as of
now I'm looking for a lot of things
right now but yeah maybe in future ok
any public meter body planning me and my
son friends want to meet you
I don't think so there are any future
soon meetup being planned up days are
really packed but again I am getting a
lot of invitation from engineering
universities and colleges I may accept a
few of them and there we can have a meet
up because I love to talk at colleges
and universities but Schill is
jam-packed so no public meetups as of
now okay but if it depends if I get
invite I may think of it okay how to
publish Android app okay I've told you
already
auditor okay okay okay
which is the best programming language
to help helical hackers okay there is no
such thing no programming can help
ethical hackers because hackers should
have first of all an open mind and then
should be flourished in a couple of
languages there is no such one but of
course everything starts with the one
thing get started with a pretty easy
languages like Python and JavaScript
they will help you to quite a lot and
you can design even desktop apps in
JavaScript an electron and all of that
so go ahead with that shell scripting is
also a good thing that every hacker
should learn okay a lot of questions and
I'll just scroll through governor over
there and it's it's keep coming which
programming language is best to become
full stack developer javascript is the
way to go right now it's it's awesome
language full stack web browser print I
wish I really wish things could have
been much more simpler at my early days
when we have to learn HTML CSS
JavaScript jQuery bootstrap PHP and
server-side sequels and everything
well everything is done in JavaScript I
cannot believe how simpler things are
now is Linux a better option for
developing apps ah now here is a
controversial statement okay first of
all I'm a big fan of Linux
I do have worked quite extensively lot
on that track and Kali Linux some of
might not be aware of the BACtrack
version 2 &amp;amp; 3 when I was working on it
also I have done a couple of series of
certification in Red Hat that's that's
on my protection side okay but in order
to develop apps I always move on to a
Mac computer because in Linux there are
usually some issues which requires a lot
of time so it's not backed by any
private organization to give me that
kind of support for Windows and Apple I
know this is this is a completely
bizarre statement but in order to
develop apps Vee requires stability in
the operating system I should not be
worried about
hey how to update this package how to
update that rpm
I prefer Mac for developing apps okay
but again this doesn't means I don't
like Linux I have done a word
extensively in the Linux okay
make sure you understand that okay now
let's see now I know this is gonna make
some sound but I do need my air
conditioning to be working it's getting
hot in here okay so so that I can talk
to you a little bit more okay I hope
that's fine it's gonna make some noise
in here but bear with me bear with me
okay so I got I'm not getting placement
due to my 12 class 59 although I have
done a lot of project in web development
and two internship I have 70% in VTAC
but I always rejected you to my 12
percent perhaps lecture you are not
applying to the right companies in a
right manner go ahead get started with a
github upload all of your project to the
github if your projects are just mini
scale project then of course you will be
get rejected but if your project use
extensive about the database the login
system and everything then there are
hundreds and hundreds of companies which
are ready to take you in fact one of my
friend is looking to hire PHP developers
in Jaipur but he is saying that people
should be aware all the things okay so
if you are in Jaipur I can do recommend
to that guy to help you there but again
your project should be solid ones not
the kids project okay so ah
there are a lot of lot of questions just
scrolling through down there okay okay
how was your holiday time in Egypt and
Jordan Hassan Sanjay my time was really
awesome I've discussed it previously as
well in this particular video please
tell about freelancing freelancing is
awesome as soon as you keep getting the
clients some time it's tough because the
competition is tough but again depends
on what kind of quality you are giving
you will always get clients if your work
is professional your property or showing
professionalism work on time and
everything yeah then obviously
freelancing is good there are a lot of
platforms like fiber freelancer upward a
lot of them in fact if you have do have
contacts in a lot of countries and
friends and everything you just keep
getting the projects it's it's a
never-ending process do you do any
WordPress development yes
Evon we do extensively extensively
WordPress development because it fast
and sometimes usually the clients there
is a client demand there so we have to
do a lot of WordPress development we do
it we do it quite a lot sir by YouTube
Frank answer by YouTube because YouTube
gives me a creative freedom and this is
kind of a new hobby for me actually to
be honest I'm already into video'd of
the pent quite a lot and YouTube gives
me creative freedom I can create my
videos wherever I want to however I want
to there is no restriction in the
facebook the biggest restriction that I
faced it it was not creative just
writing a text is not creative and on
top of that the limit of 5,000 friends
it's really sad because I have finished
my 5,000 friends about two years back
and still new people want to get
connected to me want to know me I want
to know them so it's a bad thing that
Facebook is stopping me over 5,000
friends on top of that I wanted to
become little bit more creative learn
new things and for that now I don't
think so that there is much better thing
than the YouTube so that's why I
switched onto YouTube I should
than that years and years ago but hey
it's never late hey taste it just
curiosity to ask where you guys giving
us online lessons right now they are
working on quite a lot of platforms
right now we are working on udemy we are
working an open learning we are working
on to Telus in Spain so they have a lot
of platforms on which I am working but
the most popular one is udemy I do even
get approached from a lot of others with
open learning in Australia and to Telus
in Spain where we are giving it they're
trying to bring it up into the India as
well fingers crossed
maybe we can do it very soon okay so can
you manage to do so many things so how
can you manage to do so many things I
have to cut up time from my sleep that's
ah that's that's the one thing I always
do cut your time from the sleep a little
bit but again time management is the
most essential thing in order to become
successful you may have skills that's
okay you may not have skills you can
learn the skills but if you don't have
time management
you cannot success get success in life
because at the college level also you
have to manage your homework your
assignments your classes schedules in
between times of the universities
because every University is having a
problem of 75% even mine one was having
on top of everything if you are able to
manage your time and able to learn the
things do whatever you want to do that
is the thing that makes you successful
okay so can a person be both Android as
well as iOS developer yes of course that
is why react native is coming up in the
picture I'll show you a couple of
tutorials maybe I'll upload them right
now because I already have them so yes
it's possible and even if you are
working on the native base as well like
for example certain Java it's almost
similar just a few codes are here and
there so yes it's possible even I do it
many time we missed your video sir thank
you so much for that but I'm back in
here hello sir when you are going to
make videos on implementation of
mathematics and programming be neat sir
because we don't
know which topic of math is important to
study okay so maybe tomorrow I'll do it
I don't make any promises in here I'll
try my best
I wish ake hi okay now again scrolling
through because the list is going on a
lot of hello hello god of how to get
projects of Java online which part I
should learn in Python for feature scope
there is no such part in Python you have
to learn it entirely you also have to
learn to apply a lot of modules and
import libraries there's a lot of things
to learn so if you're learning just
focusing on one language make sure you
go through quite a lot in it okay again
it's it's going on there was one comment
with a lot of Smiley's what should I do
after 10th to learn programming how
again I would tell you to birth they are
bringing up a lot of online courses that
you can study at your home will you
accept my friend request there is a
message on Facebook as well
I cannot manage Facebook YouTube all the
things at time I cannot accept Facebook
friend requests I really want to but I
cannot my limit is exceeded okay oops
sorry okay so I think this has been
quite a lot of stuff we have spent 22
minutes in here I was planning for 15
minutes only event ahead of the time so
I would say all of you that please
please PLEASE await a second wait a
second everybody's posting still the
questions okay this is all for this live
update I will be back for sure very soon
with a lot of good news lot of awesome
videos helping you out every single day
with all all these awesome videos and
even programming videos as well why
don't you upload any free videos I do
have a lot of free videos but again I
think you need to understand that why I
don't upload the free videos is I have
to pay my bills the internet that you
are seeing the tripod that you are
seeing there the cameras the mics even I
have to
food as well so that is why I I like to
earn a little bit not much little bit
okay so I would try to answer your
questions don't be sad there I will be
back I will be back but right now I have
to get back to work there is a lot of
work being pending in here so bye bye
everybody and keep posting down your
comments in section there I am looking
each and every one of them I still
haven't decided what I will be making
tomorrow's video so make sure you post a
lot of comments and I will pick one of
the comments and we'll try to answer it
in a full fledge it video bye bye
everyone and have a great big day ahead
