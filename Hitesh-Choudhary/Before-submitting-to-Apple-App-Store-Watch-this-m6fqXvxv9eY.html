again with another video in this video
I'm gonna talk about the submission of
your app into Apple's Play Store now
this video is not about hitting that
submit button and filling that forms and
descriptions and images all of that this
video is rather all about sharing my
experience that why your app can be
rejected in the Apple's App Store as
well as what are the issues that I have
faced recently as well as in the past
and how I made it through those issues
so this is going to be a really
interesting video sharing all of my
experience that I have got so far with
Apple and trust me this is going to be a
fun video you're going to enjoy a lot
and you'll see some of the kind of
excuses that Apple usually gives and
that eventually comes up with that so
stay tuned and let's get started so
before we move on further let me tell
you that I have submitted almost 15 apps
for my clients into the Apple App Store
and probably more than 15 in some of
them I was working as a graphic design
intern some of them I wrote I have
written the entire code by myself
sometimes I have worked as a team itself
and there were always and always Bazaar
reasons that came up showed up and the
reason why our app got rejected and I
have learned quite a lot from that to
all the developers who are submitting
their app to the Apple's App Store I
would recommend you to keep in mind that
your review is going to be going into
the manual process not like in the
Android App Store where you simply go
and publish your app and it's being
automatically being reviewed by the
software in the Apple's App Store
everything is reviewed manually still
and yes they are using a lot of
automation techniques but still there
are always persons involved so there's
no chance that you can make any kind of
trickery to that skip that system it's
not going to happen I still remember
that one time when I released and done
all of my work at the very first time my
app got rejected because I used a
smaller font at some of the places which
were not into the guidelines so there is
always a guideline that you all
have to follow I would highly recommend
to read about the hIgG the human
interface guidelines provided by Apple
to skip all of such mistakes that I made
in my early days and I always recommend
in all of my boot camps to read that
guidelines and then move forward but in
this video I want to share the
experience of learned code on line AB
the app that is still in the review
process and we are facing a lot of
problems so just after when I release
the Android app I prepared an iOS app as
well and here after preparing the iOS
app it got prepared within like five
days six days let's just take it a week
so it was prepared within a week and I
pushed that app into the app store now
there the business model that we are
following up here is once a student
purchase a course onto the website
the same course is in his account and
the same course appears into the Android
app as well as iOS app there is no need
to purchase again those courses
obviously it makes sense and the same
process is being followed in Android app
as well as iOS app so the moment we
published out our iOS app there were
some issues that we faced I'm gonna
share all of them some of the problems
were at my an and some of the problems
were at the Apple ad and again all of
them are teaching us something the first
problem that got hit was in-app purchase
issues so there were some meta tags
being missed in the in-app purchases and
we actually filled that up and that was
completely our mistake not filling up
that meta tags so work being done and we
published we again sent it back to the
review process now in the review process
you might have seen in the apples
developer conference that they have
promised that now we are upgrading our
app review process and review will be
reviewed within 24 hours I would say
Apple is drastically failing in that
promise and now you actually don't get
all of the things within 24 hours
actually it takes usually 48 hours still
and on top of that you might be aware
that the situation of when you submit
for a review your time actually
increases exponentially which I personal
thing is not a good thing for developers
because once your app is being submitted
it takes two days next time it's going
to take like four days it's it's not a
good thing with
sometimes the mistakes are just
miniatures and hey Apple you're such a
big company you should hire more people
for review process and it should be
really quick now instead of increasing
that exponentially I am personally not a
big fan of that next time when we
published our app for the review process
again during that mid time I actually
rolled out again a course on Java
bootcamp that was an ongoing series and
we again got a rejection this time
completely our mistake and in the
guideline they pointed out a thing that
said I in your app purchases if
somebody's purchasing something that
should be a finished product and cannot
be an ongoing series and we said okay
let's just do that and we pulled out
that course from the server so that it
doesn't appear in the iOS itself it
still does appear in the Android but not
in the iOS so that was another point of
rejection I get that these two all
mistakes are due to me and I'm the whole
sole reasons for these mistakes but what
comes after that was completely bizarre
now I do my entire learn code online web
site is all about programming and I'm
not just an iOS fan I also teach people
how to make apps for Android and Java as
well and this was a bizarre reason for
rejecting my app the Apple App Store
review process guys told me that hey
your app cannot be submitted into the
App Store because it takes the name of
the Android I submitted my reason that
Android name is going to be there
because it's an entire course for the
Android not a mention of a third-party
app but these guys are not ready to
listen to me
and I found it really really bad that
Apple is so scared with the Android that
the moment you'll be putting up an
Android word into your app your app gets
a very high chance of getting rejection
in the App Store now obviously when I'm
making that complete Android developer
course this course shouldn't be having
any problem because a lot of other
competitors and other people who are big
giants are already having their apps
which has similar kind of courses I
don't know what's the reason with Maya
but they gave me straight reason that
you cannot use the word Android for next
like ten days or so we have been
continuously arguing
about the thing that hey it's not a
mention of the third party app it's an
entire course you have the entire app
check it out and these guys are not
ready to listen to me so we decided hey
let's not fight again on that and we
pulled out again one one more course on
Android and we figured it out that we
need to remove all of the words that say
is android and we are going to fight
that on the version two so we did the
same and we pulled out that course and
we thought now we are ready to go and
submitted our app again for review again
this is all going on through a period of
like 10 days or 15 days or maybe even a
month again all of these things are
happening because Apple doesn't tell you
all the points at once they simply just
review one point if there is a rejection
they're going to send you the review
thing and it's bad because once you are
if you're revealing something you just
mentioned you can mention all of the
points and developer can work on all
those points which are making you a
problematic guy there
so all got sorted out and we thought
that now we are gonna have our app into
the iOS App Store now we got another
situation now in the review process they
told us that if you're making it in a
purchase why are you collecting the data
we asked what kind of data you are
telling us they said you are collecting
the emails of the student can you tell
us the reason why are you collecting the
emails of the people who are buying your
in-app purchase things and we explained
them the entire model of the business
that it's the main anchor point by which
students are getting all those courses
because we want the experience for
students to be amazing and if student is
buying a course on the iOS app and is
not able to see the same course on the
desktop it's not a good thing so we want
to just make sure the students buy at
one place and get an access to all the
places without paying again to us and
again I don't know what kind of guy is
there on to my review process at least
and he's not ready to understand that
and he said that hey collecting of such
data is not allowed unless and unless
it's a huge business case and we
explained this yes this is a business
case we want to collect the information
of the students just the email address
so that we can allow
courses on every platform it's not like
that all the people read only from an
iPhone or an iPad people do read on
their IMAX people do study at their
Android devices so that's why please
allow us to collect the students email
and after that only we can allow the
purchase Apple being Apple they didn't
listen to us and instead I said that hey
if you want to explain these things to
us on a phone call we are ready to give
you a phone call trust me this was my
very first time and I saw such a long
process such a long rejection in the App
Store and even the matter came onto the
phone call now in the previous days also
I have seen rejections like 2 or 3 times
and again when developer submits that it
gets usually passed through that but
this time this is too much Apple I try
to explain them everything on the phone
call and the entire team is working here
really hard to make sure that our app
goes through all those review process
but Apple being Apple they are not ready
to listen to anyone I haven't counted it
but this time it's being like 12 or 13
rejections so far and that is why the
process is being delayed and this is
something really bizarre because all of
the things are making sense here I don't
know if I'm wrong here I might be wrong
and I'm not able to see that but I think
collecting the emails of the student to
provide one-time access for all of the
places does really make sense and a lot
of other peoples are already doing it so
this is whole of my experience what is
going on with the Apple and surely
through these videos I will be
explaining more later on that what kind
of more issues we are facing for the
learn code online app as well as other
experiences that I'll be facing for
submission of other apps now I have seen
a lot of rejection in the past due to my
small fonts due to not making graphic
like that much scripts or missing up a
3x time of the images I have seen all of
that most of the time it was like my
mistake that I had done there but this
time I'm not able to figure it out that
what is the mistake here having an
Android course was a mistake I don't
think so because it's a product and it
should be allowed in the in-app purchase
was collecting students email was a
mistake I don't think so because it's a
business case and
email-id is an anchor point through
which students are accessing courses on
every platform web mobile Android iOS
everywhere I don't think so it's a
mistake so on a whole note I would like
to say that here yes it might be a
mistake on my side but hey Apple at
least what you can do for the developers
is pointing out all those mistake at one
time so that developer can look out for
all those mistakes and don't have to
wait for an exponential growth of the
time that you take in your review
process I know well can already see this
the things are not going really great
with the Apple and especially the
release of the iPhone 8 before the
iPhone 10 and let's just be honest
something is going wrong at the Apple
side please Apple you are a great
company and I have seen other fruit
companies like blackberry that have seen
the fall I really don't want Apple to
fall here to make the situation from bad
to worst what you can do is involve
developers in such kind of situations
please don't do this Apple I really wish
that this company should grow up they
make amazing products and amazing
everything but hey Apple there is
something missing please figure it out
and solve that as quickly as possible I
