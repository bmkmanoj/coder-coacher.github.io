complete bootstrap for training now
let's go ahead and walk you through
again with the same file that we are
working in here now last time we just
walk you through let me just make it a
full screen in here let's maximize that
so this is what we got in the last video
but what we want to do now is use CDN by
the way CDN is the recommended way of
going through other things okay so what
we're going to do is let's just for the
time being let's comment out this link
style or sheer CSS and obviously it's
going to affect our documentation and
this doesn't look so good now and the
script file we'll leave it for a moment
and we'll discuss what is this CDN ok
CDN is actually a content delivery
network and the great advantage of CDN
is if somebody has visited a website
which are using the same CDN then it
just gets stores in the browser cache
and your website is going to reload or
load very fast because the person all is
already having all those Syrians like
jQuery tether and a bootstrap file
already in is cache and your website is
is not going to require to download all
these things again okay so let's just go
through with the CDN so it says
bootstrap CDN and by the way this is the
recommended way ok so although it says
yeah you can just link your style sheets
in here so I'm going to copy it again we
did that last time as well but this time
we're going to do it again I'm going to
delete integrity and everything we don't
need it I'm going to delete that and I'm
going to also remove the script tag
script tag needs to go at the end of the
body so this is the browser CSS that it
has given us basically it's this exact
same CSS file the magnified one and this
is being stored on to somebody else
server that we can use and that's what
the CDN is ok now in the last video I
skipped the step or even I didn't went
to the step of downloading the jQuery
and tether because I think that's not
what we want to do in here we want
efficient programming in here so this is
what we have
so our stylesheet is done if I save that
and reload that this is this is again
looking good so CDN works just exactly
the same now let's see why this guys
not working okay so if I go in here
there is no dog now basically I read
that in the documentation of course
everybody does that is what we need now
is we need tether and we need jQuery as
well so let me just go into the
introduction and I think there is a
starter template in here notice there we
go
and notice it just says that you need
tether this is the tether and you need a
jQuery as well so we can just copy these
couple of lines and can work with that
and notice it says jQuery first and
tether then and then bootstrap Jia's now
in case you don't like the CDN GS or the
code or jQuery CS you can always search
for something like jQuery CDN and
obviously it's going to give you a
jQuery CDN using CD and GS calm as well
so no big deal you can just grab it now
the best part about this whatever the
jQuery version you're using by the way
you can use the slim jQuery version as
well which is much more smaller than the
jQuery itself a lot of people complain
that the jQuery is quite overkill for
the bootstrap so what you can do is
click on this drop down and you can copy
the script the script tags there we go
the script tags in here and I can just
paste them here okay so the jQuery part
is done you can do it in here as well
let's go back in here going back to the
bootstrap documentation again I'm into
the getting started introduction and the
next thing that we have to copy is this
tether as well now obviously you can
just find out the tether CSS as well and
notice anything about 1.4 is going to
work so no big deal there okay let's
just look for the tether CDN and we
won't be looking for any the tether of
the CDN or we won't be going into the
jQuery or anything else I think the type
of CDN is not available in here it's
it's in here okay so there we go we have
a lot of tether CDNs in here so we can
just go with that I would like to go
with the this guy as well so I'll just
click in here and I'll click in here
copy that
first there should be jQuery and
thereafter there should be this tether
guy okay make sure you follow that order
because this is important order their
first comes in the jQuery then we have
got tether and then the bootstrap Jia's
now this is a perfect template that all
the time we are going to need okay we
will always be starting our code in here
inside the body but this is the one
common template that we are going to
require okay and I expect everybody to
save this file because we are not going
to be creating this file and again let's
clean it up a little bit because we
don't need CSS and anything we don't
need actually the CSS files and anything
we just need this one index.html file in
here okay so this is one good thing and
we are going to now follow up in the
later on videos we are always going to
go get started so as of now at this
point of video I want to show you that
this is all the setup we are always
going to need whenever I say use the
boilerplate HTML for code you're going
to use this particular code by the way
you will also get a link in the on the
resource section of this video about
github evade it from where you can just
clone this boilerplate code okay
so now let's move ahead into the next
section and talk a little bit more about
what advantages really the boot step
forward gives to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
