Internet of Things the most jargon word
the most confusing topic of right now
into on the Internet of course people
are developing apps for a tour there
will be models for it but again a lot of
people are still confused and that's why
we have after this topic first of all
thanks to these peoples who have
suggested for today's topic and in case
you want to suggest me for today's
technical talk which I all of them read
is a quick way is to just post me on the
social media like you can post on my
Facebook page the links are here and you
can also tweet me by the Twitter handle
it H calm its d/hh vom okay so let's
talk about what is the Internet of
Things so hope you're using internet
right now is heavily dependent on how
you understand the Internet of Things
like for example the present Internet is
based on some external devices like and
the user these are my things like
external things like phones or maybe my
tablets or something like that so in
order to use these internet facility I
need to actually access some device and
these device I have to carry on and I
have I have been carrying things them so
long that I forgot that these are
external devices that are not a part of
my day-to-day life I've made them a part
of my day-to-day life like mobile phones
so the goal is actually to integrate the
technology seamlessly in the new things
and that's why the name Internet of
Things in the things that I used it in
my daily life like my watch or my TV or
my pen or my helmet and what we'd like
to do is put in some kind of small
sensor into these technological pieces
which are officially called sensors into
some devices might be my air conditioner
right
like that one time once the sensor or
insight that they can collect some data
and transmit that data to another
gateway or maybe directly on to the
Internet and then we can actually do
tons of things without so with this a
lot of people are trying to contribute
into the I of T and that the latest
what's happening in the technology world
in the hyotei is well the company known
as arm has released the dedicated
operating system known as an MIT OS
which is specifically designed for I or
T's because other teams are not that
massive things it's a very small thing
that you need to integrate out there
seamlessly and the embedded OS is
actually dedicated for that it follows
all the protocols of IOT and goes with
light with light - ok so why do we need
an operating system since I'm talking
about that I need to explain a little
bit of technical stuff of the operating
systems so the operating system which we
are quite familiar with is multitasking
it's like your Android your iOS Windows
yes and couldn't put windows in that
category for right now just bear with me
so this is the one category which we are
quite familiar the another category is
the art sauce or the real-time operating
system which is generally in the
airplane store these sophisticated
devices which works on the real-time
analysis and things to be done in the
real time so that's the different
category but these operating system are
powerfully so you cannot use them at the
IOT imagine my helmet is IOT and I'm
just plugging it again and again to just
get some power so that's not possible
with IOT another is you can call them as
a bare metal but they are constant are
somewhat like the are toss because they
keep on looping and looping and trying
to find out that particular one event
which is responsible or triggering
another events or maybe some files or
some like that so again that's not
possible because with so much of the
code which is going to process a lot of
things it's not even possible we deleted
IOT that's why we needed a dedicated
system for that and that's what they are
doing with the embedded OS which is
currently an open source project so
that's why we need it done now when we
integrate this technology with IOT
devices it definitely needs a gateway to
pass on the information on to the server
or Internet or somewhat like that so
definitely gateways are a great way to
have that now that gateway might be a
separate device my might be your mobile
phones or may be of tablets or anything
like that okay but in order to transfer
that information from IOT to the gateway
we need a very reliable communication
source which is also not power-hungry or
you can call them as the low power
source so they usually transmit why the
technology or transmission channel then
ZigBee or maybe Pluto's or like that so
that's the whole idea what can be the
future implementation and all that the
tricky question let's get some questions
or some suggestions on that let's just
create a hypothetical situation let's
say I'm coming to my home it's very hot
here I want to turn on the AC before I
enter the room maybe there's 15 minutes
from my app of mobile phones that might
be great integration of IOT in the
air-condition with my phone that's
really awesome so again my AC needs to
be connected to internet Internet should
be on and my app should be connected to
the Internet as well now some of you
might be saying we are not that not that
lately we can turn on the air-condition
by going inside the home again folks we
have already become quite a lazy and we
will become more lazy with the
technology so hard case isn't that of
course we will become and we will like
to do that give me tons of example of
that let's take one more let's say I
want to drive in a car and let's say my
car engine light has turned on so what
right now I assume is that I need to see
a mechanic or take appointment from the
workshop
as possible otherwise I don't even know
that but imagine the IOT integration is
my bike or my car then when the light
turns on it automatically sends some
data of course with my permission send
some data to the dealer and dieter finds
out what's the problem calls me that
your problem is crucial you need to come
as quickly as possible you need to order
me all gadget some new of engine parts
or something like that so that can make
my life much more easier I can
understand what the problem is it's
really going to be very very crucial you
can see it tons of lives but let's say
you integrate that with a helmet IOT
being integrated with the helmet when
the helmet gets an impact it
automatically sends the data to the
nearest hospitals and hospital calls you
back and really if you don't pick up
with two or three calls it just sends it
to one to your location it can save
chunks of ice so with that this is just
a real-life examples that aren't do a
very small scale and of course you can
you can escalate it to a high level like
for example you can make entire home
which is smart out there but of course
with that security is a big issue
because nobody likes to live in a home
which is constantly being monitored by
some hacker or hacking can turn on the
lights turn off the lights make it
freezing cold or can stare your wife by
your webcam that's scary and creamy as
well but again security is an integral
part of the new technology so we have to
handle that a lot of companies are
working on the IOT Security's a lot of
conferences are happening and they are
trying to pin test these Smart TVs smart
and smart helmet I don't know whether
the helmet does have a pair or not but
again being a fan of biking I like to
this think like that okay so I think
this movie help you quite a lot to learn
about Internet of Things my small
request would be to subscribe to my
channel like the videos and of course
don't forget to follow me on the Twitter
and just send out the topic for in
general things you can send it to
anytime posted on my wall or just reach
me I eat all of them and whatever the
topic I like that I need to do this
today I'll be doing that but again I'll
be taking all of the topics we have a
lot of going on in the technology and
you can just work on with that I can
subscribe to channel and see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
