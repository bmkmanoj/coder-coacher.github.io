with another video and this is a page
from past talking to you all the guys in
future this video was recorded a little
bit earlier by the time you are watching
this video I'm already on a travel so
just onto a side note I'll be back in
this lovely amazing studio talking to
all of you guys on I guess 2nd of March
or maybe 1st of March I have a quick
travel for business stuff so I'll be
back but regardless of this I really
wanted to release this video and I have
absolute perfect timing and this video
is about our month evaluation
let me fill up all those people who are
not aware of this challenge that I'm
throwing up on my facebook and how do we
evaluate that so let me talk about that
but before that let's throw up an intro
for all those people who are not at all
aware about throwing up a challenge let
me fill you up about what we are
actually talking here I threw up a
challenge on my Facebook two months ago
that just pick up your stuff whatever
you want to learn either from learned
code online or maybe from whatever the
resource you want to learn just pick up
your goals and every single day I'll be
reminding you about your goal through my
Facebook page I'll be posting day one
day two and all these stuff so that you
can feel a little bit challenging and
can progress with that remember I always
say consistency is the hard work there's
nothing else if you are being consistent
or anything you can achieve anything you
can learn anything and results were
amazing in fact I have got amazing
results a lot of students are getting
amazing results and there is no charge
for that
just follow me up on my Facebook page
I'll be posting every single day you
have to also post on my comments that
day one day two and all that and it
works amazingly awesome now moving
further on that I have already released
out videos for January that what it went
up first of all I'll talk about how was
this month for me and then I'll share
some of the screenshots of people who
are doing amazing and what is my
experience about that so first of all
let's talk about how was this month for
me so February February being a very
short month it's obviously known for not
being very much productive but still I
achieved quite a lot the first big thing
that I did was rolling out a course on
Django 2.0 which is really having a lot
of difference from Django one point X
and two is really new stuff so I studied
a lot about from directly from
documentation because there is no book
or video course available for that I
rolled out a big nerd friendly course
and it is well appreciated a lot of
students are mailing me and saying that
they are enjoying this course learning a
lot about the backend stuff if you
haven't checked that out go ahead and
check that out
the second good thing that I did is
completing a project before time in fact
I just completed it ten days before the
actual deadline it included a lot of
progressive techniques regression
techniques by the way regression
techniques are a part of machine
learning and since I was not much of the
familiar
that time so I had to read a large study
a lot apply that on the clients project
it was an amazing project I really wish
I could use some of that code in my own
stuff but it's a client deal so I have
finished that it was really amazingly
productive there
I have also rolled out huge number of
videos on YouTube as well including the
web scraping series it's a mini small
series that still in continuation that
was also liked by a lot of people and
talked about a lot of important stuff on
YouTube so I would call this really
productive but even if you are not
impressed here I also travel to like
seven or eight universities in this
single month and I talk to a lot of you
guys what I was really impressed is
whenever I went to the University
student actually understood what is
actually the power of being consistency
what is the power of learning the things
they got serious about their careers in
life and a lot of you showed me what you
are actually building up a lot of
amazing Android apps a lot of amazing
iOS app concept based things I was
really thrilled to be all those
universities little bit hectic I really
did suffered a little bit on the health
issues because of such quick travels but
I absolutely loved it I don't really
care for it and I will be again
traveling if I'll be getting more
invites there so it was all fantastic
now coming on to the students side I
noticed that I was expecting that things
will be growing up on my Facebook page
that people will be posting but I can
understand this is tough
consistency is tough so compared to the
January it was really the decrease in
the number of comments about day one day
two but I I was expecting this and I
even expect that in the upcoming months
it will get a little bit down because
not everybody can be consistent and not
everybody can be hard-working but I
really noticed that a lot of new people
joined up as well as some of the people
who were absolutely consistent even more
consistent than me on posting those
things and learning the stuff people
learned a lot about front-end things
Android things and whatever they really
want to learn so
I'm really happy for all those people
who were continuous from the January to
whenever we started this exciting kind
of experiment and they continued all on
their path in February as well and I
welcome to all of the new people who
have joined up on the February and have
started to achieve their goal now if you
want to join us on this experiment it's
totally free it's not chargeable but it
does require a lot of consistency every
single day you have to work on your goal
and post on my Facebook page day one day
two it looks easy it's not is it
fruitful absolutely so in case you also
wanted to join up about this amazing
experiment of being more productive in
life
go ahead join up on my Facebook page
it's facebook.com slash hit a chartering
page and then you can simply just like
me there and every single day post these
comments that's it so now here comes a
lot of comments amazing comments of the
people on the post that what they are
trying to build how is the experience of
that and you can enjoy this amazing song
as well catch you up in the next video
I remember when you grabbed my hands
I wanna go back
you know I felt no pain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
