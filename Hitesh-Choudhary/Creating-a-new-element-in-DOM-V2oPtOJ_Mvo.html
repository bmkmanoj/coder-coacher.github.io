code online dot n if you haven't visited
lemon-curd online I have plethora of
courses there so let's get started and
talk a little bit more about JavaScript
so we have seen in the past that we have
learned a lot of stuff about it like
query selector changing the things but
one thing is still remaining we have
also learned how we can remove them we
have learned we can edit them but so far
we haven't learned how we can create
them now as I've mentioned probably
hundreds of time and my other YouTube
videos is that there is no book no
course or no video series which can talk
all about a one particular subject like
for JavaScript no matter how hard I try
I cannot cover all of them it's almost
impossible and that is why we learn
things on the go in this particular
video series our one of the many goal is
to create a simple to-do application it
can be done by various means we are
reaching towards that goal by learning
about them I'm saying all of this
because creating an element is really a
little bit subject which can be done
with a variety of ways I'm showing you
just one of them okay so let's learn how
we can create elements in this
JavaScript now in order to create
elements we need to first understand the
structure of our HTML the structure
really pays plays a really good role
here so notice we have learned that
everything is arranged in a document
object model document your file it's
object head tag body tag P tag and they
are some of them are the direct
children's of the body tags some of them
are not and this is how your Dom is
structured if you want to add an element
how do we add it let's just analyze that
when we directly write the code in an
HTML element for example I want to add a
P tag here so the first thing which I
did my brain did I don't even realize
that is I looked up for the body element
I didn't want it to start writing here
automatically I clicked in here because
I wanted to add in here so the step
number one is to find the place where
you actually want to write I have in my
mind selected automatically that I want
to write inside the body tag and then I
moved into this paragraph that means I
want to end I want to add my element at
the end of whatever the elements are
they're already inside this body tag
then first and foremost I add a P tag
that's it and just by adding a
it doesn't really make sense I can save
it probably hundreds of time still you
know already that nothing is going to be
showing up on the screen so there is no
sense of just adding a pee tag obviously
I need to add some text inside it
something like this was added wire HTML
something like this and when I save this
I go back here and I hit a reload and
obviously it is being changed again to
this but if I just come in this for a
moment come on we are learning something
allow us to learn and if I just go back
here notice this was added via HTML so
this is the process that we follow when
we manually add things and this is the
exact same process we follow when we
want to add something using our
JavaScript okay so I'm gonna uncomment
this to show you some of the stuff as
well so how we can add that the first
and foremost thing is to select
something where you want to add your
tags so how we can do that first of all
let's just call this as Const and my new
para something like that create call it
anything whatever you like and then what
we're gonna call it is a document and
there are many options how you want to
create that one of them is create
element and if I can find that there we
go create element and inside that you
can pass on whatever the element you
want to create in this my particular
example it makes much more sense that if
I add just a P tag but feel free to add
like things like h1 tags s to take
whatever you want to create okay so this
is the first step that we have learned
that my new para is a variable which is
going to be responsible for creating
that but it hasn't created anything yet
because I haven't mentioned where I want
to create or what I want to write inside
it ok so these are the two questions I
still need to answer so what I can do is
I can say my new para and I can say dot
text content what I want to add into it
and I'm gonna say I was added via Jas
okay so what I have done so far is I
have written
something like this in the HTML I have
written this P tag and I have done
something like this come on write a P
there and inside this P tag I have
written this copy that and paste that
okay so this is what I have written in
so far in the GS now I have selected
that and cut that on my clipboard notice
it is being cut it is there somewhere
but it is not there in my HTML if I go
back and save this file nothing going to
happen because it is still on my
clipboard it is being created in the
memory it is not there on my HTML in
order to put that in HTML I have to
select where I want to put it probably
at the end of the body click there and
add it there okay so that's the next
step so how we can do that once we have
done all these steps this two one now
the only thing that is remaining is
select an element where you want to add
it and just add it so what you can see
is document dot and always I use the
query selectors it makes much more sense
for me and in the query selector where
you want to add it in this case notice
I'm gonna add it to body okay so I have
selected my element the only thing that
is remained is where you want to add it
and one of them is append child append
child simply means append anything on
existing simply in HTML we have already
discontent I want to append my things at
the end of it and that's it and what you
want to append is depending on what you
want to put in this case I want to put
this my new para okay so my new para and
that's it you have learned how to create
an element just exactly how we do that
in regular stuff now notice one more
thing in here I have uncommented this
line from nine number ten to twelve and
this is changing all of my paragraphs
into I am changed using loop so can you
answer me as simple questions just by
pausing the video right here that
whether this appended element which says
I was added by a JavaScript will also be
converted into this line or not say yes
or no in the comment section below
okay so I hope many of you did try to
pause the video there and try to comment
it there
answer is no it will not be changed into
it the simple reason is as I mentioned
previously as well everything in
JavaScript and HTML runs from top to
bottom so first it just saw all the
elements and change that to into I am
changed using loop and then it saw this
code which is adding new elements so
that's why our last element will not be
converted so if I go back here notice
everything is changed using this loop
but the last one which says I was added
by jeaious is not gonna be converted in
case your goal is to convert that as
well what you can do is you can just cut
that and you can paste that at the
bottom obviously you know the answer now
everything will be converted into that
if your goal is like that okay I'm gonna
move it back onto the top because this
makes much sense in case this here okay
now coming back on to the point that how
we can add this appendchild and all of
that there are probably many other ways
to add elements into your object onto
your document in the HTML this is the
one that we have learned and this is the
one which will make much more sense for
our project that we really want to do so
now you have understood that how you can
add an element you can remove an element
you can edit the element I think almost
all the current functionality is almost
done with that now that is all done and
this is the only thing that I wanted to
talk about manipulating the Dom surely
there are few other things that I want
to discuss and after that we can surely
do a simple small project to brush up
our scales and to do whatever we have
learned so far so that's it for this
video and I'm gonna surely surely catch
you up in the next video hey did you
forget to subscribe that hit subscribe
on my channel come on that encourages me
