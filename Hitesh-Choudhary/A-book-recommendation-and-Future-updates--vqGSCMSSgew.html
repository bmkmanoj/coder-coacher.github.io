again with another video and in this
video I want to talk about some of the
past updates like how it can be updates
if it is from past but anyways these are
the few updates from the past some of
the future plans as well as I have one
book recommendation for all the people
who are interested in machine learning
or data science or a little bit related
field so let's get started in the last
few months I was little bit busy in
working for a head rubber-based
startup and I would not even call them
startup because although they are new in
the market but the technology on which
they are working it's pretty amazing
it's mostly a business-to-business
service that they are planning to launch
out very soon but it was an amazing
product and I happen to be a part of
that team probably if they will ask me I
will prepare a separate video for about
explaining their product and stuff but
keeping that aside it was an amazing
journey I learned a lot about machine
learning data science and especially
their recommender systems and it was
good payment good experience and all of
that now this brings us to the next
topic which is the book I want to
recommend all of you now it was most of
all recommender system that we were
trying to implement as a part of my
particular my particular job and it was
all amazing but for that I had to read a
lot just like everybody else and there
is no exception about reading you have
to buy a lot of books a lot of online
blogs articles so it has to be all the
way now well the book that I read during
last few months was a recommender
systems by Charu Agarwal I was
completely blown away by the details and
the way how this book was written and
how much efforts has been put up into
this book and personally I would always
always recommend this book from now
onwards anybody who is little bit
interested in recommender systems or is
interested in data science machine
learning a little bit matrix
manipulation using variety of libraries
regardless you're working on Python or R
it doesn't really matter the book is
fully thorough and specially the
examples about identity matrix and all
that up
amazing insanely crazy the book also
walks you through with variety of inside
details and real-world examples about
how the recommendations should be built
up and what you should take care about
the privacy policies of the users and
what you should be taking care about the
cave it points which should not be there
in the recommender system absolutely
love these few points the only point
that I would say that this book is
little bit onto the expensive side but
hey author has done a really great job
so respecting that I would say that yeah
it's a worthy buy and I would HIGHLY
highly recommend to buy this book now
the only point that I have about this
book is if there could be little bit
more easier examples on this book it
could have been like really the best
book but anyways are the examples that
are already included in the books are
pretty amazing but I was expecting a
little bit like on to the easier sites
of the example so that it could have
been easier to walk through into that
complex example but anyways I would say
I'll leave a link in the description as
well as on the screen if you are
interested in buying a book or summers
are coming up if you want to have a good
read in your shelf to read a little bit
about that I would also recommend the
kindle edition which is much cheaper as
compared to that still the same content
but a little bit lower price so I would
highly recommend to go through on the
Kindle one but anyways choice is totally
yours I'll leave the link in the
description below if you are interested
in recommender system or anything like
that again recommender systems by Charu
Agarwal the link is in the description
and again this video is not sponsored by
anybody not even by Charu girl or not by
the book I genuinely liked it so I
thought I should recommend it now this
brings us to the next thing which is
what's coming up next
now in the last few days or months I was
amazingly busy in preparing a course as
well as doing all this work for this
client and now things a little bit like
okay I'm into the relaxed mode now
usually my days are planned up before
what I am what the days are about to
come and everything is planned so that I
can just go through and without even
thinking I just keep on working but now
till the 15th of May I don't have any
much plan to do anything at all so it's
like a little bit free time for me and
I don't want to be free so what I have
planned for the upcoming few days now
obviously I do have like couple of
travels in between that and also some of
the family stuff will be going on in
these few days till the 15th of May and
I just wanted to get a little bit busy
so first thing that I'll be doing is
I'll be focusing a little bit on my
exercise routine and we will try to get
a little bit more into the shape and the
best thing that I would be doing is I
would be starting a series on JavaScript
on YouTube this is gonna be an amazing
series and I am expecting that everybody
is going to enjoy the cities but there
are some points about the series which I
cannot disclose right now this is a
surprise which is going to come up once
we complete the series this series is
dedicated only and only to the regular
subscriber of this channel and it's
going to be super helpful for you now
there is a little bit of the catch here
the catch is not about anything at all
and just all I'm saying here is watch
these videos regularly as quickly as
possible you can do as of now follow me
along in this entire series and within
probably a few days before I just catch
a back onto my plan on 15th of May we
will be able to finish up this series on
JavaScript and probably within a few
days you will have an extra extra scale
on JavaScript so I think that's it I
don't have much other things to share
all of the things are already done the
things that our plan are going to be
starting from 15th of May and that's the
whole update we are gonna be starting a
JavaScript series the book here I have
already recommended to all of you and
that's pretty much it be regular on to
the series watch the videos as quickly
as you can and learn them as quickly as
you can and that's it if you have
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
and hit that subscribe button because a
lot of videos are about to come on
JavaScript and I'm going to surely catch
you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
