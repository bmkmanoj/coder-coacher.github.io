with Sunday live so I'm waiting for
people to show up I'm actually a little
bit early early by 5 minutes but I'm
pretty sure people will show up so I'll
be waiting for a while for people to
show up and there we go yes we have
started to build up the community
already and if you are live already do
hit that thumbs up it's an easy way to
see me there that yes people are coming
up so hey everybody hey harsh
hey Muhammad Shah Rukh how are you how
hi Peter hi Rahul hi Mallick hi Bill hi
harsh I'll never stay as well no problem
in that let us say hello how are you
okay
so let's wait for a little bit while for
a couple of minutes so that a lot of
other people can join up can ask their
questions regardless whatever they are
tech related little bit off topic as
well so let's let's wait for a couple of
seconds in the meantime don't forget to
hit that thumbs up it's a thing that I
can see that yes people do love these
Sunday lies and I'm really happy to
announce that we have been doing this
for more than a month now Sunday lies
are awesome
people really can put questions if
they're facing problem in some
installations some other things or maybe
want to know some about other fields
that I dunno they can ask about it so go
ahead give that a thumbs up and we will
start in a couple of minutes in the
meantime I can say hello to everybody
hello Rajesh hello say yes I'm good how
are you new background yeah it's a new
background I'm not it's a little bit
thing so yep hey young kid
hey she she Burton how are you going
okay so let's get started and let me try
to answer a few questions
namaste Prashant how are you I'm good so
let's try to answer a few questions
let's take a few of your question
and try to answer them okay so let's try
with this one how web application and
mobile application world with same
back-end as an Amazon dot and now
everybody just like to that's a good
question actually and now anybody can
actually do that it's not like you have
to make up a good server push up a lot
of api's with that it's not like that
now it's really simple and you can use
firebase for that firebase is online
database or rather a back-end solution
and you can use same database same
features for your mobile app for your
next top app for your web application so
yes firebase is one of the solution but
for the rest of the things where we use
like Amazon Web Services and ec2 all
these there you have to make up a
database and use API in the Mobile's
like iOS or Android but yes I would say
if you're getting started there off our
base would be a good solution for you
okay okay Naaman says hello sir half
again felt great to talk with live with
you here that's why I allow also feel
really great to catch you all a few live
and to see that how people are reacting
what problems they are facing if I can
make your problem go away that would be
amazing
ok how do it a person from normal
engineering college from India get a job
at Google it's it's not actually that
tough if you want a job in the big
companies like Google or Amazon or
Facebook you have to be good at coding
or maybe designing as well so make sure
you focus on that programming there a
lot of Google code jams and lot of
opportunities there in fact due to my
youtube videos I got a job offer from
Amazon I didn't joined up there because
the job was thought of my interest but
yes it's it depends on your subject
expertise so it's really possible no big
deal there ok hello Sean hi sort of
please suggest some topic for my final
year project you can build up a lot of
things in Python you can build a lot of
things in android
to check out my Android course and take
all those 10 lists you can get some
inspiration from that you can just
redesign something from there so a lot
of options you can also check up my
github repository I did created a heir
ventures you can upgrade that or angry
analyzer is there at my github you can
try to do with that that's the InfoSec
project by the way ok so how to become
hacker
I'm very soon planning to do a video on
how to get started in ethical hacking as
well that will take a little bit while
but that will answer a lot of your
questions like do we need to learn
programming what kind of skills do we
require what's the scope of that future
options and all that so yes that video
is planned up and will come up very soon
ok can I know your contact number nope
do the more about courses you can write
me up email anytime you can ask at life
I don't like to share my personal phone
numbers most of the time my phone is
turned off because I'm either recording
the videos taking boot camps or in
meetings most of the time I would say at
least at least in 15 16 hours in a day
it's just turned off ok Abdul says it's
data structure is important to learn I
would say yes our data structure is
something that you don't have to focus
too much but a little bit while the
knowledge of the data base won't hurt
and especially if you know how to sort
the things efficiently and this kind of
thing it's it's important so I would say
yes end of the day it's all about data
management so yes data structures are
important especially the sorting
algorithms are pretty useful so focus on
them a little bit ok so it must Java how
to gain expertise advanced java or core
java it doesn't really matter because
the thing that gets you expertise is
doing more project and working on it
every single day so go ahead try to do a
lot of project ok so there we go so
starting with Android is so hectic what
to do I'm learning through Android
YouTube
on YouTube yes it might feel a lot of
hectic because you are learning from the
YouTube because YouTube things are
awesome don't get me wrong bear but they
are not organized in a well proper
manner
obviously these are free videos people
just thought hey I'll put that video
I'll put that video so there is no
organized channel of learning so that is
why it is hectic you can check out my
course or any other course regardless of
that that is actually far more better
way of learning because that is far more
organized and gives you best practices
as well okay but again feel free to just
hang around on the YouTube videos no
problem there okay so let's take up what
are the things needed for coding I would
say a laptop that's it or maybe a
desktop that's it and a lot of
determination lot lot lot of
determination so that is number one
thing and after that you just need a
laptop because there are a lot of
programming a lot of kinds of
programming so you can get started for
web android/ios maybe other things as
well next of applications will you make
tutorials on progressive a web
application probably probably in the
future react native course hi my your
react native course is going to take a
little bit while but there is a good
news for all the people who are into my
react.js course they will give they will
get a lot of videos on react native
absolutely for free as a course update
very soon so react native especially
building up the basic elements and
everything is gonna be there in that
reacts yes course as a free update so
yeah that's gonna come up but yes react
native course is going to come up very
soon ok Rahul says sir should we move
for nodejs or PHP I would say if you are
just getting started right now it would
be really good if you try with the
node.js first because again I'm not
saying that PHP is bad PHP is amazingly
awesome but for a modern web application
and modern job oriented things and
people are trying to move on don't yes
it's really efficient manages load
really well so I would say get
started with nodejs they just were says
why don't you make videos in Hindi I
don't make videos in Hindi because you
understand English as well there is no
such pants English here you understand
you're this kind of videos as well so
that is why and a lot of people are
there whose mother tongue is not in
Hindi they are from Tamil or maybe from
Kerala
maybe Andhra a lot of people are
watching this video so language is just
a way how I passed my thoughts to you so
you understand that and that's it okay
which language you specialized I would
not call anyone as well because I do
work in a lot of programming language
especially I work in Swift
I work in JavaScript quite a lot but I
know Python really well as well there
are a lot of other says oh hell there is
no such count for that as long as I am I
want to do something that's it okay hey
bro check out my app in finishin Stock
Exchange simulator in Play Store surely
you can drop me a link at my facebook I
will shortly check that out is it good
to start my career in cross-platform
like ionic why to go with the cross
platform for ionic first of all that's
the question do you really want your app
to make for both the platforms or not
depends a lot of questions are there but
again every point you are getting
started with coding is amazing and
that's the perfect choice
please start course on our at CSA yes I
am I ran at certified I have done it
quite a lot of certifications in Red Hat
maybe maybe I can plan that out because
Linux is amazing everybody should have a
little bit basic knowledge of Linux it's
it's awesome ok so let's go there and
let's answer a few more hey where can I
take course on information security
haven't you heard about learned code
online dot in yet I don't know if you
are on this channel and you haven't
heard about the learned code online
hey where have you been so yet nature do
check it out
okay in the meantime please hey
everybody do give this video a thumbs up
if you're enjoying these life session
these are something that motivates me so
let me see that counter going up like
that so do hit that like button okay so
super eclipta says how to fetch specific
data in android app from a website okay
API is our the base but I can understand
that you are looking for a specific data
that is not available via API in that
case you might want to learn regex
which is also known as regular
expressions it's little bit tough to
find information from a webpage so you
can launch a web view and from that you
can fetch up that information filter
that out using regex or regular
expression and can try that but again
it's not the easiest way so don't think
that it's gonna come up really easy why
you hear a same clothes it's easier it's
manageable it's less hectic and I don't
have to think about what I have to go
while wearing what I have to wear while
going live or anything so it's it's far
more easier I have really good knowledge
of programming and iOS and Android
development and I'm not even 12 past
then can any company hire me why you
want to get hired at so much early stage
if you know that all these things really
awesome go ahead get admission in
college or something if you're good at
something
make sure you polish it quite a lot why
you want to do a job after just 12 spend
a little bit more time in learning
should I learn JavaScript or jQuery ah
without JavaScript I don't think so you
can learn jQuery alternative for
firebase yes there are few alternatives
there is one back and less Gaurav and
there is one parse as well but for the
parts you have to host that from github
to Amazon web server there's a lot of
work but there are other alternatives
like hot 0 and back and less these are
the two that I know and
really awesome not as awesome as
firebase how much of jaw knowledge of
Java is needed to learn Android as Java
as was high because that's a good
question
I would say you don't need much if you
are if you are able to write loops and
functions and little bit knowledge about
classes and objects I think you are
ready to go in designing Android apps
okay so javascript language didn't got
your question javascript language these
two words doesn't make a question okay
when we will get ethical hacking videos
videos are already there at learned code
online how to get certificate from your
site as soon as you join of the course
finish up that course there will be a
quiz at the end finish that quiz with
the minimum marks mentioned there and
that's it you get a certificate react
native or Cortland I would could react
native I would go react native that it
is going to be my favorite in that
choice what is the difference between
free software and open source software
free software might be just free but the
open source software is something where
you get all the source code as well
thanks ash hey you're welcome Muhammad
how to create a messenger notified to
get alert that our favorite person had
logged in now because most of the time
had been wasting for them by checking
either that they have arrived or not
please make a video you can do that
easily with the firebase if that app is
yours
firebase 2 allows you to give push
notifications ok ok there are a lot of
questions coming up please do a video on
Google map and its implementation
Ashish where do you want me to do that
video on iOS or Android if you can
clarify that as well I can try to do
that no problem which is best PHP or
asp.net if that is the two choice I
would go for PHP ok which course is best
AWS or Salesforce
I'm a fan of AWS I would rather rather
say that ok
and okay murder is good hey bro check
out my website f innovation 17 calm
surely will try to do check that out
best web server Amazon web server or if
you are looking for a smaller one
Hostgator is good I'm not promoting any
one but Hostgator is a little bit good
and amazon web server is awesome tell me
name off some Android apps in Play Store
most of my Android apps are available at
github you can directly check them out
other reason why I push all of them to
the github instead of the Play Store so
that other people can also find the
every source code and everything there I
don't usually push them on my personal
name on Android store or either hand a
Google Play Store I would like to do
that much often because app really does
require maintenance and for the
maintenance you have to keep working on
it and I don't have that much type to
give that maintenance and everything so
that's why I don't push it much okay so
let's put up what is deep linking in web
in Android studio deep linking maybe
I'll try to make a separate video on
that that's a big subject ok how to
start react native canal if you want to
get started with react native I would
highly recommend to check out first
react GS because although it's not super
required but I have felt that if you
know all the concept like props and
components and state available all these
things then it's easier to switch into
react native so I would recommend you to
check out my course on at learn code
online dot in for react GS and to just
give you a little bit of date canal
there few videos of react native are
about to be added as a free update in
react GS course sir I wait for your
Sunday night so I'm here didn't miss
that it was really tough for me today to
get live but still I managed it ok some
project topics on machine learning
there are hundreds and
hundreds of topics and machine learning
like face detection handwriting
detection you can do a lot of things
so going from Python to Java you would
not like it trust me because Python
people are habitual of writing very
small code and in the Java you write
that much of the code how to become
hacker okay we will answer that answer
that hacking is going to come up when
the competition will start a competition
will start in about less than a month or
so I have given all of you a heads up so
that everybody can practice and
everybody can participate in that yes it
will start and we are also planning
competitions for Android apps as well
I'm preparing a few api's that you have
to use in that Android app so that will
also come up very soon okay how is
darker useful for web developers I would
like to talk about the Dockers in a
separate video
it's getting really powerful because dr.
is something where you install all of
your dependencies your favorite things
your favorite software's and you code
there as well so that is gonna come up
okay please make a video on progressive
web development we'll try that we'll try
it very soon hi Priya how are you sir ha
sir between PHP are no js' for which
language we should give more focus if
you're just getting started I would say
no it would be no it should be your
first choice but again don't forget to
learn PHP as well for some smaller level
of the code or smaller websites PHP is
amazingly powerful you don't want to pay
pick out big guns for just smaller talks
so again both of them are required at
some stage unlearning web application
using PHP MySQL I and Java Script so in
additional to that should I learn more
language I think that that should be it
for right now because if you are
focusing quite a lot in JavaScript
learning other things should be easier
for you so I think it's a good start
good start get get going on that is that
anything instead Java to get strong on
oops concept because Java gives stuff
a lot of other languages like Python is
totally object-oriented get started with
that you'll get all of those concepts in
Python as well Java is awesome in that
Python is there a lot of other Swift is
also there if you are on a Mac ok please
reply me Rahul hey I am replying to you
rob
where can we share our app for free
another way like Play Store github
github.com if you are not aware of that
that is one way ok can I start with Java
I don't know programming yes surely
everybody and anybody can start directly
from Java there is no such thing as you
have to learn C first and all of that
no that's the all jargon ok tell us
about use of cloud computing you're
using already a lot of places cloud
computing it's it's quite massive I
would like to make a video on it someday
but you are already using cloud
resources and it's not about just cloud
computing it's split it into various
things like software as a service and
platform as a service so saspa saspa
there are a lot of things so yes already
you are using quite a lot ok so what are
your views on Python Django for
developing web apps ah not so good views
because Python Django is by the way
really awesome and amazing and people in
Python really want to do everything in
Python so that's awesome
it works really great for a small scale
application until unless you are having
extreme traffic and data it it's works
really great but there will be certain
points we will think that hey Django is
not working out and I would like to go
for something more robust like react
native or maybe PHP or something like
that so yes it's awesome for small-scale
application it doesn't really break
anything ok so yeah yes Android course
is that awesome thanks I'll say thanks
for the heads up hey people did you
forget to hit the thumbs up there I
think so a lot of you did don't forget
to hit that thumbs up we really do need
that
I will be able to give spent ten more
minutes with you it's a lot of work
hanging around there hi our still I
managed to get up there
okay please reply Adam versus bracket
versus sub line okay that's that's a
tough choice but I like to use Adam all
the time but I always keep some lime
text there because for some of the
reasons I always keep it there and some
time I found myself hanging around on
the sublime text so yes that is there oh
how can I earn money for bye good laptop
I know HTML CSS and little bit J's
please step you have to first focus on
learning because after learning only you
can make websites and everything so do
practice a lot of projects there is a
competition coming up for ten thousand
rupees at learned code online out at
this channel here as well open to
everybody
no registration charge or anything open
to everybody everybody can participate
without even but putting any money or
anything there might be some
registration as well but no registration
fees because I have to sort out and
select everything okay
once I saw I thought tattoo of triangle
and I on your head explained of I tattoo
it it's it's still here if you can see
idea it's still here it's a universe
it's not an eye it's a pyramid it's an
infinite pyramid i I did it in Egypt so
it's there probably we'll talk about it
later someday okay tell me about
yourself
what is your journey there's a video
that says I resumed a you can check that
out I think that's almost my journey
well that's old that's almost 2 year old
so how can we customize push
notification using firebase what kind of
ok I think I know what you try to ask
there is not much of the customization
that firebase allows you on Android
specially in the iOS it's far more more
customizable but I can understand it's
not much customizable ok so your flexbox
series is just fantastic hey thank you
so much because
I am trying to make sure that I take a
little bit time out of the busy schedule
and post at least a video on flexbox so
that you can upgrade your knowledge
flexbox is awesome and I think everybody
should learn it who has a little bit
knowledge of CSS because later on in the
future apps are going to move into HTML
CSS NGS flexbox is the way to handle
that okay
how to start with GUI programming uh
what is your base language because it's
not just GUI you can just not drag and
drop and do things
what kind of GI you are looking for
because it can be done using Java it can
be using done in electron using
javascript it can be done using Python
it can be done using C++ as well so what
kind of thing you are looking for sir it
is ionic worth learning please reply hey
Shubham ionic is awesome but I would
highly recommend to check out react
native as well okay screen size versus
orientation how to tackle
I have already tackled it down when I
was making all the iOS videos and
Android videos so check out them in the
course how to send user-centric
notification using firebase I think for
that I have to make a video for the
user-centric because you have to filter
out the data from your database first
look out for all the emails that you're
looking for there is a lot your data
model should be designed like in that
way I think I'll make a video for that
that's an interesting subject a smart
one at LC oh it's not LLC hits NCO LLC
is a Kashmir it's line of control we are
working on LC or learned code on life
okay
share your apps check out at github.com
I had do have a tons of repositories at
github check it out does connection
matters for jobs college matters for job
like IIT no it doesn't it doesn't
sorry offered Swift language yes Swift
is there at learn code online it's an
amazing course new upgrade is also about
to come it's gonna be on iOS 11 and it's
to be one of the fantastic course I have
ever produced okay so I know you don't
use Java much but how I have often heard
that Java is most complete language due
to application in various domains and
computer sense can you tell me some of
these domains
yes Java is being used quite a lot I
don't work much in it but still I have
to manage a few Android apps that I am
already managing so I do use it it can
be used pretty vastly in mobile
application and desktop and web apps as
well but there is a but here that it
works really fine in the Android but
doesn't work really great on web
applications especially the scalability
part it's a lot of had a lot of the word
can I need to be done when it comes to
the web application for web application
there are bigger giants that can handle
things much more better manner easier
manner so I would recommend with that
guys okay what is Geok iOS operating I
don't want to talk about gee how much in
this video okay productive things for
CSE students in summer holidays there is
just one amazing productive things which
is learned code online dot in go ahead
check that out it's really productive
some info about recession right now in
the market recession is always going to
be there it's about if you're good at
something if you're amazingly awesome
company cannot let you go you will be
getting back-to-back job offers if you
are something amazing in that particular
tech or a lot of text so make sure you
focus on learning rather than worrying
about hey jobs are not there and
everything because if you're something
amazing everybody would like to hire you
regardless of there is a recession or
not or things like that
okay okay completed half your Android
course a facade that's awesome and you
are about to make some awesome apps
because the half part was just like
getting started yet
after that the fun stuff starts ok
should I continue with it or need
changes for market demand ok there's a
question there I didn't find C and C++
interesting I like to code in HTML CSS
and JavaScript and PHP if you like
something just do it don't
worried about I should be working on C++
I should be working on that if you like
PHP and HTML just go there that's it
okay Prashad say they said is best thank
you so much I liked it and I can see a
lot of people are pushing that thumbs up
thank you so much thank you so much guys
okay so we have asked answered a lot of
questions span hi I have spent almost 30
minutes I'm running a little bit out of
the time I don't have much time today to
spend with you probably in the future we
will expend these a sandal is a little a
bit longer I have to get back to work
