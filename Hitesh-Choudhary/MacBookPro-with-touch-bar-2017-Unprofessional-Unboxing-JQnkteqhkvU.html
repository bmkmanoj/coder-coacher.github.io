video and today we're gonna do an
unboxing and in case you don't know we
don't do much unboxing on this channel
but sometimes we do our unprofessional
unboxing now in case you are not aware
what is unprofessional unboxing it's a
simple kind of unboxing that everybody
does at home and so we're gonna do that
now there are a lot of professional
unboxers here on this platform YouTube
so go ahead watch those channel if you'd
really like to watch how professionally
the Box are open but we are gonna do it
unprofessionally it's upside-down sorry
so there we go so this is what we are
gonna do unboxing here but recently I
have actually set up a one more break
which is like a top shots are gonna see
some of the shots from me so without any
further ado let's get started and we
need to change this camera lens because
this is not wide enough for our
unprofessional unboxing let me do that
quickly so this is super wide lens and
yes I can probably do an unboxing up
like this much of a box but this is just
a teeny tiny box so there we go this is
our box and we are gonna unbox this and
now yes I know the title says it MacBook
Pro can focus on this okay I think it
can okay
and before we unbox this hey Apple
haters I invite you to just come in the
comment box and just say hey you have
purchased a bad device hey this is not
the latest one this is not the modern
one come on go ahead you can do really
better than this so go ahead and just do
that but yes on top of that I have
bought this and we're gonna bring back
our pen because we do our unboxing let
pen strange because this is not a
professional boxing so how I can open
this okay there we go
see pen also works you don't need a
professional knife for that
do this let us see that there we go
the final magma flow is here how they're
gonna put this up boom there we go nice
and easy so this looks pretty awesome
pretty cool it's a nice finish here so
what people do is now we're gonna move
on to our next rig that I have just
built and we're gonna do rest of the
unboxing there so let's just move their
part
if you
you call me early morning he was our
baby you was out lately
drinking with your girls and you come
through but every time you do we fight
I'm only asking once can we not do this
I don't want a finite I'd rather kiss
your lips and undress you so that was my
other rig where we do unboxing so just
back here okay so what we're gonna do is
I accidentally turned it on this this is
a pretty dope MacBook and this was a
quick unprofessional unboxing of it it
comes with a touch bar I don't know
whether I'll be using it as far that
often or not but this is it there is
nothing much to do there is a laptop
there is a charger and that's pretty
much it
of course no ports just four ports that
doesn't do much here so this is your
basically and you know what this time I
have bought the Space Gray one it looks
white in the light but it's actually the
grayish one I hope you can see that oh
there you see so it's the black one I do
already have had the white one let me
show you that so previously I was having
this MacBook which is bulky and beefy
have all the ports that you can wish and
the only thing that I missed from this
old MacBook is its light when you turn
it on it actually glows when you turn it
on actually I hope you can see that no
you cannot see that so he just glows
when you turn the light on well this one
it doesn't blow up so that's it that's
pretty much it for the unboxing
unprofessional unboxing of the new
MacBook Pro for sure I'll share the
feedbacks of how this device performs
and everything maybe later on if you
wish that but these unprofessional
unboxing are just fun videos if you want
to see the more professional kind of
unboxing and what actually the content
how this matte finish looks like and all
these things you can probably watch it
dozens of other video this is just fun
stuff so that's it for this video and
I'll surely catch you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
