code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey did everyone who
they sheer back again with another video
and in this video we are talking about
flutter so in case you are not aware
flutter is a tech designed by Google and
is recently being launched the flutter
is an amazing tech and as mentioned on
their website flutter is a mobile sdk
meant for designing high performance and
high fidelity mobile apps for iOS and
Android using a single code base I know
this sounds a little bit jargon so let
me try to break down all of these things
for everybody so that everybody can
understand that but before we even do
that let's roll up the intro
first and foremost we need to talk about
what flutter actually is and what
flutter is not a lot of blogs
I have even read a couple of them are
saying that flutter is the googles to
reply to Facebook react native in case
you are not even aware about the react
native just check out the link in the
description I have talked quite a lot
about react native in fact I do have a
separate course on react native so just
take a look on that now coming back onto
the point I would disagree on this point
not completely but on a little bit that
flutter is not at all at reply to
Google's or for the Facebook's who react
native its little bit different than
that now first and foremost difference
is that it doesn't use any of the tech
stack which is most popular on the
Internet react native uses HTML CSS and
JavaScript not exactly HTML it's a JSX
but moreover it's moreover dependent on
the JSX
while the flutter is nowhere like that
let us say is that we are focused on a
single codebase and this single codebase
is going to produce ios and android app
now they are not saying that for this
codebase they are using the popular
languages like JavaScript or swift or
maybe other languages like C++ or even
Java they are saying we are coming up
with our own language known as dart not
their own language exactly but it's not
so popular either as well I try to
download some of the flutter built that
they have given on the github and try to
run them as well try to little bit
tweaking about the codes as well I found
that dart is not so hard it's relatively
easy but still finding people who
already know dart is going to be a
little bit challenging the biggest
selling point of this flutter take is
two things the first is their high
performance app and the second one is
hot reloading now obviously we can point
out here that Google is aware about the
miracle that Facebook has created that
their app can be reloaded now just
bringing up your your attention to the
point that dart and this whole flutter
thing as well as react native things our
business solutions for example if I took
up the apps
Netflix Amazon Prime or maybe Amazon now
they are already a stable business and
they need their iOS and Android app now
flutter and react native gives kind of a
business solution to these companies
these companies would like to hire a
single team so that they can have a
single codebase and can manage their iOS
and Android app it reduces down the cost
quite a lot as well as managing of the
team and the code base is much more
easier so obviously now a lot of
technologies are looking forward to
somehow recreate their apps for Android
and iOS using these technologies and yes
hot reloading is an amazing thing which
is available in react native as well as
in flutter you just save the app and
just like you do on the web you just hit
a refresh and your code gets refreshed
now imagine on a side note just imagine
that Facebook SDK is would be so
humongous if it would have been designed
in just Android and you hit a recompile
so many things need to be recompile and
it would take probably days or not even
hours or days to just recompile those
app so obviously hot reloading is a tech
which is kind of a necessary when your
application or your product goes like
insane crazy like Facebook so let's talk
about this Dart what is this Dart now
dart is a programming language that is
being used by flutter it's relatively a
kind of a unknown programming language
for most of the people in fact for me it
was really new I never heard about the
dart and I just came to know about it
through the googles conference which
they kept for the flutter and I tried to
tweak into a little bit of the code
downloaded off from the github given by
the Google guys at flutter and I checked
it out and I found it relatively easy
it's not at all a hard language so
eventually people are going to learn it
pretty comfortably I don't think there
is a like steep learning curve for it
it's rather easy but yes I would be
little bit on to a downside with the
selection of the stack here because they
could have done a little bit better job
in selecting the stack of course they
are making a point that dart is really
fast we are using a C++ base engine so
it's not Oh am widget dependent so it's
relatively fast but again the point is
that now
a lot of people are already in the
market who knows the dark so that makes
me that this technology I will wait for
some time that whether this tech is
growing or not because the selection of
the stack is little bit picky here
coming back on to the point that how
easy is start yes if you are familiar
with JavaScript or Java or you have
programmed in probably in any other
language you will find really
comfortable with the dart dart also uses
a lot of a CSS part as well so you'll
find a really comfortable if you are
good in front-end tech especially in the
CSS you'll find really comfortable here
of course the base focus is the somehow
using of HTML and CSS for making their
UIs
now one thing that I like about this
flutter is they are saying that it
already comes up with a built in
Cupertino as well as material design so
whether you are moving for completely
iOS experience or Android experience
that is going to be relatively easy and
you don't have to use third-party
anything that we like to use and react
native also I would like to mention that
the flutter team is little bit behind
the schedule of launching the flutter
because I think they could have launched
it a little bit earlier or at least when
other react native was taking their
popularity already react native is so
much popular that flutter is going to
have a really tough competition in
making the market space or taking the
market space as compared to react native
already so many libraries so many apps
are already using it and in fact
Facebook showed it really really a bold
move by converting their Instagram and
all these apps already into react native
and showing that yes this that can
handle all the tropics and all the
performance issues already it is there
now all the things that is we are seeing
about the flutter is you can read in the
documentation as well that they are
saying that flutter is being used inside
the firewall which is really an issue
because Google is a big company of
course but it is nowhere near about the
traffic that is getting by on a real
world app so I would really like to see
some of the apps by Google like maybe
Adsense or AV or some kind of these apps
being designed in flutter and showing in
the market that yes we can actually do
that and flutter can handle all kind of
such traffic of course
do that but I would really like to see
an example set up by Google directly
there
so yes flutter is a really interesting
topic and and Kelly and I can talk quite
a lot about it probably in the upcoming
videos I will do that but let me know in
the comment section that if you are
interested in knowing more about the
flutter attack or maybe I should
download some of the stack on my
computer and can show you that how
things can be edited and kind of
initially now one more thing that I
would like to mention here is will I be
using flutter for production for my
clients anyway even if client asked my
answer is no not at all I'm not gonna be
using flutter as of now because right
now the flutter is in alpha mode so it's
not even in beta and even I most of the
time I try to avoid the betas in the
production so as of now flutter is good
for playing around or to see how it is
evolving but for the production I'm not
gonna be using it as of now but this
doesn't means and negative about the
flutter I'm super positive whenever
somebody says that we are having a
single codebase and you are having a hot
reloading for your mobile apps
I am totally optimistic and totally
positive about that so on a final note
flutter it's a good move by Google
probably they are a little bit late on
making this move but yes it's a good
move I would surely like to see how
things are going to be evolving in the
future I'll be keeping a close eye on
this and surely I'll talk about that in
the future so let me know in the
comments section what are your thoughts
about the flutter by Google as well as
what you think how is it going to take
on to the market compare to react native
I know this video comes up with a lot of
jargon words as well and I'll leave that
link in the description about the
flutter official documentation so go
ahead check that out as well
so that's it let's just wrap this video
in case you have enjoyed this video give
it a thumbs up in case you have enjoyed
it more do share it on Facebook and
Twitter as well do hit the subscribe
button in case you are new at this
programming channel in this tech world
we talk about programming on this
channel as well as some of the other
stuff as well so that's it for this
video and I'll surely catch you up in
the next one
