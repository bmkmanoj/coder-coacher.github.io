with another video now this video is a
little bit again a little bit different
and this video is going to be all about
my first impression when I try to learn
and do a little bit of project work in
the react native now again before we
even begins with this tutorial I would
like to mention a clear-cut fact here
that this is not at all a tutorial for
react native at least not this one we
may come up with that later on but right
now it's not a tutorial it's just a
general opening what I think about the
react native as I was trying to get my
hand dirty with this really awesome
thing so let's get start it in here now
without wasting much more of the time
let me tell you what is my first
impression now before that I have to
talk about a little bit of the incident
that happened a little while ago now I
was the one of the very first early
adopter of the parts which is kind of an
online a database service which used to
be there
now due to one of the project I had to
switched up on to the firebase and after
that I was I got completely stuck with
the firebase because I liked it so much
I also liked the parts and I was kind of
an early bird adopter of parts I liked
it so much and I thought these two
services are top-notch quality I think
they should exist forever and suddenly
after that Facebook came up and shut
down the path now some people will
disagree on that point because Facebook
has moved this thing on to the github
now it's completely open-source you can
deploy your own ews server and
everything but still the service is
actually out of the market now it's not
as much good as now the firebase is
because the parse is going on now you
might be thinking why I am just talking
about these things now this is to put
important because when we talk about the
react native the first thing that got to
my mind is it's being backed up by the
Facebook and Facebook has a pretty
dominant history about shutting down the
things and that is something I cannot
get out of my mind and that is something
worrisome about this Facebook project
okay now let's also talk about what is
the learning curve
and what are my initial thoughts about
the react native now I was really free
in these days I I was taking a couple of
videography and all those classes so I
thought let's go a little bit deep into
technology as well and I tried up react
native now the first impression is a lot
of people are using it it's so much easy
so much cool because in case you have no
idea what the react native is it's kind
of a framework or moreover a library
framework ish thing where you can write
your HTML CSS and JavaScript code and
the same code will produce a code for
iOS and for the Android so your one code
which is basically at that based
language HTML CSS JavaScript will
produce the native application for iOS
and Android and that is something cool
and I would really like to see this as a
growing feature because one language for
everything that that's the futuristic
approach for sure and I liked it and
it's not a hybrid app because most of
the time hybrid app are just like a
wrapper in a in a browser and all of
your applications are just running into
it so not not a big fan of a hybrid app
I'm more with a native app guide
specially in the Swift and iOS
environment here so I like the approach
first of all I digged into it I liked it
so much so much awesome so I started it
to download the stuff a couple of
repositories and NPM packages modules
and everything now my initial impression
was hey there is a lot of things to do
because to just build up a boilerplate
code there is so much of the things that
you need to do of course before you do
so you should be aware with I would say
JavaScript version 6 or broader
technically correct X my script 6 the
latest version of the JavaScript so you
should be aware of it as well now after
you are aware of that you should also be
aware of something I would like to call
this as the style of writing the code in
the modern web application now there is
no good name for that but it's kind of a
approach of writing the code of the
components and the direct
is which you might have already seen in
some of the angular application ionic
applications or maybe the node
applications you might have seen this
kind of writing style of the code way to
divide the things into components and
stuff so you might have already been
familiar with that if you are into the
latest modern web application
development as well now I thought that
it's really a good thing I liked it but
definitely there is a lot of learning
curve now the great thing is that there
are a lot of github repositories which
can give you a boilerplate code and you
can just get started directly no problem
at all
but since if you are a learner or you're
trying to explore more things about
react native you would work you surely
would like to just save all the files
write the boilerplate plate code by
yourself so definitely here is a lot of
learning curve and it takes a lot of
time now at first I definitely wanted to
write and go ahead everything by my own
with the documentation little help and
here and there and everything but from
now onwards obviously I would be looking
for the boilerplate code on the github
and I'll be just using that converts
directly so that is it now my personal
is kind of a look or you can say initial
experience with the native I liked it
quite a lot I would be definitely going
more into deep but there is still one
thing that is bugging me up is whether
this is going to be a stable branch and
is going to be developed in the future
or not that's it that is the one thing
that is still keeping me away from
getting full fledged into it now
definitely I know that when I will be
working with the Swift or maybe Android
for Java these technologies are not
going anywhere they are heavily platform
dependent and they're always going to be
there it's not like Apple is going to be
shutting down the Swift if they have
removed the objective-c they have
introduced the Swift early on and it's
much more stable it's gonna be there it
should be there but on the other side if
someday I wake up and I see that hey we
are not going to support react native
any more all of my apps that are on
Android or maybe on the iOS are nowhere
I have no
whether alternative I have no
competition around so that I can pitch
on when pass got shut down
I had an alternative to move everything
on to the firebase so that is something
which was there but for the react native
there is no such thing and there is no
such viable stable words words from the
Facebook saying that hey we are going to
develop this branch and we are pretty
much committed towards it it's not there
it's just still in the early phase and
that is the one thing that's still
keeping me off but again this doesn't
means this is not a good technology this
is something which I was expecting for
quite a long time this should be their
one language for the web one language
for the Android and one language for the
iOS I think there can be nothing nothing
better than this when you have a simple
experience in HTML CSS and JavaScript
with a little bit styling of different
style of writing code you can produce as
the lighting feels nothing better than
this but again I would say so keeping it
on to a summary there is a learning
curve quite a lot I would say you should
be familiar with the ACMA script 6 as
well that is obviously going to be there
and the new style of writing code a
modular more modular code like with the
components and directives that should be
there apart from that stability is a
still issue in my mind but again this
doesn't means I'm going to be stopping
learning this technology it's pretty
awesome but for right now I'm going to
be staying with the native app
development and I won't be switching
into the complete let's react native
kind of app developer now I would be
staying with the Swift for now but again
technology changes in every quite month
so I'll update you what I think about
that when I'll be doing some more deep
project with it right now it's just I'm
scratching the surface right now so I'll
catch you back when I'll get with more
experience with this technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
