another video now we have got some
interesting comment in here and if
you'll read the comment in here that
says how to think like a programmer make
a video on that and at first I thought
hey it's not a good topic I just
scrolled over it but after it after a
second I just say oh my god that that's
a good topic and at first you might be
thinking hey programmers are just normal
people and they just think like
everybody else does and that's pretty
much it but now in fact I just taught
exactly the same being a programmer for
so many years I also taught exactly the
same just like you are thinking but
there is so much more that the
programmer things and is attitude
towards the life and attitude towards
the problem that makes him a programmer
so in this video I'm going to talk about
how to think like a programmer or try to
think like a programmer so let's get
started and it's time to roll that intro
okay so let's get started here so this
was a very interesting comment that how
to think like a programmer and I want to
explain that in a bit more detail so
that you can understand the thought
processing behind doing any project
finishing of any project or in fact to
learn any new language or to learn any
programming language at the very first
time and for that you have to come
closer so coming here so yes I do
completely agree with you that
programmers are just normal people the
common people who just write the code
but what makes them different is that
approach how they take down the things
okay so let's start by a step by step
approach of a programmer now the very
first thing that a good programmer
should have is patience yes patience is
the most important artifact that any
programmer can have if you don't have
pace
you cannot learn programming and in fact
that would be true for anything else as
well you cannot learn swimming you
cannot learn basketball you cannot learn
cricket or anything that you are doing
you cannot learn that without the
patience and this is the one thing that
is being required quite a lot but people
and students in fact I have seen a lot
of student just after writing 20
programs they are saying hey we are not
good in logic we are not getting the
logic of the programming we are not able
to build the logic my dear friend you
have just written 20 codes there 20
programs what does it it's nothing this
is the amount of code that every day I
write and throw up in my garbage can
there and in fact most of the
programmers who are working there just
write the code delete them quite a lot
this happens a lot but the key aspect is
patience
so until unless you have returned
hundreds and hundreds of piece of
programs that does something you won't
be able to understand the logic just by
writing 20 or 30 programs and you are
saying that I am not getting the logic
in there is is not right programming
does take a time now understanding the
syntax performing a project and just
getting there will take around a 5 or 6
month with a good amount of training
nice instructor and everything there but
apart from that it takes years to master
that kind of confidence level that you
are looking up for yes I know it's a lot
of time but yes programming do requires
years and years of experience it's not a
magical thing that you can get within a
month or within a week it's it's not
going to happen yes definitely you can
get better in learning the syntax
writing the codes and everything but
there is also one key important thing in
here with that now once you have got a
good amount of experience with the
project and you have done these things
in one language moving on to the next
language is always much more easier
because all of your experience
regardless of the programming language
whatever it is JavaScript PHP whatever
it is it's also going to come and going
to transfer into the different language
as well ok so patience is the most
important thing in here now as a big
nerd the second important thing is
consistency so think like a programmer
a programmer writes codes every day and
if even after shutting down the computer
is keep on keep on thinking about the
programming and it's stuff like that so
be consistent in that so these are the
two important points in here okay now
how else programmer things now
programmer is optimistic guy who is very
positive a very very positive he all
these things like hey things are going
to get up very soon so things will be
made up things will be done so he's
never like hey I'm feeling low I don't
want to write code because I'm not good
in solving problem I won't be able to do
it no that's that's not a programmer a
programmer is something who always looks
at a problem and we disguise of angles
to solve that maybe breaking that
problem into smaller chunks so maybe
trying to solve that from different
angles different perspective it's just
the same things and apart from that
writing loops and arranging things in
there is is just a part of the plan so
these are the few important things that
the programmers do keep in mind now one
more thing that I would like to add in
here is programming is not the easiest
thing on the planet it does require a
certain amount of luxuries as well
luxuries like having a laptop having a
dick stop or having us sometimes having
a mobile for sometime having a good
powerful computer these are some kinds
of luxuries that programming does
require so let us say I want to design
apps for iOS and want to publish my app
in app store for by Apple then certainly
I do require a Mac there it can be a Mac
Mini at a Mac iMac just like I'm using
or maybe a MacBook macro it doesn't
really matter but that comma that kind
of luxuries you need to have and why I'm
calling these as luxuries because yes
avoiding a laptop is not the easiest
thing spending like a forty thousand in
Indian rupees or maybe a fifty thousand
rupees is it's not for everyone and not
everybody can do that so depending on
what kind of goal you have there are
certain luxuries of course you can do
programming on a very basic laptop but
that won't be a high-end programming
like
having Maya 3d or maybe rendering of the
videos or maybe things like that so I
hope you've got my point and similarly
to design app for Android store you need
a good amount of RAM in your computer
and all these stuffs and on top of that
you should have some experience with the
device in itself again there is no such
requirement while coding all of these
things but if you don't have the device
you will never get the field that what
you want to really do because you don't
have experience with the device so you
don't understand how the user will
behave and you will give certain amount
of feature or certain things to the user
so that is also very very interesting
and important thing in here so yes
thinking for the programming is a bit of
this different kind of experience for
the video for me and I can talk a whole
lot about it but thinking for a
programmer I would like to sum up the
entire video as just one word coders
don't quit regardless of whatever things
are happening whether the code is
running or not whether things are going
in their direction that they want to or
just going into the completely opposite
direction coders simply don't quit they
research a lot they do a lot of googling
and stuff they take a lot of code from
the Stack Overflow and they just paste
the code in their application quite a
lot of course they always change logic a
little bit different otherwise the code
is not going to work but yes this is how
the programming life goes on in case you
are thinking that programming life is
exciting no it's not action movie that's
going to happening around there you will
be sitting and solving a lot of problems
just from your computer but the impact
that you can make on the society is they
be huge then compared to anything else
perhaps am little bit biased towards the
programming but yes that's how I do and
that's how I work so imagine the uber
solving a huge amount of problem just
sitting on a computer desk so yes these
kinds of things happen and one thing
that every programmer lacks around and I
suggest all of the programmers should do
is go ahead get yourself a hobby because
you're spending a lot of time on
computer and until and unless you are
picking up some good hobby you are
working quite a lot so pick up a hobby
and take care of your help so that's all
for in this video and again I am reading
all of your comments so if you have
something that I should be making up the
video do post down in the comment
section below
I'm checking all of them and I'll catch
you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
