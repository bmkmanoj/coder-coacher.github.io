code online dot an amazing resource
have you checked it out yet if not no
problem let's just go ahead and get
started with our JavaScript so what is
the plan of action for this particular
application the plan is really simple I
want to just go hip here I first and
foremost want to select the input this
add to do this remove to do and this
whole list item as well so this is the
first plan and the second plan is I want
to take down this remove to do and the
plan is really simple as soon as I click
on remove done to do it should be
deleting all the items which are marked
as check there and that's pretty much it
and we will be exploding some of the new
concept using the value and basically
and interestingly we will be learning
how we can have loop inside loops so
let's just get going it's pretty simple
no big deal there now first and foremost
is I want to grab this item it says ID
is 10 so it would be better if I just
use get element by ID I can always use
the click like on click method here and
can write a function attached to it that
is also completely fine and I don't see
like really a big difference in doing
any ways of these things so let's just
call this a so far and this is gonna be
add to do and that there will be two
button add button and remove button in
fact I would like to call this as add a
button it would make much more sense to
have this and then I can simply say
document dot get element by ID and use
the adhere okay now I have selected this
once it is being selected I want to
attach an event listener to this this
add button so what I can do is I can
simply call this something like that add
button dot add event listener and this
is gonna listen for an event which is
click not listen like waiting for it
kind of a thing you got it and we will
be writing a simple function that says
add item I haven't created that function
yet in order to avoid the problems I'm
gonna create it right now somewhere in
the bottom here it's really simple to
create a function we just simply save
function
I can write it properly and this
function name is add item pair of
parentheses there we go and we're gonna
have a simple console dot log saying add
button clicked so that we can just check
it out
okay that's our job one it is being done
the second part is to have remove button
and we're gonna call this as remove
button and there we go
same process exactly same you can pause
the video and do it before me as well if
you would like okay so I hope everybody
paused the video there and document dot
get element by ID and what did I call
that I have absolutely no idea
remove there we go removed here we go
once it is being done I would like to
add remove button dot add eventlistener
same it's gonna listen for an event
which says click and it's gonna look for
now here we can use a callback function
so far we have been using a callback
function but if I'll be using a callback
function here it will be really really
lengthy so we can do the same thing here
as well so we're gonna call this
function as remove item following the
same process remove item there we go and
we can just have kind of a similar
function we can copy and paste that and
we can call this something like this
remove item remove item and we're gonna
say delete button clicked so there we go
saved it and it's always a good idea to
first and foremost check the things so
that we don't make a mistake later on
and add button clicked remove button
clicked ok so everything is binded
correctly almost so these are the two
things that we have we are gonna put
them in a little bit bottom and at the
top I would also like to select a couple
of things probably like not much but
just one or two things so first and
foremost I would like to select my all
the unordered list so I'm gonna call
this s revoir I'm using unordered list
so I'll call them ul call them whatever
you like and I'm gonna say document dot
get element by ID and I think I call
them as lists I am not still sure yes I
called him list there we go
okay so now everything is being targeted
and is being used now first and foremost
we can just go back at the bottom and
can take down this remove item now in
order to take down this remove item I
would like to declare a variable that
I'll be using
so now inside this unordered list I do
have a list item now I will be using
that but I just want to be declared at a
global so that it can be accessed by
anybody like probably add a term or
remove item now it depends later on that
if it is being used by only one piece of
the code we can just change it and move
it here but later on so we're gonna
remove this remove item so how we're
gonna process into that now it's really
simple first and foremost I want to use
this Li which I declared above it has
absolutely nothing now this ul has a
property that names as children okay not
the child element come on children there
we go and the big question is what is
inside this children so why to worry
about that when we can just print that
out so as soon as I'll be saving that
and I will be clicking on this remove
item button
we should be getting things in our
console so let's just open up our
console did I close that accidentally
console and remove to do so it gives me
a collection of four elements of course
all of them are array and we have this
li dot my check so we are getting one
zero one two three four and the zero one
is here the first one is here now notice
that inside this first one inside this
children we do have a property I this is
the property I am looking for which is
the children inside the LI that is also
for other children and then we have a
property that says if I can find that
the value not here okay there we go
notice it says a checked in here so we
can somehow use that too for our
advantage it's really hard to find
things in here in this smaller space so
let me just show you rather that how we
are going to be nailing it down so once
we are aware that it is being done what
I can do is I can look through this list
element because
now there is no such thing which can
find out how many elements are gonna
come up so we're gonna be using a for
loop for that so index zero is totally
fine and we are gonna go for this index
is less than Li dot length index plus
plus is good and we are gonna be
printing out from this Li element is
gonna be Li index and I just want to
print out this first of all so that I
can see what is inside this element so I
can simply log this and I can say
element now let's just see what is there
inside this element so save that go back
here did I gain closed it where is my
memory so there we go have a remove to
do now notice this time I'm able to go
through with all of this now the
confusion or the problem thing is now
our loop is actually fetching all these
element but we need another loop because
we need to go through with these four
things either I just manually go through
them or using another loop inside my for
loop which can go through inside each of
these allies and can check whether the
ID not the ID basically they do have
other elements just like we have they we
just saw that it has another property
which says children and check a property
there if it is checked or not okay so I
need another loop that's the main idea
here that our first loop is just going
through each element but I need another
loop inside here so instead of just
going through like that I can just
remove this line and I can create
another loop and can anybody guess what
is that loop we are gonna be using yes
we just learned that in the previous
video and that is our simply value so
what is the condition that while loop we
are gonna be fetching up now there are
two condition basically the first one is
when I do have this Li at index okay
whatever the index we are going through
0 1 2 3 4 it should have a children and
at the very first of that children there
is a property known as checked you can
check that again by clicking a console
log on this Li so this is the checked
I'm looking at for okay will it do my
job yes
almost almost so first and foremost what
we'll be doing
here on this you well what I really want
to do is I just want to remove this
entire unordered list in here okay so
not the entire unordered list but rather
inside this unordered list the list
element okay I hope I didn't made a
mistake there so in my unordered list I
want to remove a child remove child and
what is that child that child is the li
element of that particular index i hope
actually I cannot make it much simpler
because I literally told you exactly in
my line but there is one more mistake in
here little bit not much let's just save
that and see now technically speaking
when I just click on this remove to do
it should be clearing up all the things
so when I hit to remove notice it just
does all of that where there is a cannot
read property children of undefined
remove item let me just check a if we
have done anything mistake like that and
I think probably like that but problem
that I was talking about is we need to
actually check for the index itself as
well and there is one just kind of a
small stuff I found it out way back when
I was working on this kind of same
project and let me just say that reload
that and there we go
now when I was figuring out for the
property of this children actually a
couple of things came up and well the
guy suggested me on the Stack Overflow
that hey you are checking up all the
things but you're not checking up or one
more condition which is if it is the
same element so what I need to do is I
need to check out Li at index I want to
check for present index not for all the
index here okay so this is the mistake I
was making and yes just like you I also
looked up on the Stack Overflow and
somebody suggested me that I was missing
this part so this is more over I wanted
to share my experience now the whole
only probably for some of you it might
be making sense now what it is saying
that it should be on to the present
index as well as inside that index then
we want to check on to that okay so I
think it makes sense to most of you and
I can clean that up and I can hit remove
to do
it has removed no problem at all the
reason it was doing all this thing
because we were not checking that if we
are onto for present index or not we
were just checking it is on checked or
not so we have to check both of them a
great advice given to me by somebody I
am absolutely terribly sorry who gave me
that advice on stackoverflow I forgot
about that it was like two or three
years ago but anyways okay so this is
what we have done accomplished first
remove item we can hit the reload and
can see that whenever you checkmark
anything that gets removed and that's it
okay so here's a quick assignment for
all of you now we want to create a
simple just create add one more button
here which says remove everything and it
should be able to remove all the list
item inside this unordered list and I
think that is actually pretty easy we
don't need to go into one more level of
the loop because we don't want to check
anything like check we just want to
remove them so it should be pretty easy
assignment for you in the next video
we're gonna take down this item as well
which is our item which can be a little
bit tricky so we will be moving on to
the next video and let's catch up there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
