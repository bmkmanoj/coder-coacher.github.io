with another video and in today's to do
I'm going to clear up all of your doubts
regarding Catalan and Java so in case
you are not aware I did a previous video
on the introduction of the cut length so
Carlin is officially in now and it made
a lot of buzz that hey is Java dead now
should we be learning Java right now or
not should we stop our training or not
so yes there were a lot of good
discussion being made on the previous
video so obviously it needed a one more
video so that we can clear up all the
air and can get friendly in here now
before we move on there let me tell you
that discussion is always a good thing I
always appreciate the discussion with
the discussion always good thing comes
up sometimes you make your point
sometimes I make my point and that's how
we do a discussion so keep on that I
always look out for that and try to make
more videos with that now moving on now
first of all I would like to answer two
very important question and then we will
move on further to the discussion in
here now point number one is if you are
doing any kind of training in the Java
and Android you don't need to stop doing
that you can carry on with that it's not
like there is a subtle move from Java to
the Catalan it's not like that Java is
going to stay for quite some time at
least for quite some time in here so
there's no point of getting panic there
do keep in mind that you should be
learning whatever you are doing don't
stop that learning is a good thing
whatever you are learning a Java Android
keep doing that but also keep in mind
that Catalan is going to be there in
some nearby future so keep on with your
training but keep an eye on the
Coughlin's if you can find out some good
courses or anything just make sure you
learn Catalan as well by the way our
course is also rolling out on the
Cortland very soon but that's not the
thing in here I'm just saying that
wherever you are learning whatever you
are learning keep doing that don't stop
that because your Java experience will
be quite helpful in learning the Catalan
as well and just to give you a good idea
about how Catalan will get our take over
the Android development
Coughlin's is actually completely
interoperable with the Java so you can
convert your Java code into Catalan and
Catalan code into Java and I was working
at one of the project where we have to
integrate one of the feature in one of
the very good app and that complete
feature was written in the Kotlin and
later on we just integrated that file
into an existing Android app so yes
that's possible and completely valid as
well so that's the good news for
everybody just keep on continuing with
your training focus on learning and you
will be a good programmer no need to be
panicked about the Java now point number
two is a lot of people said hey we did a
certification of the Java will companies
will take in now or they will require
for everybody for the Kotlin no it's not
like that Java will still be existing in
their parallely with the Catalan so all
of your certification are not just a
waste of the time or anything it will
surely help you in there but now now
comes up the meet part of the discussion
let's carry on with that but we need to
roll that intro of you almost forgot
that how we can do that so let's roll
our intro
okay so before we move on and talk about
why you should be learning Kotlin and
yes Java is going to be there but it's
very very important to learn in the
Kotlin now before we put on more of my
points in there let me tell you one
thing language is just the tool it's
just a tool to produce anything let me
tell you my experience so far I have
been into the app development for quite
some good time I have produced a lot of
apps that have reached to the App Store
and Google Play as well now many times
client has come to me and say that hey
we need an app this should be the
feature and it should have a good
experience it should be a native app and
as long as I am giving them a native app
and the features they are asking they
are completely happy they don't care if
I'm writing that in Java Kotlin Swift
objective-c JavaScript whatever it is it
should be a native app and should
produce that feature that's it that's
all about it so what I'm doing right now
is most of the time for my Android apps
I am writing my all of my code in
JavaScript now a lot of you might be
jumping around and will be saying hey
you are not producing a native app in
JavaScript you are just producing a
hybrid app nobody I'm producing a
complete native app and I'm fully aware
of what hybrid app is so the point is
never love any programming language it
is just a tool that will come up and
will go
I was once a big fan of Python and was
looking around the base to design
everything in Python like websites
mobile apps but that was a naive move
and I understood that really quickly
that that's a bad move I shouldn't be
doing that
I should be learning more programming
languages people were once a big time
fan of objective-c and C now it's a
sinking ship and people are just trying
to jump into Swift so my point is yes
Java is a good skill you should learn it
but also keep an eye on the Kotlin it's
not like that you can stay forever with
the Java you shouldn't be doing that the
more programming languages you will
understand it's it's always a good thing
now also answering to one more question
that was quite seamless leaving popping
around and around was yes Java 8 I'm
fully aware of that that has got a
latest features and a lot of good
features like lambdas and
everything but let me ask you one
questions my dear friends how many apps
have you written in the Java eight that
has reached to the App Store you got the
point in the Android development or in
the Android word we usually use a Java 6
ish environment in there and things like
lambda functions are being integrated by
the third-party libraries like retro
lambdas and all these things so yes it's
it's a pain Java 8 features has not
completely integrated into the into the
Android environment and obviously people
will look out at the other languages
which are mature and 100% interoperable
with the Java so that we can integrate
with them and that is what Catalan is
doing now
Catalan is is a complete mature language
having all those features like lambdas
and everything and trust me it is far
more less code that you will be writing
in the cutlet and you can just convert
them directly into your Java or you can
convert Java code into the Catalan now
in case you missed a video by the Google
guys on this channel the video was being
made that you can just directly copy and
paste your Java code into the Catalan
file and it will be automatically get
converted into the Catalan now a lot of
people will say hey why do we need to
learn Catalan if it automatically
converts everything though my dear
friend you need to learn the syntax and
basics of the language which is almost
almost familiar with the Java so that's
all about it now I have tried to answer
a lot of your questions and lot of your
doubts regarding the Catalan and Java
but I would like to summarize it as well
just just like I do in almost every
movie so point number one keep carry on
with your training with the Java and
Android it's it's going to be still
beneficial for you but don't just
completely merge into that state and I
on the carbonate as soon as you get a
chance to learn Catalan don't forget to
learn that as well Android studio 3 will
completely be will be having all these
features so you can just play around
with that directly and the point number
two don't stay that one language don't
learn any language at all don't just
love it make sure you are ready to move
on there because language is just the
tool let me know what are your thoughts
about a clearing of this confusion if
you have
still more confusion we will do more
such videos until and unless your
confusion is cleared up I'm looking out
for all the section on all in the
comments sections so that I can read
your comments and can get your feedback
and by the way if you haven't checked
out years yet please do check out learn
code online dot in a recent website
being rolled out to help all of the
Indian students to learn programming and
all of my future courses including the
Kotlin will be there very soon so don't
forget to check out that and I'll surely
catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
