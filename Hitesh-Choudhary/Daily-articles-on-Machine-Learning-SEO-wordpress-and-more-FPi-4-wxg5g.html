want you to tell about one of our
resource that will help you to upgrade
your knowledge every single day
absolutely for free if you are connected
with me on Facebook which is like the
only platform where I remain super
active you know that I am strong
believer of consistency and doing things
every single day now one of the very
great example you can get is just like
from drop by drop a bucket can be filled
up just similarly like that giving some
simple amount of time probably just five
minutes or an hour in a day you can
upgrade your knowledge quite a lot now
whatever you are learning just keep on
learning with that but if you spend like
two minutes or three minutes while
coming from college I into the bus or
maybe a metro travel or maybe just
hanging around somewhere
so just spending those couple of minutes
you can also upgrade your knowledge and
one such resource we are providing here
is our blogs if you will visit learn
code online dot n slash blog you will
find that we do have plethora of blogs
now from last month almost like 30 days
or so we have been consistently writing
blogs and articles on machine learning
the goal of every single blog is to
upgrade your knowledge now we don't
follow like regular SEO stuff on the
blogs and stuff like that because our
number one priority is to precise the
content as short as possible and serve
the user that's our number one priority
now we try to make sure that we put
really unique articles that can upgrade
your knowledge just take an example for
machine learning we have been putting
article on regressors and linear
equations and all these things so that
you can upgrade your knowledge in that
now so here is your thing now you can go
to learn code online dot in slash blog
and can read all about machine learning
and all those articles now coming on to
the people who are not interested in
machine learning and just I said yes
machine learning is booming quite a lot
but it's not the end of the world like
if you'll not learn machine learning
that's all about it there are a lot of
plethora of other things as well that
you can learn
we do take care about that as well in
our block our team at learned code

so post your comments have an
interaction it would be really fun if
you can have interaction with these
authors and show them some love couple
of more things about the blog's now just
to make sure that you have a full
reading experience we don't put Google
Ads as well yes we can earn a lot with
the Google Ads there but sometimes these
these ads can be little bit distracting
and until unless we figure it out
we are keeping the ads completely
sideways and probably in the future as
well we are not going to be interested
in much more of the advertisements there
so it would be a completely distracting
free reading material that you have also
a couple of other notes as well in case
you are interested in particular topic
that we should cover up definitely don't
hesitate to reach me out on Facebook and
post your queries I'll pass these
queries to our amazing authors who are

that you want to see in our blog also in
case your author and they are interested
in writing scales or something or just

purpose in case your primary goal is to
serve the user and put some valuable
