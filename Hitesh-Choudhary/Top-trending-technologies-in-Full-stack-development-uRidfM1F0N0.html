with another video in this video I'm
going to talk about the top 10
technologies which are dominating in the
full stack development now I have my
points there and these are the points
for the most popular technologies for
the full stack development now of course
this is not just any random survey this
is based on the stack overflow now in
case you don't know what the stack
overflow is I would ask what kind of
programmer you are if you don't know
what the stack overflow is by the way
stack overflow is the most popular
website where you can ask your questions
and probably there are high chances that
your questions has been already answered
on the stack overflow it's a website
that runs totally on technical
programming and code related stuff so I
have picked up a data about what are the
most popular technologies which are
being used and the questions are being
asked of course if they are being used
there might be problems a lot of
problems with them and these problems
are asked at Stack Overflow so these are
going to be top trending full stack
development technologies that we are
discussing and these will shortly help
you to pick up one of them so that you
can jump-start your job career what do
we like to call it so let's get started
in here
in this channel we talk about
programming technology mobile
development web development and
everything related to computers
programming and technology so in case
you are new here consider subscribing
also you might have noticed that we got
a new friend here Mikey Mikey's has
already being therefore in all of my
videos we haven't seen that but since
recently I got delivered my boom arm now
you'll be seeing Mikey quite a lot and
he's a good guy I use him in all of my
videos so let me refer to my notes here
and talk about the technologies and we
can discuss them a little bit in them so
at the bottom list I'm going to
obviously start from bottom to the top
and first of all we have got the lamp
which stands for the 15.6 in the
popularity rating here now let's dance
for the Linux Apache MySQL PHP and with
no surprise obviously there are still a
lot of applications or web apps which
are being designed in the core PHP and
obviously it makes a lot of sense for a
website which is just 5 page website are
clearly designed in some HTML CSS it
makes much more sense to just use the
PHP in the contact form and deliver the
things to the mail so it's much more
fast convenient and less time consuming
so obviously it stands at 15.6 percent
the lamp stands at the bottom here now
on top of that with no surprise we have
got Python standing at the rating of
18.2% again these all stats are from the
stack overflow
now python is one of the most diversify
language it can be used for the web
development writing the script of even
making the good games a lot of things
and it's pretty much easy to get started
with language and especially the
platforms that or the kind of frameworks
which has been introduced like Django
you can do quite a lot of stuff with the
Python so again for the hackers with one
of the most favorite language and I
would say it's a great starting point if
you are kind of attractive with that
language on the next there's no surprise
we have got no chairs now personally I
have done quite a couple of projects
heavy projects on the node gf I have
thoroughly enjoyed
node.js and I became a big fan of it now
in the previous days I was working with
most of the time with the firebase or
kind of a database of like MongoDB but
no GS is just killing it in case you are
already familiar with JavaScript I would
personally highly recommend you to get
started with the node GS the mode you
will learn it the most simplicity you
are going to get it it it's kind of a
killer technologies in fact I'll make a
separate video about node.js and why I
so much you love about it
next up we have got SQL Server now let's
give server holes
holds about 28% of the popularity there
now again a lot of Technology are coming
up new but they are just new and are
coming up that doesn't means that all
the previously existing technologies are
going anywhere they are still going to
be there so SQL based websites are still
there's SQL based web application are
still there so definitely it's worth
learning a skill and in fact if you just
want to directly jump onto the newer
technology that's great but
understanding a little bit about these
all the time stable technologies is
really good and I would highly recommend
you to go with the SQL now next up we
have got no surprise at all Java and
with the 30.7 rating now Java again I'm
not a big fan of Java because I mostly
like to work in the iOS environment or
other environments but again this
doesn't means that if I'm not a fan of a
language that doesn't means that it's a
bad language obviously it's good
a lot of nice can use it one of the my
friend John from cave of programming
comm is also quite killing it in the
Java from the very early days so
definitely was a good learning this
programming language but honestly I'm
not a big fan of Java and I I don't even
recommend it but this doesn't mean it's
a bad language it's great language it's
not something that I get quite easily so
again you eventually develop some love
for language so it's not one of them now
next up is again one of the favorite
language is angular not the language
kind of a framework age thing so angular
is killing it with thirty to thirty two
point two percent of the popularity
meter there now why angular is getting
popular now angular actually runs
mostly on the SBA's the single page
application and one of the reason why
angular is popular because of its
component now usually in the website
then we need a web page it just reloads
the web page then we want to change the
content the Dom model actually changes
completely but in the angular you don't
change the entire our model you just
replace the thing that you simply want
to change so you are not anytime you are
not getting back anything from the Dom
you are just changing to the Dom you are
not getting anything back and that makes
your SPS the single page application
quite fast and that is why angular is
writing it quite a lot
next up is the PHP with 35.3% now why
PHP is going so much and we have seen it
at two places there the only reason is
WordPress now you might be surprised a
lot of people hate WordPress but to be
honest a lot of freelancing projects
actually are made on the WordPress in
fact a lot of big and popular website
either the news websites that you see
around are being made in the WordPress
now what is this quite easy to manage
here there are some security issues that
you have to bother about you have to
look around and somehow you have to be
dependent on the updates that are being
released to maintain the security of the
WordPress but if you compare that with
the production cost which is quite low
in the WordPress you will neglect that I
know a lot of people are going to yell
at me that hey how can you avoid
security
how can you neglect the security but
sometimes you have to calculate the
production cost as well later on you can
work on the security but if there is no
product what you are going to secure so
obviously the first priority for every
development company and every
environment is the production and to
make sure that the product reaches out
to the people and we all know never it's
never the first product or the version
one is going to be perfect it's never
gonna be it's going to have a lot of
design issues it's going to have a lot
of security issues but really what press
is killing it and I believe that is one
of the main reason why it rocking to the
PHP now next up to a little of my
surprise is c-sharp with 37 point
three now this caught me with a little
bit of the surprise to be honest is
completely caught me off guard it beer
but I believe this eShop is really
getting popular in fact I have seen
quite a lot of questions being posted on
the free shop on the stack or flow as
it's rapidly growing there and one of
the main reason is the unity environment
now unity is heavily based on the C shop
and a lot of people are learning the
c-sharp because they want to make their
own gains in unity and previous year was
completely dominated by the game
development and unity and everything so
I believe that is one of the reasons why
c-sharp is getting so much popularity in
there next up with on to the last one we
haven't made it actually like top ten or
anything the top technology with killing
it with 85.3 in fact it almost doubles
the highest what we have discussed so
far is the JavaScript now in the first
deck development
javascript has become a holy grail you
can kill it with the front-end
development you are going to killing it
onto the back end development and
node.js front-end for angular or react
or react native maybe so I believe one
language which has done kind of a
tremendous job extraordinary job is Java
skill the reason why I started to learn
JavaScript is because of the egg my
script six and that's my personal word
stairs now previously I was having a few
problems in fact I'll make a separate
video what of things that I love about
es6 now two things that I would like to
talk in here is the two things that I
hated about the JavaScript and previous
versions are the best keyword and their
scope rules now they have completely
solved them and now in the echo script 6
there are definite scopes which you can
work with like the scope of a function
or scope of a class and also the disk
key but it was completely a mess this
keyword and in fact if you code in
JavaScript you had already being faced
these kinds of things so they have fixed
the disk keyword as well so this was my
quick overview about the top full stack
technologies that were popular in the
last year of course
how we are going to get the survey of
this year the survey is actually for
last year's because the data comes from
one year previous I hope you get that
what I'm trying to save here so this was
a quick movie of how we actually get
about the surveys and everything so in
case you have some doubts about what
I've talked in here and I hope this
video helps you to pick up the
technology that you want to really work
as a full-stack developer and yes I
haven't talked about the mobile
development or anything in this but this
was just a quick video about the surveys
that the Stack Overflow has made up here
