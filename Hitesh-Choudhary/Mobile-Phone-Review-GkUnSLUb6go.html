with another video and in this video
we're talking about mobile phone first
and foremost let me answer that why a
mobile phone review now recently on my
Instagram I posted a photo of iPhone X
or iPhone 10 whatever you call that and
I don't know why certainly that photo
got popular and I i usually receive in
my email that what is difference between
Java and JavaScript and iOS and Android
and all these stuffs but suddenly from
the last week certain I don't know how
this is happening that photo got really
popular and a lot of people just start
asking me why don't you review an iPhone
why don't you review a oneplus device or
why don't you review the phone that you
are using so let me tell you about my
review of the mobile phone if a phone
has got a Snapdragon processor the
latest one it's an amazing phone if that
phone has got a good amount of RAM so
that you can open up like 10 or 20 apps
at a time it's a good phone the storage
depends on how much you want to use it
also on top of that if you get a
features like face unlock or maybe a
thumbprint
that's pretty much it that's all a phone
is about to me if you love i phone
ecosystem go ahead get an iphone if you
love the Android ecosystem you have got
options like Samsung or maybe oneplus
devices and we all know that there are
different variants in that so that's
pretty much it if you can spend a huge
amount of money there is a bezel less
thing see 18 to 9 aspect ratio for you
and all these things and that's pretty
much it that's all about my review of
the mobile phones a lot of people think
that since I'm a youtuber and I have
crossed the hundred thousand mark here I
would be getting a lot of devices and
probably that's the reason why I'm
receiving such emails but this is this
is not how the things actually work on
YouTube this is not like certainly one
day you'll be hitting hundred thousand
subscribers and BAM companies will be
giving you a lot of phones and your
house will be filled up with the phones
and they can do a giveaway no this is
not how the things happen if this is
what you're thinking let me explain how
the things actually happen nowadays
there is no shortage of youtuber whether
they guys have experience or not they
want
become a youtuber and certainly they
open up a channel and usually that's a
tech channel now I don't say that
opening up a tech channel is a bad thing
if you love tag that's your thing you're
gonna do it anyways but it's not also
like that you'll be getting your mobile
phones without approaching anybody and
just by sitting at your home you'll get
a mobile phone now yes companies do
somehow approach me and try to give all
of their gadgets and all these things
I usually don't accept that unless I
love the device actually but here's the
thing that how you will be getting your
devices the first and foremost thing you
have to approach them you have to ask
for a device you have to go into the
mobile launch parties whether that's a
oneplus device Samsung or whatever you
are device you are looking for so the
number one thing is you have to approach
them until unless you are attending
their events we were at whatever the
city they are happening in and you are
approaching the PR guys you won't be
getting any devices since I don't attend
usually any YouTube events and any
launch parties I don't get much of these
devices so that's why I don't do much of
that abuse all of the things that I have
so far unbox and all on this channel are
totally being purchased by me I love
that device I purchased it I use it
every single day that's why I just
unboxed it if I had to do all these
unboxing and reviews I probably could
have already done that I use some
amazing great Mike's a great iMac of
macbook pro a couple of them some great
mics my friend recently bought a latest
and galaxy device I already do have an
iPhone X at my home so I would have
already done that but since I'm not an
expert in doing a mobile phone reviews I
don't do it a lot of other great
youtubers and great tech channel who are
doing that I really do appreciate that
they are taking the time and sending us
these amazing reviews and all these
things as far as concerned about this
channel this is more over attack channel
which is oriented and based towards
programming and that's why recently I
changed the cover on my YouTube and say
this is a programming channel because
yes I do love tag just like you you love
to visit all these latest technology
what is happening with latest Samsung
device or an iPhone device but again to
be honest what I am most concerned about
is what is happening inside those
devices how can
I contribute in that by making an app or
making a website on all these things so
I'm not much interested in just opening
a device and saying you know what this
camera is amazing we all know that how
much you are gonna get better in the
mobile phone devices still these DSLR
and these film grade cameras are gonna
be dominating at least for now I am Not
sure that whether in the future I'll be
doing these reviews and these gadgets
and stuff probably or probably not but
as of now I want to keep this channel as
just pure programming channel I love
these things it's not like I'm against
anything but it's something that I am
not comfortable in doing I'm more
comfortable in talking all day for react
maybe angular maybe machine learning
dotnet to xamarin these are the things
that I love to do and I can obviously
talk about them these are the things
that gives me spark yes these stakes are
also interesting like what is going to
be a new iPhone and all these things but
just like you I'm also a viewer of these
things I like to be a viewer I don't
like to be creator of the content for
such things and obviously it's a
well-known fact that whatever the device
you want to really get it's always
little bit out of your budget for
example you want to buy a MacBook Pro
but what you can afford right now is
MacBook Air what you want to get is an
iPhone 10 or iPhone X but what you can
afford right now is iPhone 6 or iPhone 7
and this is the condition for every
single one of us and then there is
another strong reason and that is the
quality of the audience at my youtube
channel my youtube channel somehow is
having amazing audience quality I'm
really saying this out loud that I am
really proud on the quality of audience
that I am having here is like something
that doesn't often happen at YouTube
usually the channel is filled up with
like people who just abuse and just
dislike the content for no given reason
at my channel the subscriber quality is
like vey top-notch and I'm really so
heartedly thankful for that this is like
you don't see these kinds of things
happen every single day on my channel
people do debate me about usage of
sublime text versus Adam these are the
people that are already having high
intellectual level the audience at this
channel is somehow
working really hard so that they can
make a better life they can become a
better programmer they can live a very
happy life they can upgrade their skills
and all these things so somehow I'm
really proud on the audience that are
combining up at this YouTube channel I'm
really proud of all of you guys at this
channel I do really appreciate all of
your feedbacks when you just want to
learn that why I should be choosing
react over the angular and all these
discussion these are high intellectual
discussions these are not about why the
company is giving me this 60 B RAM or a
8 GB RAM you don't talk about that you
obviously know that 6 GB RAM means a
little bit slower an 8 GB means a little
bit higher if the device are using like
that kind of amount of RAM first on the
very first case so as of now I would say
that if you are looking forward for
getting some mobile phone reviews or
some gadget review on this channel
probably I will not be able to serve you
with this because I would like to stay
with this channel as a unique channel
for just programming and stuff that is
really helpful for you related to
programming life like interview
questions what is the latest tech going
on what is happening in the recent
wonder abilities and all these stuff I
love to talk about programming more over
than a mobile phone device and that's
that's just me so that's it this is my
mobile phone review about all of the
mobile phone do hit the subscribe button
if you want to see more content on
programming maybe programming interviews
and just more or over related to code
and stuff don't hit that subscribe
button if you want to really see the
mobile phone reviews and all those those
stuff as of now I'm not comfortable in
doing mobile phone reviews probably I
cannot say much about the future but as
of now this is the situation that's it
for this video and I'll surely catch you
up in the next one and just one more
thing hey don't forget to catch me up on
every Saturday I do a live at YouTube
every single Saturday at 10 p.m. Indian
Standard Time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
