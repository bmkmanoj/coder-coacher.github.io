I'm back with another video so what
we'll be doing today as the title says
we are going to today compare the two
great gigantic apps in the design world
now of course one of them is pretty much
more gigantic one as Newby you can say
so these are the two apps the Photoshop
and the sketch so we will be comparing
which one is better of course there is
none of them is better and none of them
is less better or something everybody
has a perspective and every particular
thing has a situation where one thing
rules the other so we'll be comparing
which one is going to be suitable for
you and we'll be placing all those
scenarios with that so let's get started
so today let's get going with the
photoshop and the sketch now first of
all let's build up a ground that Who am
I and why am I talking about it because
as a simple designer or a developer you
need to understand that which kind of a
person I am so you can judge my
perspective okay so I am a developer but
I used to hire the designers to design
all of my things like a web icons or my
image overviews for my apps my websites
and pretty much like that so this used
to be a scenario because I am a
developer and I used to hit design
although it was very much necessary for
me to learn the design to make sure that
my apps looks really great so I started
with the Photoshop and everybody knows
that Photoshop is a gigantic innumerous
monster that you cannot just master in a
couple of days or a month you need to
spend a lot of time with it and then I
heard about the sketch app and by the
way I am not associated with this sketch
or anything guys I have no affiliation
or affiliate link so don't worry about
that so then I heard about the sketch
app and I thought that let's give it a
go I tried it and apart from being a
developer now I design all of my assets
including the most common icons the SVG
icons for my apps for my website my
wallpapers even and
my icons for the YouTube thumbnails and
pretty much I do it by myself and I'm
pretty much happy with that
so let's compare the Photoshop and the
sketch and again as I told you I'm not a
professional designer but I'm going
there I'm just moving into the phase I'm
pretty much happy with it so I'm not a
professional designer yet but I do code
a lot and I am a developer I would like
to say that so let's just compare that
now the first thing that I don't like
about the Photoshop is the subscription
model I I don't like them much because
subscription is something which just
consumes your money every month violon
the sketch it's a little bit expensive
like $99 is still a big amount of money
that you might want to spend in just one
software and so I like this sketch
monetization it's just one time go I
bought the sketch in the third version
and still they are giving me the support
and update and pretty much everything
and right now as you can see I'm on the
sketch version 41 which they call like
to call as sketch 4 so still they are
giving me everything for just Nightline
bucks for the students they offer a
discount as well I'm not sure but I
think they give you for $70 or something
I have no idea about pretty sure but I
did paid almost $19 for the sketch so I
like that and while on the other hand
the Photoshop gives you a subscription
model which is comparatively it's cheap
because it's I think it's 49 bucks a
month but if you'll just use the sketch
for let's just say three months then
it's going to be okay so I'm happy with
the sketch in that point now if you ask
me that which one is a gigantic
innumerous and can do a lot of work then
for sure it's Photoshop sketch is no
match for the Photoshop in that but if
you'll ask me to design an image which
is having a clear background should have
this lot of stuff like that then
obviously sketch can not do that that's
a drawback but obviously sketch was
never meant to do so because it's not
meant to handle the images and clear
their backgrounds remove their
backgrounds so in that particular case
the Photoshop is much more gigantic and
a numbers and a couple of more things
that I do like about this
let me just open that up and this is a
plain background I'll play in Slate you
can say and one thing is I like I can
press a for art board they like to call
their canvas as the art board I can see
that on the right hand side I have got
iPad pros I for iPad sevens iPhone 7s
and the desktops and everything so
basically right from the star it's
telling you that hey and not meant for
the image editing and some stuff like
that that is Photoshop is more powerful
and famous to do so so it just says hey
I'm not meant for that I'm meant to
design the interface of a website for a
mobile website or a big gigantic website
or a mobile app for the Android for the
iPhone and everything so I would like to
stick with that so that's what this app
is saying and right from out of the box
you can say they have got some material
designs for the iPhones and some Android
phones as well with the desktop you can
say they have responsive desktop HD
desktop tablet and mobile portrait that
straight of the box they are saying that
hey you know what we are not going to be
doing any kind of image stuff we are
going to be doing and focusing on the UI
design of your websites and your mobile
apps so I like the concept I can just
select anything like iPhone 7 and there
you go right forward they give you a
canvas or they like to call it as
artboard of an iPhone 7 and every size
and everything is being done already for
me so that's good now yes you can design
almost every everything that sketch can
do you can do everything in the
Photoshop but to be honest for a
developer like me who who don't want to
go into the basics of the layers and the
colors and pretty much everything a
sketch is much more efficient for a guy
like me yes obviously a professional
designer can immediately go ahead and
design a much more better interface than
me but since I'm a developer I know how
the interface should look like and I am
pretty sure what color scheme goes with
Apple and what doesn't goes so therefore
if a developer learns how to design it
is much more effective and professional
and he can grow it quite more but it
doesn't means that I want to offend all
of the designers out there they are
doing pretty good job obviously they are
always going to be remain
much more higher and perspective wise
they are going to remain higher than me
obviously so that's one thing now
another thing that I do like about the
sketch is something like this let just
say I am creating a rectangle so I'll
press R and I'll upload more videos
about the sketch work so I can just have
this and now you know what I can just
select the background and I can say
what's the size of that let me just
delete it for a moment again I can see
that the size is 375 let me just give it
a rectangle R and I have I want to give
it a 1/2 of 375 so I can just say here
that's something like 375 and divided by
2 so I just press ENTER and it gives me
the half of 375 so you can perform a lot
of mathematics operation in this sketch
and I just love this because I can just
select anything and can precisely say
hey you know what I want to do a half of
your artboard and it's gonna do for me
obviously I could have just opened up a
calculator and could have done that but
you know I'm a lazy guy and I like this
approach here okay so this is the one
thing that I do like about it it can do
a lot of calculation and mathematics
approach for you now one more thing that
I do like about is as something known as
rotate copies and options which are much
more good for a developer let let me
give you a quick demo I can just make a
line and there is my line I can select
rotate copies and I can get let's just
say 14 of that click OK and now I have
got a good clock ish thing there we go
and I can just play around with it can
get a lot of designs and things like
that I hope you got the idea so these
small shortcuts obviously I could have
done them in the Photoshop but this
saves me a lot of time and in fact in
the future movies will show you that how
you can design some cool icons and can
replicate some logos and everything is
in the vector form so that's that's nice
obviously I can just select this guy or
any guy here and I can scale them up to
let just say two hundred percent and
it's not going to just randomly get
scattered in the pixel wise so these are
the few things that I do like about the
sketch now bear with me
one more thing that I do like about the
sketch are these operations at the top
the Union subtract intersection and the
difference these are really good saves a
lot of time of course as I always say
you can do them in the Photoshop as well
but still for the developer purpose I
don't want to dig up into the layers and
layers of the Photoshop and that is why
I do love the sketch now you might be
thinking this is a biased movie for the
all-time you have been just shouting
about sketch sketch sketch I do have
some of the problems in the sketch like
one of the problem that I do face is
clearing at the background they could
have involved that like if I want to
delete the background there used to be a
magic eraser in the Photoshop still it
does but there is no such thing in the
Photoshop so if you are looking that
sketch is going to be an alternative for
the Photoshop you're completely wrong
it's not going to happen I think it's
never going to happen not anytime soon
but it's never going to happen so you
will for sure need Photoshop if you are
good into the editing Xin all of those
stuffs but if you're someone like me who
don't want to do a gigantic anomalous
stuff in the Photoshop and things like
that you know then you can completely
get rid of the Photoshop and can work on
the sketch now I bought sketch almost a
year back I guess so or maybe little a
little while that and still I don't use
Photoshop now I do all of my work in
some of the online tools like canva and
in the in the sketch so I'm completely
happy with that if I do need something
else so I just hired someone from the
freelancer or something and I just make
sure that he does a quick job for me so
that is going to be my whole point of
perspective about the sketch versus
Photoshop let's summarize it quickly
sketch is not eternal alternative for
the Photoshop but still it's a value for
the money it's good you will be
completely happy if you are into the
development and you like to design your
own assets especially for the websites
all of them mobile tablet and everything
and as well as you like to do some of
the mobile stuff for the Android or the
iPhone then I would definitely say go
ahead try the sketch and they do have a
trial version so go ahead try it out and
let me know
in the comments below that how how you
like this sketch and for sure in the
future movies I'll be uploading some
cool tutorials that will that are going
to teach you the sketch basics as well
so with this I would like to say
subscribe to the channel I'm putting a
lot of videos now and you might have
noticed the new set of that I have got
so this is only because I want to get
much more serious on the YouTube and do
hit the like button subscribe button and
share it with your friends if you think
that somebody can get benefit from this
