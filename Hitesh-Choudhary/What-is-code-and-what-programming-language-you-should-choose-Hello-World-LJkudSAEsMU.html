welcome back to the video series hello
world in this series we are answering
all of your most common questions that
you might be having before getting
started in the code today we are gonna
answer what is code and what programming
language you should choose so let's get
started out here so in case you have no
idea what's going on here I have just
launched a series out there named hello
world which is gonna answer most common
programming questions out there if you
haven't watched that our playlist out
yet do subscribe to the channel and
watch out the entire playlist there is
one more video out there back coming on
to the question of the day which is what
is code and what programming language
you should choose out there we will take
one by one each of them first of all
let's take down what is code so just
open up any book out there Wikipedia
page any great programmer out there or
just ask him what is programming what is
coding he's gonna say computer
programming is a set of instruction
given to a computer to perform a
specific task I know that's boring and
that doesn't really make sense to a new
person out there who is just getting
started in the code out there I
completely agree with that
and when you spatially open up the
software's like your app out there or
out a YouTube video channel out there or
some quick player out there or even your
games the call of duty games or sir hi
or some high-end games it doesn't really
make sense that cannot be just a
computer instruction out there that that
might be something else that might be a
little bit more but sadly or fortunately
or unfortunately that's actually true
that is computer instruction but again
there are a lot of platforms and lot of
things that I want to cover here so one
by one let's get out there now if you're
getting started with the app development
it's really easy for you to understand
that yes everything is a code out there
because whatever you just write out
there is actually being performed or the
output actually comes up in your real
device so it's really easy but if you
are just a normal person who is using
day-to-day desktop and you write a
program out there on Python or C or
language the terminal output doesn't
really make sense with a QuickTime movie
but yes that's computer and that's code
so what does the code actually does now
code actually gives some great
instructions to the computer which
computer actually follows consider the
computer as a dumb guy who just follows
your instruction just like that and
let's just say I instruct a dumb guy go
in the south direction that's it
he's gonna go into the side direction
regardless there might be a bit there
might be a highway route there might be
accident there might be crashes he's
gonna just go out there so you have to
be very precise in giving instruction to
the computer computers are dumb VR the
person who makes it intelligent out
there so always be precise in your code
and code can be anything it might be
just a plain text English out there
written in a bad grammar out there and
that is where most of people are
learning code there is no grandma'd
rules or anything out there but yes
computer has computer does have its um
its syntax its own rule out there and
we're gonna for sure focus on that as
well so that's the part number one what
is good just a plain set of instruction
performed on a step by step manner or
triggered by a special event are there
that's that's not tough yes that's not
tough that's easy
so when anybody now asks you what is the
computer code what is programming you
can just say hey that's our just
instruction done by some program on out
there and computer is just following it
pretty easy yes now we have a knowledge
of that now another interesting question
which we have an answer in this movie is
which programming language you should
choose now I'm gonna come on to an off
topic a little bit now if you are
studying in computer university out
there of any any university which is
doing a specific curriculum out there in
the computers then obviously you don't
have much option out there if they are
getting started with a C or Python you
have to get started with that that's
mandatory but I would say if you're if
you are saving some money and are just
trying to learn computer by your own I
would say do some research before you
get started in the computer programming
it's not about you always should get
started with C you it's not about you
should always get started with Python
PHP it's not
like that it's about what you want to
achieve out there and yes most of the
people out there get started with the
see that's a great point that's a great
learning step out there but it's little
bit boring it's not that exciting
because see is a very men civ and very
deep language with which does a lot of
job with the hardware's out there
and to me that's not exciting for you it
might be but for me it's a little bit
boring so go and do a great amount of
research now you will also find a lot of
people talking about hey language
doesn't matter you can go ahead and
choose any language and get started out
there and I would disagree on that point
why because let us say you want to
design an Android app and you are
learning soft language for that or maybe
Python language on that that's a time
waste so decide a goal for yourself
first of all what you want to do you
want to design a website you want to
design a web application completely full
fledge it or maybe you want to go with
the mobile apps maybe Android maybe iOS
maybe Windows or you might want to
design some hacking scripts out there or
maybe something else then after you can
narrow down the things let's just say
for the web yes of course there are
again plethora of options are there PHP
nodejs Emmet tons of things are out
there but again at least you will get
specific on that domain you will not
look for let's just say Swift out there
or maybe the Java for the Android or
something like that so you won't be
going out on that direction so always be
focused on what you want to do of course
you can comment down below and I will
surely help you that what you want to do
and what would be the suitable language
for you okay so for example if you want
to go with the iOS development you
should be going into the Swift if you
want to go into the Android development
you surely might want to learn Java for
that and that's a great point now I
would again say that learning any
programming language is all about
learning syntax and getting familiar
with the concept of programming by the
way if you wanted to get started with
the C programming language I have a very
special coupon out there for you so
check out the description for the coupon
code out there and that's a great
concept course which will get you
familiarized with a lot of concept in
the C programming language
that's a great point to get started okay
so summarizing the movie first of all we
took about what is code set of computer
instruction given by some smart
programmer to a dumb computer to perform
a specific task which language you
should choose that requires a lot of
research
maybe web development maybe iOS Android
Java Python scripts and the tons of
things like that so always take your
time watch a lot of YouTube videos take
advice from a lot of experienced
developer that I want to do this
specific thing which language I should
get started with that's gonna be a great
point and that's all for this movie make
sure that you do hit the subscribe
button out there I like the video if you
liked it and share the video if you
think it can be useful for someone else
out there with this I'll be coming back
on to this series maybe tomorrow
and we will discuss more important
concepts about the programming at that
point of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
