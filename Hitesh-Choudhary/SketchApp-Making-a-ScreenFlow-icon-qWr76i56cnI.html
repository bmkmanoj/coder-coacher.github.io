are learning to replicate the logos by
various techniques this well this is one
of our handy works in the first couple
of movies we tried with the whatsapp
then the mail icon this is the image
this is our job and the next that I was
looking up for making the videos I found
that this is gonna be a great example so
I looked up for the ScreenFlow and I
think we are gonna replicate this guy
which is the latest ScreenFlow 6 logo
again we are not the creators of the
logo of this guy it belongs whole
copyrights and everything belongs to the
screen club so I'm gonna drag and drop
it into my assets and let's just drag
and drop it oops did I did that up and
there we go ok so let's go on to the
sketch and I'm working on just for one
file so that you can look on whatever
the work we are doing so it's a good
idea not to create many files because we
won't be using them so what we can do is
I can select all of these guys and these
are inside the mail we have grouped them
no problem and this is okay this is text
somewhere I'm not able to see that okay
where it is okay this is an T work there
is no whatsapp I think it's good
okay so let's bring this guy onto our
screen
and there we go very short guy let's
move it a little bit up and we know
there is a lot of details going on in
this logo like the color scheme are
these shades but actually these are
triangles and this is a pretty simple
obvious rectangle with some rounded
corners couple of circles which are
actually behind this bar so it's good it
is good so let's just try that so first
of all let's get some guidelines out
there okay and we are gonna follow the
first technique in this case now notice
there is a small shadow out here as well
so we're gonna do that little details
make big things okay so this is good
let's just go a little bit out I'll
present Zed key that converts it into
the magnifying glass and then I'll zoom
it okay this is perfect okay so now I
would like to press o for getting the
oval look for the center ish point there
we go alt and shift and we're gonna drag
and drop it so I think this is good okay
this is good now this is not good
now first of all let's change the fill
to red and reduce the opacity so that we
can see exceed okay it looks good now
they just select that and make it good
so I think there we go reduce this looks
like a fatty circle so let's reduce that
and I think this is good okay now it's
looking good
and in case you are not happy with that
you can move it a little bit out there
from the arrow keys and there we go
looks perfect almost perfect to me
okay this is good now let's just move
this guy out here and a little bit more
we'll talk about the colors later on now
how can i tackle these things the
rectangles now there are a couple of
ways you can just work on with the
vectors actually that would be the best
but let me just try with the rectangles
okay our four rectangle and let's have
something like this and what we're gonna
do rotate that so let's just rotate that
I think this is let's align it out there
and I think we need a little bit
rotation as well yep that is perfect and
there we go little bit out press ENTER
to get out of this mode and I think this
is good and I think this is perfect
almost perfect okay looks good looks
nice let's remove the borders and let's
change the fill to something like
greenish so that we can see what is
popping out and things
okay let's reduce the opacity as well so
that we can see what's going at the back
now let's press R and get a rectangle
again big one this time and remove the
borders and we would like to rotate that
as well so I think there we go and I
think I missed one thing
let me get enter
it's not rounded so the inside thing is
not rounded okay interesting let's go
onto the rotate and try to rotate this
guy a little bit like that place it with
the hands and I think they're not much
so let's whoops let's rotate this again
a little bit and why is rotate not
working
okay I'll click outside click on this
oops
I'm clicking on the transform how is it
gonna rotate if I'll click on the
transform my bad my bad my bad
ok enter making it a good size out there
a little bit out there reduce it very
much out there now let's round the
corners and I think this is almost
perfect so 21 I'd like to go with 20
there we go I always like to stick with
the even numbers and not with the odd
because odd do make a lot of problems
with experience I can tell you that ok
and this is good so let's just change
the fill to something like reddish
red-ish tone and reduce the opacity as
well okay now what I want to do is
select these two rectangles and I would
like to click on the subtract oops I did
a mistake again
because this rectangle the this one
should be on the top and command Z this
rectangle and this rectangle so this
rectangle should be at the bottom okay
and now I can select both and click on
the subtract so that it just leaves me a
line out there okay
let's click on this line and click it
again and we are into the vector mode
oops
command Z I think this is good perfect
almost perfect
not just okay now we'll keep it out here
somewhere okay we will fix that later on
or maybe just now like that and this is
good let's align this guy as well I
think this is already perfect okay so
smart guides are helping me I think red
color is not a good choice because it's
gonna make a lot of problems in the
smart guides so let's get this a little
bit greenish okay this is good
now about the circle so let's remove all
the guides are there and you know you
can handle the things quite in a number
of ways so let's just say oh for mobile
and I think this is the center almost
and press the key
you don't which keys and let's just zoom
it a little bit let's move it
I'm using my arrow keys to move it okay
I think this is looking good
a little bit ight okay this is not
perfect I don't like the borders and
what we're gonna do is we are gonna make
one mole so oh four oval and alt and
shift and Center ish point and there we
go the outer point remove the borders
change the fill to something like
reddish not reddish bluish greenish and
let's just reduce the opacity so that we
can see through it okay looks good looks
good and again my outer shape oval six
should be on the bottom so I'll just
move it up and I'll select both the
shapes command and click on the subtract
okay
so we got the logo or the round circle
now what I'll be doing is I'll press my
Alt key and I'll be making a copy of the
circle okay it looks good so pretty easy
job and I think this is almost okay SH I
will not call it call it perfect okay
but okay each job
and I'll put my smart guides out there
and there there and there as well okay
let's get out here and I'll select this
guy shift and this guy as well now let's
move them out there I think somewhere
there or maybe I'll use arrow key to
move them a little bit let's go into the
zoom and I think this is not much space
out there and this is okay this is gonna
work so shift and let's use something
else color like this and now I'm gonna
select this guy as well as this guy and
press Union so that it looks like this
but you know the rectangle is actually
looking full so command Z and I think
this is just like that so this shape is
actually not on the forward I can move
it on too forward but this is actually
on the back side of this and this is
looking good perfect okay now it's time
to change the color of the things so
select this select this and this guy and
let's change the fill to complete white
move turn up the opacity to full and
there we go
let's change this guy color to fill
make the fill of this color and what
else we can do
from the opacity already remove the
borders okay this is looking nice
already looking good
and one thing that is not looking good
is actually this guy so this guy I'll
move it on to the forward and what else
we are missing we're missing about her
so he should have a border and this
border would be not this color obviously
let's have it a white color a little bit
dark because I think there is a little
bit darker shade of white of course so I
think this is good okay so now it's
giving us a feel that it's above but I
think a shadow would be much better
so Ave I shadow would be good minus 1 I
think yes let's remove the border and
yes this is much better I would say much
sharp actually I like it adding our own
flavors no big deal
and I think this is looking good with
the shadows because it's giving us the
feel that yes this guy's on the top and
these are on the bottoms ok now let's
tackle the final guy remove all guides
and v4 vector this is easy click here
click on here and we're gonna click here
move it a little bit round ish like that
click on this guy a little bit like this
and press the command to make it
straight there we go
click here little bit roundish not much
and there we go and I think I need to go
way into the zoom because this is messed
up so command Z a couple of times and
one more time so I'll go into this and
I'll click there and it's it's good like
that and then I'll just click here just
like that
almost good take your time no problem in
that
press command and let's join the shapes
okay now it's good
let's click enter and I think this is
good let's go one more time zoom and
this is not a perfect job so let's
double click there move these guys to a
little bit out there this one a little
bit like that like that and this one
will go a little bit out this is okay
this is okay and obviously this will
look so good and not like that obviously
let's move this as well so I think this
is good let's remove the border and give
it a fill and this will look good okay
let's go back a little bit zoom let's
place our guideline so that we can place
it on to a perfect lace and there we go
oops now got links there we go click on
this and drag it out there so I think
we'll place it here
and change the fill color to pure white
and this is little bit bumpy here but I
think you can work out on on that at
your own time
so although we can fix that just by
removing this point and I think this
point should go here somewhere and let's
just remove this point as well I think
this is better shape actually little bit
triangle ish but you can just fix that
as well yep I think I like this I like
this there is a small bump there as well
but you can fix that no problem
considered as an assignment I know this
is mean but you can just work out now
there is one more thing remaining in the
shadows but I think video is going to
long so let's just finish up this some
finishing touch in the next movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
