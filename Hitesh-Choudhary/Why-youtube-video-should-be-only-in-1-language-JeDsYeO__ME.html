another video now recently I got a
comment in my section and in fact these
comments were keep popping again and
again and in fact I got a couple of
emails and some Facebook page requests
as well that's why I don't make videos
in Hindi okay so we need to understand
this a little bit more detail why the
channel should only have one language
now I know this is a little bit of
overwhelming subject but let's just try
to understand what I am trying to say
now the number one goal of any language
is to communicate the thoughts that what
I am saying should be transferred to you
exactly without missing any information
that's the point of any language now
some of you might be thinking that hey
when you will be trying to speak in
Hindi or maybe other languages it will
give your users much more connectivity
so that he can understand what you are
trying to say much more frequently much
more awesomely now I let me break the
pointed here now a lot of my audience is
not only from India is coming from a
five variety of entire globe so if I
will be speaking in Hindi obviously they
won't be understanding it I get your
point that somehow we are going to get
connectivity and to give this myth
around that when you speak in your
native language people get more
connective let me break this myth and
try to do a simple experiment okay when
I speak in English you are getting my
words you are trying to understand what
I am saying and you are actually getting
Dutch up my job hindi Mabel's down to up
mr. kuch locha so much may I garlic in
Bakke loom kobilka summers nagashima job
or wrong hola habla espanol pero esto
significa que double hablas español en
mis videos did you got my point when I
was speaking in English you were getting
me completely when I moved into Hindi
some of you people who were bilingual
like who knows Hindi and English as well
but feeling much more connected with me
but as soon as I tried and moved into
Spanish the people who knew
actually we're feeling much more
connected so the English and Spanish
were feeling connected but having no
idea what I speak in Hindi similarly
those people who speak Hindi and English
had no idea what I spoke in spanish so
that is why here is my whole point that
I'm trying to say that when your channel
is having just one single language
people feel much more connected and as
reliable actually that hey whatever he
is going to speak they will be able to
understand it now with this I don't want
to say that I have any grudge for any
particular language all languages are
great they are means of communication
and that's all about it I don't have any
grudge on any language I don't say that
this language is better or this language
is a burst or this is best now it's not
it's just a means of communication for
me I don't take it as a part of my ego
anywhere or anytime so you should also
understand that this channel talks about
technical things this channel talks
about codings this is not a channel
where I discuss any random things just
what I want to say it's not about an
entertainment it's about technical it's
about coding it's about sometimes it's
about products and reviews and v logs as
well but most of the time I would like
to say that in this channel I talk about
what is what is technically going on
maybe sometime about DSLRs videos how I
am learning about video of making
process and everything but most of the
time it's going to be technically
coatings and stuff so that is why I am
keeping this channel totally in English
now again since use be writing most of
your code in maybe is somehow little bit
English you will be reading most of your
documentation in English that is why I
think you should also try to focus a
little bit more on English but again
this doesn't mean you need to learn it
and you should only be speaking in
English I don't say that now with this
also I would like to state that that
this channel is always going to be in
english only and totally in english i
may start up a new channel where i can
speak in Hindi or can do tutorials in
Hindi but that's going to be totally
onto a separate channel not at all in
this channel
and for that kind of thing like our
speak are starting a total new channel
in Hindi is not at all in my to-do list
for any time in this year planner not at
all anywhere not neither and planning it
to put it any time soon so that's all
what I wanted to say that yes speaking
into your native language is always
little bit most connectives but when I'm
trying to get a little bit more
connection with you a lot of people are
losing what I'm saying in that
particular language and I don't think so
that that's a good idea so don't take it
personally don't take it like a grudge
or anything this channel is going to be
in english only and that's what i wanted
to say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
