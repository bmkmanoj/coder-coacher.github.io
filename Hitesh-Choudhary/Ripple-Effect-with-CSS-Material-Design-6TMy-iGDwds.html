again with another video in this video
we're gonna do some ripple effect now
let me tell you first of all the two
things that I really want to share the
first thing is we all love bootstrap now
the reason we love bootstrap and web
development because we are all not so
good in designing the thing the CSS part
bootstrap what it allows us it gives us
some file we add those files and just
add a class in our tags like buttons
and it just works we all love this kind
of feature by the way if you're not
aware of the bootstrap you definitely
want to check out my complete front-end
development course but onto the right
track again the thing is we want the
things to be simplified and in today's
video I'm gonna show you how you can
simplify the ripple effect in case you
don't know what the ripple effective I
will tell you in a moment or if or the
ripple effect is something which came up
with the material design of the Google
and Android ish thing and you just click
on the button it gives you a very thing
over the button it's not that much
important but it looks so subtle and so
cool that I really wanted to design that
so in this video let's quickly design
that and it's not a big deal you can
quickly just copy and paste some code
that I'll give to you and just add that
class and that's it so without wasting
any more time let's go ahead onto my
screen and let's do that quickly to
ripple effect on buttons you'll be
surprised to know that how easy it is to
have a ripple effect so let me just walk
you through with that bring up your
editor whatever that is in case in my
case it's Adam and in your case it can
be sublime text no big deal there so
just add up a folder there there we go I
have dragged a dropper folder here and
we're gonna press command + or ctrl n to
get a new file and let's just save this
and we're gonna save this as simply
index dot HTML we always save that like
that and just get a symbolic plate code
not like that but yeah just like that so
there we go we have got some boilerplate
code and then we're gonna have a
container so div dot container and there
we go and inside that we need a button
so there we go
we're having a button and it's gonna say
something like this oops I can type my
name correct if I can remember there we
go not a big deal and we need one more
file and this is gonna be our CSS file
so I'm gonna save that as style dot CSS
there we go not a big deal and now we
can just link this file up so that could
be pretty easy we can just have a link :
CSS there we go style or CSS now we need
to launch that file so I can open that
up in my chrome somewhere okay there we
go
so there we go our file is here and we
can just have it I'm gonna keep this
aside for a minute so that we can have
some stylings here so in the meantime
I'm gonna open up a blog article here
and there we go and we will use that in
a second don't worry I'm not doing
anything outside the screen kind of
stuff okay so first of all we're gonna
need something stylings here because
this right now doesn't look cool so we
can say dot container and our regular
stuff is gonna be like background color
is gonna be like we can just use a c1 c1
c1 which is a light grayish I remember a
few colors okay in a big deal we can
have a height here as well of 500 pixels
again and we can have like flex oops not
a flex it's kind of a display flex and
again justify content center a line item
Center I think I'm going a little fast
but no big deal you can just pause me
there and copy and paste so in the
button we're gonna add a class so this
class is gonna be something like BTN
just like that and here we can just pick
that class of BTN and we can grab some
colors from learn code online color
picker and I but right now I'm gonna
just not do that and I'm gonna just do
something very bad which is orange
you should never write the colors like
that but I'm I'm doing that still okay
so just colors and we're gonna pick up
white there and we're gonna have the
size text size font size
sorry font size and we're gonna get
pretty big here 40 pixels okay
and we're gonna have some padding and
from top and bottom I'm gonna get 20
pixels and from left and right I'm gonna
grab 40 pixels there so pretty big deal
and it should look pretty good and there
we go quickly we have got a button it
just looks like this plain simple button
not a big deal okay and what we can do
now is we can add a ripple effect to
this button so that when you click on it
a wave of circle just goes like that it
looks beautiful so what you can do is go
to learn code online dot and I have
published a recent blog just recording
before recording this video so you can
just search for getting perfect ripple
effect we by the way post a lot of blogs
article which you should definitely read
so go ahead read them and just open this
in case you are not finding it just
search for it you'll find that and there
we go all you have to do is copy this
code so this is already being written
and there is a class you can notice
there is a class with ripple here and
you just have to add this class you can
bring up a separate file and can do that
in this case we don't need that so we
can just paste this code directly here
now what you have to do is add this
class just here so you can add an
existing class just like that save that
and you can go back oops hit a reload
there and now it will work here to
hill's work and the good news is you can
use them alongside with the bootstrap as
well no big deal and I have explicitly
choosen the white color here because it
looks so good but you have a white it
looks awesome with any color like for
example if my color is something not
orange it's like blue any other
selection of color like black can be not
so good so that's why I have chosen it
so for example the bottom of blue or the
white effect will still be there and if
the color is black it looks pretty dope
so let me just show you that and just
hit a reload there and there we go it's
a subtle white its subtlety that makes
things beautiful it should be not so
much aggressive it should look good so
there we go and you can obviously style
that a little bit more or it can have
that so yes the blog article is here you
can just note down that you are a link
or you can just search on learn code
online dot and blog pretty good pretty
good I like that so this is this was a
quick ripple effect now I know this is
not the world's most perfect ripple
effect but it just does the job is
there can be a variety of ripple effect
like it it can start from here and can
transition can go upside with a nice and
beautiful animation or it can be like
coming from one side clicking other side
clicking it it can be evaluated quite a
lot but the best part is you are not
adding any jaysis file like javascript
file or any other extra things it just
works so that's it for this video and
I'll catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
