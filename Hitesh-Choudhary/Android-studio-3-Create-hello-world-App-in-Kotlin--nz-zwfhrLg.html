see on the screen there is something
special we do have got Android studio 3
so I'll walk you through with a couple
of things like for example how you can
create a simple hello world app in
Android tree using Catalan and I'll also
show you how you can convert your
existing Java code into Catalan and
you'll also notice that a couple of good
things in here and I'll walk you through
with all these steps so we will be
learning quite a lot of stuff let me
just remind you what we are here for the
goal of this video is just to create a
simple hello world application in
Catalan using Android studio 3 and we'll
just place a button on the screen and
we'll make a toast with that button ok
simply a toast
the toast is going to say hello world
that's it that's it you want to complex
the things but it's super easy people
and will also make you understand that
how now you can use the power of Java as
well as Catalan okay let me get started
and this is the Android studio 3 I have
also got an Android emulator
up and running and by the way lel's to
show you one more cool thing by the end
of this video which is one app that is
already there on the simulator
I just just saw that and let us start
with there so how we can proceed
that's a good question just click on the
start new Android studio project and
notice notice this guy if you haven't
let me zoom there include Kotlin support
super awesome why not and let us call
this as something like cool hello cool
hello but that's good and it should
begin with uppercase so cool hello that
is good and we will also check mark this
include Kotlin support which gives us
things and just to just to give you an
overview Catalan support was previously
also there but in the end reg studio 2
point X we needed to install a plug-in
and named as jetbrains and that gives an
access to the Catalan and once we have
installed that plug-in we could have
used the Catalan and everything and a
lot of people are already doing that
just to give you an idea
now the
that is completely trying to get
involved all the latest feature in the
Catalan in the Android as well as
Pinterest is totally on the Catalan
support and millions of people are using
it so yes the the whole idea is now you
can use the power of Java as well as
Catalan and can combine them together so
that I hope you understand the whole
goal is to serve the user it doesn't
matter what language you are using as
soon as it is good and easy and just
does the job okay enough of the rant
about Java in Catalan let's do something
meaningful so just check mark this and
let's click on there everything is fine
and I'll just use an empty activity and
next main activity is is okay in this
case okay there we go
and things are okay and straightforward
you can notice that the file side in dot
Katie I'll show you how you can convert
your existing Java project into Catalan
as well all along with me press command
shift a if you are on a PC command
always means control not always most of
the time it means control so control
shift a it will open up this pop-up and
just say convert convert convert files
oops
what am I writing oh my goodness there
we go convert Java files to Kotlin and
just hit enter there it will do
automatically everything for you yep
it's that easy okay now what we want to
do is place a button and come on where
is that design okay there we go and
design and this should be zoomed a
little bit ninety yeah that's fine why
don't you make everything big I just
like big things make it everything big
there we go let's place the button there
a button should have an ID because I'll
be needing that I'll call this as hello
me and it can also have on click
functionality but I don't think so I'll
be needing that right now I don't want
to do any big things in here but
just keep it something like collect
maybe I'll need that maybe but I don't
think so I'll need that okay let us see
how we can proceed within within here so
there we go now we need to do a little
bit of configuration here because
straightforward things are not going to
be working yet I think in the future
edition of the end of studio three it
may work but right now we need to do a
couple of things let's go into the
Gradle script and is this no this is not
the guy yep this is the guy so go into
this guy Gradle dot build module app not
the project cool hello so there we go
now straightforwardly this line is
already written at line number three I
know this is this is very small this is
very small for you to read and come on
file system okay where where is the font
just give me font colors and font okay
font and okay this is this is too much
of the highlighting default okay and I
would like to bump this font to maybe 20
yeah 20 for any food is good it looks
good this is too big for me pardon me
pardon me for that and this should be 20
okay looks great looks good so this line
is already written apply a plug-in
cuttle in Android and we need one more
of this which is Cortland extension by
the way this is not super important but
it makes our life easier cause in
extensions make sure you keep an eye on
that okay this is one thing also we
would like to import for the toast this
guy which is ankle very famous in the
world of Catalan people there are a lot
of such libraries that you can import it
makes life super easy it will just give
you a toast and a lot of other things
will be you can import the entire anko
project but for this little thing it
would be an overkill so will be just
importing the common guy and it will not
work it will not work let me show you
why where is that guy there we go I can
just add it into the dependencies
this will not work because right now
this ankle version variable is not
declared so we need to find the version
it is 0.1 0.0 dot zero so 0.1 0.0 there
we go and we can save this guy and click
on sync now things are happy now okay
and how you can work with the anchor is
pretty simple all you have to do is go
into this main guy what did we named our
button I forgot that hello me hello me
and all you have to do is call this
hello me and you can set on click
listener and what you can do is can
utilize the power there's a little bit
let's get rid of this and place press a
curly braces there we go use the curly
braces and can simply say there that hey
I want to use at toast and in the toast
I should say hello there people save
that and I would like to run this guy
yeah run that on Nexus 5
I should have created a better device
Nexus 5 is not that good will serve the
job for us right now where is that raise
that device there we go so we have got a
button and if I click on that it says
hello there people pretty awesome I can
do it again hello there people live we
have set it the click function there as
well maybe maybe we can use that later
on in some of the videos right now it is
pretty cool to just see hello there
people so this is your almost exactly
the same thing but now this is in the
Kotlin let me also show you that you can
convert your code convert a Java to
Catalan and on the website off not the
first link this is this is not what you
want this is you this is you want
Catalan lang okay and try it online go
on to that and click on this convert
Java and paste your Java code there and
it will convert your Java code into
Catalan there we go as simple as it
sounds
and one more thing that I wanted to show
you this is not related to this video
but let me show you an app which I was
working on and that is completely in
react native and just just one this is
the login app and notice how beautiful
that looks if this is all what we are
doing right now for one other project so
this is the thing which we are these are
pretty good pretty good thing in here
okay we can do so in okay just wanted to
show you that yeah this is this is
something beautiful that is coming up
I'll keep you posted what we are doing
and how we are doing it what I think you
have enjoyed quite a lot in this very
short 10 minute video and we have
learned about how we can create an
project in Android studio 3 using
Kathleen and can configure it this is
the base configuration that you need to
have let me know in the comment section
below how you have liked this kind of
video and that's it now it's time to go
hit outside because I have been just
working for quite a long I need to get
fresh air it'll be time enjoy this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
