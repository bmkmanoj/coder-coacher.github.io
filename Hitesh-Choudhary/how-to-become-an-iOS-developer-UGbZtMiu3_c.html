youtube channel now today I'm going to
be discussing a very important and
crucial question that I get quite often
out there and that is how to become an
iOS developer now in this video you will
get the entire process of becoming an as
developer what are the problems the easy
ways and all these things and I'll be
completely honest with you in this movie
I won't be selling any of my curses my
boot camps or anything just complete
honest scenario how you can start to
become an iOS developer because becoming
an Al's developer is far more good than
any other mobile application developer
yes they are good but the payments in
the iOS development is quite high
nowadays this is the present scenario it
might change in the future but right now
the iOS development is far more
expensive as compared to the other
developments so it's good people are
getting much more money in the eyes
development ok so how does the process
starts to become an iOS developer now
this is the process that I would like to
show you but obviously there are some
exceptions let's not talk about them so
the very first thing that I would like
to suggest all of you to before
beginning becoming an iOS developer is
to get friendly with the iOS environment
you might be having an Android phone or
a Windows Phone or maybe Ubuntu phone
but if you want to develop some apps for
iPhone then the environment should be
very friendly with you first of all it's
really really required a lot of people
say that it's not compulsory to have an
iPhone with you I say that yes it's not
compulsory to have an iPhone but you
should be completely familiar with how
the screen looks like how the segues are
moved how the app transition happens
from one screen to another screen and
how the permission pop-up looks like and
how how the segues actually move on and
a lot of things like that so that you
can understand the feel and polished
look that Apple is trying to give in
each application without that you might
be able to design that but but that is
that is not going to be a great app so
first of all familiarize ation with the
iOS environment is very much important
out there
the
thing that you might want to have is a
Mac operating system now you can have a
Mac Mini a MacBook MacBook Air MacBook
Pro maybe iMac or anything like that but
it's required and it's really compulsory
out there to release your apps in the
iOS App Store and a lot of people will
say that you can go on and work on with
the virtual environment virtual machines
some online virtualizations and can work
on with that you can also work with the
hacking toshin all of that but that's
not gonna work believe me you can work
on the hackintosh but at the time when
your apps might want to get released out
there you will for shall require a
Macintosh out there so go ahead and the
easiest option is a Mac Mini because you
get a fusion drive good amount of RAM
good amount of hard disk it's it's
obviously a great choice for the bigness
so I started my development with the Mac
Mini and it's a great piece of hardware
you might want to get that but in case
you are having MacBook Pro or Mac Mini
or bag bouquet or high Mac whatever it's
going to work so make sure that you have
that okay so that's requirement number
two now once you will get started with
the familiarization and it's done then
you can move on to the development phase
now obviously the language that you
might want to learn for the iOS
development is Swift not objective-c now
because I expect you are starting right
now not before that and you might want
to get familiarized with the Swift but
designing an iOS app is a little bit
tricky process although you might be
working in some company or maybe like
that but if you are looking for
freelancer the number one step is to
design your app not to code your app so
you might want to take a piece of paper
or maybe a pencil pan whatever you like
to have and on the piece of paper just
design just a rough rough sketch off
your app that this is going to be my
flash screen this is going to be my
first screen then when a person taps on
this then I can tap move on to this guy
then my image will look like this then
my app will look like this image and
things like that so make sure that you
have a rough sketch onto your piece of
paper
that is really really important
otherwise if you'll just madly go out
and simply just will be coding on the
Xcode it's not going to work ever
because you will be confused what should
I do what what is my next step so
obviously the piece of paper is still
required okay once that is done then you
might want to hire a designer or if you
are already a designer working with a
Photoshop or sketch or maybe some other
tools like that you might want to design
the interface for your app how the login
screens would look like the signup
buttons are the forms where you can fill
up the emails and passwords and all
these things how does it look like when
the users turn on click on the sign up
button how the next screen will move and
will look like and all these things
there is a good app out there sketch
which I do like most of the hires
developer like you might want to get
started with that
in case you are working on the
freelancer otherwise you can hire a
designer as well no big deal and there
there is a invision website on which you
can just upload all of these images and
can simulate that how your app will look
like on a real device in your hand or
maybe on the simulators as well now once
that process is done then you might want
to move on to the Swift and design a few
cool apps like hello world and that is
going to be a good scenario of getting
friendly with the iOS design then a good
knowledge of the Swift is required but
don't focus too much on the Swift
because Swift is just a way to how to
process the loops how to process the
functions and all these things a lot of
functions and things are already pre
written by the Apple so you might want
to get friendly with that like for
example up the date picker view or the
picker view how we can implement them
what are the required functions
what is the protocols and all these
things you know so once you get friendly
with that then this complete your app
and in a polished manner all the images
should be there all the graphic designs
and everything make sure that you don't
forget to export all of your images into
1x 2x and 3x it is required and read the
hague as well the human interface
guidelines by the Apple so that you can
design best possible icons and can fix
the widths and high
of all the images and everything on to a
best possible manner according to the
Apple guideline the human interface
guidelines okay now once your app is
ready make sure that you play with it
for at least a day or a couple of day or
in case you have some family members or
friends just pass on your apps by taking
your taking their mobile phone and
installing that app directly out there
now it's possible in the Xcode 8 to just
pass on the app into any iPhone or iPad
just like that so make sure that you
played for a couple of days and then the
final thing comes up is registering for
an account for a license and it's paid
it's right now a $99 for a year and it's
not much because you're going to earn
quite a lot if you just release a lot of
apps in the App Store so it's not heavy
but this is a barrier that Apple has
deliberately created so that the rubbish
app don't comes in because if a person
is spending $99 for the app for sure he
is very serious about that and he wants
to release the Paulist and the perfect
app out there so once you have applied
for the license it usually take
sometimes one day sometimes seven days
so between a week just expect that the
license is going to come up and
thereafter you will be writing
provisioning certificates
that's easy process and you can just
release your App Store then Apple gives
you a separate platform on which you can
track your analytics your downloads your
reviews and a lot of things like that so
this is an entire process of becoming an
iOS developer I hope the video was quite
interesting and gave you a little bit of
knowledge as well in case you want me to
discuss about something others as well
do let me know it's always fun to talk
on the YouTube and thumbs up for the
video subscribe to my channel and I will
be waiting for your comments below the
