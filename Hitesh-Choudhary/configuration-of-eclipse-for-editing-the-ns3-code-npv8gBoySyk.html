three video guide now I hope you are
following me up with the previous videos
as well and in the last movie we saw how
it is difficult to install the net annum
and all of that but really the typical
part was to edit the code because we
were not aware about any kind of
suggestions we were not getting any
suggestions and all of that thing so to
get rid of that we can work on any IDE
and in fact I really wonder sometime
that why people work on the editor like
notepad or notepad plus plus when we
have got editors out there when we have
got IDs out there like eclipse is one of
my favorite all-time favorite when I
work on the C C++ maybe Python Ruby I
always prefer to work on Eclipse but
depends on your choice what you prefer
so what I'll be telling you in this
movie let's first go onto the full
screen mode and what I'll be telling you
in this movie in this movie we are going
to install the Eclipse and configure it
now we are going to configure the
Eclipse editor now there is a reason why
I'm calling the Eclipse as an editor and
not as an IDE because I would recommend
you to please write your code or edit
your code in the Eclipse but please
don't run that inside the Eclipse it's
not recommended at all and what you
could have done here is just configure
the Eclipse on run your code from the
command line the valve a so first of all
let's try to take out the things what
you need actually for that of course you
will need a copy of eclipse I'll tell
you which one is that
let our Firefox load come on Firefox
please hurry up and here it is and what
I'll do I'll open up my terminal also by
just typing ter and here is my terminal
let me bring it down here for the
maximum visibility I'll first of all try
type Java - version and you can see I
have got the latest Java one point eight
zero point zero
underscore two five now how I got that
because when you run on the Eclipse
first thing that you require is the
you should have Java and there are a
couple of ways to install it first of
all you can run that by command-line way
let me show you what is that you can
simply launch your snap tick and I have
to give my password and here it is
although I like the other way around
because it's really convenient for me
but what you can do just type eclipse -
CDT scroll down a bit because we don't
want any of these and here it is so what
you have to do just tick mark on that
mark for installation and it will do
rest of the things for you but what I
have found during the couple of
installation I did it three to four
times before making this video that this
installation process is really slow
although I have a decent internet speed
with 8 Mbps but still it was slow maybe
I don't know because of virtual machine
or something like that but I would tell
you another way which is bit faster Daz
I compared first thing that you need is
eclipse.org islas download go to this
webpage and make sure that it is
selected as Linux since you are
following me on the Ubuntu and which
eclipse you need this is the one the
Eclipse ID for C C++ developer make sure
that you choose the right one it is a
32-bit or 64-bit I hope you can find out
in your Linux which bit it is if not
just pose down in the comment and I will
show you a quick way of how to find it a
little bit version on 64-bit version
next thing you need is the JDK the Java
development kit you can simply got it
from the Oracle website and I will show
you a very interesting link of Vicki how
and this link says install Oracle Java
on Ubuntu Linux this is really a nice
guide out here on how to install the JDK
or GRE on to your machine make sure that
you install JDK and what you have to do
here is instead of this one point seven
point zero five make sure that you give
the exact number of the version which
you are using in the JDK apart from that
there is a screenshot guide really nice
one and here is the guide which will
tell you which version you have
and apart from that I found this really
really interesting and nice and easy
article to make sure that how you
install and configure the path of your
Java properly that's the whole thing
whole story that what you need once you
have downloaded the Eclipse you can
simply extract the files extracting the
files is really easy let me show you
what the command is it's simply tar - X
vzf and then the name of that your file
which is eclipse - cpp and all of that
I've already extracted my file so what I
will do I'll open up my Eclipse and it's
just a simple extraction file just click
on this icon and your eclipse will load
up and let's just wait for a couple of
seconds till the Eclipse loads up and
the first thing it will ask for is the
workspace now workspace is done nothing
else just a folder where all of your
configurations or files are to be saved
so just click on OK
if you mess around and your
configuration goes wrong you can make
sure that you can simply run it again
and change your workspace and click on
OK I'm configuring it all for the first
time here on this machine so it's not at
all a problem yet when it loads for the
first time it takes a couple of movement
and this video is going to be a bit long
so make sure that you have your tea or
coffee around with you it's going to
take a couple of moments to conjugate up
Eclipse but it's the really worth pain
to have and here it is about to load and
it's taking still time to configure I'll
maximize the screen and I'll actually
close this welcome screen I don't need
that ok so all of your meaning a menu is
on the top of the bar so what you need
to do is first of all you need to
explore the project and install
a couple of things inside it so let's
try to install a couple of things and
make sure that you have got your
internet connection for it first of all
let's click on the help and install a
new software here it is install a new
software and we want to install a
mercurial here so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go to a path and what I
will do here is I will try HTTP colon
slash slash and the path which you want
to give here is sibs dot Java fuj
dot-com slash updates and make sure it's
not updates it's just update I'll copy
it because I'll need it one more time
and I'll click on the add I'll just
paste it here otherwise if you leave
this name as a blank it doesn't really
matter but I'll just keep it there click
on the ok now depending on the speed of
your internet connection it is going to
take a while and here it is now you
don't need the code Beamer right now
with the Milan integration you just need
a mercurial Eclipse and make sure that
the rest of the things are also selected
once you have that click on the next
accept the license and terms in
agreement which you let which it will
ask in a moment okay so I'll just click
on the next on this screen and here what
we have got the mercurial accept the
license and some terms in the agreement
and click on the finish so once it has
got installed it will say that cliffs
need to be restarted and there is no
reason not to do it so I'll just click
on yes and I will allow my Eclipse to
restart and in a moment it will launch
up it's been really cold out here in
India so this reason the videos are
getting slowly uploaded I really it's
kind of really hard to work in these
winters out here in India
let's load it up and so what we have
done so far we have downloaded and
configured a little bit of mercurial but
we need to do a lot more than that so
let's try to do that and here is our
Eclipse now what we need to do first of
all we need to create a new project so
that we can have that and to do that
what I will do I will click on the file
click on the new and I will create a new
project that would be a C++ project in
the C++ project I will give NS 3 as the
name of my project I will choose the
default location I would not make a
trouble out of it and there is the
important thing the tool chain you don't
want to make the Linux GCC you want to
make the Cross GCC out here in this case
I'll click on the next and here is the
debug and release all of the executables
and all of that and you don't need to
worry about that
and what I will do here is is first of
all I'll go to the back and I'll change
this location actually because I don't
want to copy my files I'll go to the
desktop and 3 all in one and ns3 I'll
select this one and click OK
so that I can edit them on the go
now it says directly via the specified
name already exists and you don't need
to worry about that I'll just give it as
NS 3 to 0 that's the name which is more
relevant and I'll just click on the next
and here are the d bugs and the release
and we will just configure them in a
moment for right now just click on the
next and we are also going to configure
the compiler and all of that but right
now I would just say click on the finish
and we have got all the paths files and
libraries out here a lot of files are
out here now although you can directly
work on here but what I'll be doing I'll
be doing a couple of more things here ok
so what I will do I'll make
first of all there are a couple of
important things you need to be aware of
first of all inside the dick stop I'll
go into the ns3 all-in-one and inside
that I'll go in the Ennis tree if I'll
do ALS I can make sure that the valve is
here and I'll click on PWD now when I
click on the PWD you can notice there is
a path from the slash that's a slash
home Ubuntu desktop and us all in one
and all those three I'll copy this part
because because we are going to need
that in a moment and after that what I
will do now once you have created a new
c+ 4 project with your preference name
you should choose the install NS 3 path
for the project and as I have told you
before I install NS 3 in my in on my
desktop so that would be my path now
what I will do I'll right-click on this
project I'll do it and I'll right-click
on it and I'll click on the project and
I'll go to the team I'll click on this
share project and right now it's being
set to the mercurial I'll just click on
that and click on the next and there is
my path shared repository path and make
sure it is as it is it shows your path
and I'll click on the finish that's the
one thing you need to do it will just
take a couple of moments and there it is
it shows the edgy status pending now
it's default and that's the one thing
you need to do now we haven't configured
our valve yet so we need to configure
our valve also so what for that you need
to do right click on this and then click
on the properties oops right click and
here are the properties I'll open up the
properties and I'll click on the C C++
belt and I'll uncheck these boxes
both of them now the first box is for
the use default build but and the second
one is for the generate make build file
automatically we don't want to do that
and what I will do here is I'll make
sure that I'll delete this make and
instead of that I'll copy paste my path
and also at the end I will write WEF
make sure that you copied it properly
also in this I'll do the same thing just
with a small difference I will put a
slash and I will put a built that's the
one thing we need to do and then I'll
click on the behavior tab and what you
have to do click on the behavior tab and
remove the all option here so what I'll
do here it is and ok so I'll just check
mark it again and I will write build and
after that I'll check mark them again
clean and all of that I'll click on OK
it will take a couple of moments to
configure it and that's it so what we
have done so far is it's really good we
have configured our path also now let's
try to configure our debugger also so
what I'll do
ok so now what I'll do I'll just click I
would like to configure my debug
applications so I'll just click on this
here and debug configurations and after
opening up the debug configuration I'll
click on this one my new configurations
and I'll remove this space here I would
select my project as and it's three this
one three to zero ok that's the one
thing and I would search for my project
and that would be my simulator for the
scratch so I will just write here
scratch
oops here it is the scratch simulator
and I'll click on okay and then I would
like to set my environments also so I
will just click on the new environment
and the name of my environment would be
LT underscore library underscore butts
now this is written in the documentation
of NS tree and you should keep it as it
is and I'll paste my path again whatever
I have copied and I would put a slash
build at the end of that and I will
click on OK and I'll click on the app
and of this click on apply and click on
the close so okay so you have configured
all of your libraries and the bug paths
and all of that now what we need to do
now we can open up any file copy of that
and can run from there clips as well as
from the valve but again I would
recommend to run it from the valve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
