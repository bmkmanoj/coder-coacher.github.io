with another video now in today's video
I want to talk about how to prepare the
best resume to get a job in IT yes
everybody wants to have a job and in
order to get a job you have to apply for
it and when you apply for that resume a
is one good thing that you always submit
so in this video I'll not only talk
about it I will show you what the best
resume it looks like and for sure I hope
many of you can just mold your resume
according to that and can proceed and
can have a successful job there so let's
get started
in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps and
pretty much everything related to
technology so in case you are new here
consider subscribing now what is the
main job that I do at this channel apart
from teaching your programming and
creating web apps and mobile apps is to
guide you how you can be professionally
ninety and can get job and everything
related to that and one of the doubt
with the bigness is how we can create
those good resumes now I have got two
receivers with me and I'll show you what
is good and what is not so good I won't
call it bad but it's not so good okay
now when you apply for a job as a
programmer now don't think like a
programmer think like who is the person
trying to hire now the one person who is
trying to hire you meet the programmer
okay I hope you are very clear with that
if that person is not looking for a
programmer probably the job is not for a
programmer the job might be for a deli a
10th grade student who can just pick up
some calls can answer the people about
why your PC is not working or maybe some
support jobs ok I hope you understand
that if a job is there for programmer
the person sitting behind the wall needs
to understand that we are hiring a
programmer and don't worry there are
enough people who are pretty much aware
that we are hiring programmer so let's
look at the resumes here you might look
at the screen there I have to look at it
my phone so this is the first resume
that we have got here ok so at the top
we have got meaning that's good we
always require your name and then got a
few address telephone number email
that's nice contact information is
always good ok and there's a big object
of aspiring to take up challenging blah
blah and pretty much you know that
nobody is going to read that and that is
why you haven't spent much of the time
there you might have already copied it
from your friends resume and that
template is going around in bed
College I hope I'm right and then there
is a big box of education you might have
seen that quite a lot of time where your
temp certification your 12 certification
marks and your college first 10 seconds
entered them and all these things goes
on but do you really think anybody cares
about that and pretty much honestly
nobody actually looks at that and then
there are some key skills now this is
where a potential employee is looking up
and he says a he or she whatever it is
we shave a database skills Oracle 10g
Microsoft ok programming JB 11 web
technologies asp.net other programming
language PC shove and all of that but
where is the proof that you know these
languages since you have written in your
resume and how can how can I be sure
that you don't see shop you might be say
hey take my interview at least or call
me up do do you think that really a
potential employee has that much of the
time to call every individual submitting
these kinds of resuming and check out
whether do they have a programming
skills or not probably not and you might
have already phased that as nobody calls
you up with that now let me show you
another resuming there and this kind of
resume it always gets selected there and
in this case as stain a happened as well
one of my friend Rahul Rafi he's doing a
AI business there with information
security related to the AI so he hired
this person for an intern and look at
the resume x-rays and second-year
student blah blah and all these things
and he knows about the company and he
saves that in the last line says I would
love to be a part of your company to
learn and contribute to the company
improving security using data and
possible usage of AI so he has studied
about the company that what kind of job
this company is doing and he has been
applied so he says I write about my
working and learning here find my
profile at LinkedIn there which is again
optional if he wouldn't have given the
LinkedIn profile then for sure he would
have been selected and here's the
important part
worried about my coding experience check
them here and notice again there is a
github link there the github is again a
very good and I don't say it should be a
github it can be a bed bucket as well
but github is much more common okay so
go with the flow and he says that all of
his skills that you can check out all
on the github so if he knows code and he
has got a profile there it's on the
github and I hope you get my point that
nobody has time to call you up for an
interview that whether you know this is
skill or not everybody is looking to
submit a portfolio whenever we submit a
portfolio to the client or there is a
deal that we have to crack up we don't
send hey just users because we have this
team or I work from there I work so much
of the years I just say these are my
past projects or these are the things
that I've done in the past and this is
what I can do for you and that's it
within three lines I always crack down
my project because I don't do draw bla
stuff I always take it to my clients
like this is my last ten projects that
I've done with other people check them
out and if you think we are the right
person give me the job and that's it
whenever somebody calls me up for kind
of a big job about maybe some product
that I have to work as a team as a team
member then I always show them my github
I have a couple of github accounts and
based on what kind of people are looking
up I just throw my github profile and
say look if I can fit in there or not
and that would always lend you up in the
job so all in all I'm trying to say is
work on your profile and there is no
shortage of the project that you can do
you are just making an excuse it I don't
know what kind of project needs to be
done hey create anything create a
shopping cart create your own website or
maybe whatever you are doing with a C
C++ Python a Java Ruby Python there is
tons of things that can be made of
you're only making excuses so let's not
be getting hard spheres but that's the
truth work on your portfolio work on
your profile I'm pretty sure you will
land up in your dream job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
