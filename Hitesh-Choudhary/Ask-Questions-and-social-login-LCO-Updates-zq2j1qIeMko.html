again with another video and before you
move on with this video let me tell you
that this is quite late and this is
almost almost one o'clock in the morning
a connect any focus that there we go
it's more than one o'clock in the night
and I'm still recording this video
that's why you can see a little bit
little bit of a low enthusiasm as well
as a little bit red eyes there but again
let's forget all about that and I have
been doing quite some good updates for
the LPO the learn code online dot in the
website that I've recently launched so
this is a video all about the updates
what you can now get and again
everything is included as a free update
whether you had an existing student or
coming up student you'll be able to
access all those features which are
which have updated today so from today
onwards I have actually previously
mentioned that you can get access to the
certificates and certificates are now
better designed and all of you can
access in certificates in all of the
paid courses free courses don't have
certificates because these are not just
completion certificates these are
training certificates signed and along
with a unique ID okay that was a
previous update now as a new update
discussion forums are now enabled with
every lecture now you will get equation
answer section because I understand it's
very important to ask questions and ask
your doubts and all these things so
every every course whether free or paid
will be enabled with the discussion
forum where you can put your question
show off your work that would be one
thing you should be doing if you're
learning something don't hesitate to
show up post some screenshots suppose
some things so that other people can
know that yes you are making progress
and I would request all of the community
to help other students as well in those
discussion you can ask questions can
help other students as well and I'll be
hanging around there as well to assist
you to solve your problems and I'm
looking forward to hire some of the TAS
at the teaching assistants so that they
can help you further in answering your
questions as well so this is a good
update about the discussion forum the
second and I would call the second and
third together because we
just combined together now you can sign
up and log in with Facebook and Google+
that's fantastic news because a lot of
you were worried about the security
issues and all those nothing to be
worried about because under the layer
everything is purely secured nothing to
worry about
but in case your browser is popping you
quite a lot about filling up emails and
all those now you can sign up with
one-click with Facebook and with Google+
as well so that is again a good news I
have done a complete integration
flawlessly everything is working
flawless and you won't feel any
difference now these are the updates
that have pushed up today on the website
but there is one more thing I would like
to say that some of the students might
have faced some of the issues about
getting the course and they have paid
actually and getting it for taxes with
after ten minutes or five minutes so
these are all under control
don't worry about anything them just
shoot me an email with a proper subject
so that I can give you priority there
and can solve their problems okay so
nothing should be worried about and
trust me all of your money is completely
safe and you will get the access of the
course no problems sometimes I'm
sleeping or maybe working on some other
things and cannot reply to the email
immediately but I try my best to reach
out to you everybody as quick as
possible
but sometimes the emails are flooded
around so just trust me that I'll get
back to you soon nothing to be worried
about okay so that's it these are the
few cook quick updates that I wanted to
share about the lco
and I refer the LCU because it's a long
name learn code online dot in so I would
be calling it as LC Oh
let me know what you are calling this
website and if you are enjoying on this
website please post down comment in the
below section that yes you are enjoying
now a lot of you might want to ask hey
what you are doing right now I am
waiting for a meeting I do have a late
night meeting with a client for which I
have to work and I'm also being
approached by one of the publishers for
whom they are asking me to write some
books and all these stuff probably let
us see how that goes off and also I'm
making a fantastic game a tic-tac-toe
you might have played that and I'm
writing
code for tic-tac-toe that is being app
being completely made in Java in Android
so that is also going to come up in the
future courses so that's that's a quick
update that I can give you and share it
with you now and I'll try to make more
such videos about sharing updates what's
happening what will happen next what
courses are coming what I'm doing right
now and all these update and I hope you
are enjoying them and very soon will be
creating more programming related videos
and stuff but that's it for now and I'll
shortly catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
