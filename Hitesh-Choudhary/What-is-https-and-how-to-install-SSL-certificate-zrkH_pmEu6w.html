with another video in this video I will
walk you through what is HTTPS and more
importantly what is SSL certificate now
this is not a regular video which just
says AES UTP means a secure
communication between server and browser
it's way beyond that
and we're going to discuss about what is
http what is HTTPS what is SSL SSL
certificate how these certificates are
generated where you can find one
certificate for your site most
importantly how you can install one SSL
certificate on your website and how we
can verify that the installation was
done decently okay or if there are any
bugs how you can resolve these issues
and such things like that so whole story
short this is one video which are
looking up for for all the information
that you are looking up on the web
regarding SSL certificate install ition
of that on your website and Tom Coplin
so let's get started
now before we get started and talk about
SSL HTTPS and more importantly the
installation of SSL here is a quick
sidebar in case you did noticed we have
moved now completely the learned code
online system on an HTTPS version of
that and we did it in two phases first
of all the main website is the learned
code online dot in and its blog was
moved on HTTPS and now the entire site
and all its sub domain are on HTTPS so
that's the good news and it's a good fun
thing to have that sidebar over now
let's talk about the HTTPS now you might
have heard quite this term quite a lot
HTTP and vs. HTTPS now the reason why
the HTTPS is there on some website and
some website don't have is the hero of
the story which is SSL certificate now
we will talk about how we can get these
SSL certificate and can upload those
website but first let's talk about the
hero of the story what is HTTPS now
let's move on to the history lesson
first now in the early days a protocol
was designed which was named as
hypertext Transfer Protocol nothing so
much mumbo-jumbo here just simply a way
to communicate from browser to web
server and that's your whole story
that's your HTTP but eventually things
become stronger in the hacking community
and a lot of attacks came out around and
also the website got evolved and now a
lot of information valuable information
was being passed by a browser to the web
server and we needed something more
secure because when your data is
travelling in HTTP protocol it just
travels in the clear text format and a
lot of researcher has done a lot of
papers on that using Wireshark and other
interception tools by which they pick up
your request which is going from a
browser to web server so our websites
are getting advanced we are passing
credit card information login
information and a whole bunch of
sensitive data that needs to be
encrypted and that needs to be secure
here comes the story and here comes our
hero which is HTTP HTTP simply makes an
encryption when the request is traveling
from the browser to the web server so
that if anybody picks up that
information it's told encrypted and
looks like a mumbo-jumbo so picking up
the information from that kind of
mumbo-jumbo is little bit hard so how
does the HTTP protocol work now HTTP
protocol works on either of the two
things the SSL which is secure socket
layer or maybe TLS the transport layer
security but both of these things
actually use a PKI
which is public key infrastructure now I
know a lot of you are not aware of what
is infrastructure and what is this
public key private key encryption a
whole lot of things don't worry you
don't have to worry about anything for
especially the SSL thing you just have
to think it like there is a some way of
encrypting the data and that's traveling
around the web and the browser basically
your web server and the browser and
that's it now both of these two
protocols are amazingly awesome you
don't have to worry anything about that
just on to a quick sidebar the PKI which
is public infrastructure uses two keys
one is public and one is private so
anything which is encrypted using public
key can be decrypted by the private key
and vice versa
I may be talking about these or maybe
geeking about a lot of public
infrastructure and these key system and
everything
maybe someday later on in this video
right now you don't have to worry much
about that just keep in mind that it's a
secure channel that is between your
browser and your server now here is an
important question you see two different
kinds of SSL certificates when you visit
most of the web sites the one is the
regular one and another one is the
extended one and this is the reason why
when you visit a banking website you see
the whole green bar turned with the name
of that website I like some XYZ a bank
com that is your extended certificate
while the regular one just simply uses a
lock I can pad I can and that's it now
for most of the website you don't need
an extended certificate but something
like a banking system obviously you need
a little bit more security and a little
bit more extended version of SSL
certificate okay so you told that HTTPS
means hypertext Transfer Protocol secure
so my web site is completely secure from
all attacks nope here's the wrong story
because the word secure is so
much misinterpreted that it doesn't tell
the whole story now your website is
almost secure I would not completely I
would not even completely secure because
ultimately security is evolving process
it's not layout a hard rule coming back
onto the topic the s simply means in
HTTP that your channel your
communication between the web server and
your browser is now encrypted or I can
deliberately say here that it's secure
but what about the other attacks the
attacks like SQL injection cross-site
scripting CSRF and a whole bunch of
other things are still accessible and
can be performed on any web site so for
those kinds of attacks you have to
prevent you have to use other kinds of
preventive measures so yes it's the one
step forward in moving into the security
or the securing of your website but it
doesn't mean the website is fully
secured yes it's a good to have but
don't just rely on that hey I'm going to
have an HTTPS and that's it though it's
the wrong thing does everybody needs an
SSL certificate or should everybody move
their website on HTTPS now there is no
such yes and no for this question
but yes I can talk I can talk you
through with the little bit detailed
explanation of that now for the regular
websites which I like to call them as
brought your website simply website
having my name my work experience or
contact information and that's it these
are just display websites and brochures
website these websites really don't need
an SSL certificate but if you'll have
that it won't hurt you it will just give
you a little bit more secure connections
and things like that but let's talk
about the cost that it cost you for
having an SSL certificate first and
foremost thing in order to have an SSL
certificate you need to have a dedicated
IP and yes last time I checked dedicated
IP are not so cheap to have so make sure
you first put out a budget that what's
going to be the cost of having an SSL
certificate so make sure you keep an eye
on the dedicated IP note here now also
let me tell you a really important fact
that not all the hosting services that
you have taken are capable of installing
an SSL
Fickett probably you might have taken
some hosting from GoDaddy or Hostgator
or Bluehost or wherever you are doing
this is not a paid video so wherever you
have taken your hosting first make sure
you ask your hosting provided that for
this of my plan because there are a lot
of other plans for this of my plan is
ssl certificate is possible to install
that one that's the number one good
question
now I have seen in the recent years that
the plan which comes up with unlimited
parking of the domains there are a lot
of plans like that where you can have an
hosting and park unlimited domains over
there are capable of hosting an SSL
certificate so first and foremost do
checkout with your hosting provider that
can I install an SSL certificate with my
existing hosting plan now I can
understand hosting a dedicated IP is its
kind of expensive thing and not
everybody can afford that so let me walk
you through with the process that you
can follow up now I'm not saying it's
100% secure nothing is hundred percent
secure but it's an alternative way with
maximum security that you can have so
let's clear this thing here that you
don't have a brochure website and a lot
of payments are happening on your
website so let me walk you through
because I can understand you are
thinking that I cannot have a dedicated
IP or cannot afford that kind of
expenses right now so here's the
solution now there are a lot of payment
service that can provide you an API to
integrate in your website now what you
can do is you can have your website on a
non secure channel which is just an HTTP
and whenever there is a payment that you
have to take just redirect the user
totally on that payment gateways service
now obviously that payment gateway
service is kind of a mandatory to have
an HTTPS and you can do all the payments
and transfers there and once everything
is done there they generates you a token
you can use that token by API and can
find out the whether that payment was
done successfully and not a lot of terms
of information comes up with that so
that's one way of handling the situation
and keeping your budget little bit under
comfortable zone but eventually if a lot
of transactions are going on on your
website that means your business is
getting in the profit it's a good idea
to have an
GDPs or basically an ssl certificate so
from there I can get these ssl
certificate now there are a lot of
websites which can provide us a
certificate and basically it's a
encryption mechanism from browser to web
server and trust between the user and
your website saying that hey whatever
the website you are looking up for is
trustworthy and like that so there are a
lot of hosting providers that can give
us SSL certificate probably I'll make a
video on that for a separate list
comparing them with each other but a
common name that you might have seen our
GeoTrust Komodo GoDaddy and pout a tight
eight how they how they how you say that
it's up to you so these are a couple of
common providers of SSL certificate from
where you can get an SSL certificate now
sometimes it does cost a lot some time
it's reasonable and affordable depends
how much you want to spend on it it's up
to you now the beast question how you
can install an SSL certificate on your
website now installation of this ISO
certificate is not the easiest one it
does require you to follow a lot of
steps now luckily for you I have crafted
a PDF that involves all the steps for an
SSL certificate it's really super easy
and it also low after when you have
purchased SSL certificate now I would
like to point here again and again and
again I cannot stress that enough that
make sure you ask your hosting provider
that in your current plan SSL
certificate is possible or not now once
you have got a green that hey go ahead
and install an SSL certificate follow up
these 14 pages PDF don't worry it's not
very long since I have included a lot of
screenshot that's why the PDF is so long
so I'll link a blog here I have just
written a blog about that so download
that PDF it's totally free and follow
all these fourteen steps to install an
SSL certificate on your website and I
think anybody with a decent technical
skills can perform that but in case you
are missing around that hey I'm not able
to install that and anything always feel
free to call up your hosting provider
they are really happy to help in that
particular situation so that's basically
your whole story download this PDF and
take a look at all these
but again dedicated IT is must or check
out with your hosting provider is SSL
possible on your hosting or not as I
told you installing an SSL certificate
is not the easiest one it's fairly easy
but not the easiest one so once you have
done all the installation of the thing I
would highly recommend to check out this
link which is SSL Shopper no I'm not
providing you to sell anything on this
or affiliate anything there's this link
will help you to evaluate that whether
the installation has gone right or not
this is an amazing link to check out
whether the SSL are working fine or not
this is amazing
link here again make sure that you give
it a little bit time as well because the
updation of the DNS and the SSL thing
usually take a little bit while
depending on what kind of hosting
provider you are using sometimes just a
couple of hours sometimes just couple of
minutes sometimes almost 24 hours so
it's a long window but what we can do we
have to wait whew that was a long video
but it was fully tagged jam-packed with
a lot of information about SSL HTTP
public key information and a lot like
that so in case you want to read all of
that information I'll link down a blog
which I've just written about the same
topic and also if you want to check out
our regular all these such blogs visit
