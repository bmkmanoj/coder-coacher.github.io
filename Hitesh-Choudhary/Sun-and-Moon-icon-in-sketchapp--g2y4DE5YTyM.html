the other video and in this video we're
gonna be again rockin with sketch we
will be designing two simple icons
without wasting any more time let's get
into it
so let me bring up my sketch file here
there we go my nice and awesome lovely
sketch file by the way all of the other
icons are still here so I just leave
them I will be giving you this file once
we complete all of that so here are the
two icons very very simple to design the
one is amazing lovely beautiful Sun and
another one is lovely beautiful moon and
I will show you some of the neat tricks
with the moon as well as well as some of
the stars as well it's not easy to
figure them out just by looking at this
level but if you look at notice how nice
shadows are and on the stars as well but
there are different shadows so command
one again to get back on here so first
of all let's just press let's just go
zoom this way so we want to design first
of all this Sun here that is actually
pretty easy to design so let me show you
how we're gonna do that
first of all we're gonna have an
artboard so let's just have an artboard
of size 500 by 500 there we go we need a
circle so press o and I'm gonna hit my
option key now my shift key has so that
I can have a nice perfect round circle
so what is the circle here 255 by 255
sounds good and just check mark the
border and what I'll be doing is I'll be
picking up this color so I will be
selecting this fill and color picker I
will be picking this one this is by the
way is e 7 B 2 1 5 there we go okay now
the next thing that what we will be
doing is we need a rectangle yes for
those rays we need a rectangle so we're
gonna have a really nice teeny-tiny
rectangle and okay so this is it
obviously they move the borders I don't
like them at all so this is like 14 and
the height is like 52 I'm gonna go for
60 for the height I think 60 is nice and
I'm gonna keep it or the center okay now
what we want to do is select this guy
and for the corner radius since I
sizes 14 Evette and 60 height so we're
gonna make it a corner radius of seven
now what the seven will does it will
make it a perfect roundish corner
because the width is fourteen so half of
that is the radius to make it a
perfectly round let me zoom that a
little bit so that you can see that so
this is what I'm talking about okay
let's get zoom out and hopes to command
one again okay
press the Z key and let's focus that
again now what we have to do is make
sure it is somewhere around like to any
pixel away from this circle and we're
gonna select this guy select the rotate
copies it's the most fun one and we need
actually like twelve copies of that I
already have one so I'm gonna get eleven
more and there we go and I'm gonna just
increase the radius here a little bit
like that if you want a little bit more
copies no problem you can get more
copies at all no problem at all so we're
gonna be selecting something like that
okay just eyeball it a little bit and
then select this guy this rectangle
shape here and we're gonna fill that up
with exactly the same color there we go
nice and beautiful and I can even select
both of the shapes here and I can just
Center them just like that okay there we
go use these buttons to align them
wherever you like and that's pretty much
it that's you got now obviously you can
increase or decrease the size of the
circle however you like whoops command Z
make sure you press down the option key
as well option and shift so that it
increases on its same size and there we
go nice and easy that was pretty dope
and pretty easy one as well okay so this
is one is done now let's move on to this
shape which is next icon is the moon I
can pretty easy to have it again have an
artboard and this one is also gonna be
like 500 by 500 there we go and what do
we need we need an oval so press down
your shift key so that you can have a
nice amazing circle and just like always
you know that border we're gonna remove
that okay now what you need to do is
press down your Alt key or your option
key and click and drag it's gonna create
a copy
and first of all just let go of your
mouse and then your option key okay now
what you want to do is select both of
these shapes and click on subtract there
we go and if you think that this is like
too thin on the crust here you can
always double click on these combined
shape and you can
oops you can release that a little bit I
can just select this guy and can use my
arrow keys to have it something like
that now no matter how much you're gonna
be shifting it it doesn't really matter
and it's not gonna look beautiful until
and unless you select that shape and hit
rotate now this rotation actually gives
a little that feeling of like moon ish I
don't know how it does that but until
unless you rotate that it doesn't really
give that much feeling so once you
rotate that something like little bit
like seven ish degree or 8h degree then
I think personally it looks better to me
okay and the next thing we need a few
stars luckily in this we do have stars
so go into shape and the star and we're
gonna have a star hold on a shift key so
that we can have nice beautiful star now
remove the border here and for these
stars actually you can play around with
the points and radius right now I have
five but if you wish like something like
that crazy you can always go ahead with
that and I'm gonna go with five because
I think that's more beautiful for the
radius I'm gonna shake it a little bit
so that it looks like like pointy stars
I like pointy stars not the fat one like
that so I'm gonna go something like 37%
looks pretty good to me okay and now the
fun part is select this guy and we will
be selecting the same color here so let
me show you that and we will be
selecting that and there we go
so this is like two seven eight zero e
one and same goes for this guy so select
this and again two seven eight zero e
one now here comes the interesting part
let me just zoom it here so select this
shape which is now a combined shape and
we are gonna be giving it in their
shadow snout inner shadows are beautiful
they don't consume anything outside the
shape they come sit inside and gives a
little bit imposed feeling there
like that and for the stars I don't like
much of the inner shadows in the star I
like the outer shadows on the star it
gives a feel that it is being like
popping up from the screen and this is
going inside the screen so it gives a
nice amazing feeling and hold down your
option key and we're gonna create a copy
this copy this star a little bit like
that on to the downside whoops command Z
and make sure you you release the mouse
first and then your option key and there
we go if you won't change it a little
bit like that you can have it and I'm
gonna move that a little bit something
like that I'm holding down my shift key
and playing around with the arrows you
can also just place it like that so I
think that looks beautiful
so hit command one and there we go
without any do without any much more
time-consuming this is all here now I'm
gonna hit it - oops not that command Z
and I want to combine all of them
command G to group them all and then I
can actually move them on to a center
ish way and there we go
also for this guy as well we will in
rectangle command G to group them so
that I can send to them like this guy
and this guy there we go okay so this
was all pretty much fun stuff about
designing to more icons and just like
this we will be designing two more in
the next video so that's it and I'm
gonna surely catch you up in the next
video and hey if you haven't yet
