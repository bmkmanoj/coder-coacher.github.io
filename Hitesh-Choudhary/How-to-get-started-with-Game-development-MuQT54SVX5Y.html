again with another video now in this
video I'll walk you through with the
basics of game development no it's not
going to be a practical tutorial but it
will really help you to get started in
the game development so all the
knowledge that you're looking forward to
get started in the game development is
going to be in this movie so let's get
started
now game development is a very vibrant
domain you're going to love every single
movement that you'll be spending in
designing a game and once the product is
done you will enjoy more playing that
now the best part of the game
development is that when you design
something or you design an algorithm
mostly it's unpredictable
so it's something involved with a lot of
randomization and that's why the player
who is designing the game actually
enjoys it even more because he's not
able to clear up what the level that he
is created but before we even move on to
the game development I would like to
clear up a lot of myth that's going on
here now I have seen hundreds and
hundreds of students asking me the same
question like I am a great
counter-strike player or I am a great
Call of Duty player I want to design my
game I spend many hours of my day in
playing that game and I want to learn
game design now there are some good
things and bad things with that the good
thing is that you are aware with the
game of playing strategies and game
designs and game arena quite a lot
that's a good thing but if you're going
to be spending a lot of time in just
playing the game eventually you will
never be able to get started in the game
design and game development so the very
first thing that you need to do is
uninstall that Call of Duty or
counter-strike that you have in your
computer now don't get me wrong I'm not
completely against with the game are
playing in fact I do play a lot of games
but in case when you want to design
something or develop something you have
to spend a lot of your time in learning
that instead of just playing the game so
technically speaking it would be a
complete lot of wastage of your valuable
time in playing that game and again game
playing is a completely different
industry and game designing is a
lately different industry in most of the
Asian countries the game-playing
is quite hype and quite growing nowadays
in case you haven't watched the
documentary please go ahead to watch the
documentary by vise a very good YouTube
channel and pretty big guys and they
have created a great documentary in what
is the life when they when there are
players kind of a very famous player in
playing the games like League of Legends
or Call of Duty so do watch that but
again coming back here on to the game
development so the first thing that you
want to do is keep away all the
distraction like playing the games and
everything now getting started into the
game development so what kind of
research do you need to do now first of
all you need to decide yourself what
kind of game you will be building like
there is a domain of 2d games and there
is a domain of 3d games now being a
little bit old guy I like to be into the
2d games little bit more like the retro
style games I was born in the era of
Mario and Contra so I like to be in that
kind of gaming style but again this is
no compulsion for you at all so decide
yourself whether you want to go in the
2d games or the 3d games for the 2d
games of course it's more over a mobile
oriented and it's pretty easy to get a
hype in that kind of game for example
the flappy bird which was having a which
was having a pretty easy design and it
got popular there and a lot of games
like that you can do now if you want to
get started with the 2d game the
construct 2 and the sprite kit are two
great way of getting started with that
now one thing that I like about the
sprite kit is you can use your existing
iOS development knowledge and can
enhance that in the sprite kit and can
design pretty easily a nice game now the
drawback is it's going to be only
published on the iOS platform but again
you get a lot of benefit with that let's
talk about it someday else now moving on
to the construct construct 2 is a little
bit different game engine and it's
mainly based on a Windows platform but
again don't get me wrong it's a very
powerful thing it designed all of it
games based on mostly on JavaScript so
you will be able to export your game for
iOS Android Windows or maybe other
platforms as well so it's a great point
of getting started but again these all
are 2d games now if you want to get
started with the 3d games there is a
whole plethora of engines getting out
there now maybe later on in some of them
we all talk about the top game engines
that are out in the market and you may
get onto that but naming a few engine
you might be aware with the unity3d
which is getting more popular nowadays
there is a far cry engine and and a lot
of engine like saga engines and pretty
much lot of their own nowadays and again
a lot of are being used in the design of
Call of Duty some are being used for the
assassin Creed's and everything has
their own advantage and disadvantages
again pricing point is they are somehow
okay so once you are ready for the 3d
game engine make sure that you
understand the basic knowledge for
example you want to get into the Unity
game development and you can design some
pretty fantastic games with that you
need to understand you have to switch
into the c-sharp language but again
that's going to be a good point to get
started okay so what is it like in the
3d game design now 3d game design is a
completely different animal it has a lot
of things like graphics the UI design
the movement controls the the monitor
mapping and the event mapping sounds
physics and a lot of things is there but
again I may talk about them later on in
some videos right now let me just say
you that designing a 3d game engine is
or not the engine the 3d game itself is
a different thing so you might want to
research a lot about your engine now in
the leg in the next movie I will talk
about what is game engine and how you
can rely on the game engine how to
choose the best engine for you for
yourself that's going to be coming up in
the next video but right now let me just
tell you that game engine arm is
mmediately based on a few things like
the events the polling the physics sound
and your entire environment that you are
creating so again do a lot of research
on that now my goal with this movie was
to just to get started and clear up some
myths about the game development and how
you can get started with that now for
sure in upcoming movies I'll talk a
little bit more about the 3d game
engines the game physics sprite kids
construct and a lot of such things so
stay tuned in case you haven't
subscribed yet do subscribe to my
channel and make sure that you hit the
like button if you liked the video in
case you haven't liked it no problem no
hard feelings I'll try even better next
time with that I'll say goodbye for this
for this particular movie I'll catch you
up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
