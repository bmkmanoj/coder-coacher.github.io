code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey there everyone
they share back again with another video
and in this video we are talking about
an incident which happened just last
night and if you are looking forward to
upload your app on Google Play Store or
Apple App Store which probably you might
be then you should definitely watch this
video and I want to cover up this
incident which is going to be helpful
for my future boot camps as well as well
as for you as well let's get started
give you the context of the situation
here now in my boot camp specially in
the offline boot camps we design a lot
of clone apps the clone of snapchat the
clone of Instagram the clone of tinder
now not because we want to just
replicate them and we want to create a
similar business to them obviously we
cannot of course without funding we
cannot but these apps are amazing these
are the state of the art technology
especially if you look at the tinder
cards they are like just marvelous piece
of UI design how they swipe the things
and onto the left and right so copying
or cloning that technology will give you
a lot of idea and understanding about
how the basics works look at the
snapchat their way of just hitting the
back button and poof your photos are
gone these are amazing to implement to
understand the life cycle of an app
component did mount component didn't
mount all these things are amazing for
teaching purposes and I do them quite a
lot in all of my all boot camps I try to
replicate these functionality and teach
students that how these things can be
performed now sometimes students take
them further far away and want to design
their app exactly like to be snapchat or
tinder now yesterday same thing happened
in just a couple of days ago we finished
up an offline boot camp and we did
design a snapchat clone in that now what
a student did he just took the design of
the snapchat exactly by word by word and
he wanted to design a snapchat only for
his college so the registration of the
email was limited to add the rate a
university name
and initially the thought was it is okay
to have your own personal snapchat but
he uploaded that app onto the Google
Play Store on that last day and the very
next day he woke up with an email that
your account is now terminated now in
case you don't know let me walk you
through in the process that when you
upload on to the Google Play Store and
you do some naughty stuff which you are
supposed to be not to be doing then you
get strike strike one strike two and
strike three and after that you get your
account terminated but this time it was
the very first time that I saw that
somebody uploaded a clone app and his
account to God directly terminated
without even getting strikes so this was
little bit new for me and also the same
exact app when he uploaded on the aiya
store got passed away completely without
any problem now yes you can call it as a
situation that everything in the Apple
goes through the manual review so they
can review and can do better decision
while on the other hand on the Google
everything is monitored automatically so
it might have picked up some of the
words like snapchat or clone snapchat or
something like that so they have
immediately blocked that app now the
thing that we all can understand and can
learn here that cloning of these apps
are not at all allowed yes you can
borrow some of the functionality just
for the test app and all these things
but obviously if you are looking forward
to just put in the keywords like this is
a clone or kind of a similar of tinder
or snapchat you're gonna use those
keywords your account may get directly
terminated without even getting the
strikes yes I do strongly believe that
cloning the functionality of these apps
like Instagram or snapchat helps us
quite a lot in understanding the things
but you also need to understand that
these things can get your account
terminated so if you are uploading any
such kind of app for just one purposes
make sure you keep your accounts safe
where all your production app are
running and these fun apps are on two
side now I have been doing this for a
long time all the accounts that I have I
have multiple accounts for uploading the
apps like my account for learned code
online is a completely separate app
separate account and has just got one
app I have other accounts for uploading
these fun apps and tutorials and all
these things so make sure you keep that
now I just wanted to discuss this thing
with
all of you so that you can get aware
that if you are planning to upload any
such clone apps your account may get
directly terminated without even getting
the strikes but to my surprise that
exact same app actually made it to the
Apple App Store and not to the Google
Play Store this is the first time I'm
hearing this otherwise the reverse of
the situation is mostly true so what is
the situation now we have actually done
an appeal that this is not a clone for
the business model threat for the
snapchat this is like a fun project that
we wanted to do but again this is a
situation that is little bit tricky
luckily the students was uploading his
first app and his account got terminated
so he is not losing much of his existing
apps and in the future he can be little
bit on to a safe side yes if you are
also planning to upload your app and it
is a perfect clone make sure you are
aware about the situation that the
automatic review of the Google may pick
up your as a clone or a threat to the
existing business model and can
terminate your account so make sure you
keep that in mind and take your decision
wisely for that just wanted to share
this information with all of you so that
you can make better decision while
uploading your app to Google Play Store
or Apple App Store so that's it for this
