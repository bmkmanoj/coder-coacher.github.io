not a tech video now on this channel we
regularly do a lot of things about
programming a lot of things regarding
Android iOS Linux fighten maybe
JavaScript a lot more things but this
video is not about programming so in
case you have been expecting that hey
this is a tech video go ahead skip this
one at least and you can watch out other
videos in this video this is just a
simple talk and a little bit about my
experience with riding the bike
specially I do ride a Harley Davidson so
I'm going to be sharing some experience
from my life and that's all they're
going to sit back here and we're going
to talk that's it a lot of people think
that I just code every single day and
all the time it's just my hobby no code
is I love actually programming I'm not
denying it I'm actually quite mad about
it and I encourage other people as well
to do programming and stuff but again
apart from that I also do have certain
other hobbies as well one of them is
travelling and other one is riding my
bike in case you don't know I do own a
Harley Davidson and I love to just ride
this bike but due to certain involvement
in a lot of things like lines and these
boot camps and especially the video
making process and everything
I almost didn't ride my bike it has been
I think almost a year and a half that I
have touched actually my bike
well that was maintaining that and
that's it that's pretty much it I didn't
got much time to write that but today
morning I decided that I'm going to be
doing something different and bring my
hobbies back especially the bike one so
I thought let's go ahead and check out
how the bike is doing and eventually it
was not doing really good covered all in
dirt all in dirt absolutely like that
and also I do own a really nice bicycle
it's with the big tires it's a kind of a
showstopper wherever you take it people
are going to just stop you and are going
to ask about it I see this quite a lot
so I love to write both of them but I
saw they are all covered in doubt so the
number one thing that we're going to do
today is to clean them up
sometimes I'll make the drive being
hotter than it needs to be nothing yet
true so why do I worry coward I can
see I'll be juicing my money for my
wrist took the money that I spent and my
with my friends was worth it come time
I'll make this guy's gang harder than it
needs
Oh
I don't belong out there I lay in my
back it's going on hey-up
also the cleanup I taught that hey I'm
going to take this bike for a quick spin
I did that and really I'm happy that
this machine is still working absolutely
fine and I'm happy about it now very
soon you're going to see couple of more
videos regularly often on this channel
where I'll be taking this bike for a
spin I don't have much time to spend on
the dedicated rights for a big long ride
but still I'll be taking that for a
regular right in in Jaipur as well so
that's what you're going to be seeing
very soon on this channel not yet not
yet a lot of things are still being
planned but yes it's going to come up
very soon now also some of you might be
asking hey you have a holiday which and
have you write something big with it yes
I have done actually and the recent big
ones it's not a recent it's it's a vey
old that I did was from Jaipur to Goa
and yes that was kind of a write for
which I actually bought this bike and I
was making myself ready to do that kind
of ride and finally I did that traveling
from Jaipur to Goa was amazing I met a
lot of people and I went for India Bike
Week which is kind of a Sturgis in India
a lot of people come to go on their bike
from Bangalore from Kashmiri from
Rajasthan from Mumbai a lot of nice
people you meet around you see around a
bit it's all a fun event and it was all
fun for me and yep I'm going to be
joining the Sunday rides back with the
troop that I am i regularly ride with
those guys so very soon I'm going to be
going with them for Sunday rides and you
may see a couple of good shots from
those Sunday rides it's not yet because
I do have spare a couple of travels plan
up and it's basically these travels
which actually engaged me quite a lot
I'm not able to ride my bike because in
the past couple years I haven't been in
India for quite long time I had a lot of
boot camps a lot of quick travel links
even if I missed
India on top of that I have to travel a
lot seven wide some talks some like that
so I am actually taking a break from
that from all of that busy life for a
couple of months and in this couple of
upcoming months I will be doing just one
travel which is essential I have to do
it I have already said yes for that and
in most of the days I will be taking my
bike out and will be enjoying some days
but this doesn't means we are not going
to be talking about check this means
I'll be engaging in making more videos
and delivering more knowledge to you so

subscribe button you will be enjoying a
lot of things I'll be sharing a lot of
experience from personal life from tech
life as well and that's it that's it for
this video I'll surely catch you up oh

mood it's worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
