code online dot in and welcome back to
this JavaScript series and it's time
that we move forward in JavaScript now
yes we have learned only a few concepts
in the advance and there are still so
much to talk about things like promises
and a lot about arrow functions new
concepts and the objects the triple dots
a lot of things needs to be discussed
here but obviously if you'll be just
moving on to that that pace with those
things it would be really hard for you
to understand and apply these concepts
and remember the whole idea behind
creating any CD's that I do is something
which user can replicate at their own
end and can create a really big project
with that it's not just like I just want
to show off some skills it's always the
idea is to break down things into
smaller chunks so that you can repeat it
so what we are gonna do now from this
point onward is we will be learning how
we can use this javascript onto a
web-based platform or simply say it as
website and so that we can use our
existing knowledge into it the more
concept that we'll be learning in the
JavaScript will be applying them and
we'll be seeing live in action what we
are actually capable of doing it also on
the side we can create some of the fun
projects that are pretty easy to do fun
to do and we can do that so let's go
ahead and move on how we are going to
set up the things in probably future
videos maybe some project videos but the
set up is always going to remain almost
the same so the first and foremost thing
is we are gonna create a new folder so
let's just call this simply as 0 1 and
we're gonna call this as web basics
there we go and inside this web basics
we actually need to file there can be 3
files as well but basically we just need
two files the first file is simply an
HTML file and the second file is gonna
be JavaScript file we're gonna learn how
we can attach these javascript file into
our HTML and can manipulate all the
structure of this HTML once we have the
knowledge of restructuring the HTML
using just the JavaScript we can perform
a lot of things and whatever we have
learned we can apply them there so let's
just go ahead and do that so in the web
basics we're gonna create a simple new
file and we're gonna call this as index
dot HTML feel free to call it whatever
you like I'm gonna call
simply index dot HTML okay we also need
one more file so I'm gonna call this as
my are simply my script you can call it
script or GS as well the common one is
script or GS but I'm gonna call this as
my script GS okay there we go so now
that we have two files in here now in
the index dot HTML obviously I will not
be talking about what is HTML how we can
write this how is CSS how is going get
gon going on I do have a course couple
of courses our first one is Emmet
available on learn code online dorian
which is totally free and you can learn
how we can have really the fast
structure using HTML notice and just
using an exclamation sign hit the tab
and it fills up everything for me this
is gonna be the fast-paced things which
I'll be using again there is a free
course on Emmet and completing all these
boilerplate structure and stuff like
that in case you are still not impressed
what you can do is we can have something
like a paragraph which is gonna have
lorem of probably 50 words I can do that
as well and it's gonna generate 50 words
for a lot of Epsom for me I'll be using
these kinds of shortcuts so that we
don't have to waste much time in writing
HTML so that's why I highly recommend to
check out the Emmet course also if you
are much more interested in the this
JavaScript stuff I do have a complete
front-end developer course in there as
well but enough of that let's talk about
how we're gonna arrange all these
structures now okay so this is my
boilerplate HTML and if I even run that
it doesn't say anything so I'm gonna
just have an heading and I'm gonna say
this is my new file save that and I want
to run this file to run this file either
you can open up your directory and can
click on this index dot HTML just double
click on that it's gonna open up in
browser that is totally totally
absolutely fine but we can do something
better you can just open up your
installation of extension and I have
installed an extension which says live
server and this live server is being
developed by ritwik day again I just got
to know that he also watches my videos
on my channel quite often so thank you
so much for this amazing extension
developing this so thank you so much I
highly recommend this I have used it
it's amazing it
works like a charm all you have to do is
go into your index dot HTML after you
have installed it you're gonna find at
the bottom go live if you're on the
windows this blue bar is actually at the
top and you see a go life there as well
just click on this and it's gonna start
it and gonna fire up your browser and
there you go that's it the best part
about this is that I can just have it
side by side something like this come on
I just want to close this there we go
and I can change the things on the go
like something this is my new file and
and some more come on I can write that
and some more if I just save this it
automatically reloads the thing for me
web development is much more fun when
you don't have to just keep hitting the
reload and reload and reload so that is
why I use this extension ok
pretty good extension thank you so much
for the big day I really enjoy this so
make sure you have this one now once you
have this guy as well here what we want
to do is we want to add our script of
this my script into this file so for
this all we have to do is add this
script tag and inside the script tag we
have to mention the source as well in
the source I'm gonna directly say that
hey load my my script rjs okay now
here's the tricky part
now if we are following exactly the same
structure that I am doing you should
face no problem at all but in case your
index file is somewhere else and your
script file is somewhere else that can
be a little bit dramatic and you have to
figure it out that how you can link this
file ok it's pretty easy but I highly
recommend to follow the exactly same
structure that I have been doing so far
and then what we can do is we can simply
write a simple alert statement there and
in this I can say file is attached and
as soon as I save this notice I get a
pop-up on my webpage that says hey file
is attached if you are getting exactly
the same message that means our setup is
perfect and is completely ok also I
would like to comment this because this
can be a little bit annoying that all
the time you reload the file it just
says file is attached file is attached
it's really not so good experience so
there we go so this is our basic setup
that we'll be doing probably almost all
the time whenever we will be doing any
project work or any such things for
learning and stuff so this is our basic
stuff I hope you're following belong on
this series so make sure go ahead do all
these setups as well from the next video
onwards we are gonna understand what is
the Dom structure how we can manipulate
them how Java Script can be integrated
and so far whatever we have learned
about Java Script how we can integrate
onto a webpage and can take advantage of
it okay so that's it pretty easy talk I
hope everybody will be able to do it and
I'm going to surely catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
