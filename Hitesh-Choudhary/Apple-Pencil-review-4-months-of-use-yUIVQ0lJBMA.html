I'm back again with another video now in
this video I would like to talk about
some review about the new gadget the
Apple pencil in this video you will find
out whether this is a good device
whether you should buy it should design
this buy it should students buy it or
who should actually buy it is it worth
it how durable it is and a lot of
answers like that so stay tuned and
let's get started with the review of
Apple pencil I use a lot of Apple
products iPhone Apple watch and Apple
pencil as well and I thought it would be
a good idea to share my thoughts about
what I feel about this and is this
gadget for everyone so I'm gonna answer
a lot of questions and I hope it will
help you to understand that whether you
should buy the Apple pencil or is it not
for you so first of all the question is
is this Apple pencil for everyone and I
would say no it's not for everyone just
like Apple watch is not for everyone
it's just an extension of your existing
iPhone but let's not go on to the Apple
watch yet today let's talk about this
Apple pencil so it's definitely not for
everyone because you won't be using it
and in case you you don't have the
newest iPad that means it's just a piece
of junk for you but how good is it and
what do I do with it
I use this for every single day almost
every single day and I have been using
this for almost three or four month now
and it's pretty solid and durable now a
lot of designer might be looking up that
hey should I buy this now let me get you
very clear that if you are a Cintiq
tablet guy who designs a lot of stuff on
the Cintiq tablet definitely you won't
be switching on to the Apple pencil as a
complete alternative for a Cintiq tablet
or the Wacom tablets the resistance that
you get in the Wacom tablets and a lot
of tips and pens and the tips that you
get with the vacuum tablets definitely
you don't get with the Apple pencil but
again this doesn't mean this is a piece
of junk it's really helpful out there if
you are thinking that hey I want to
utilize my time and flight time or maybe
some travel time and I want to design a
couple of things on my iPad on-the-go
with this pencil then definitely
it is the best stylist in the market I
would say and it is somehow if I'll
compare with the stylist of the windows
that they offer I would say that this is
much more better than that I felt that
now another question is when do I use it
now I use it every single day and if
you're a student I would highly
recommend that this is one of the key
thing that you should always buy my all
of my students are really happy that
their teacher has got the Apple pencil
now why because I write all of my notes
let's just say I want to teach somebody
about sorting algorithms bubblesort and
all these things I like to show them all
the demonstration on the piece of paper
now when I do that on a piece of paper
or with the PowerPoint presentation the
connectivity is missing so what I do I
teach them all of these stuffs on
directly on my tablet I use a notability
app and I just directly draw in front of
all the arrays and everything and I
teach them like that now students are
really happy because they don't have to
actually borrow the PPT s or anything
and don't have to I don't have to go
into the nasty animations and everything
and I simply link it to the Dropbox and
they get everything from the Dropbox so
every student gets my notes and it's
really good because if you're a teacher
you're writing on the the whiteboards or
blackboards it's really good that you
use technology in such a way that it's
helpful for the students now as a
teacher it's really kind of a benefit
for me that I don't have to spend time
in making PowerPoint presentations
adding some animations I can now write
on my tablet and it's really good so
it's really good device and I think my
college life would have been really
better if I would have something device
like this because it's really great and
I don't have to carry hundreds of
notebooks for writing different notes I
don't have to worry about where is the
notebook of the first time or second Sam
because everything would be technically
in my iPad I can save them on the
Dropbox with the and of course you have
to buy a couple of apps like notability
and everything but they are very cheap
the way I use them it's almost nothing
that I'm paying them the price is a
little bit issue it's a little bit
pricey thing compared to that but I
would say that if I'll use it for let us
say
here I would consider that it has paid
its price now how durable it is now I
haven't dropped it yet I have been using
it for 3 or 4 months I haven't dropped
it because I like to keep my things
organized and Apple product is something
that you don't want to just fell here
and there it doesn't really make sense
to me so I like to keep all of my
gadgets really nice and steady there so
I haven't dropped it so I cannot say
much about the durability but yes it's
nice and one thing that I again like
about this Apple pencil is the size now
you can see this is a very standard size
and the pencils in India in UK and in
America are almost exactly that this
size when they just are opened up from
the box so I'm really I would say I'm
really impressed by the size of this
this is really a great piece of hardware
that they have given and I like it when
people do research quite a lot on such a
device on the length and obviously the
same way I get really I really get
annoyed when people don't do research
and come up with the absurd idea and
what is that
yep that's the absurd idea the way I
charge the Apple pencil is something
that I'm not happy about for example I
use this with this iPad and one thing
that I do not like it is the way that
it's charged this is how it's charged
and you can see this is not comfortable
for me
but I would also say that again the best
part is how quickly charged and I would
say within 10 to 15 minutes it gets
fully charged from 0 to 200 and it stays
up with me for almost a week so not much
a problem but again I really get annoyed
when people don't spend time in doing
research they could have find
alternative ways to charge this pencil
this is this is not good this is
absolutely absurd that if somebody can
broke I can broke my pencil there and
it's expensive one so I don't like it
and obviously this is not something that
I would recommend to all of the people
that hey this is no good way of keeping
your things so and also I don't like
this cover that goes off when I need to
charge my pencil because I may lose it
and then it would be troublesome so I
don't like that wait but I do like the
sturdy build and the quality is really
nice one thing they could have done a
really great is could have
added a small grip here so that it
really feels really grippy when I write
my notes or something but again I can
work with that by adding a simple tape
here but with this price point I expect
effort happen to do everything for me so
all in all I would say this is really
great piece of hardware if you are a
student I would highly recommend to buy
the new iPad pro and this Apple pencil
and I try to take all of your notes
there and if you're a teacher you should
definitely jump into this your students
will really appreciate that you are
teaching all of the things like
mathematics you know whatever you write
and just write it on your iPad and share
the links with the students moving on
the technology is really great your
student will appreciate that they don't
have to copy and paste the notes from
their notebooks they have everything
available online so this is a really
great product for the students and all
of that now one more thing I would like
to take in the part from the designers
point of view is designers will somehow
feel that on the new iPad pro when you
try this this is absolutely on the point
of the connectivity that you get from
the writing and drawing and sketching is
really nice but you will feel that
somehow it's not equally the same
resistance that you're get value drawing
on the paper so get yourself a glass or
tempered glass on iPad pro and you will
feel that way the good so it's really
nice but it's not an alternative for
real-world pencil but still it has to go
quite a long way and I would I would say
this is just version 1 or beta one I
expect a lot of upgrades and change of
these kinds of stylus and I'm really a
big fan of stylus so I think this can go
pretty long way and this was all my
thoughts about the Apple pencil of
course it's not for everyone only a
selected category of people and their
jobs can have can have or can take
advantage of this Apple pencil so this
was all the review that I could give you
with the Apple pencil and again of
course once I use it for a year I will
come back again and talk about what are
the pros and cons of this
pencil again so with this I would like
to say thank you so much for watching
