I cannot say welcome to my youtube
channel because it's already a little
bit old but I really wanted to come up
and want to discuss a lot of things with
you in the last few years I was just
putting a videos on programming
information security SQL injections many
programming languages like Python so
often see but I thought I can do a
little bit better every day I receive
dozens of email asking for the courier
advice or maybe landing at a perfect job
or maybe some technical issues and all
of such things so I thought I can serve
my students better if I come up directly
onto in front of the camera and can talk
about a lot of stuff so in this channel
I'm going to upload a whole dozens of
movies about the career advice is what
you should do to start learning code as
a naive or how to get a best job out
there what it's like to be in the
information security field or a dozens
of things like that what it's to be like
onto a video education versus the books
out there what is to be in getting a
broad colleges and tons of things like
that so welcome on board and let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
