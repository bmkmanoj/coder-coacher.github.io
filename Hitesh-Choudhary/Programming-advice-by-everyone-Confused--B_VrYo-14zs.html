with another video in this video I want
to talk about advices so I know a lot of
you are big nurse in programming and are
looking up for advice with weather which
programming language should I be
learning up
should I be learning Python or Java
should I be learning Swift or C it's
really really common that everybody
seeks up for advice either from
professionals or from a little bit a
higher person who have some experience
in programming it's completely ok but
there is something that you might be
doing wrong coming up in this video
let's get started so you are looking up
for advice to get started in programming
that's completely right everybody wants
to have a programming language that they
can trust on most of the people are
looking up for the best advice that
possibly they can get it's completely ok
but let me share you one incident here
and after that we'll talk again about it
almost two months ago on my Facebook
page I did received a message a person
was in trouble and finally after making
a lot of troubles and lot of advices he
narrowed it down to the two languages
and he was looking up for my advice
whether I should go for Python or Java
just onto a side note both of these
languages are amazing and great and you
can get started with anything of course
if your job is or if your goal is to get
started with Android it's really better
to start it with Java and if your goal
is about machine learning or tensorflow
or something it's really good to start
with Python but again both of these
languages are great coming back onto the
story so this person messaged me about
almost two months ago and asked me that
hey bitch
which one should I get started and hi I
said the exact same thing that I'm
telling you right now and he said ok
I'll look about it and I'll ask more
persons about it now just today yes
exactly today I again received an
Facebook message from the same person
and he said I'm still in a quick bit
confusion I have asked to a lot of
people or to my H
- my college teachers my seniors elders
- you and other professionals and
everybody is saying different some
people are saying start with machine
learning it's the future
start with AI it's the future start with
I us start with Android start with
Python and tons of advice and he's still
confused and I just want to say one
thing to that person you have spent like
two months in just looking up for advice
do you think that you are a little bit
overdoing it
all I want you to think is in the span
of two month you could have started with
Python could have created one or two
project in that and by the time now you
could have started with Java yes exactly
like that you could have started right
there and you could have moved on to
other languages because the experience
that you're gonna get in programming
either that's a Python or C it is going
to be helpful in other programming
language as well but what you did you
simply looked up for advice and more
advice and more advice
I'm not saying here that you got wrong
advice from people all those people who
told you that machine learning is
awesome
Python is awesome Java is awesome iOS is
awesome all of them are true and they
all are great advices but here I want to
say something serious that don't spend
too much of the time in just looking up
for advice don't look for the too much
of advice even from me don't do that you
are overdoing it instead of just
focusing on what should I learn what
should I learn and what should I learn
start learning that would be much more
productive even if it's an advice coming
up too much from me don't take it from
me just decide one programming language
and get started in it yes on to some
point I would agree that getting started
with a perfect programming language
actually saves you a lot of time but
again seeking up advance for entire two
months I think it's too much and you
should not do this so my advice would be
here is start flip a coin that would be
my advice just flip a coin heads or
tails start with either Python or with
the Java and I think eventually with
like three months or six month or some
span of time you'll be able to complete
that language
a few projects in that and then you can
move on to another programming language
yes of course at learned code online dot
and we have an amazing library a lot of
programming language projects are there
a lot more are coming up
take take help from there in case you
want to learn from other person or want
to recommend some books and everything
feel free to explore even I have helped
a lot of people in finding out great
books and great courses other than me as
well the whole point of this channel is
to make sure you get started in
programming not by me or from high
courses only if you help that that
really is appreciated but again the
whole point is get started with this I
would say keep learning keep programming
hit that subscribe button hit that like
button and share this video if you think
that this video was helpful I'll surely
catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
