code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey there everyone hey
they sheer back again with another video
and in this video we are touching up the
great subject of what is the difference
between a library and framework yes you
might have already touched that subject
by looking up the definition of what
library as well as in the framework but
those definitions are not at all able to
give you the whole perspective and is
not able to make you understand what
actually the individual subject means
and also this is a common topic being
asked in variety of interviews as well
the programming interviews as well so
it's going to be really helpful that you
thoroughly understand what is the
difference between a library and
framework and trust me after watching
this video you won't be searching for
this topic any more further so let's get
started now let me tell you what the
issue is the issue is many time people
try to just say understand what is
library and then try to understand what
is framework and you'll get bored the
answers there but it is not perfectly a
correct thing you need to understand
both of the things side by side now if
you look out into the any definitions or
Wikipedia or something like that you
will find a quite a common definition
which is a collection of library is a
framework which can be true or cannot be
always true so you need to understand
both side by side now I'm gonna give you
two examples here the second example
will make much more sense but in order
to understand that second example let's
move on to first example first
so library and framework both of them
are dependent on the rule one is your
home and another one is just like your
school or your university so I'm I'm
making an analogy here that your school
is your framework and your home is just
like your library ok so here is my point
when you have less number of rules it is
more likely that it is going to be
possibly a library and when there are
more number of rules then it there are
high chances that it's going to be a
framework for example in your home you
can just throw off your t-shirts
wherever you like
and you can just place your bag wherever
you like but when you go to school or
university there are fixed places where
you put your bag there are fixed places
most of the time that where you are
going to be sitting up your marker for
your teacher has a fixed place that it's
going to be there there are some options
that you can change them like here or
there little bit but it's always gonna
be closer to the teacher so that's more
like you are bounded by more rules while
on the other hand at home there are less
number of rules yes you may like to
follow some rules but most of them are
built by you so library is more over
like your home it's like whatever I want
to do I'm gonna be doing it and
similarly on the framework is more
bounded by the rules that you are only
allowed to do certain kind of things yes
you can go ahead and change all of them
but it takes time and Polly such thing
now let's move on to the second example
this second example is more over code
oriented and the people who are
associated with little bit kind of the
code even like simple JavaScript or
jQuery will be able to understand it
much more better now in a simple library
library is simply a collection of codes
obviously so some functions or some like
document object model or all these such
things are being packed together and is
being used over and over that's
basically your library is now try to
understand in this manner now whenever
you are making a call to any library
that is most likely to be a library so
whenever you have the power to call the
code whenever you like
that is simply a library on the other
hand in the framework actually your
framework calls your code and further
your code can call to a library
maybe but notice the difference here in
the library you are making a call to
library but in the framework framework
is actually calling to your code so just
understand in this manner I will take in
another very beautiful example which is
a difference between jQuery and simply
Django less or there are many other
frameworks as well so in both of these
things whenever you want to make a call
to a jQuery library you can make it on
the other hand in the Django there are
mores restrictive environments for
example your templates folder should
always be named as templates can we
change it yes of course but it required
digging up into the settings files
digging up into the framework so it's
most likely that you're going to be
calling up your templates folder always
as templates because that's what
framework is telling you to do so in if
somebody next time ask you it's all
about the rules when we have more
freedom that means it's more chances
that it's going to be a library when
there are more restrictive rules than
there are going to be great chances that
it's going to be a framework and again
who is calling to whom is a great way of
getting the sense that what it is is it
a library or is it a framework if you
want to get an example always in your
head
just remember jQuery and Django or maybe
Ruby on Rails or maybe any other such
kind of framework jQuery is a library
and on the other hand your Django is a
framework so there you go finally always
remember who is calling whom and you'll
always get the answer that is it a
library or framework and from now
onwards you can read those definitions
keep that mind but now you know
absolutely that I can understand the
subject no matter if I remember the
definition or not but I do understand
the subject and that is going to be most
important part so that's it for this
