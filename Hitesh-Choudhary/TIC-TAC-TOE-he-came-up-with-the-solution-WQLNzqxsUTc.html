again with another video and in this
video I want to share an exciting
incident video and this incident is
related to Android as well as the
attitude towards learning programming
stay tuned and let's get started if you
have been following me on my youtube
channel you obviously know that I have a
theory in life there are always two
kinds of people in this world the zeros
and the ones zeros are always about
complaining about the things hey this is
going bad in country this is going bad
in programming and all such things and
there are just ones who take the stands
and just say hey it's not about
complaining it's about coming up with
the solution so somehow we're gonna deal
with situation and we're gonna fight
with that and there's no other kind of
people just zeros and ones that's it
exactly same kind of people I have found
again on the very first Jan of 2018 so
first let me give you the context of
this story I do have an Android course
in which I teach people how to make ten
Android apps now nine of out of these
ten apps are completely done one of that
app is not completely done and that was
a deliberate decision that I took
now that app is tic-tac-toe app now in
that app I have taught how you can have
buttons and how you can change the
picture on that buttons by crosses and
zero when somebody clicks on it and how
you can design things like when somebody
against clock click on that that picture
doesn't change in all these logics but
deliberately I have left out one thing
in that that is winning logic now in
that app section I have told the
students that hey I'm deliberately
leaving out the winning logic here but
I'm gonna tell you how you can do that
you can always stores all the winning
combination in an array and can check
after every button press that hey
whether the whether the user has got a
winning logic or not or winning
situation or not now again I do
understand that was not easy to perform
but somehow I believe that too much of
the spoon-feeding is not good if if
somehow I'm teaching you the
9 apps you should be able to dig around
on stackoverflow apply your own logics
and could have come up with that one
logic so deliberately I left out there
now I do believe that yes people will be
blaming me a lot will be saying a lot of
bad words because I left out that really
interesting part there I did that
deliberately here and the consequences
came out like right and wrong just today
itself again so in the morning like
around 8 o'clock one student came on my
Facebook page and say hey page
I liked your course enjoyed a lot but I
wish really if you could have said that
hey this is the winning logic and you
could have made a video about winning
logic as well it could have been lot
more better I can only give like out of
ten I can give you only eight stars
because two stars are missing because
you didn't gave us the logic of winning
I hope you can make another video and
can just share with us and on the exact
same day around 10 o'clock today in the
morning one student Shoaib came to me
and said hey hey I am really enjoying
your videos your videos always help us
to push ourselves beyond the limits and
make us ready for the world an actual
programming situation he came up with a
solution of that tic-tac-toe game now
he's not the first student who came up
with the solution of that tic-tac-toe
game previously also a lot of student
approached me and have sent me this
github link that hey we came up with a
solution we feel so happy that we did it
on our own it takes us it took us weeks
or sometimes months to came up with a
solution but finally we did it I am a
strong believer that at initial stage
when somebody is getting started he
needs all the resources in the world
best courses best mentors maybe books
online courses offline courses whatever
he can get his hand but again I think
about it once you have got that big nerd
phase over there will be situation when
a problem will be thrown at you if you
ask me hey they should name the
programming to something else if you can
without even a blink of eye I would say
problems you cannot run away with these
problems whether you are a company big
nerd or an experienced problems are
gonna be there in programming so either
you can just sit around and complain
about them or you can just look around
to find a solution and don't just give
up until you found a solution this guy
Shoaib is a living inspiration to many
such people who just say hey there is a
problem sure it is a kind of guy who
just open heartedly says hey there's a
problem bring it on to me I'm gonna deal
with it do you really think that within
like days he could have come up with
this solution no not at all
he probably might have spent weeks or
maybe months in coming up with this
solution it takes a lot of efforts to
find such solutions but do you know what
he has got with us he got a feeling that
yes I can do this
I can do this kind of solution no matter
what kind of problem is I can take it
down I'm not even naming the person who
came up with the complaint that hey you
could have found the solution and all
these things in fact I'm not even mad at
him some of you might be thinking hey
I'm too much mad on this first student
and not on the second student no I'm not
at all mad even the slightest one on
this first student the problem is he's
not on the right track and somehow I
believe that it's my duty to bring him
on the right track instead of getting
mad at him if I'll get mad at him it's
it's no point it's of no use instead I
have discussed with him that hey it's
not about I cannot provide your solution
it would take me just like 15 minutes or
20 minutes to record a video and provide
you a solution but I don't want to do
that I want you to just work little bit
more harder on this and come up with the
solution I would be really happy to
check your solution I'll also link down
below the ship's solution on the github
link so that you can read the solution
and can find out with other things now
yes this is one of the many ways by
which you can solve this problem but
there are hundreds of others so come up
with your own solution life will always
give you lemon and you know what to do
with it either you can complain about it
or you can come up with something better
I can understand you have hopes you want
to build an amazing website you want to
build an awesome Android app or iOS app
you have a lot of pressure from the
situation but hey we all are dealing
with these situations it's not just you
it's the entire world so whenever the
next time the problems comes to you just
open your heart and
says bring it on do you really know the
thing that is stopping you the bridge is
just that problem beyond that problem
the world is amazing so don't just wait
get on to your computer
face your problem and don't give up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
