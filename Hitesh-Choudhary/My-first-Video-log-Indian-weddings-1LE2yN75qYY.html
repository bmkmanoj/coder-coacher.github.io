party but it was not a birthday party it
was more over like arrangement of a
wedding and this is my first video I am
starting a video Lord as well as what
was the day was like so it's going to be
really fun and exciting it's going to be
into another playlist of a video logs
every day and you're going to live and
you're going to see how it's like to
live my life so it's going to be really
awesome but first I really need to
change up so in the meantime you can
enjoy the some shots from the very
okay so this is my very first video log
and a lot of you might be thinking hey
why is starting a video long now let me
tell you there are two main reasons why
I wanted to start a video log first
reason is I talked to my buddy again
about the YouTube things and everything
and he told me that if you are so much
excited about the YouTube stuff why
don't you start a video log and I told
him whether I'll be able to do it or not
but he said hey everybody needs to start
someday and the community on the YouTube
is kind enough maybe they like your
content maybe not but again it's worth
giving a try
so the reason why I'm starting a video
log is to improve my video quality and
stuff so that I can learn more about
composure the purchase is going on
related technical stuff every single day
I have to edit this V log so it
definitely requires a lot of discipline
so for sure it's going to help me quite
a lot and the second reason is you're
going to love this my life is really
full of excitement in just one room and
I'm going to be sharing all of the
things that I do like about the client
meetings how I manage my work how
disciplined I am or maybe how I hit the
gym or how I do everything so but
believe me it's not going to be boring
like that you're going to surely enjoy
that it's going to be always some things
that I talk about to talk about some
thoughts that going on in my mind I
wanted to make a video on that but
usually that goes off but with the V
logs I can actually share a lot of
things with you for sure I'll be doing
all of the regular programming and stuff
and posting videos and all of the things
on a separate a playlist out there but
I'll be doing here now again obviously
one more question that you might be
thinking or you might be suggesting me
you say why don't you start another
channels for video logs and everything
now trust me I have given it a shot that
I have started another channel for
another thing I couldn't cope it up
because it's so much stuff managing all
these channels takes a lot of time and I
don't have that much of the time to
manage
elsewhere but shortly you're going to
enjoy it you're going to love it and
this is the end of my first video log I
know it's a bit short but the video
loads are going to be short precise
concise and for sure with some awesome
video qualities I'll try my best to have
some awesome qualities in the video logs
so the adventure will begin from
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
