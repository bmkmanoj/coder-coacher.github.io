in this video we're going to talk about
Adobe XD this video is just a startup
and in this video we're going to talk
about what is a tobe xD and what's the
difference between Adobe XD and
Photoshop and how you can install that
and some important stuff about Adobe XD
so Adobe XD is a relatively new product
in the line-up of Adobe Suites and you
might have heard about the pretty much
same kind of tools like maybe figma or
maybe sketch and moreover sketch is much
more popular so Adobe also introduced
their Adobe XD and the good news is that
it's a cross-platform and you can have
it on Windows as well as on Mac and it's
really amazing so what that OB XD does
and how is it different from Photoshop
that's important question and is being
mostly asked now I would say that
Photoshop is like a bigger version and
you can do almost anything in that also
some time it's being compared by
illustrator as well
now the serving purpose of both the
three these three apps is completely
different from each other in the
Photoshop you mostly mess around with
the photos and their pixels and how
enhancement of that surely it can serve
the purpose of Adobe XD but there are so
many options in there that probably a
prototype designer or a user experience
designer don't need that and especially
in the era when we are talking about
mobile apps and web app designs and
making simplifying experience of that
now of course you can also compare it
with illustrator as well but illustrator
has like gigantic options which again
are not at all needed for a design
experience guy or somebody who is
designing for a type or maybe a low
fidelity or high fidelity frameworks and
stuff like that so Adobe XD fits right
into it where even a programmer or the
person who is having less experience
with the design can also switch into it
and can design his own screens login set
up some buttons some vector icons and
all these things so I think it's a
perfect point for every programmer and
you should have that but again designers
can really nail it down and can do late
like marvelous piece of things with that
so coming on to that you can get it from
Adobe website adobe.com and if you just
look out to this product they have a lot
of products honestly and Adobe XD is one
of them and you can also get it like
really cheap they have like 676 rupees
per month it almost breaks down to like
ten dollars per month for just one
product and if you already have Adobe
suite like all of them you probably
might already have it so this is what it
has a really a good thing that you can
have it and one thing that you love
about Adobe XD is this bottom like like
see what you can do now what they're
saying is this is like amazing like if
you are avid user of Sketch just like me
I have been using sketch for husbands
three years you can also import all of
your assets from sketch into Adobe XD as
well as it's always cross-platform with
inside apps in the crowd cloud of Adobe
like you can import your assets from
Illustrator or Photoshop obviously in
the XD that's the whole sense of having
this but the integration of the sketch
import I love this now I don't have to
like really be working on two different
apps I can import all of my sketch
assets into XD and they just work like
that so this is all a little bit
introduction about it now let me show
you how you can have it it's actually
pretty easy now if you just go on to the
top of your cloud Creative Cloud
subscription whether you have just one
app or all of them you can just click on
the all apps and it will just say
install just like my Photoshop is saying
right now it's a little bit new set of
machine but you can just click on this
install and that's it that's pretty much
it you have got your app here and it
will appear in the installed apps and
you can either fire that up using it
fear of the Mac you can hit command
space and can write the name in the
spotlight if you're in the windows you
can go into a Start menu and open that
up now my advice is always to open that
I've been using Creative Cloud which is
far more easier so let's just fire this
up and click on open now the very first
thing that you see on your screen is
gonna be this a screen if it is let's
design an app and yes basically that is
it can also be really amazingly used for
designing your web mock-ups and web
designs as well I'll talk about that in
probably in the later videos but mainly
the focus is on the app design and this
is what we'll be focusing as well now
whole lot of things about this
particular interface and what you see
after that as well we will be exploring
it like quite in a lot of detail but I
think this is a good introduction
we have set up the ground that yes it's
different from photoshop illustrator
it's completely new thing as well as
easy as well so I hope you are
interested now and in the future videos
we're gonna explore every bit of Adobe
XD so that's it for this quick short
video and I'll surely catch you up in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
