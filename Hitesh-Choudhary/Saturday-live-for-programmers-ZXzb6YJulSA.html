again with another Saturday life just
you know let you know that we do live
every single Saturday and that's 10 p.m.
Indian Standard Time the life that we
usually do is not specific to any
particular agenda sometime it does but
mostly just a random life to just say
hello to you guys yes there is a new
Mike I know there was some issues last
time and this is very better Mike so yes
we do these kinds of live every single
Saturday and you can just ask your
questions or we can just hang around or
you can just say just hello like garish
Waseem Aatish Shubham unmold a Ravi web
developer god of nagger
hey gardener girl how are you I see you
all of my comments there I'm 14 good
good for you you're pretty young and you
should be proud of that
hi I am 15 first of all let's for happy
loli happy loli every single guy I hope
you're enjoying it is quite a lot it's
an amazing festival we're having a DJs
and all these party going on outside
so love from Goa thank you so much so a
very first thing
can you please notify me that how the
audio is this time I know I screwed up
last time in the live audio that was
really really bad so higher on the
people of YouTube
so can you please let me know how the
audio is this time as compared to the
last time I hope it's a very better
because I'm always about sounds and
audio should be amazing you guys deserve
this so yes I love from Pune he look
good thank you so much I'm getting a
little bit fat not much I'm gonna get
started with swimming again audio is
okay so why is it just okay it should be
amazing okay audio is good it's amazing
great audio yes that's what I want to
look for this is a high quality mic this
is expensive I need to set it up it's
just randomly here but it should look it
should sound amazing so there we go
so it's more over like a podcast audio
okay so let's pick up questions PHP or
no to start with okay
this is a good question let's answer
this now PHP and note this is a common
question everybody asked this and you
should you might be having this doubt so
let me answer this if you want to get
started with like basics and want to do
more over freelancing especially on
freelancer website then PHP is a good
choice and again you can pretty much
anything in PHP as well as in node so
PHP is generally a starting point but if
you want to do like more heavy end
projects that can really pay you really
good then know it should be really good
back to gray on the sweater here it's
not much cold here so always inside the
sweater this is the only t-shirt that's
what we are having oh okay
so your your nation free what's love
from Tamilnadu love from me as well come
in Nadu you're amazing
actually most of my audience is actually
coming up from the southern part of the
country and I love it I get always
emails from Bangalore Chennai and
southern part yes the northern part is
doing pretty amazing as well but you
know more emails are coming up from
there so otherwise I have to shower what
do you think about xamarin as a career
option it's a pretty good option if you
are already enrolled in the technologies
like dotnet or c-sharp you're already
into the dotnet core then sampling is an
amazing option but if you are totally
new then it's obviously a little bit
like different English so yes something
wrong with audio I think there is eco no
it's not eco it's it's actually heavy
based mic that's what I don't use it
much on the lie but my blue Yeti which
is just here you know this is actually
this makes a hum and this is a problem
in every single Yeti so yes this works
like that and you know this is kind of
echo this is not an echo this is a boss
heavy mic there's no echo here so this
is like more of a podcast stylish thing
so it's a little bit different to
understand I know I can get that but
it's not an eco first of all it's more
over like I can just do it a little bit
like that okay and I think now it should
be good
okay I know it's not a Nico it's more
over like boss heavy it's it's like that
okay okay - bro listen to me a hive Azim
how can I help you how can I listen
where are you right now right now I am
at my home okay so there we go
so how can we start machine learning
machine learning is all about data
science so good option would we start
with getting good at math so mean mode
linear equations Fourier transforms
biased Oram probability these are the
very first step what is the price of
this mic this is expensive so I want to
be professional Android of the / hey
thank you so much for the support if you
want to become a professional Android
developer there are a couple of options
for you the first one is and what
everybody follows this is Java learn
Java and then move into the Android
don't start too much with the Java you
can move on with there another question
otherway could be Kotlin which is again
rising quite a lot and you should
definitely take apart and the third
option is react native yes there is an
option like salmon as well but I don't
think so you will be interested in that
that much so react native is another
option easiest one react native most
like like everybody what follows is the
learn Java and in Android you can find
all of that at a learned code online
rotten hit that website it will be super
helpful okay how to start with iOS
development Shubham ask this question in
order to get started I use develop end
the first hurdle is getting machine
Apple machine there is no exception for
that reduce the echo of my you can lower
down your volume this is like okay this
is how the mic is and if switching to
another mic that will be too much of a P
sound I don't like that this is how it's
gonna be for this please resolve the
audio issue I want your wallpaper which
one this one I'll try to give it to you
please come to Hyderabad a very soon
I'll come there can I work with you to
learn more I am complete web dev and
Android dev hastily saying surely you
can work with
very soon sound is bad okay I'm getting
a lot of complaints about sound we can
try to move on to a different sound
I'll let me just try that okay they
don't guys be invited we want a
different sound okay let me try that and
just wait for a second okay so is this
better a little bit let me try and
listen to this sound okay so how is this
sound your audio isn't clear okay let me
know how this sound is but there is a
constant like P sound I don't like that
okay robotic sound better okay yes this
is better the old one is better so we
have to just coin to us yes this is
better okay so this is better you like
this guy but this is like constant t
sounded I don't know what to do with
this constant irritation better than
that one okay a little better we need to
figure it out okay so no P sound okay so
is this good for you okay this is better
than before okay
so we can just go with this guy okay
road you are expensive but you are not a
fuse for me today so on the public
demand our Yeti is back let me bring
this guy really really Big Mike I have a
couple of more mics I probably can try
that too Mike okay this is better
P sound is there yes it's a constant hum
I can't get rid of that okay you guys
can stop string screwing around with
maybe the changing of these mics you can
stop doing that okay better than
previous one okay so okay let's just
continue over talk because today is the
festival time tomorrow is also a big
festival in Jaipur so I won't be just
kind of a give you much of the time here
today I have to get back to the party
which is going on outside
so yes love from Nepal love from India
to how to prepare for code Jam okay I
probably need to make a video on this
there's so much requests of that
okay so love from Nagpur sound issues
yeah I'm trying to figure it out you
know when you go to live there are a lot
of sound issues you cannot really just
go and fix everything up I am trying my
best to get some mixer and good mic and
quality so that I can improve this stuff
but yes a venue good life you don't have
ability to edit the audios when I grew
cord my videos I always edit them and
just upload them after that otherwise
there's a constant issue just like that
and you know stuff like that
so definitely I'll try to buy some mixer
and stuff like that so that we can
improve our audio probably later but you
know okay let's pick up more questions
how to start with back-end there are a
variety of ways to get started with back
and PHP nodejs
firebase MongoDB MySQL there is a lot of
things to cover up in the backend yes
very soon we are planning to do
something for back-end as well but a
little bit stuck and busy with some
paperwork related to learn code online I
will reveal that very soon so okay okay
let's pick up more questions PWA or
react native for future you know what
you can design all of your PWA the
progressive web apps using react native
so both can go hand-in-hand
amazing PW is a lot of companies are
trying to build it up as an offline
first app so BSU can do that but you can
just go with both of them and recently
we did work on one of the project which
was offline first project I'll try to
show that project and we'll try to show
that how the PW is actually worked it's
not a big deal you can do that with
react so we will be working on with that
okay so what about hiring interns I have
completed web and Android dev at CEO hey
anis sahjhan we are very student gonna
be hiring a few guys once we complete
this paperwork which is going on right
now our first guy which we hired for
just one month is still hired still yet
hire and we are paying him every single
month yes a lot of people just condemned
that you are not doing good by hiring
somebody onto such a low wage and
everything
but remember we actually increased his
pay a little bit and now still till now
he is hired so that was a just one man
job he did so great that still he's
hired at learned code online so yes
sometimes people miss the opportunities
so yes very soon there will be offers
for interns there will be offer for
pretty much everything right now this
live issue is not working really great
in India I do give like online trainings
and stuff to us and a couple of other
countries so definitely are very soon we
are gonna fix this stuff okay our boot
camps worth it yes absolutely boot camps
are costly but you get access to teacher
and all these stuff so yes if there's in
person boot camps obviously it's gonna
be really heavy
what is vas in sound it's the heaviness
that you think probably discuss a little
bit later that how these things are get
introduced here okay so love from
Pakistan thank you so much I do have a
lot of subscriber from Pakistan thank
you so much for subscribing me love you
guys okay I want to get into content
writing please suggest how do I do I
don't have much experience in content
writing to be honest buddy let's just be
honest here first of all I don't have
much experience in content writing I
even just forward my contents to some
freelancer and to some known person so
I'm not a good resource for you to
explain you much more about content
writing it's it's a little bit tough to
me why don't you reply my mails please
reply to shower Oh JA did I missed your
email already I think there are like 160
email just from today that I have to
read an answer a lot of them are like
business emails so you know it's a lot
of emails coming up very soon I'll be
filtering out emails and the fastest way
to reach me is still the Facebook so you
might want to catch me there okay Oh
which is okay is it going course on
electron jeaious no as of now it's not
in the list it's not in the to-do list I
cannot reveal my to-do list right now
what I am doing and stuff but yes it's
not in to-do list electrons yes love you
dear was seen thank you
so much hi - really I like the
appreciate for guiding youngsters in a
positive way
yes at least somebody should tell them
what to do what not to do at least for
programming stuff because enough of the
tech channels on the youtubes let's
let's talk something here let's talk
about the meat part what should be dealt
and what should be called as tech okay
so I want to work with you even with no
salary nobody come leash if there is
like salaries and jobs and offers we
would like to pay you if it is like that
kind of thing so no need to work for us
for free we like to pay just like we
don't like to give our course as totally
free we just charge a nominal fee and
that helps us to build more stuff more
amazing stuff so we like to pay as well
I'm a mechanical guy I love coding
should I start it of course neeraj why
not everybody can become programmer you
know once I have trained this
construction guy literally he was a
construction guy in the boot camp he
just knew a little bit good decent
English and he knew how to he was a
regular blog writer on a WordPress that
said that's it and he is right now
currently working in a new york-based
startup and that was like the amazing
thing I've ever done turning up
construction worker into a developer
amazing so yes anybody can learn that Oh
what next after front-end you can go for
PHP you can go for react you can go for
node what is material design I should
probably make a video of that isn't it
do you know what there we go got a new
delivery of these guys so yes very
helpful and I'll be writing it down okay
our publishing paper in I Tripoli worth
it yep yep yep absolutely worth it
absolutely worth that but make sure you
don't get scammed there are a lot of
scam going on based on the I Triple E
paper and publishing so please do take
care of that I don't want your hard
earned money to just go like that
so yes definitely it's totally worth it
but be careful when you're coming to
Hyderabad you know I really wish to come
Hyderabad again I love the food there
amazing food
the guy's cook the food well then I
really want to come there again hello
sir come to withdraw withdraw uh okay
I'll try to come there I usually come to
get out quite a lot I'll try that okay
PHP versus Python for back-end easy a
Python Django it's it's super easy a
little bit like more of our flow and
control thing is PHP okay which
programming language to learn for
ethical hacking your what let me let me
tell this ethical hacking is really a
debatable subject the moment you pick up
this subject there will be a lot of
people coming after me bashing this
video that hey you talked about ethical
hacking let us bash you whether I talk
meaningful or not people will be coming
up here but regardless of that I believe
that a strong programmer is
automatically a hacker with a few skills
to be learned if I know how the MySQL
word how the PHP works and how these
data transform and all these are
happening and I learned something about
SQL or excesses and CSRF then obviously
I can protect them I can write better
code for them so obviously a better
programmer is a better hacker and that's
what I personally believe that you can
start with any language and can protect
the data as well as can write a lot of
good code for hacking as well like if
you'll check my github account available
like in a wavy hold time I wrote a
script for our Wi-Fi cracking and
aircrack-ng it's a GUI for that so
that's also a hacking and some data
analyzing that tools that I made still
on the github are also like part of
hacking it's not exactly like hacking
breaking into a bank but still helpful
so yes that's it let's just close this
subject here okay okay so let's pick up
I want to talk to you personally when I
come hey rap God what you wanted me to
do do a rap with you probably will meet
probably you can join me somewhere in
conferences or maybe some like that love
from crush me hey man would thank you so
much okay
a hi Sudeep how are you okay
Mongo versus SQL for web dev
Mongo is like the recent which everybody
is using right now and I highly
recommend that Mongo but yes my skill is
also again a great chess it's really
hard what do you really want to do okay
so come the haka sometime yeah probably
I haven't got invited from Dhaka anytime
soon how do you pick up comments it just
keep on scrolling so fast and I just
take my eye on one come and try to read
that otherwise it just keep on going hey
guys give it a thumbs up if you like
this kind of video Tanzania thank you so
much Tanzania is a beautiful place I
would like to get my grab my camera and

react 2018 it's amazing
still thumbs up for the react okay let
me sir hey Bunch I love you too buddy
okay Jango versus flask Jango you know
flash flux is awesome it's little bit
easier than compared to Jango but
jenga's really rock solid yeah I'm
saying this but yeah it is it is okay
will you be available in Bangalore yes I
was available in Bangalore few days ago
I posted on my Facebook page that I am
available I met a couple of people there

so if I'll be available next time at any
place I'll be posting down at my
Facebook page link is in the description
or search for hit HR 3 page I know my
name is tough to spell but that's it ok
how to build patience while learning
important question he need to have
patience for doing anything almost
anything want to go gym basketball or
anything patience is the worst you my
dear friend lots of love from India sir
thank you so much I'm getting so much
love here I love that amazing where can
you find such amazing people who love
you and you're just talking to them
it's it's really amazing good make video
in Java career oh yeah I can do that
okay Python versus R I would be picking
a pipe and as compared to R especially
if it's a data science and stuff like
that I would be picking Python because I
can use Python scale and other such
things like Django designing scripts or
maybe a lot of other stuff so I would be
picking up okay I am iOS developers
Souls I learn unity 3d thumbs up to you
unity is awesome and good for beginners
I'm not good in unity as of now but I'm
learning it okay somebody share
experience on node.js with Mongo Cloud
Atlas okay I can probably talk about
Atlas many soon I hope you are talking
about the stripe atlas okay firebase you
have become ten it is not like I have
become ten it's like I'm really getting
good in my food I am doing all of the
good diets good exercise and running
since I can do swimming that's why I'm
doing running and stuff so yeah I'm
actually getting better in the help okay
you started early you told me like ten
thirty
no did I told you ten thirty I don't
remember that I told you to ten it's
always 10 and 10 to 10:30 ish some time
it gets 11 so like that how to build
portfolio to work in tech giants yes of
course you need a portfolio whether it's
a get a portfolio a website make a lot
of apps make a lot of websites if that's
a machine learning a go to website
download datasets and try to do a lot of
stuff with that so yes no real life of
experience of programming still never
misses one of your video it's not a big
deal if you don't have real life
experience then build up your own
experience like create an app create an
uber clone or maybe a kinder clone or
maybe whatsapp or something like that
there we go okay a humming sound yeah
I'm really sorry about that I tried the
other mic but people found out that it
was more eco II it was not equally it
was more over like the bass heavy sound
and that's what these mic are being
designed for I'll try and figure out
some other ways by using
Xers and stuff we will work on it don't
worry guys we'll order some new stuff
new mics although these mics really cost
a lot like $200 or H that one is a road
one is even more expensive but no
worries we're gonna order something new
and we'll try to big get that say
something about ok
where is it going it's just a good ish
sound yeah it's just good ish not so
happy without editing can you earn
millions from programming have I earned
millions of rupees surely have I earned
millions of dollars not right now
exactly not a million figure as of now
pretty good pretty good as soon as I
reach up a million dollar I will tell
you Saturday night should be a TV show
it's like a TV show for nerds let's just
call that okay LC is your startup it age
so can you throw your views on startup
ah it's not a start-up it's just a
project that I love to do I love to work
for this project it's a personal project
I'm not looking forward for investing or
fundings or something like that it's
just something going great I like it if
I show you the starts you'll be amazed
that as of now on the Saturday night
even on the festival at least more than
12 to 15 thousand students are at now
live on that website on a learning as of
now so it's going pretty good
I'm enjoying it and that's what I like
why do you love programming okay that's
a philosophically question I love it
it's challenging I create something
which touch the millions I have created
a project like learn code online apps
and these are touching every single day
thousands of people and I just love it
this is it's so challenging it just
pushes me beyond the limits I think
about the problems critical thinking and
all that so yeah I just I just like it
okay so will I remove the jobs did
computer remove the job when the
computer came and first of all everybody
was like I hope you remember that that
was very old when computer came into the
India people were going on the strikes I
still remember that people were going on
the strike saying that hey
we should not encourage the computers
they are gonna take the jobs and now
remember this is the most job easy
oriented field so people are gonna pose
the technology has the star students
stopped no star student hasn't stopped
yet honest origin but I have paused it
for the moment because a lot of people
were just using it for emailing me and
kind of a advertisement of their
individual products so I am recasting
some rules so that I can just again push
that this is not for advertisement the
learn Quran line star student section is
not for advertisement it is for
something for students so that they can
get a better get a better view of like
of the companies and stuff like that so
it's not for advertisement and a lot of
people thought that I'll be sending you
the links of my app and he will be
posting there it doesn't work like that
okay I love you brother heritage thank
you so much love you too guys
okay do you know how to use JavaScript
and Photoshop that is totally new for me
totally absolutely new I don't even use
Photoshop much it's expensive okay so
it's going then is your birthday my
birthday is on 2nd of August okay me too
and third fold Fabian conference hey we
make thank you so much yes I am coming
to third and fourth on the conference
happening in Jaipur so you can catch me
up there at 3rd and 4th of February and
then I'll probably be available in Goa
as well for one of the conference but
let's just say if they send me the
tickets here tickets then I'll be there
ok Zambian tutorials no as of now there
does not plan up do you develop custom
rooms no I don't develop custom rooms
okay I rap God please don't post such
things I hope you are trying to get some
attention but notice there is no screen
of the comments so that's why you don't
need to be extra smart if you want to
just ask something go ahead ask
I just say thumbs up awesome let's just
enjoy festive season here please make a
free helical hacking course why always
it should be free if somebody can
sponsor me or can just donate some money
surely I can try to make it but
obviously I am spending my time these
amazing awesome resources so I need to
make some money to just keep on
continuing with that otherwise I have to
leave all these tutorial and making
video stuff get back onto a company like
Amazon or something and have to work
there so little bit money is always
required to keep on continuing what you
love to do otherwise your business model
is not gonna be sustainable okay okay so
let's pick up more questions how to
contribute okay it just keeps on going
like that there is your seminar in
Jaipur it's a conference if you'll check
up on my Facebook page I have even
posted a link of that website it's a
cyber Conclave you can just catch up
there and catch me up in Jaipur at that
conference absolutely right about money
yes in order to sustain anything you are
learning these programming or attica
liking and all these stuff because you
want to make money you want to get
higher that's all about Monetary Fund's
needs to be there to continue what you
are doing the reason why I'm able to
offer these all courses affordable rates
because I do have other clients and
other works otherwise these courses
would be expensive like everybody else
so that is why a small amount of money
needs to be generated from these kinds
of resources as well okay you are
learning this for money so you should
spend some money learning that as well
okay you are not learning all these
amazing technology to just work for
Amazon or somebody for free you you
cannot do that you cannot afford that so
you know perspective I might be wrong
there but this is I think you believe
okay when is your conference and you go
up probably in the first week of March
okay so you have girlfriend let's not
keep that and that much personal here
buddy
let's just say we are gonna be working
on the tech stuff here okay how to grow
your blog have you checked out the learn
code online blog it's amazing blog
I ranked services you look good and
beard yeah otherwise I look like a child
so I just like to keep beard you had
girlfriends in college what can I say
it's so long so fast I don't remember
much okay
where to it's just going on
do you know see same answer car no I
don't know him probably I might have but
I'm not remembering right now same month
say hey car no I am not aware of the
much of the people I'm not kind of a
friendly guy who just walks into every
conference in every event so I haven't
made much of the people if that's a
programming conference shortly you might
have seen me there but apart from that
you usually regular get-together events
I like to avoid them I usually attend
the events where somebody's teaching
something like mode over like a boot
camp ish workshop or conference but
people actually open up their computer
write some code and show us that this is
the chair that we can build up or this
is the implementation that can be there
I am found moreover in these kinds of
conferences not on the conference where
people just talk I really go there
sometimes I do okay
happy livery hater man thank you so much
wish you two as well freelance ok ok
there is a good question about I did I
missed it there was some question here
ok there is it still you can scale up
reaching to national level education
startup like by Jews etc sir making else
you your stardom yes probably probably
we can scale this up to like by choose
level but if you'll check out go ahead
download the Baiju app and check out the
pricing of their course they are
charging like twenty three thousand to
fifty thousand for some of the courses
yes obviously we can shout that much
amount of money if we had some pressure
of ventures and funding that hey make
some money make some money but the goal
is not to make money with this project
this is a side project and moreover what
I really want to do with this project is
to reach as much as audience of course
with your support
and try to bring up the quality
programmers right now what is happening
in the tech industry is what people call
the tech I don't believe that's an
actual tech so I think what should be
called as tech for me it's more over a
programming so yes that is my goal to
make affordable and quality programming
so that people can learn and talk about
these stuff like Django or react they
can fight over which one should I choose
node or react or Django this is my goal
where people actually come up with a
good solid understanding of programming
it's affordable and you can just write
anything in your hand the startups comes
up in my country as well like uber or
Ola you can code up your own app make
your own life easier I use tons of app
in my own phone that makes my life
better every single day these app never
saw the face on an actual Play Store but
I designed them whenever I need them I
have designed my own alarm system I have
designed my own to do apps my own
reminders so I do that that's kind of a
fun to me and honed my foe together all
these things I love doing these things
and I want everybody should be able to
do this okay okay enough of that talk
let's pick up more question okay
how can I get a job in big companies
like Google I haven't got a job in
Google but yes for Amazon yes I got
there I cracked down them is on it was
pretty fun probably in some videos I'll
talk about that very soon I'll make a
video ok suddenly the comments are just
following just like that why do you why
don't you publish them on Play Store I
have thought that maybe in the future if
I'll make I'll publish them on to the
Play Store I like to moreover keep them
on to a github on to a private
repository just to show the clients oh
but really I don't think these apps are
like that much great to be published
these are like simple to do app so
reminder there's already a reminder I
wanted to use my custom one that's why I
created that so probably if you wish I
can publish them they're not a big deal
but whatever I like to keep just one app
there learn code online that's like the
best one just enjoy that so if it is
meaningful it's deep it's like
generating some money then I like to
keep those apps on to the Play Store if
these are just fun apps I am not that
much interested
okay emmalin android app no there's no
such usage of implementation of machine
learning in android as of now how much
coffee a day if it is good probably two
cup max two cup that's it ah if it's
iced tea probably three or four or even
five would be good if it's iced tea
okay how to how to make your own courses
just like me get a mic record it get an
awesome camera and that's it okay uh
which type of bug reporting okay it's
going it's going really really fast
please please make some site to buy
hosting okay hosting there Prell plenty
of them go dari big rock hostgator
bluehost i what i don't use is GoDaddy
and big rock so these are the two guys
which I don't use not like they're bad I
just don't like them I prefer Bluehost
Hiroko Hiroko is amazing by the way or
CloudFlare this is rock solid technology
you should really how much sleep you
take they're all the dark circles that
you see so don't I don't sleep much and
these are all the result of that so yeah
really bad I should be but you know I
don't like sleep okay sublime or at or
at home text you later okay you can bash
me after this for that but yes I do use
a term much more still I always have
sublime text
I never skip that but he has Adam is off
my daily driver as of now so broad disk
is about data analytics yeah I'm
planning to make a couple of videos on
data analytics and kind of a machine
learning stuff very soon so do you know
which commitment you didn't follow in
this channel I know a few a year I
didn't followed
yeah I'm mistake lot of them but yeah I
tried I try myself to just get as close
as possible Kotlin native worth it
yes absolutely okay the test channel
says block me just write an abuse
comment you'll automatically get block
no big deal okay okay I found a channel
to block and there we go where is that
okay hide user there we go okay finally
yeah there we go
you abused you got block why Django no
okay flask is also amazing but you know
flask is really like tiny tiny thing to
design Django is much more wide there is
a fixed pattern to design all of the
apps in that and recently there are so
many good updates in Django I didn't
like the Django one version a lot of
about things about it especially the
regex part but now in the Django - it's
all sorted out it's so amazing and plus
the community is amazing rock-solid
community a lot of answers are there on
Stack Overflow and things like that so
yes I do like Django not that asthma hey
Roman how are you you know how to get
noticed there you don't need to do that
