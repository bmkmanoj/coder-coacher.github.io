going on I've been waiting for today no
it's it's not Saturday have you had
dinner yes just have my dinner
and again backwards you know regular
iced tea winters or anything it's just
iced tea for programming tell us
something about girls and you know what
programming is something which is not at
all biased about your gender your
raise your color is just programming so
your girl or boy
it's just same thing for you so that's
the good part
say my name yes chubby thank you
I think it's energy drink yeah kind of
iced tea is energy drink for me
jsr Python for database easy and one
Titan and the more industry friendly and
more awesome thing which is much more
scalable is Jas so just like that love
from gogo Diaz Hagel gluteus thank you
so much and yes I've invited Gugu Tia
once I couldn't joined up because I had
other plan actually it was a very big
company which I was having a session so
I chose that company instead of good
yeah maybe next time I'll get an update
or will get an invite I'll surely be
there ok so what's the use of Python I
cannot give you the use of item in just
one video because there are so many
right from scripting to making web apps
and so much thing you can do I receive
scholarship from Udacity congratulation
for you
why grey sir don't you get bored no I
don't get bored it's it's actually much
more easier do you think Ellen musk
recent falcon heavy launch it was
amazing I saw that I saw that online
it was amazing large it's like it's like
the next leap of faith that I'm having
it's it's amazing tell something about
technical round interview I am planning
something really good along with some
colleges some colleges are sponsoring
this kind of thing where I am which I'm
trying to do about the technical
interviews and I think this is going to
come up very soon and probably I'll be
able to release the news as well some
universities are so much so much trying
to do for the students I really
appreciate that so if they sponsor me or
something like that then probably we can
do something really amazing for
interview videos so let's just see how
that goes on
how's lco app made it needs a lot of
improvement I know that very soon I'm
going to reveal how the app is being
and all the process behind it but right
now it's not perfect it's not near
anywhere near what I really want with
the app but it's just working so that's
what we have I think you forgot to make
a movie unprogressive about yeah my bad
I almost forgot that sir sorry about
that I'll make it very soon I'll discuss
in fact I'll I'm planning to make a
video where I show you live demos about
these apps and stuff so yeah my bad I
forgot that sir
any college called you for 75% in is now
none has called actually most of them
have watched our videos wherever the
college I'm going they all know that
video at least so Adam brackets of lime
text which ones are I used to I use
sublime text and Adam for the video
recording purpose I always use Adam but
sublime is always there sublime love you
know so yeah how's it going on for you
people demand of dotnet let's not talk
about that should I use hackintosh no
you shouldn't use that that's not a
really good option
it is like good for a project base if
you want to just do a project for your
knowledge upgrade and stuff you should
do that but apart from that for like
full-fledged development I would choose
a much more reliable machine IV I mean
even choose Windows as compared to the
hackintosh so I don't like that so ml
videos I am myself working on an ml
project right now machine learning we
are designing something for a credit
card industry I should not be talking
about it so myself I'm making videos not
videos I'm making myself a project work
and stuff like that on ml so once I
finish this stuff I do have good
experience on that then only I can make
videos on that okay not able to crack
the first round of interview procedure
what to do yes I plan to do something
really effective for that so yeah very
soon I'm gonna address
that's like a big issue here so any new
courses yes actually I'm working on that
right now I'm recording a few videos for
that but unfortunately this this guy
died and I'm live here just doing
nothing really it I missed come on Mouse
get charged you're wasting my time
you should get charged but the good
thing is I'm live I'm interacting with
you guys so this is good what about my
YouTube my YouTube income is thrashed
down it's almost like nothing at all
this is all thanks to the yellow dollar
sign I'm not making anything good on
YouTube but who cares okay so why Apple
products you know why I use Apple
product because they just work and I
like something when I say it just works
what's the battery life of that Mouse my
free life is pretty good it usually runs
for like 15 days or 20 days or maybe
more sometime so that's why I always
forgot to charge that but it's good it's
good
I do have trackpad as well that battery
is much more awesome
live tomorrow - yes of course it's
Saturday Saturday at 10 o clock in the
night that means 10:00 p.m. we always go
live at least for now
so yes suggestion for SEO
my buddy Arpit is working on their SEO
stuff so definitely it's gonna be very
soon out so is it compulsory to buy AWS
after electron sheis no it's not it's
not not at all nothing is compulsory
seems you busy sir yes I'm actually
extremely busy right now
things are getting really busy and I'm
liking it there are a lot of like
already there is a project work going on
which is pretty big we are using machine
learning a lot of Direction pattern and
all of that for here ml framework that
you used I have used Sai kit mostly and
k neighbors algorithm and couple of like
probability stats and all these stuff so
that's that is going all already I have
to read quite a lot for that
and on top of that I'm working on a
course to finish up really quickly that
is a really big course and that will be
divided into two parts so that is also
going on
apart from that videos and travel and
management client it's going pretty busy
and I'm enjoying it so that's so that is
what is happening right now okay so it's
a it's bad connection okay it's gone
even though the 50 Mbps this is this is
the situation of Internet come on hey
guys you forgot to hit the like button
there it's not Saturday yeah it's not
Saturday it's it's just lie because my
mouse is dying so you didn't hit the
like people let me see the love coming
up there hit the like button come on
come on you can do this
yep yep it's going up and please do hit
that if you haven't done that suggestion
for mini-project topic for postgraduate
post-graduation students
ah you should take that really seriously
if you are onto a post graduation then
you should design something really rock
solid
maybe maybe on something like network
simulator and a3 or something like that
because that is expertly it's expected
so this is what you should be doing okay
so how is weather there and by the way I
hope everybody knows I'm coming to
Kolkata on 13th of February so you can
join me up there if you are there so and
the point is keep coding keep working
it's why don't you matter some of the
guys like really don't get fascinated
about the programming and course I'm all
the way pumped up about all the time for
programming probably I'm supercharged
for that but yes I know somebody that is
that is something I haven't ever seen
how to auto auto focus on cannon 1200 d
there's my photo there is Sandeep thank
you so much I have never seen this my
photo there thank you so much I'm really
impressed with that so coming on to a
question how to focus on cannon 1200 D I
think 1200 I think the autofocus is not
there on Canon 1200 it's like veo de you
have to then a face detection technology
is not there but still you can try the
autofocus there and always work on the
manual
that's always are you bored with
programming nope nope nope nah this is
the last thing that was going to happen
ever in my life I'll get bored of
programming up I cannot live without
that honestly I'm too much addicted with
that so completed CSS in four days that
is amazing I think that's because of the
consistency Gaurav which camera you use

phone and that to handheld that's what
I'm using for live session and apart
