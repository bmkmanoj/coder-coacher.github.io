laboratory we're coding is number one
priority should have what's less YouTube
videos but you know I've watched a lot
of them today so anyways welcome back to
our JavaScript series and today we're
gonna be learning one more fun
interesting stuff that he'll be using
probably almost on all websites yes the
approach is gonna be different but this
is all the useful stuff that you'll be
using in your day-to-day life and we
will be working on some project later on
as will be progressing in the series so
this is all about some of the functions
that we can do now notice here one quick
thing then we'll be moving on to the
next file so if you just notice here
come back onto the file notice there are
a couple of ways to access everything
here if I just type simply like my -
duze and I say dot and then I want to
access a day I simply say day this is
how I access my properties okay and if I
have to access my functions and just say
something like add meeting and add a
pair of parenthesis very very big
difference when you access a property
you just mention that when you access a
function you mention a pair of
parentheses as well very very subtle
difference but very important one so let
us get rid of that and we're gonna be
moving on to new file to have a new
example so let's just open this
intermediate we're gonna create a new
file and this is gonna be simply says as
Weber web check dot Jes okay so the
whole idea is to define a simple
function which can check for a username
and we want a username just like Gmail
so it should always contain some number
and we also want to check out a password
and we want to check out if password is
not something simple like one two three
four and probably in the user name there
should be an add the rate sign as well
and stuff like that and password should
be maybe like more than six characters
so couple of things that we have to take
care and in order to work with that we
have to explore something so first and
foremost let's just say we are gonna be
having a user user email so that's gonna
be our first thing and we're gonna be
calling it as simply let okay so there
we go we have a user
email and that's gonna be something like
at the end always we are gonna be adding
like add the raid gmail.com or at the
rate L Co com that's also fun so
somebody has given us a user name for
that and let's just call this as L Co
and L see you want - okay so later on
we'll be changing it to something like l
co only we should be getting an error if
it's it it is just L Co if there is no
character word being included that's one
thing and then we have a password and
the password is gonna be something like
we will be having a password like 1 2 3
4 and it should not be allowed because
it's really simple so we will not be
allowing something like 1 2 3 4 5 6 and
also we will not be allowing anything
which is less than 6 character so there
are a lot of things going on and how we
can handle that luckily for us it's all
simple so whenever you have defined a
string there are a lot of methods and
properties that you can access with that
string for example for any string let's
just say the password 1 I can just
access a lot of properties as soon as I
put a dot you can see there is a list of
things that can go on here yes you can
explore them directly here but there is
a better option so directly it just says
length and if I just use a length it's a
simple thing it's a property it's not a
method so that I don't have to give pair
of parentheses this is just a property
and it will give me length of the string
as simple as it sounds so let's just
save that open up our terminal and just
fire this up
oops not here come on be will be I think
I'm at wrong place yes I am so we'll be
going into zero to intermediate and then
clear the screen node and web check J
yes so there we go we got four obviously
one two three four is four okay now let
me walk you through with something which
a lot of you will disagree with me here
but only the people who will agree with
me here are gonna be walking with the
journey of becoming a programmer as a
programmer it's your job and it's your
duty and it should be something that you
should like is reading the documentation
now whenever I mention this
documentation part that hey read a
little bit from the documentation some
people get angry that hey why we are
watching your CDs or why we are taking
your videos that if we have to look up
into the documentation trust me my dear
friend as your job as a programmer most
of the time you will be spending in the
documentation and less time in writing
the code because you will be figuring
out new things and it's not like
everybody just remembers everything we
have to dig up into documentation so
believe it or not like it or not you
will be there on the documentation page
quite a lot so let's go ahead there and
we will be having a resource for the
documentation my favorite one is mdn
mozilla guys I know you're trying really
hard for the firefox but one thing that
you have absolutely done amazing is this
resource MDN so javascript and we are
going to be walking through with the
string and it should be the first link
with Md and javascript and string link I
love you Mozilla guys what the amazing
resource you have put up nobody can even
compete with this so there we go we have
a lot of things here notice here one
more thing now some things are saying as
properties let me zoom that on the left
hand side there are two things which is
prototype and length these are
properties rest of the thing that we are
saying is methods so you now are able to
understand that why for some of them we
are using pair of parentheses for some
we are not so notice here one that we
used it's all alphabetically
characterized so the one that we use is
the length so that is actually top
because it's a property so we have used
the length but we have others as well
for example one that you will be using
quite a lot is like lower case and upper
case and something like that for example
let's go ahead try that out let's just
say something is trying to have an i
username like this and obviously all
caps means it's like screaming at us we
don't want to do that so if I check
something like this if I just a large
values here and if I just say user email
and I want to convert that into
lowercase so I'm gonna be simply saying
dot lower case not this to lower case
there we go now important stuff is here
which everybody makes a mistake is there
is a capital L and there is a capital C
but no capital T so this is something
that you should be playing focus here
and let's just run that again and it
just returns us a function to lowercase
because we forgot to put a pair of
parentheses it's not a property it's a
it's a method so we have to run that
again and there we go finally it's LC oh
one two three so you got the point how
we can use all of them like to our case
just like this there is a to upper case
as well it's not a property it's a
method so go ahead run that and if we
just have something like this this is
something like that if I can type that
correct it's gonna convert that into
yelling this is something all caps okay
there we go
now just like this I want you to explore
more stuff here and I want you to spend
a little bit time with it don't spend
like all of that but you should be able
to spend a little bit time and it's
pretty easy documentation for example if
I click on lower case to lower case it
gives the syntax that you should have a
string then use this method what is the
return value a new string represent the
calling string convert it to a lower
case so it just takes a string gives
back your string and pretty simple stuff
okay so one thing that you will be using
quite a lot is is something in here I
can show you
there we go trim and let's open up the
documentation so what it does it takes a
string obviously and a new string
representing the calling string stripped
of white spaces from both in I hope
that's a pretty clear stuff what we are
trying to say in here is if there is a
white space at the start or maybe at the
bottom or maybe at the boat if you use a
method that is trim instead of this then
it's gonna just remove all those spaces
and gonna give you back a really clean
string this is something very useful
when we take input from the user in the
forms which we'll be learning later on
okay so enough of the theoretical basics
we have learned quite a lot and now we
are ready to define our function what we
want to do so we are gonna be defining
this function so let's call it as user
checker and that is going to be equal to
function there we go
and it takes a parameter and it takes my
string whatever that is so it takes a
string parameter and you have to check
certain kinds of things with the string
let's just assume we're gonna be giving
something like we don't have to put a
codes there it's just automatically a
string so what we have to do is we have
to check a few things and we'll be
returning true and false based on that
so we're gonna be using if an else
statement so we're gonna be saying
something like this that first and
foremost in the user email I want I want
some numbers so if my string dot and
there is a good method here which says
includes come on include and let me show
you what it does it's always good to
recommend these things again and again
there's no shame in that that if you're
if you're recommending the documentation
so what even I'm looking for there we go
include so there we go and what you can
do is you can pass on a search string
whatever you are looking forward to be
searched up okay so let's just say we
are saying that hey there should be a
number now in order to have a specific
number we have to pass on something
known as a regular expression but I
don't want to go into the regular
expression right now in detail so we
will be looking forward that if we are
using an include here we are just
looking for one two and three
specifically so these should be there
exactly in same order if we want any
number from zero to nine to be present
in a string we have to use something
known as regular expression don't worry
it will come up later on right now we
are literally looking for it okay
and we can use our end signs in here and
we can simply say something like this
and a one more condition needs to be
fulfilled and I think we need a pair of
parentheses here and here and then we
can use end and we can simply say my
string and we will be looking for the
length
and it should be greater than probably
six or whatever you like to have now if
this condition is true if it includes
one two three and if it includes a
simple length which is more than six we
are going to simply return return are
probably a true and in the else case we
are gonna be returning false so there we
go
else return false and we don't need to
actually use the else case in here it's
not compulsory you can just directly
return else case because only one truth
one return statement works in the
function as soon as it sees a return and
it just returns anything back that's it
the function is not gonna run anymore so
this part in here is completely optional
if you think that hey I get confused
with that that's critically fine but in
case you want to write something like
this that is also totally fine totally
absolutely fine only one of them is
gonna get returned okay so obviously if
we have something like this let me just
remove that we have something like ABC
we should get a false so let's just
check it and we're gonna be logging it
so let's just log this and we are gonna
be running this user checker and we will
be passing on this user email here and
let's run this and see what is going to
happen so there we go we get a false so
you get an idea that how it works and if
it says one two three and then something
like ABC it just automatically looks for
including one two three at any position
we don't have to worry about it run that
again we get a true okay so one thing is
solved shortly we'll be later on
learning the things that how we can have
something which can search for any
numbers using your simply regular
expression I have a small series on
regular expression on my youtube channel
go ahead check that out and let's define
one more function for the password okay
so let's just remove this guy and let's
pass checker
there we go not like that and we are
gonna be creating a function and the
function should have a body it is gonna
be expecting a pass or password and now
it depends how complex you want to have
password you can have variety of methods
to be checked on so let's just see we're
gonna go on to the if and else condition
now in here the if and else conditions
it's totally depend how we want to be
included in all those stuffs or
basically we can just copy and paste all
of this and can be a little bit lazy
like that so it's gonna look for in here
I have to change this pass this is gonna
check its pause so it should include
something like one two three or maybe
you want to have a little bit stricter
so it should include something like one
two three
probably an add the rate on exclamatory
sign should also be there however you
want to go ahead and look for that and
for that obviously I have to use this
string here probably you want somebody
to have like it should not include like
something some strings that you want to
have like it should not include username
however you want to get that you get the
idea
so let's just say I want somebody to
include in all of their password like a
number one two three four and the
password should be really strong so it
should be greater than eight then only
we are gonna return and allow that so
you got the point that how we can
actually work with the strings how
powerful they can be and how these
methods are defined and there are a lot
of if and else conditions in checker on
these usernames and password and don't
then only we are able to proceed into
login in or signing up or choosing a
username so this is all happening when
you select your username for Gmail or
anything else okay so I hope it was
pretty infinitive for you you enjoyed it
as well and make sure there is no
hesitation there should be no hesitation
to check out all these things like ends
with concatenate there are some useful
functions that you should definitely
look up for and should spend a little
bit time in reading documentation they
are not much you don't have to memorize
but spend a little bit time so that's it
that was some fun with the web basics
which we will be using later on when we
will be designing our own functions for
these passwords and stuff
so that's it for this video make sure
