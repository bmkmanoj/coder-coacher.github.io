to Adobe XD training and in this video
we're gonna talk about the art boat and
some of the stuff about crates as well
so some of you might be familiar with
the art boat in case you have not this
is the video where we are gonna master
that so in the infront of our screen we
can see we have an art board for iPhone
6 7 &amp;amp; 8 and this is what we are having
now if you press a on your keyboard this
gives you an art board you can also
select it from here but as I mentioned
it's always easier to get things done by
the keyboard so pressing the a it gives
you an art board features on the
right-hand side as I mentioned
right-hand menu is context based and it
will change so right now it's art board
based so we can see we have a lot of
designs here iPhone X iPhone 6 7s some
of the Google devices as well Android
mobile tablets surface and some
web-based as well first we are going to
talk about the art boats related to the
mobile apps and then I'll talk a little
bit about the web as well so here you
can select any of the devices like I
just have a Google Android mobile one
and this is the one we have now press V
on your keyboard this is most of the
time you want it to be selected you can
just click on here as well this is the
one so the first thing is make sure that
you have an artboard and you just change
the name of it you can just double click
and name that so for example this is my
login screen so you can just make it as
login screen so there we go it's always
useful because when you'll be designing
a lot of apps it can get a little bit
clattery so make sure you have that and
we do have a layers panel here which we
haven't talked about much and this is a
quick way of accessing all of your art
boards and stuff now notice here on the
Android mobile or login screen you can
see a very tiny tiny button here and
which is a mark for a batch export we
will be talking about exports later on
just to mention that it is there I'm
gonna hide this layers panel so this is
how you have a login screen and probably
for Android you want to give a different
experience so you can double click and
say login - Android maybe screen or
something like that so there we go
this is the base stuff about it now
let's talk about what are all the
options that you have and some of the
grid systems that everybody should be
aware while designing so this is your
artboard and as you can see on the right
hand side we have some width and
of height being assigned for it okay so
we can select any of that and we can
talk about it
now the first this width and height
which is 375 and 667 is your width and
height this a right hand side x and y is
your position where do you want to have
this to be placed on the artboard based
on the first outward the positions are
being determined and you can have that
for example if you just say hey is the
second artboard should also be on the 0
0 position obviously it's gonna lar it's
gonna overlap over login so obviously we
can have it sometimes it's helpful for
knowing about these things obviously you
have landscape and portrait modes of a
labels here you have your square this
lock button in case you want to just
increase the aspect ratios just want to
keep that intact or something like that
so it is also available now the
scrolling feature we are gonna talk
about later on because it's related to
somewhat a little bit like prototyping
having things on being actual phone or
phone each thing and its self all there
now let me talk about very interesting
thing which I think every designers
should understand which is the grid
system now first we're gonna talk about
the grid system for phones or mobile
phones and then we're gonna move on to
web as well so just check mark on this
grid and we can see there are some lines
on our screen now for the mobile phones
we use the system which is known as
square system and the square is gonna be
eight of defaults 80 units now let me
press Z key or Z key on my mobile phone
and just zoom that apart a little bit
now notice we have a grid system here
now in the ideal situation what you
really want to do and in fact let me
tell you what you really don't want to
do press your R key and let's just say I
want to design a button or maybe a area
in my app which is gonna be like image
or anything if I just start directly
from here you can see that this is kind
of a snapping towards the grid and this
is what you really want so let's just
say this is my button or maybe an area
now as a designer you will be judged
what you have done just right now
because your alignment is not perfectly
onto these grids as a designer you
really want that whatever your buttons
or area that you are having should be
aligned somehow on to these grid lines
so
if I just make it like something like
this this is better design as compared
to previous one obviously I have to
align that now these small things
eventually make a lot of difference now
when you'll be exporting your assets and
if they are aligning everything on to
the whole numbers for example there
might be a width of something like 120
8.5 this is not considered as a good
approach because when you'll be
exporting the assets it may look a
little bit fuzzy so my recommendation is
always try to match that everything
should lie on to these grid lines and
there should be nothing into these like
one 28.5 this is really don't you don't
want to do so it should be either 128
129 so and also you will notice that if
you have a high resolution screen that
these point and decimal things when you
export them they look really fuzzy so
just take care of that okay so this is
like basic stuff and obviously when you
export the things these lines doesn't
really appear so this is what we have
now obviously we are gonna select our
artboard come on let's just select the
artboard and there we go
so hit command zero to zoom that out and
there we go
so there we go now we can see we do have
another option which is layout which is
now we're gonna talk and default is 8 so
this is all about your mobile phone so
try to keep that in mind now let's move
on to one of the design aspects for the
web you will be designing a few web
assets as well so let's just say I'm
pressing a again for the artboard and
this time I want something to be web to
el-ad so there we go this is our screen
here and now if I just select V tool and
select the dartboard I want to lay out
here notice here we have 12 column grid
and there are something known as gutter
with column width so what actually it is
now most of your web designs are gonna
be using the layout system being marked
by the bootstrap there are other layout
system as well
but let's talk about this bootstrap
stuff and we have to visit a URL this is
beautiful Argentina let's first of all
go on to Google and we're gonna surf or
search for bootstrap grid layout there
we go and we're gonna go directly to the
official documentation from bootstrap
and it is get bootstrap not this one so
make sure you check out this get
bootstrap so if I go back here and just
scroll a little bit till I get these
things notice here are all the things
being mentioned so this is exactly what
we are talking so the number of column
is 12 and then the gutter width is
mentioned as 30 pixel so if you are
designing anything for the web
usually like 80 to 85 percent or maybe
95 percent of the people use the same
markups as being mentioned by bootstrap
there are a couple of others as well but
this is like mostly standard so this is
what TV will be using so there's 30
pixels that are built and everything can
be applied here notice like gutter with
right now it's 16 we want 12 column
grids and you have like column width as
well like if you want to have a gutter
width of probably it was mentioned as 30
pixel 15 on each side so maybe you want
to have that maybe you want to have a 30
so notice this is how it is now column
width you can expand that decrease that
based on that so you might want to set
that up it is sometimes a little bit
time-consuming but make sure you spend a
little bit time on that and based on
like column width whatever you want you
can just change that probably you want
to have it like 60
however the width you really want to
have then the gutter bit obviously it's
gonna increase or decrease based on that
so these things are like a little bit
time-consuming at first but you really
want to do that again if you are
designing some assets for example you
are designing something for two or three
column width
if you press R key these your lines are
gonna be snapping to that I hope you
noticed that
so the snapping is going to happen and
obviously we want snapping to happen so
let's just say we are using four columns
here so this is what we are having let's
just give it a fill for fun purpose
something like this and we can then copy
and paste it now we are going to talk
about these copy and pasting stuff later
on but we do have some amazing stuff to
talk on like for example this repeat
grid then I can just have copies of it
as quickly as possible
there we go hit enter and it's it's done
we will be talking about these stuffs
what are the advantages disadvantages
how we can fix this stuff like if this
is going a little bit high we can change
the
and can make that pretty easily
beautiful we will be talking about that
but obviously I want these elements to
be on to the grids that's helpful so I
hope this video has helped do you quite
a lot and understanding what are all
things that a designer should keep in
mind while designing the things and with
all the preparation you can do for
having these cutter width and all these
things now mainly we will be working on
designing this stuff on mobile so we'll
be using this eight column square grids
here
so that's pretty much it and that's here
basically your artboard and some of the
key points that a designer keeps in mind
while designing all these stuffs so
that's it for this video and I'm gonna
surely catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
