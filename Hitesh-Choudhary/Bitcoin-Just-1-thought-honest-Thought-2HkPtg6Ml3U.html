with another video and in this video we
are talking about finally Bitcoin but
before I move further in this video let
me tell you that I am not at all expert
in Bitcoin I cannot provide you any kind
of advices on investment on Bitcoin but
still there are some important
information regarding Bitcoin and making
investment in Bitcoin that everyone
should know again I'm no expert but I
think you should always keep these
things in mind
falling back into you if i wiii be
sparta
yes I am not at all an expert in Bitcoin
but yes I do have studied things like
centralized system decentralized system
torrent streaming system and a couple of
other things to get my degree so I know
a little bit about them not much but a
little bit first and foremost let's talk
about what is Bitcoin probably you might
have seen thousands of videos on YouTube
every youtuber try to explain you what
is Bitcoin what is blockchain and blah
blah and stuff let me just try to
precise and summarize all of them
Bitcoin is divided into two parts the
first is token and the second one is
leisure the first part the Bitcoin the
token is something which all of us are
getting crazy here which is getting
evaluated and high-priced money and all
of that and the second part is the
ledger which is kind of a ledger which
everybody maintains in a decentralized
system now in return of that
decentralized maintaining that ledger in
a decentralized manner everybody who is
monitoring that is getting something in
return that is known as Satoshi which is
a very very very tiny part of the
Bitcoin again valuable but very tiny
part of that so now that you have become
an expert on what is Bitcoin you know
what is Bitcoin you might be wondering
hey I know Bitcoin now I'm I'm gonna go
get invest in Bitcoin and I'll earn
thousands and maybe millions of dollar
the very next moment but wait a minute
my dear friend just wait for a minute
onto a very side note let's also clear
up that recently in India in the budget
it was mentioned that Bitcoin is no
longer a legal tender for doing all the
business and stuff previously it was
also not legalized but I believe that
government is on to a very strange path
where they can legalize the Bitcoin but
they cannot do something against it
because bitcoin is really powerful and
the yes government can allow it but
there are nobody to disallow it so still
bitcoin is still as something just to
give you a very vague example if I just
talk about this mouse and just say this
is the last Mouse on the planet and it
is very valuable I'm selling it for ten
thousand dollars it is valuable but the
next day you find out that hey you know
what there are some other Mouse just
like this and I can just get that in a
hundred dollars suddenly
mouse is not at all valuable same thing
is happening with the Bitcoin as well
every single day new coins are coming
out some of them are getting valuable
some of them are not but here is my
point to all of you the money that
you're earning is really hard earned
money and you should really value that
just because a 15 year old has told you
that bitcoin is valuable or that other
coin is valuable you should not trust
them I am not at all against these 15
year old giving all these amazing
investment advice but some of them have
absolutely nothing idea what the
centralized system Handa decentralized
system or even the blockchain technology
is I am myself a very kind of an admirer
of these blockchain technology but I
always keep my eye that if something is
too good to be true it probably is I am
probably no one to give you advice on
Bitcoin and yes I accept this I am
nobody I don't have huge investment
reputation like Warren Buffett but
neither do those 15 year kids also don't
have any reputation that they should be
giving you advice now all I'm saying
with you is don't get crazy about any
other Bitcoin or a theorem whatever that
new coin is coming out one of my friend
who happens to live in Thailand and he
travels quite a lot from Thailand to
Singapore as well he's earning thousands
and thousands of dollar by installing
rigs and giving the online access of
these Bitcoin mining stuff he is making
a fortune of that and he always says to
me you know he - I'm not investing in
Bitcoin I'm saying that hey you should
get a mining rig to have just these
Bitcoin mining and people just listen to
me and buy a lot of rig I have got my
agency of these rigs and graphic cards
and I'm making a fortune by selling
insane crazy amount of these rigs yes
people are actually making money when
you just buy these rigs or buy these
cloud based services to mine Bitcoin I
don't know about you that you whether
you are going to be getting rich or not
with that because investment is huge but
certainly these other third parties are
getting rich this all looks like makes
me that I am against the Bitcoin and all
these coins but I'm not I'm always
optimistic about technology but
certainly if something says that I'm
gonna make you rich overnight I
certainly don't
that this all makes me believe or makes
me look like that I am totally against
the bitcoins and a theorem and all these
coins no I'm not in fact I would say
that I'm optimistic person I always love
these new tech in fact I think
blockchain technology has so much
potential that it can certainly
revolutionize the new world that is
coming up all to us but again think a
little bit and in case you are not aware
of that that search on the Google about
bit connect and you'll see a lot of
people crying on the YouTube that they
have lost so much of the money on this
new coin that came on as a name of the
bit connect a lot of youtuber tried to
make awareness about it try to stop a
lot of you but still people have
invested like $20,000 $30,000 in this
new coin and they came out with an
amazing idea that we have got an amazing
bought a AI or machine learning BOTS
that can smartly invest and can give you
one person return every single day makes
it a 365 percent of the return which is
crazy and the way of presentation and
everything was so amazing that everybody
invested in that so again I highly
recommend you to check out about the bit
connect scam they came up with a really
Ponzi scheme they came up with something
as pyramid scheme so again I'm not again
bashing anybody or thinking about
investing or not investing in Bitcoin
just listen to me it's money it's
hard-earned money and there are bad
people out in the world who really wants
to take your money
so whenever you want to invest in
something you have extra cash just
listen to your elders listen to the
people who have credibility strong
credibility in terms of investment play
wisely I really don't want you to cry
later on that hey I invested in Bitcoin
or any other coin now it's getting
devaluated and I'm losing all of my
money because I was not aware about the
technology don't be that guy who really
don't know anything and still investing
in that that's it for this video this
video was just created to make sure that
you understand that there is a lot of
risk involved in investment and you
should really look forward for that okay
that's it for this video in case you
have enjoyed this video give it a thumbs
up you can also see a subscribe button
smash that and you'll get all the
notifications but again let me
bu this notification of YouTube doesn't
really work much often so you have to
come on the YouTube search for my
channel again and again look for that
hey YouTube if you are listening fix
this subscribe and the Bell notification
it's not working for my subscriber most
of them so again that's it for this
video and I'll surely catch you in the
next one
was for you to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
