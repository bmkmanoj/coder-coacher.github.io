I'll give you on that that it looks
weird a lot weird in this video we're
going to talk about what is regular
expression how you can use them what
programming language do you need to
learn in order to use regular expression
how they are so much powerful and some
tips and important instructions
regarding regular expression and their
usage on web Android and iOS so let's
get started it makes you see this john
deere
there are two important key points that
I want to get started in this video the
number one point is the programming
community don't refer them as regular
expression because it's a little bit
mouthful although my name is still a
little bit mouthful but still I'm saying
this so programming community doesn't
say that it's regular expression usually
they use a short form of that also known
as regex and in fact all the programmers
refer to this as regex
point number two and which is very
important regular expression or also
known as regex
is not at all a programming language a
lot of people get this misconception
that in order to use the regex we need
to learn Java or we need to learn Python
no they are not at all a property of any
programming language all the programming
language in fact have the ability to use
the regular expression some use them as
a by default method for some you have to
download some packages out you have to
use third-party packages but apart from
that all the programming languages like
Python Ruby Java JavaScript PHP all of
them have the capability and ability to
use regex so the questions still have
what we have here is what is reg X now
reg X is not a programming language
let's get clear first of all that now
reg X is simply a pattern matching thing
so yes it is little bit weird to
understand but let me try to explain
that in this way when you open up any
document you just press ctrl F or
command F and started to type searching
for the things your Microsoft Word or
maybe your web page where you have
opened the source code and tried to hit
command F or ctrl f it just searches you
the thing but sometimes you want to do a
little bit more onto the search maybe
your search criteria is I want to look
up for all the email address on this web
page yes of course you're just searching
with ctrl F is not going to give you all
the email address present on the webpage
because some of the emails might be from
at gmail.com some of them might be Yahoo
dot code are in some of them might be
yahoo.com so it's not easier to find
with just our regular ctrl F or command
F there comes your regular expression
with regular expression it's something
like a strike on a steroid it's
also refer to this what I mean by that
whenever you want to search something
maybe into a database you write a query
select star from table this lessness and
this star means select everything from
that and this regular expression is
something like estwick on a steroid you
can search and can define your exact
pattern that you are looking up onto the
web page or maybe on to a big document
file and there can be a lot of patterns
like that you might have noticed that
some website pushes you that you should
use the password in uppercase lowercase
some letters and some special characters
as well this is all done using regular
expressions forcing a user to write
correct format of the email forcing the
user to his use a very secure password
or maybe entering a credit-card number
into a write format these are just of
the few examples where regular
expressions are used but it can do way
beyond this regular expressions or regex
can give you exact amount of data or
exact data what you are looking up in a
big huge chunk of file this data or this
information this set of information is
otherwise so hard to find out I am NOT
saying you cannot find it obviously you
can find it but since you are a computer
user especially a programmer it doesn't
make sense to dig up into the whole file
it makes sense that you write some exact
script that can find out what you are
looking up for but this also comes up to
some interesting usage of regular
expression just taking another use case
scenario let us assume that you want to
write a simple script that goes into a
personal computer of the person and then
try to find out the bootloader or the
grub file and then going into that graph
file and writing some mumbo-jumbo text
simply just corrupting the computer so
this can all be possible using the regex
or regular expression because you'll be
working on to a computer in which you
have no idea how the directory
structures are still you are able to
find out your exact file that you are
looking for this is where the regex
comes into play so yes a lot of virus
bombs Trojans want to cry all these are
somehow inspired with regex not totally
but yes a huge part of writing such kind
of files is actually dependent on regex
or regular expression I would also like
to add up here that if you are into
information security penetration testing
Rezac
is kind of a really good thing to learn
you might be asking why let me explain
that as well
now whenever you are into penetration
testing or sort of ethical hacking the
main job of what you will be doing here
is analyzing the thing it's not all
about using the tools and everything
many times you have to analyze the
things for example it's a virus data or
maybe a wired data and you want to find
out some specific chunk of information
for that you have to just get let's just
say you have launched a Wireshark and
you want to grab some information from
it
a good way of analyzing the things would
be using writing your own custom scripts
that uses as specific data sets and find
them using regular expression this makes
you from a regular pen tester to a pro
pen tester since you are able to write
your own scripts and find your own data
you'll be exploring the things that
nobody has ever explored ok so now that
you understand that this weird-looking
string that I showed you in the first of
the video what is this and where they
use it comes up in here the next common
question that I get while explaining
about the regex
or regular expression is so what
programming language should I be
learning in order to master the regex
the answer is choose whatever you are on
already
now since regex is not a programming
language it's not a plugin it's just a
way of finding the things you should
always be stuck to whatever the language
you are maybe you are a PHP guy maybe
you are Python maybe you are into Java
or JavaScript wherever you are just stay
there and regex is something that you
adds onto top of your programming
language and there is no such thing as
best programming language with regex or
worst programming language with regex
regex works fine with all programming
language so another common question is
how much time should I spend with regex
now before we move on to that regex is
hard and I give you on that it's not
easy to learn and write regex scripts
people have spent like days and
sometimes many hours and days to just
write a simple this much long regex
script but this is super powerful so I
get you on that that it is hard and it
is time-consuming as well so how much
time you should be spending to learn
regex
now it depends what you really want to
do with regex in case you are into the
domain of pen testing or cyber security
or maybe network
traitor Linux administrator then regex
is super powerful and super helpful for
you you should spend maybe months on
learning the regex alone it is it is
going to take you to the next level of
that but again if you are just a regular
web developer iOS or Android developer
then it's not that you have to go into
in depth of that again giving you on to
the point that if you go into that
that's super helpful for you but in case
you don't want to go into too much depth
of that that's completely okay and fine
as well so how much depth should you be
talking about so in case you just want
to touch the surface or the regex
I recommend this website regex are.com
this is one of the favorite resource
that you can use for using the regular
expression now for all the guys who are
saying that hey this is sponsored by
regex hey come on get a life in all of
my offline boot camp or online boot camp
I would recommend this resource regex
are is one of my favorite resource to
learn and I have particular reasons for
them reason number one it has a
QuickStart guide on the left hand side
so that you can learn about the regular
expression without digging too much deep
into what are the square brackets what
is the slashes as trickin all about that
it has a QuickStart guide on top of that
it has some options that allows you to
write regular expressions for many
programming language yes regular
expression is same for all programming
language but there are subtle
differences just a few minor one of them
and this website allows you to have all
those differences to be enabled or
disabled at the go and the second most
important reason why I love this website
is its community section there is a
community tab on this website on which
you can go and can find out common
regular expressions for example you want
to have a regular expression to enforce
the password thing uppercase lowercase
letters numbers and all these weird
stuff so there are already cooked up and
very well defined regex already being
there for you but here is a quick word
of caution until and unless you don't
understand what the code is saying you
should not implement that code so first
of all try to understand what what are
the basics of regex or whenever you see
a regex you can at least try to think
that hey this is what it's doing and
that's fine so these are my reasons why
I love this website now this is not like
this is the only resource available on
the web there are
of other resources that can help you to
understand the regex
I also recommend that if you find out
some good books related to your
programming language or just regex go
ahead and buy them it's something that
you want to invest in yourself the more
you'll be investing in learning the more
are the gateways that open up to earning
now here is an important and very very
important instruction if I would have an
alarm I would just like to put it right
now be very cautious while using the
regular expression you can get into the
legal trouble as well yes regular
expression usage can land up into your
legal trouble as well how you might be
asking let me explain you that when you
try to scrape on any website for looking
up for the email or any kind of data
this is not at all allowed not at all
allowed now some website allows you to
dig up the data add to certain extent
but most of the website doesn't allow
this so it can be a little bit dangerous
at that site as well so if you are a guy
who is looking up and thinking that hey
I'll make a website that looks up on to
the all emails or maybe a specific data
on to a website and I'll use regular
expression on that trust me if that
website guys find out that you are doing
this this is not at all legal if you
want to take the excess of any website
or such resources there are always API
is available for that website if that
website want to share its resources with
you regular expressions are useful still
but it's not like that you can just
launch them on any website and can use
that it is illegal my second big advice
is don't use regular expression in your
Android or iOS app now this is super
important if you are submitting your iOS
app then for sure that if you are using
too much of the regular expression for
scraping some data on the website this
is against the Apple policy and your app
may get banned or may even not be able
to submit it on to the website same case
goes for Android in Android since the
initial hurdle phase of submitting your
app is super easy that means you'll be
able to submit your app that uses the
regular expression but as soon as Google
will find out and trust me it will find
out it may kick up your existing app or
even may ban up your complete account
and your existing all other apps as well
so be super cautious while using the reg
this was not to scare you this was just
to give you the fairground basis that
what extend you can use regex and where
you should not be using it that's it for
