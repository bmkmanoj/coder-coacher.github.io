you know the next girl we want a small
image of the Rolex there at the center
of this this will look pretty cool okay
so how we can do that obviously we have
to add an image there so I'll just go
below this h1 and I'll add an image so
IMG and it tab and notice this saves us
a lot of time and that is the reason why
I asked you to install the Emmet it
gives us so much ability to not bother
about hey did you forget about the
source or what the alt is so it says as
a lot of time in there so in the source
I can simply say that I want to use an
image of test dot jpg and notice in case
you didn't notice that in our background
actually oops there we go the colored
death wheel there it's rotating it
doesn't get recorded in my screen but
sometime while recording just pops up
and delays the tanks okay notice that
this is a PNG image and this is a jpg
image so a common mistake there make
sure you write it properly there so if I
save that and I'll say I'll simply watch
thumbnail okay save that I notice there
we go a big gigantic image there all
that looks good but this doesn't match
our page at all
okay so we need to fix this up so first
of all we need to add a lot of classes
in here so first of all let's get
started with class okay and in the image
tag I'll add up a class and I'll call
this as what should I call it
I am a for image let's just say I am a
okay and this I am a is gonna be
selected in our CSS come on get selected
and let's just call this as dot ima if
our images I know there's a bear not a
good name but I just came up with that
I'm not proud on it but yup I did that
and let's just give it a fixed width in
height so height is gonna be legislated
pixels you can choose other heights in
width as well I'm gonna be just choosing
in height and width of 100 and 200
pixels okay so now we have shrinked it
down a little bit I know that's not a
good thing to do because we are playing
with the proposed
since there but again I'll let just say
for this we are doing it or how about
100 100 is not at all not even close to
good I'll go with the 200 this is much
better okay so that's one thing so we
have just written bare minimum CSS
notice we have just written a height and
weight now rest of the thing that we'll
be doing is through this classes at all
that's the magic so first of all is IMG
- there are a lot of others like circle
that you might haven't seen that I just
it just doesn't work at all any here how
it is gonna work for sure it's gonna be
thumbnail that we are looking up in here
and there we go we got a thumbnail there
looks good but it's not at all Center in
here you can see it's not in center and
how we can do the center not to do the
center first of all we're gonna do use a
trick we're gonna say this image is a
block level element and just Center that
and to do so we are gonna say D block
saying that here it's a block level
element I know that's not true but we
are just saying it and then we can use
again in built property that says MX
auto okay and makes it in center there
we go
cool a nice trick there now by the way
in case you didn't notice that this is
just one way of doing that there are
there can be hundreds of ways to loosen
and one of them would be let's just say
we are creating a new division with the
class of text
- Center and in that we can just place a
proper image there so I am G and I can
simply say what is name test dot jpg and
save that and we haven't assigned
anything in that let's assign a class
there so that we can shrink it and see
it so class equals ima save that and
notice this is against link so you can
use you can place it inside a division
with the text center property there and
there we go
obviously we can use another class if it
look it doesn't look good is copy that
and paste that again save that so there
are a couple of ways you can just you
these tricks to say that hey this is a
block-level element and use Amex Auto to
Center it or you can just give it
another division there and say that this
is gonna be Center and there are maybe
hundreds more to just do the same thing
to achieve the exact same look that
you're looking for and even if we shrink
it it just stays there so it looks so
soothing and so good and I'm gonna be
just commenting this down because I
don't use it I will just keep that for
you okay so this is our very first
project that we have done in here we
have used some custom fonts from the
Google we have just placed a nice image
we have learned only that much about the
image and we have learned a lot about
these things notice this is h1 this is
even bigger than the h1 and notice our
CSS file this is I would call it bare
minimum some font element that we wanted
in here even though if you just remove
these two guys it's not gonna bother
much we are using a font text font so
Paul I'm saying is it's a bare minimum
CSS file and already bootstrap is doing
everything for you so so awesome notice
even the smaller size it looks so
awesome and automatically responds to
the different media exercises there okay
so that is one good project that we have
done and here comes the assignment part
don't forget if you are following up the
course you have to go with the
assignment now what you have to do is go
onto the pixabay and you have to search
for coffee beer okay there are hundreds
and hundreds of images of the coffee
choose any of them and just use any of
your software like a gimp which is free
maybe an online version there canva or
anything just make sure you also give a
kind of opacity layer there for a
rectangle there and just shade it out
like blue just shade it with a coffee
color okay I want you to create exact
same project but it should be saying we
are coming with coffee okay I'm a coffee
lover and I am expecting that you should
be giving me a simple project assignment
there and we are coming with coffee okay
I would be waiting for your post there
in the Q&amp;amp;A section you have to post a
screenshot of this and if you're
following me up definitely you should do
that I'll be waiting for that and with
this we are ready to rock and roll with
and
and more about the bootstrap this
project is officially over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
