mobile development the first one is when
you want to learn mobile development
first you have to decide whether I
should go for iOS or Android for iOS
it's a different language Swift for
Android it's a different language like
Java or Catalan the second big issue is
when you want to design an app you want
your app to look amazing great the way
you have designed it the way you have
imagined it but as soon as the device
size changes your app doesn't look that
great and there are so many devices
right now in the market talking about
iOS or Android there's a huge abundance
of it and when you want a consistent
look in iOS and Android it's a whole new
nightmare welcome to the solution of
both problem welcome to react native
design course where we're going to learn
how to design 10 mobile apps for both
Android and iOS and yes these are all
native apps react native is a rock-solid
technology used by Facebook messenger
Instagram Tesla and variety of big
companies we're gonna write all of our
code in JavaScript and we're gonna
produce native mobile apps for Android
and iOS that are going to look awesome
on all devices this is like a front-end
course for mobile apps hi my name is
Satish and I have been programming for
almost 10 years now I have created some
of the amazing and life-changing boot
camps and have helped more than 150,000
students all over the globe in becoming
amazing web developers reaching to the
Android store or to the Apple Store my
speciality is to teach the toughest
topic in the easiest manner so that
learning becomes fun engaging and
exciting I am back with another exciting
course on react native this course is
totally focused on designing the front
end of the app so that your app looked
consistent and amazing on iOS as well as
on Android devices just using javascript
not only we will be writing all the code
in JavaScript we will also be using some
of the latest technology like Expo so
that you can just fire up any text
editor like atom or sublime text and you
don't need explicit extraordinary
hardware you can just install the expo
app available for free on your Android
and iOS and can just work with that no
need to install Android studio even for
that you
of course if you want to publish your
app that time it will be needed but you
don't need to have that all the time
that means your low configuration
hardware can also help you to in
designing the Android and iOS
applications our single JavaScript code
will be same and exact for producing
Android apps as well as iOS apps so what
are these ten apps that will be building
both for Android and iOS these apps are
specifically being selected so that we
can address various design issues that
recent modern trend is trending towards
number one app that will be designing is
gonna be a tutorial screen you might
have seen this screen quite a lot while
launching the first tab the next tab
that will be building is gonna be a
login screen app this is going to be a
keyboard aware screen and is gonna work
absolutely fine on Android and iOS next
we'll be building our dummy shopping
cart experience after that a customized
photo gallery inspired by Instagram
style of scrolling views next we'll be
building a YouTube clone with dummy API
now again this clone is not at all
functional but this is going to look
amazing in both iOS and Android next
we'll be building a horizontal scroll
view which gives you an idea how the
apps in Amazon Prime are actually
working and being designed further we'll
have a drawer view which is very common
in most app and we'll learn how the
horizontal scroll view and vertical
cards just like Instagram can be
designed further how can they miss the
tinder animation cards and finally we're
gonna have a chat list view all of these
apps that we are designing are just the
front end they are not having connected
with their back-end but they are fully
functional working and looks absolutely
fabulous on iOS and Android and all
kinds of devices this course doesn't
require you to have heavy prerequisite
all you need is a basic JavaScript
knowledge if you are comfortable in
writing loops and arrow function in
JavaScript that's it that's all you need
you even don't need heavy end computer
since you will be writing all of your
code in JavaScript and we'll be testing
out everything on your actual mobile
device this means no need of
extraordinary hardware check out the
description section have a
at some of the free preview videos and
I'll surely catch you up inside the
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
