JavaScript course and we are again
having some fun with JavaScript so now
that it is perfectly clear about you to
you that what is if and else on how we
can deep dive and how it is actually
being implemented in a real life
scenario now I would like to take this
thing a further and giving you a simple
example about my web site here again
learn code online and it's a simple
website where you can buy and have a
preview of the courses so there is one
feature in the course that one is which
allows you to buy the course and the
second one which allows you to have kind
of a free preview of the course
enrolling as a guest so how these
features can be applied and for that we
have to learn some of the logical
operations as well so let's see how we
can do that that's pretty easy now we
have actually two kind of operation
basically there are three but the third
one is actually pretty easy so the first
one is known as + operator so this is
your + operator there we go so the end
operator is something like when you
somebody says and like something I want
a pizza and a cold ring so he is not
saying I want either one of them he's
saying I need a pizza and a cold ring so
and simply is something where you need
both of them to be true so in this case
you can simply say both sides both sides
need to be true in order to proceed
further so this is what we are having
here so this is your first operator and
the second one is similar to this which
is known as or now this is the key which
is just above your Enter key it's really
hard to find some time and this is known
as your or operation so this is called
as our operation okay and this is like
something what you say can you would you
like to have a tea or coffee and here we
are not saying that you are asking for
both we are simply giving you a choice
that whether you would like to have a
tea or a coffee so just like that again
remember and is always something like I
would like to have a pizza and coke
because hey everybody loves pizza and
coke and for the or it's like would you
like to have a tea or coffee and you
choose one of them okay so here we can
say one side need
to be neat to be true in order to get a
true result and both side here I'm
talking about here so and operation we
are saying we need pizza and coke and if
somebody is saying that hey we don't
have Coke that means we are asking for
both if there is not gonna be one we are
gonna go leave the restaurant just like
that so if somebody says hey we don't
have pizza we have just coke would you
like to have it and we're gonna say no
we want both and similar to that if
somebody says to me hey we have just a
coke we'd just have pizza we don't have
coke and I'm gonna say no I'm gonna go
to nearby some other chain where I can
find both of them so here both of the
need to be necessarily done here and the
our operation only one is true then it's
totally fine and usually it's one of
them are true okay so in order to much
better understand the situation we're
going to take a real world example off
again from my website so we're gonna be
declaring a few variables here so let's
just code that so is verified so first
of all this is for the verified user
we're gonna be directly assigning true
and false values here no worries at all
and we're gonna say is logged in and
that is also gonna be let's just start
with the true all of them and then we're
gonna have like something has payment
token and we're gonna simply say true
there we go and let's just have one more
which is is guessed and that is going to
be true so there these are the few key
points or the turning points that we
have decided for the website now we want
to simply write a logic where we want to
assign some part of the user as a guest
and some part of the user as simply able
to purchase the course okay so first of
all let's have a if statement now based
on this particular environment obviously
there can be many others as well and
obviously there are many others as well
so we're gonna be choosing that if
somebody wants to purchase a course I
want to check almost all of them okay so
I'm gonna be checking first of all is
verified and he needs to be verified and
notice I'm using a and here I'm not
saying he can be verified or he can have
a payment okay no he should be verified
and at the time of purchasing he should
be logged in so that is also gonna come
up as an end and also he should have has
payment token without all of these
things I'm not gonna give a course to
him like if he has a payment token but
he's not logged in so how can I give him
a course and in order to purchase a
course you need to be verified as well
otherwise after three days your account
will be blogged he will not be able to
access that so these all things needs to
be fulfilled and this is exactly what we
are doing here so in that particular
case I can write something like console
dot log and first and foremost I'm gonna
give as some kind of a greeting message
like that
so greeting message to user whoops to
user and then we can have something like
grant grant access to paid course
whatever the course he has purchased
with that token so that is a kind of an
end now here we are saying hey this
needs to be true this needs to be true
this needs to be true there is no option
here we are giving you all the condition
needs to be fulfilled but here when we
are assigning other things let's just
say let's go in the else part and in the
else part let's have an F and there we
go like that so in this condition we can
be little bit lenient we can simply ask
that if a user is let's just say
verified or is maybe a guest user so
let's just say is guest we don't really
care much about it so in this case it
can be like something hey if the user is
not even verified and it's just a guest
we can simply allow him the access of as
a guest user so so we're gonna say
simply like console dot log and there we
go so we are simply saying here is allow
free previews there we go ok and what
else we can do we can simply have an
else block which is gonna catch
everything rest of the stuff and we're
gonna simply say can't console dot log
and we are gonna say a message something
like please contact admin
as something like that okay so here we
have learned that there there are some
things which can be handled pretty
easily with these logical operations and
obviously if you want to run that that's
no big deal we can run that and we can
simply say now it's saying hey now
please verify your email sending you
send any user email verification and all
of that I actually ran the wrong file I
need to run node and logical ops there
we go
so greeting to the message and grant
access to the page so notice all of them
are true but if any one of them goes
like false like for example is verified
is gonna go false now what is going to
happen this whole block will be like
nope I'm not gonna go inside that so
just run that again and notice allow
free previews so we have now inside this
one and we are saying hey you know what
the user is a guest so we can allow him
so here we can see that here just the
one situation got off and the entire
block was not executed but here only the
one block was allowed which is his guest
but still we got like an access to this
block so very important and crucial
information a lot of time you can just
reduce down a lot of your work in the F
and else block using these logical
operation now there is one more guy
which usually people don't talk which is
something which would reverse everything
now this is little bit strange now if I
put an exclamation sign here notice what
happens I will save that and I'll run
that and notice it says greeting message
to user grant access to paid codes so
can you guess what happened just there
yes this exclamation sign is a reverse
logical operation so whatever the value
you are storing in your variable it just
returns and a negative of that so it
only works in the boolean operations so
if you have a false value it is gonna
convert that into true if you have a
true value it's gonna convert that into
false it's kind of a work on a reverse
psychology you might have heard about
that as if somebody says yeah I'm gonna
go there and it says no I'm not gonna go
there so this is kind of a reverse
psychology and you can just remember
that always by hey this is a reverse
psychology so this is known as not
operator in the
programming terms but I usually call
them on all of my boot camps as reverse
psychology and this is what usually
parents play with their kids if they're
not gonna go there they use the reverse
psychology and just works with that so
yes sometimes work can be a little bit
easy with this reversal of psychology
and in some of our project works you're
gonna see that how this reverse
psychology can be really helpful when
things are really painful and just like
it helps parents it helps us as well so
there we go your nice introduction about
your logical operation your end and all
and you have also seen how these things
can be actually implemented when you're
working on a website or a project or
whatever you are creating so that's up
for this video and I'm going to surely
catch you up in a next one and don't
