training now there are a couple of
things that you need to understand
before watching this video now first of
all that this video is going to be
longer okay so have patience because
this is a do along with me video I just
don't want to skip any basic cool
concept which are important just for the
sake of making this video smaller I want
to explain thoroughly we would be
drilling down into the documentation
quite a lot so you also understand how
the documentation is being read and by
the end of this video you will have the
Google login system done within your
Android app ok now let me explain you
where we are right now because I think
it's a good time to have a little bit
summary we have explored what the
firebase is we have gone through with
the web interface and how the
authentication and database things works
a little bit and we have created our
previous app in which we'd created a
simple login system with the username
and email or email and the password
registration login and logout as well
now we want to perform all these things
but with a Google account sign in so
going to be pretty fun exercise and I
have created one asset for you as well
let me show you where that asset is if I
can find it and there we go so we were
using this asset will look pretty cool
because this is going to the image and
one at the top that says Google sign-in
the simplest easiest login system that
we can design so let us call this
something like fire oops why why is it
making this this is a beta bug so let's
just call this as fire Google in maybe a
random name just like that and obviously
make sure you choose a little bit of a
marshmallow or at least marshmallow you
can choose the previous one as well but
there will be few features in the future
apps that will require at least a
marshmallow so go ahead with that you
can also go with the Android oh but
marshmallow is at least that you should
be targeting minimum SDK let's click on
the next empty activity is perfectly
fine for us click on the finish and
shouldn't be taking much longer this is
quick pretty quick I would say give it a
second to just get it just in itself ok
there we go
and looks good now let me also walk you
through what we have right now let me
click on the overview and this is our
app that we have work worked on the
previous video as well I will be using
the same one but you can create entirely
new project as well and make sure when
you go into the authentication this is
super important and I'll just delete
this guy and the delete account make
sure you go into the sign-in account and
this Google guys should be enabled just
click on this pencil eeping and just
make sure this is enabled and save this
is super important about this nothing at
all will work so make sure you do that
and then you can go to the docs and can
open up the docs and inside the docs go
to get started guide for Android and
inside the authentication now we are
interested in Google sign-in we will be
reading the documentation will be
understanding it as well as we'll be
solving our error so that's how the
thing is gonna work okay I can actually
close these guys and now now make sure
you're also logged in into your Android
studio as well it it is not being shown
but it's the right corner is thing which
you can just point out there okay and I
think that's it now we can connect our
firebase to this and again just I
discussed in the previous video there
are a couple of ways to connect your
firebase app to your Android app and we
will be using the easiest one but in
case in case you want to just download
the JSON app and add some Gradle files
feel free to do so we will be using the
easiest one which is right from the
Android studio tools and click on the
firebase and make sure you're logged in
in your browser and this guy from the
same email otherwise it is not going to
work authentication email and password
up connect to firebase and this step
will be heavily dependent on your
computer speed as well as your internet
speed okay and I'll be looking for you
can also create a new project directly
here but I'll be choosing I'll be
choosing the existing one my epi I don't
know why I came up with this
in but I'm going to use that connect to
the firebase it will download a couple
of steps stuff and we'll update your
Gradle so it takes a little bit of the
time okay it will show you a green dot
when it's done and it shouldn't take
much onto my system but again your
system might be a little bit slower
again no problem we can wait and click
on this add firebase art to your app and
this also needs to be done it will also
sync your Gradle file so again some time
Gradle file syncing takes a lot of time
so be patient we will not be working on
rest of the stuff from this
documentation because this is not for
the Google sign-in for the Google
sign-in it automatically redirect you to
the page okay now let's go to the
documentation and see make sure you when
you are into the authenticate with
firebase there is a this link open that
up into new tab because we will be
leading this guy in a minute okay now
the very first thing that we would like
to have is in our App level Gradle file
just copy and paste this guy and here is
a word of caution which is super super
important this compile copy this go to
your App level Gradle again app level
Gradle okay go into the dependencies and
paste this now when you will be pasting
this don't just think right now because
there is a problem here
notice that the Play service is 11 point
0.1 but the firebase art service is 10
point two point four and this 11.0 point
one will prompt you an error so make
sure that firebase art and the Play
service level are exactly at the same
version so I'll just copy and paste this
guy I think this is a reputation at line
number 13 31 I'll just keep it there and
sync now now this syncing should not
give you any error if this gives you an
error that means we have to tweak out in
the version or maybe you haven't pasted
it in the right file so this needs to be
done smoothly okay once this is done
what I can do is I can open up and bring
up my screen
be that and I'll paste it into my driver
by the way in case you are wondering
what am i doing I'm just ringing my
asset screen one which is available for
everybody even for the commercial
purpose and all the designs and graphics
are being created by me so no problem at
all okay now let's get rid of this hello
world in the content layout I want to
set this as a background I won't be
changing the aspect ratio and all these
should be changing that because
otherwise it will look like a smaller
guy I'm not much worried about the
things here you can see it shrink a
little bit but let's just leave it there
now let's go into the text phase and
we'll be bringing up a sign-in button
let me show you from where I got that if
you'll go here you can see there is a
button no names known as sign-in button
this is not an ordinary button this is a
sign-in button and that has come up from
that greatest file so let's bring this
guy which is a sign-in button
yep it should be wrap content wrap
content we'll just fix that from the
design view and yeah all that looks good
but you know what I can make it a little
bit better with the width saying a match
constraint and I'll be shifting the
constraints here so it looks nice and
good okay well why are you dancing here
come on select that guy okay why why is
it so much of the problem okay and
layout with 0dp nub it should be match
parent okay now should be happy okay
this is what I wanted to do come on you
could have allowed me to do so
we will be adding this guy and we will
be saying this should be 24
we'll be pinning it that from here will
be saying 0 + 8 + 8 maybe a little bit
more 16 + 16 this looks so awesome
now notice the simplicity here just the
screen one tap of a button and you are
logged in so smooth and so simple for at
least for Google devices I highly
recommend this kind of UI so simple so
subtle
you can change this button and could put
up your custom graphics or other things
will not going to match detail of that
now next thing we'll be doing is setting
an ID on to it and let's just have an ID
off ID will call this as Google BTN okay
there we go
one thing is done let's go into the
design and looks looks pretty good now
let's create a couple of variables that
we will be for sure needing first one is
going to be Google sign-in button
sign-in button not Google sign-in button
and we'll be calling it as button okay
let's grab this button from the
interface which is going to be button
going to be equal to type casting that a
sign-in button and we're going to find
that by resource dot ID dot what do we
call it Google BTN there we go okay we
would also be needing one more guy which
is going to be firebase art I'm going to
call this as a moth there we go
okay we would be needing a listener as
well because we want not what is the
listener okay we haven't discussed that
yet now
listener is actually somebody who
actually listens for the change and
which is the firebase or listener now
whenever you change from log in to log
out or log out to log in there is an
activity being changed and firebase
provided us with a method that says
activity listener or authentication
activity listener we can just use it
quite a lot of time and can check out
whether you are logged in or log out so
we will be doing that as well okay
you'll be trying to make sure that this
app is actually placed already almost at
least the sign-in part okay now let's go
here and come back here and now let's
try to apply a few methods here now
first of all okay it's a is a configure
Google sign-in so we do need to
configure Google sign-in okay
so let's just copy this and let's just
paste it okay and we will be pasting
this guy here a lot of errors will be
there we have to actually solve all of
them alt-enter should be solving a lot
for us okay okay this guy is good now
there is a method known as a private
void sign in which we will be having so
let just copy this and you know what we
can actually keep this guy gso guy
inside this on create as well let's just
have this guy okay we will be will be
looking about that in a minute
have an intent okay ought all to enter
okay now the first problem is our C
sign-in now what is this RC sign-in this
is the guy which is kind of a request
code and you have to just have an
integer here so we will be declaring
that at the top and it's going to be
private final static in teacher we can
give it in any access code to one two
three I usually give one for the top
menu bar so I keep it as two completely
your personal preferences now this is
Google API client okay this guy is not
aware of what is API client if I go here
there is no such mention of Google API
client here so again make sure you click
on this link and setup a couple of
things from here as well and the first
guy is Google sign-in option and Google
API client okay
so we need to set these guys okay and
and this is an on create method so will
be just moving this guy into on create
method so copy this guy and inside the
oncreate will have this one and I would
be moving this guy inside as well what
did we copied it to time I think that we
copied it to time we don't need this we
already have that guy so delete that
okay and the second thing is at Google
API client
I just have this copy and paste that may
be done create legacy yep it says it
should be in the oncreate so there we go
documentation are helping us quite a lot
there we go so Google API client we need
to create a variable of M Google API
client first of all so that it should be
happy and available at every method
Google API client M Google API client
there we go now it's happy we can press
alt enter to make it more happier there
ok looks good now fragment activity this
is happy but this is not happy because
it's an on connection failed listener ok
so we need to have a listener here so
let's just get rid of this and let's
just see if we can get a new oops and
this should be Google API client on
connection failed listener I think this
should be the guy yep that is and this
is basically a non connection figure the
listener which is going to manage what
happens when the things fail ok so we're
going to have a toast
in case something falls back so teh
toast dot make text and we cannot write
this here because we're quite deep into
the code and writing this at this point
is not such thing I would like to do so
this and now legendary error which is
frustrating for everybody something went
wrong there we go now let's just make a
toast dot length should be short of
course and dot show there we go
ok no big deal we have fixed up this guy
we have already seen how we can have the
sign-in button and I don't think so we
need anything from here if we will need
anything from here we may come back we
may come back ok now let's go here now
here we need to override a method this
guy so let's just copy and paste this
guy
I wanted to be just below the sign in
activity so that they remain remain
close enough pace that oh my goodness
again so many legs why let's just see
how many we can fix that by alt-enter
yep one gun and import class yep
firebase art with Google I will come
back onto that later on but first I need
to explain what this guy is doing and
that this is actually basically
accessing for the request code are see
sign-in we have declared it at the top
no problem and when if it is resulted
success we are getting a Google account
sign in with the Google account and in
the fallback case else I would like to
have a toast here again toast oh maybe I
can copy something and yep this is I can
copy and I can paste it here and instead
of something went wrong I'll be saying a
auth went wrong something something like
that we can actually fire up another
activity to make sure user is helpful
now one thing that is missing which is a
firebase art with Google I can press alt
and enter this will create a method for
me okay nice and easy so far okay now
also notice that we are having a Google
sign-in account stored in a variable
account and this account will get all
the authentication information that we
require and will be fired up here okay
now let's go and see that we need to
create a firebase a mod I think we have
already created that at the top and
there we go but we haven't created any
instance for that so Emeth should be
having an instance of firebase off let's
do that and I will do that in the
oncreate just below as soon as I get the
button okay won't make any difference at
this point and then now we notice here
that the firebase width method is
actually being given to me which is at
the bottom firebase without but before
that it is also overriding a method
which is on start
now I will come back on this onstart
method in a minute right now let's just
do this guy we don't need luck we need
art so I'll just copy this and he'll try
to fix up the errors okay
so let us go here and paste that
goodness has so many reds alt import
class okay I like it
alt enter okay I like it auto result
okay on complete listener on task yeah
that can be imported logs yep that can
be imported
I can fix these tag because this
requires a string so tag and this is
also needs to be in the string okay
Google sign-in activity alt enter should
not be doing the job okay now notice
that when we get a credential this was
just a minute ago account I don't know
why the changes to the cut I cut
something like that place that should be
happy okay
now on complete listener
Alton enter yeah this fix it this
requires just at this here or main
activity dot this update UI I'll comment
you for a minute I'll come in to you for
a minute because I don't want to update
the UI as of now and Google sign-in
activity this is because this is the
toast
this is the toast we don't need
adjusting like that we can have our own
activity there we go and looks pretty
good and now let's come back and talk
about one more guy which we have
actually skipped we can work on the
design out later on right now let me
just show you one thing that there is an
on stored method that says hey you can
have a user if you're not getting any
user you can actually update your UI or
if you're getting any user you can
actually update your thing now instead
of this I want to show you something
which is much more professional than
this which is a simple guys given to us
by Google which is auth listener auth
statelessness
rather correct what is odd state
listener now odd state listener is the
guy who is responsible to track down as
soon as the authentication state is
being changed from sign in to sign out
or maybe from sign on to sign and so you
don't have to track each and every time
you can just post all that job to the
odd straight listener so we'll be
creating an odd state listener and as
soon as their app starts we'll be firing
up an odd state listener and based on
that we will be writing the code that if
the user is not signed in our user is
signed in let's move into some another
activity if it is not signed in just
keep it there okay something like that
okay a lot of jobs a lot of code but
it's actually easy it's a step by step
process so lets us create an art
listener so this is going to be firebase
auth dot hot state listener and we can
call this mmm oh my M art listener okay
M our listener there we go and now
instead just before the oncreate I can
overwrite a method by pressing ctrl o
this is going to be on start there we go
and now here I can call this a odd state
listener so M up there we go dot add off
state listener and we'll be passing our
listener which is M to listener okay now
as soon as the app is being created we
can fire up the auth state listener
function and can do something here okay
so I would like to do it here and just
at the top okay how we can do that it's
actually fairly simple so let me just
get you there it's actually basically
just a couple of lines of codes but
that's it so let's just say I'm our
listener is going to be new okay
did we did something wrong here I don't
think so it's just firebase art and art
state listener there we go we can just
finish it up by a semicolon there now as
soon as the state or state is being
changed
we are returned the
fire base auth object and we can put a
simple F else check here if firebase
ought and this will only return an
object because firebase earth will only
return an object fill with something
when there is something because the user
should be logged in if the user is not
logged in how can it return something so
we can simply say get current user and
if the user is a not null that means we
have got something we might want to
redirect user from one intent to another
one so but the problem is we don't have
any new activity so let's just create
that right-click app new and I'll choose
an activity from gallery empty activity
is it's fine for me right now I'll call
the first second second one okay it can
be your your full-fledged app being
started from here as well no problem
okay okay constant layout we can add one
more screen object here but I think I'll
just add a background here for a moment
I don't like the plain things here just
like black or light I think something
colorful maybe I'll go to the black yeah
looks looks pretty cool and I'll add a
button maybe at the centre don't pad the
top and this guy should be should be
having a few constraints okay why why
are not allowing me to select that okay
here here here and I think that's it
I'll just push it a little bit down and
I'll be changing the color background
color at least and make it make it a
little bit more reddish just just like
that
okay looks good I'll be changing the
text color if I can find the text color
somewhere there death text color there
we go
and it should be something like light
and the yep I can actually change the
font as well font family
can be monospace and up I don't like my
own space I will have cursive and then I
can change it to text to something like
log me out okay now because it was a bad
choice monospace yeah that's better
actually we can bump the font a little
bit little bit I know this is too much
but hey I love it 20 okay log me how it
looks pretty awesome okay now we can
actually give it an ID of logout there
we go nice and easy just one last thing
I know some of you might be a little bit
frustrated but hey I cannot bear to see
this with just like that I'll have it to
any planning here yeah at least like
that should be looking a little bit
awesome okay now let's go into the main
activity and if there is already a user
who is logged in we might want to
redirect him on to a new activity so
start an activity start activity we will
have a new intent there we go and we
will be redirecting from main oops
main activity dot this to second one dot
class for some reason they call it class
they should maintain this subtlety this
should also be called as class or second
one class resemblance but again Who am I
to complain okay now okay this looks
good okay let's run it up we haven't run
it with app so far strange we haven't
done this in the so far and the course
anytime but we got so busy with the code
okay great I'll finish the row warning
zero error I love it and there we go so
this has crashed no big deal crashing
happens quite a lot let's just open our
logs and 75 and this is something I
think this is a beta bug I have faced
this that is why I know it what you need
to do is just comment this down
entire thing for some for some good
reason I don't know why this happened
but you know what when you do it
something like this you just again write
it for some some bizarre reason you just
write it again and this is happy I don't
know why but you just have to write it
again and it is happy I don't know why
so Google sign-in options will call this
as gso because we have already defined
the GSO there and that is going to be
new Google sign-in options oops not
options like that dot builder and in
this builder we need to pass on a
parameter which is Google sign-in
options dot default sign-in and the next
one would be dot request a ID token
there we go we can just see it at the
bottom and this is going to be get
string and r dot r dot string dot
default web client ID and dot request
email here's of course why not
you can request much more other things I
don't recommend them much because user
can get a little bit freaky
there we go done nothing we have just
commented it out and we have just
written it again and I think for some
bizarre reason they should fix up the
thing I think this is a beta bug will be
fixed up as soon as the things goes on
and see that this is being fixed I think
this is the beta bug and will be fixed
up in the actual third version of the
Android studio maybe for some reason now
let's just sign in with the Google I
have tapped on it
please don't get crash and we forgot one
thing we forgot one thing my bad my bad
you know what what we forgot we have a
method known as sine n but we actually
never triggered it okay really bad when
we can trigger it as soon as the button
is being tapped okay and let's just do
it here so it's going to be simply
button dot set onclicklistener
new and this is going to be view set
onclicklistener
and we're going to just call this
sign in there we go we forgot that that
was a nasty nasty mistake shouldn't be
doing that
okay okay looks good pretty good
let's just hit the sign in and welcome
back to firebase Google login your sign
it and again at this will give you a
pop-up because my device is already
using my email and I actually just did a
test run and all these I make a lot of
app and because of that it gives me and
the notice one interesting thing if I do
hit a logout is that's not going to
anything but if I just stop this app and
run that again and since we have already
signed in it automatically redirects me
to the app because I am signed in it
checks it this is the auth state
listener which just runs as soon as the
app gets started okay but we need to
figure out something to do for the
logout session as well and should be
easy okay let's go there do it one by
one
first of all let's figure out what the
ID is IDs logout good one thing good and
this is a simple button nothing special
about it so we can just call in button
we will be calling it as button and
button is going to be equal to button
this is going to be mu not new not new
find view by ID r dot ID dot you know it
logout there we go okay so now we have
find out the button but as soon as this
activity gets started I want to fire up
an auth state listener here as well okay
so just below the button I need a couple
of variables first of all I need a
firebase firebase auth again I'll be
calling it as a moth I usually call it
I'm up and we need firebase odd state
listener as well so firebase art dot off
state listener M auth listener there we
go
okay now we need to override a method to
check it as soon as this activity gets
started we need to override that so
control oh and this is going to be on
start there we go and we're going to
call em auth dot add up state listener
I'm at listener okay there we go okay so
one thing is done now we're going to set
an onclicklistener on this guy so let's
just do that how we can do that freezing
button that set onclicklistener
new view dot set onclicklistener as soon
as this is being done the signup code is
just one line in case you didn't notice
that on that this guy which says
firebase aunt dot get instance sign out
and you know what we can just short it a
little bit little bit and this is the
usual practice I follow that whenever
there is an art guy I just say simply
something like this M art which am art
and I usually get an instance of
firebase art usually in my in my
oncreate function which is something
like this
firebase art dot get instance so I keep
it always so whenever I need an instance
I can just use a moth available so what
makes it in this case happier it just
says mr dot sign out that's it you can
write the entire line as well firebase
or dot get instance got get sign out as
well no problem at all that will also
work okay now this is going to sign out
but will not do anything okay that will
happen when next time you will run the
app but I want to have a same method
here exactly same thing what we have
done here which is let me show you this
is a moth listener firebase artlessness
I want to do something here whenever the
state get changed so let's just fire up
hot state listener okay there we go
and that we can actually copy or paste I
think we should write it okay
em our listener is going to be equal to
new em okay I need to check it out
firebase art sometime I forget firebase
art listener there we go okay
previously notice one thing here
previously we were checking if firebase
gives us a user not null we'll be doing
something but in this case we'll be
doing something different because this
time we are expecting yeah get me that
we are expecting that we will get null
so we will be checking it equal equal
null because as soon as the user has got
a sign out then he should not return me
anything get current user will return
null okay and we would be redirecting it
from second one dot this to main
activity okay sounds good why this is
the red line I think there we go should
be should be happy now and this is a
full-fledged industry ready login and
logout system okay let's run this app
should be your director directly to
black screen log me out there we go now
if we go back see nothing foolproof stop
that run that again we should not be
redirected to the black screen we should
get a front screen this time sign-in
