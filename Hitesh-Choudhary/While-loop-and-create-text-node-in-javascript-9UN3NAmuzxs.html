code online and welcome back again to
JavaScript so yes I know that we have
created her index file our CSS file
that's looking pretty awesome and
amazing and if I go back this is all we
have and I yes I am also aware that I
promised you that in this video we're
gonna go ahead and work on it and just
by the way in case you notice I actually
have copied and pasted these alike a
couple of times to show you some stuff
in here and this doesn't really affect
much it says record YouTube videos and
number of times so really easy peasy
stuff just copy and paste this Li like
two or three times and that's it that's
we are looking good for okay now yes I
promised you to write the to do Jes but
I will not be doing in this video we'll
be doing that in the upcoming video yes
of course the next one first and
foremost I want to talk about two
subject which I didn't cover it up a
previously in our series but right now
is the perfect time because we are about
to use them so the two things are first
of all is create text node so far we
have learned about the create element
and then the putting up some text
concept content inside it and then
putting that using a pen child that's
completely fine but there is also an
element called create text node that we
can use so let me first talk about that
okay so for example we have a variable
we are gonna call this H because I want
to create an element h1 so I think this
H is pretty good name for h1 how I can
create that it's pretty simple document
dot create element there we go and what
element I want to create yes of course
h1 so my element is created now I want
to insert some text inside this h1 of
course a blanket one doesn't really make
sense so I want to insert some value
inside it so I'm gonna save or and I'm
gonna call this as my my value and that
is gonna be equal to so how we are going
to insert some value inside this h1 tag
previously we have seen the thing which
says that content work absolutely fine
but there is another way of adding it
which is document dot create text node
and this is so common that in case you
will be wandering around Stack Overflow
you will be seeing this plethora of time
so that's why I really wanted to cover
it so create X
how does it work you just enter your
text inside it probably a simple hello
world just like that if I can write the
world correct hello world now what we
have done we have created an end node
here with element which is h1 and inside
that h1 we have actually created a text
node which is h1 so basically if you'll
ask me technically what we have done so
far is h1 and then h1 this is being
created and now I have written hello
world if I can write it correct come on
hello world and there we go so this is
what we have done also we have cut that
down onto the clipboard we haven't
pasted it anywhere on our index file so
what we need to do ok now first and
foremost you might be thinking that yes
we have done this but actually there is
one more step it is there now right now
what is happening we do have our h1 tag
and somewhere we have this hello world
we need to put this hello world inside
this h1 ok this is exactly the situation
so how I can put this h1 this hello
world inside that it's really simple you
select your element and then you use
appendchild and what is the child that
you want to insert in this h1 is simply
my value ok I hope that is clear now it
is cut and on my clipboard I want to
paste it on a web page that is really
simple we're gonna use document dot
query selector and I want to insert it
just below the h1 notice my h1 is just
here the big one my awesome to do I want
to append it just right there and I can
use append child and then I can simply
append this element which is H call it
anything whatever you like so there we
go as soon as I save this we will be
able to see a big hello world there we
don't want it so we're gonna just remove
that that was simply done to make sure
that you understand that yes we will be
using this create takes note quite a lot
in fact in this application ok now one
more thing that we'll be using in this
application is gonna be a loop yes we
have talked about a lot of loops but not
this one remember the syntax of F we
have a condition and then we execute the
statement and what is this new loop now
once you convert if into this while
there
that said you got your Valu the only
thing is yes we write our condition in
it that boils down to true or false now
the only thing is until unless this
condition is going to be true it's gonna
keep repeating that loop and this is
exactly what we'll be using so just for
a quick demo let's just have a VAR I
should be using let but let's say and
we're gonna have a value and this value
is probably five let's just say so we
wanted to use the while loop just type
well and amazing awesome this vs code
just hit enter it's gonna fill all the
things for you and we're gonna put up a
condition that run this loop till this
value is greater than zero maybe and we
simply want to log the values off simply
well now if you're gonna run this loop
just like that it's gonna create a
massacre because no nothing is actually
changing the value and it's gonna keep
on running so we need to decrease the
value as well we're gonna use the
shorthand notation well - - which is
also equal to well minus one so it's
quite a lot of lines to write so I'm
gonna keep a shortcut well - - okay now
once I save this I have learned how we
can run eval a simply while loop I can
figure it out by inspect and going into
console and there we go five four three
two one pretty awesome
pretty amazing okay so now that you have
knowledge of how while loop work and
also how create node work in the next
video we can work on writing the exact
to do application that our application
requires in here for this index file so
that's it for this video and let's catch
up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
