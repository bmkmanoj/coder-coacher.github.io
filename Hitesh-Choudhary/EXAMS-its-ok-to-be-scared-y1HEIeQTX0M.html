with another video in this video I want
to talk about exams so yes it's the time
when exams are near and almost many of
you are in your school or high school
who are about to appear in some kind of
exams and I know
you are scared of exam and I'm not here
to tell you that don't be scared of
exams you you are already scared of
exams and it's okay to be scared of
exams they are scary we all know it and
I have also faced the same situations of
being scared for the exams and having
all those thoughts in mind that exams
cannot decide my future maybe I should
drop out maybe I should not appear in
exam and all these things these thoughts
are common but today I want to share one
incident with you of my life of my
school time when I was hell out of
scared of one exam so let me walk you
through with this incident and probably
it's going to help you with your exams
also now when I was in the school I'll
be honest with you I was little bit
bright kid not the among the top one or
two but still decently bright I used to
score out of hundred like more than 90s
or 95 in my maths in my science even in
history and geography
I love these subject absolutely and we
had subjects like Hindi and sunscreen as
well Hindi it was amazing I was really
good in it but sunscreen was the subject
which was pulling me down on one hand I
was scoring like more than 90 or 95 in
maths and science on the other hand it
was sunscreen where I was barely getting
passed I still remember one time when in
one of the exams I got just 42 marks and
40 was the passing marks so I honestly
know that somewhere in my heart I know
it that teacher gave me those extra two
marks just to let me pass because I knew
inside myself
that I don't deserve those 42 marks I
was pretty sure that I'm going to get
fail in that and I was really mad in
that and it was something about me or
maybe the teacher
I couldn't just couldn't get clicked
with that one particular subject in all
of the other subject I was performing
really well my home assignment was
absolutely amazing but when that time
slot came about for Sanskrit I was
really bad in it I couldn't just do it I
was honestly really bad in that so
everything just was working just fine I
was just getting passed in all of the
exams and final exams came out just
about this time of the month just almost
when the March was about getting started
so all of the exams were going really
good and then it came as Sanskrit and I
knew honestly that I am about to get
fail in Sanskrit and all the thoughts
that you are having in your mind also
came to my mind that I shouldn't go for
exams exams are really bad education
system is really bad and these exams
cannot determine my future maybe I
should drop out so all these thoughts
came in my mind but when I checked
reality because nobody can fool you you
inside you knows all that reality and I
knew it I'm saying all of this because
I'm not performing well in just one
subject so these thoughts are all result
of this so I decided that hey I am
already going to get fail so let me try
one more thing because I'm kind of a
person who doesn't just give up at least
not without giving the best shot so I
thought hey we are getting fail in this
so there is no option so let's just give
a last try and it should be the most
perfect try so that at least to myself I
can say that hey I tried my best so I
decided that hey it's just between me
and the Sun script so I took out all of
the papers because in order to take any
battle you need two things and these two
things are important the first one is
correct strategy and the second one is
extreme hard work so I knew it already I
started a strategy
and I picked up all the previous papers
and we used to get asked like twelve or
fourteen questions in exam I picked up
all the chapters and all the previous
papers and made a well educated guess of
just too many questions I picked up a
fresh notebook I just bought it and I
decided that these two any questions
that said these are gonna be my
lifesaver or my life taker so I decided
that I'm gonna be writing every question
n times in that notebook and within just
two days I just filled that notebook
completely by writing again and again
and again all these 20 questions and
then I went to my dad my dad was totally
aware of the situation that how scared I
am of son script I am performing really
well in maths and science coding 90s but
Sanskrit is something I'm gonna get down
and I I just told my dad that hey you
know about the Sanskrit situation and I
said yes I am aware of it and I said you
know what situation is much worse than
it was previously and probably I might
get fail in Sanskrit but I just want to
show you this notebook that I've worked
really hard with that and I explained
him all the situation that I picked up
these questions these are all well
educated guess I worked really hard with
it but that's it that's the best I can
do I cannot understand that but instead
of blaming anything I have just
memorized these questions now it's all
luck or Handy's this is the situation
and my dad say that you have given your
best and here's the proof you have
filled up entire notebook with these
practices and I was like this is the
best I can do I honestly I can do this
this and my dad said okay whatever
happens just tell me and next day I went
for an exam and by seeing the Croatian
paper I was amazed eight e percent of
that exam came from all the questions
that I memorized kind of a memorize I
will not say I practice or studies they
I wrote them so many time that they
became into my muscle memory so picking
up a pen was just like picking up a
torpedo and just flushing all the
answers on to the answer sheet so
we were given like two and a half hour
to finish all these questions I finished
them in one and a half hour because I
was not using my brain
it was just memorized I just noted down
and that's it and to be honest I didn't
even look for the rest of the questions
because that's it
I just wanted to get past and I knew
that 80% of the questions so I was
really happy with that when I came out
of the exam my dad saw my smile on my
face and says looks like things got
really good and I said good it was
amazing and I went back to home I
calculated how much marks I'm going to
get in this paper I calculated again and
again and again till I got my result
back and to my surprise I out of 80 I
got like around 78 and this is the only
paper
I know exact marks because this incident
is so close to me I got 78 marks for me
paper was not of hundred marks it was
just 80 marks because that's what I knew
and I scored out of that 78 marks and in
fact I scored a little bit lower in my
history I usually score better than that
but I scored a little bit less I was not
worried about any other subject not
maths not science but only one that
subject because this was kind of one and
the experience that you get here I was
really happy when me and my dad went to
the class teacher to collect our result
she said you really performed really
well in Sanskrit this time did you got
some tuitions and all something I said
no I just took your advice in my last
examination sheet you wrote you can do
better work harder and I took your
advice it was never about getting good
marks or something and what I learned
from this incident is that yes it's it's
rather easier to blame the system or
maybe just to get worried about exams or
scared about exams but what I learned
from this incident is nothing is hard
all you need is a good strategy and
extreme hard work to just kill anything
and you can do anything in life with
that and eventually I realize that it's
not about getting the marks it was the
process that I enjoyed more
then those exams the process of writing
all those questions again and again
working really hard for it this whole
procedure made me realize that yes
things are hard in life and but they can
be conquered I see many people in life
who says you know what I'm not designed
for programming I'm not able to install
Android studio so I am leaving the
Android development I'm not able to
understand the optional values and swear
so I'm leaving the iOS development and
when I just see those people and I just
see myself yeah I can understand I was
at that situation once but luckily that
situation arrived to me at a very very
early school stage but you haven't faced
this kind of situation so that's why you
are giving up but I'm kind of a designed
in such ways or programmed in such a way
I'm not made to give up I don't give up
easily I always like to try one more
time the best shot that I can ever give
whether that's YouTube stuff or a
program or an app that I'm making or a
client work or maybe learning a new
framework
it's never easy it will never be easy it
was never made to be easy but all I
really want to say that yes exams don't
really matter and in fact exam cannot
determine cannot determine what is going
to be your feature but what is going to
determine your feature is how much you
are determined to take down that
challenge and give it your best shot
not just board exams there will be a lot
of exams in your life and they will all
they are all going to be tough and I'm
not saying that eventually it will get
better it will only get worse but the
only thing that you can learn right now
is to give your best shot so without
worrying about anything go ahead take
down that challenge and just give the
best possible shot that you can give and
just leave the rest of the things they
are not in your hand the only thing that
is in your hand is trying harder that's
