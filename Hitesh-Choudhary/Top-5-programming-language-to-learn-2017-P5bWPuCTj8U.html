another video in this video we are going
to discuss about the top 5 programming
language that you should be looking up
to learn in 2017
now these languages are not just
randomly being picked up these are
picked up with very precision that what
is the popularity right now in the
market what kind of project going on in
the market what kind of jobs are being
posted as well as the amount of money
that you can earn with these languages
so with this super-awesome video let's
get started about top by programming
language that you should be learning in
2017 in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps and
everything related to technology in here
so in case you are new here consider
subscribing now let's come back on to
the topic and discuss about the top 5
programming language that you should be
looking up to learn now I have focused
quite a lot on the bigness because I
think a lot of bigness might be watching
this video and they might be a little
bit confused about where they can go up
so starting with number 5 lets you start
it with our list and at number 5 I have
placed PHP now you might be wondering
and a lot of you might be judging my
scenario or pick up things that why you
have picked up the PHP since there are a
lot of new advanced technologies like
angular 2 no GS and in fact I work on
them quite a lot but still I would say
learning PHP is a great idea now why I
would tell you that now I work quite a
lot on websites like freelancer upward
and some line based project as well
now many time I faced this difficulty
that client wants an e-commerce website
within $1,000 now designing an entire
website in anything work like no GS or
angular is not at all possible is it
within the thousand dollar range and of
course client need that website within
three days or four days it's not at all
possible so of this choice would be to
go into some framework like WordPress
which is of course being back-end by the
PHP so what all I have to do is install
WordPress and add some plugins and of
course if I know PHP I can customize
those plugins and kendal
the product to the client now a lot of
web companies are there who are
completely reliable on these kinds of
project based websites like freelancers
and upwork and all they are looking up
is the person who knows PHP quite well
now once you understand the PHP then
it's quite easy to jump around on other
frameworks like WordPress or Magento or
others as well so still I would say and
you all know that WordPress is actually
a big part of the Internet which is
being governed by the WordPress so of
course if that much part is being
overtaken by the WordPress people need
developers who can code in WordPress and
can code in basically in PHP I would say
you can earn quite a lot of money and
it's pretty easy to pick up because it's
a bad based language and of course the
prerequisites are you should be aware of
HTML and CSS and then you can jump on
the PHP now coming up on to the list
number four I have placed Java in here
now I personally have I don't have much
of the love towards the Java but still
it doesn't mean I don't like the
language it's not popular it's the most
popular language around him here now why
the one of the main reason why Java is
so much popular is because of Android
development now Android development is
pretty fairly cheap you only need $30
for a lifetime access license and you
can publish n number of apps on there in
case you want to get started with
Android development there is no other
way you have to get started with Java
now not only the Android a lot of web
apps can be designed in the Java are
still a lot of companies are relying on
their back-end services for Java as well
so with Java you cannot go wrong but
again I would say the learning curve is
quite a lot with the Java and one thing
that I personally don't like about the
Java is you have to write a ton of code
whenever you declare a class or may be
declared available there is a lot of
code that you have to write and that is
the reason I don't like it but with a
good editor you can actually automate
those stuff and I would say if you are
getting started with Java there is a
good chances that you can pick up on
other languages as well you will always
feel that all other languages are pretty
much easy because I know
Java so that's why I would say on the
list number force our Java is being
placed on list number three I would put
Swift here
no Objective C of course fit Swift is d
market demand in here and I would say if
you're getting started with the Swift
you are making a very good move now
Swift is not at all that much mature
language but don't let me judge you
about that it is not a mature language
it is being backand by the apples and
right now all the apps that you are
using in your iPads in your iPhone or
maybe our TV apps are actually being run
at the back end by the Swift now as the
day progress at language is pretty new
there is no such person who can say I
have ten years of experience in fifth
now he cannot say that because language
is pretty new it's the perfect time to
get started in fifth now in case you are
looking up to get started for the Swift
and of course you are planning to make
some ioss I have a killer online code
check out in the description I'll link
it below with a special coupon code and
you will love this will make a lot of
apps and you will love the syntax of the
Swift now one good reason I like about
the Swift is somehow it is very much
inspired by Python no semicolons a very
compact code much more meaningful
precise code that you have to write that
is why I would put on my list number
three is fit at position number two I
would say Python and I would say that
Python is just making a comeback in here
now in the last couple of years Python
was getting a drawback of course a lot
of fans were there of Django slask and
other things like I'm making scripts for
pen testing or ethical hacking they like
to code in Python but Python was somehow
lagging behind but of course with the
recent enhancement in machine learning
data science and the AI the artificial
intelligence e Python has pegged up the
things and Python is in the game and I
would say it right now it's currently
the most popular language and it was a
very tough choice for me to judge
between language in position number one
and position number two so I would say
as position two goes to
bitin now in case you are getting
started with bison you might be little
bit confused that I should get started
with pipe in two or maybe five and three
no confusion at all get started with
Python three bison 2 is now completely
outdated yes you might say that hey
there are a couple of libraries that are
not yet developed in Python 3 and I
might want to go there don't worry there
is a complete work around for that
library I will pretty assure you that I
code quite a lot in vitam and I would
say go get started with item 3 in case
you want to get started I again have a
killer online course for Python 3 I'll
link down that in the description below
and you can obviously jump in to that of
course that car that code comes up with
a 30 days money back guarantee so in
case you don't like it you can always
get a refund there and I would say if
your plan are something related to
artificial intelligence ii or the new
hot topic is machine learning then of
course there is no get around you need
to get started with Python by the way on
to a sidebar I would say a machine
learning can also be done in our
language but I would say with the are
you will be very specific very confined
because it's not that much popular
around here I would say go ahead and get
started with Python that would be a much
better choice now on to the list number
one again this is no surprise at all
I'll place JavaScript in here not just
the JavaScript the latest syntax
including es6
so javascript is the most hot topic
around him here now as soon as the
JavaScript got involved in the backend
technology like nodejs it has just
revolutionized everything now imagine
one language for everything that is why
I have kept it on the place number one
like you write your front end of the
website in JavaScript you write your
back-end in the JavaScript in case you
are aware with the technologies like
angular 2 or maybe react native or
react.js you just write one language to
interact with the database to interact
with the front-end to produce iOS native
apps to produce Android native apps what
else you can define from this language
JavaScript is doing a lot what it was
originally
design for so I would say if you want to
get started and you are looking around
that hey what would be your choice if
you want to just get started I would say
you cannot go wrong with JavaScript and
I would also say in here that if you
want to get started with GES don't just
stuck with GF syntax in here because now
the technology is quite frankly
switching to es6 version which is just
the latest version and latest syntax of
JavaScript so go ahead learn that too
now a lot of people will say hey es6 is
going on javascript is going on but what
are you reuse about typescript now again
I would say if you are comfort
comfortable with JavaScript type script
is just a superset of JavaScript so
entirely JavaScript and this is your
type scripts so some new features are
being added to the JavaScript and there
you go you have got your type script so
I would say Java scripts no matter what
you do you can switch on to react you
can switch to angular you can switch to
no GS you can switch to backbone.js just
infinite names are there so these are my
top five list about getting started in
programming and I have give you some
little bit ideas where you can switch
onto the technologies where you can look
up for the jobs and what kind of
products you will be making up with each
particular language now let me know in
the comments section below if you agree
with the list or you have some other
list going on around in your mind I
would definitely like to discuss it
video now in case you like this video
give it a thumbs up and in case you
think that this video can be helpful for
someone make sure you share it around
and I'll catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
