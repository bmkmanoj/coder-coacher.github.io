bit while and a little bit late like
five minutes I told you that I'll be
liable in at three o'clock but you know
things are changing and some people are
not allowing me to do my work like
government and what can I say yes the
internet connection is being banned here
due to some riots going on you know
religious thing that my god is superior
your God is not or something like that
all these BS is going on but yes still
I'm trying my best to release out of the
things but you know these internet
issues really makes a problem when the
internet is blocked up and I can feel
the pain what is happening in the
Kashmir and everything and this made iOS
app release a little bit delayed not
much I think we are going to ruin it by
Venice day at the most but is it
released and it delayed the rollout of
iOS app sorry about that government
should also be sorted for that but yes
I'm trying my best so yes people are
showing up and the likes are also coming
up that means you are really happy about
these Sunday life and yes this is a new
decoration of the Aust

beneath okay creative je sir which bank
do you use SBI is versed cannot share my
banking details with you but I don't
have any problem with even the SBI HDFC
and couple of other accounts that we do
have in our family no problem at all so
far sir there are some videos are
missing from bootstrap tutorial Thank
You bhavish for notifying me that I'll
shortly look out for that definitely
it's going to be there I will shortly
look up for that Naveen say is Naveen
Khanna say is it good to sign bond in a
company you are not allowed actually you
are not required to sign a bond that
much often but usually company do
require you to sign an agreement that we
are investing so much in you your
training your stay and everything so at
least you have to stay in the company
for one year or so so that's a good
thing for companies but according to the
government regulations you cannot
actually fix anybody to hold up for so
much long but yes if company is
investing you like in training and
providing your laptops and providing you
stays and everything on doing something
for you one year bond is actually kind
of a normal thing how to get expert at
Python learn Python first of all basic
syntax then try out a couple of TK inter
libraries like you that GUI GUI whatever
you call that a couple of them first of
all then try to actually master there is
one very beautiful library in the
fighter known as beautiful soup try out
that it's an amazing library okay let's
pick up another question from pretty
girl sir my college is offering an
internship and Android development in
Malaysia should I go for it or not if
college is sponsoring you for going to
the Malaysia I would say take it up take
it up don't be hesitate but do remind
you that internship are not for learning
learning is in the training internship
you do actually work on to a project and
there won't be any health there won't be
much of the things going on like that so
make sure you're aware of how the
Android development works what are you
doing tell me something new new is iOS
app and a couple of good courses that
are coming up that's something new so we
are moving totally on to an
international scale with these apps and
you'll be able to play weird inviting
more people from United States Australia
New Zealand a lot of people are joining
up from Nepal Pakistan a lot of other
countries Jordan Egypt Spain so yes
that's new thing honey pitch sir hi
digital Rishi
that's nice name digital Rishi green
algae from where you came up with that
name you are looking very handsome thank
you so much you're looking great too
hey hey hey hey hey are we calls I just
need my reveal hi legend oh geez I'm
learning Python that's great great
choice there go ahead get started keep
on learning how to get join as an
Android developer I have seen some
interview tips interviews and everything
comes up next once you have actually
established yourself with some kind of
apps that are doing good in the market
at least I just say $1,000 for $5,000
then you can say to anybody that hey my
app is doing good hire me so I won't ask
anything today okay I do understand that
sometimes you just want to hang around
that's okay I couldn't then okay that's
okay
I did the hello how about two you are at
there which programming language should
I learn first before learning pattern
languages no need to do any kind of dig
up just directly jump into Python that's
it
Adobe XD yes that's an interesting topic
we're gonna cover that up in the video
okay hello hello hello everybody hello
Chirag get Naish mamma
hey there shake her mouth is it good to
learn data structure from Java
let's do
this one is important now what is data
structure data structure is a way of how
you arrange your data how you retrieve
your data how you put your data like
push and pop and like all the kind of
sort things that you see this is all
data structure
it doesn't require any kind of language
it does require you to have and learn
the concept itself it's not about C it's
not about C++ it's not about Java or
Python or anything it's a cool concept
itself and that concept you have to
apply through a language okay it can be
any language at all it's how you
structure or how you put up your data in
a string or maybe in the data base it's
all about structure so data structure is
an amazing thing you should learn learn
it but it's not language dependent thing
okay I hope I was clear there Ravikumar
hey AJ hey chog love from Jame love from
Jenny I just love to see people from
different states different country are
joining up together we are building up a
community so nice that we are helping
out each other asking important
questions so that other people can also
get a good answer for them I just love
this community hi i'm mohammed dream a
big fan thank you so much I just love
you
Nitish Kumar which is best showered
Kotlin there's no such thing as best and
worst it's all depends on what kind of
need you're sitting what environment
you're comfortable both are great both
are amazing hi Manoj hi Raghuveer hi
Devesh my industry use Spring Framework
I have absolutely no idea why the people
use Spring Framework and not involved in
that much in the java technologies yes I
do work in Java and Android because
Android is in the market demand so
that's why I have to work on the Android
there is no option for me and I have to
work on Java apart from that I usually
don't take Springs and hibernates and
all these things I usually go with the
open source things like PHP or maybe no
genius
something like that so I prefer that
domain okay so hello how do you develop
the net iOS app usually with the Swift
or with the react.js both are the great
options there is a new option known as
xamarin as well an ionic as well there
are a lot of things that you can do but
usually I prefer Swift and a JC's habit
of the plain the iOS app yes I have two
other many apps for the clients I cannot
upload them on my personal account but
my on my personal account the learn code
online app is coming up networking scope
amazing scope go ahead don't think much
about it I think you don't like
programming and that much stuff that's
okay you can go in the networking it's
amazing field how's the weather sir it's
okay not amazingly pleasure whether it's
a little bit hot here I don't like hot
weathers much often I like the cool
things maybe I'll move back to Swiss I
like the cool weathers how to create a
new language you have to learn the
modern compiler I do remember a book
that I learned in that I studied in my
Master's I can refer you that later on
through which you can actually learn the
language syntax language structures and
not semantics and everything you can
create that but it requires a lot of
efforts okay so darshan says react
native versus cordova react native i'll
go with the react native hi Paige hi
Ovid hood Souter I'm sorry for
butchering your name
Android update Android update is nobody
there I have launched update in the Y
great he shared most of the time it
looks cool doesn't it I like it it looks
cool
so simple not have to think too much
about it so it's good Android studio is
not working on my laptop please help I
cannot help you remotely with that
because I don't know what
the configuration of your laptop and
have you installed it properly or not is
Java is already installed in a system or
not what version of Android studio you
are looking up or working on that I
would say go ahead install Java first
enable your virtualization in the BIOS
mode then install Android to point
something version first and then go with
the three version it installs a lot of
libraries I need screen cast option in
it a new app update okay that's
interesting thought screencast so that
you can watch it on TV or something
interesting interesting I will surely
thought think about it and I'll
definitely definitely even help you
there discussion section in pentesting
yes James George I have already replied

okay hey what is the laptop under 25 and
the 35k yes actually that video is
almost ready that is being shot up today
laptop under 50 K and under 25 K and
different choices that I have made for
you I think if internet will be stable
that video will be uploaded by tomorrow
there is some editing and stuff going on
with that video and due to some internet
issues that was delayed that was meant
to be published on Saturday but internet
went crazy
today is Sunday so not much work is
being done on Sunday in fact it's a lazy
Sunday I don't work much on Sundays so
definitely tomorrow it's gonna come up
okay which is best college for CS in
India anyone go with anyone you have to
learn it on your own how can I get
started with freelancing
I just need actually I wanted to talk
about freelance sake but I was got
little bit busy with these things you
know you are seeing it bad after that I

well
okay which language is best for creating
OS that's a question payable P not a
good person to answer learn I think your
background is good thank you so much for
opinion up in there I love that opinion
but Lavi says is dotnet going to be
obsolete no I don't think so it's gonna
stay in the market for long but it's not
me who is working quite a lot in dotnet
from the starting days I did learn it
for a couple of months didn't liked it
at all because it's so much bounded with
a network via the Microsoft thing I
don't like too much of the foundation I
like my own freedom while designing
something or creating something for the
client or myself so that's why I don't
like dotnet I don't even recommend to
people to go into the dotnet I say that
go into PHP or nodejs or react.js or
angular I prefer those technologies and
I recommend those technologies as well
speak slow please I will try my best I
will try my best to speak in a very slow
mood sorry about that sir can you please
suggest a good laptop for programming
below 40k yes that video is coming up
but late for today tomorrow is the
upload will be done because I have some
editing works left for that video you
know some color correction and stuff
making these audio crispy or more
awesome so that it's awesome to watch

that new awesome decoration in your new
office thank you so much thank you so

please sure sure
this is gonna come up okay
congratulation for 71k did we hit 71
already I just looked up it was 70
yesterday I think so but we are moving
at a very fast rate thank you so much
sub skill is important than coding
skills no not at all not at all soft
skills does require a little bit of the
times to crack up a few interviews but I
would say that coding skills are at the
top even some people I have seen who
stutter started a little bit or maybe
their speaking skills are not even up to
mark in a day to day life talking and
they are doing pretty good in
programming and stuff which mic you are
using suggest me and lapel mic probably
I can do a lot of videos and mic because
I do have a lot of mics going on around
you can see there is one this is broke
it no okay this is the one that I have
here I do have another mic here which I
can show to you this is amazing mic road
I do have a lot of mics some boom mics
sitting at the top and some of the mics
some of the mics are lapel I'll
definitely suggest you I'll make a
separate video and microphones that I
use I have a lot of stuff going on here
big data is related to Python or not I
just need our language a big date I can
go up with both languages it can go with
the Python or it can go with the R as
well if you are already aware with the
Python no need to learn are but R is
also a good language okay what is the
number in bank total price enough to
live a happy life but it's not a big
amount being going on at my bank
yes it's decent it's decent I can make a
few travel around the globe can afford a
Harley Davidson that's all I can say
ends my nonsense stop going on every
single week or month I purchase in year
stuff so yes
Bangalore Meetup MCB tag yes I am
coming to Bangalore maybe in next week
or next to next week it's it's confirmed
it's confirmed that I have to go to
Bangalore
so definitely I'll let you know in which
hotel I'm staying so that you can post
on my Facebook and we can fix up some
coffee time or something like that so
yes definitely I am coming to Bangalore
very soon okay your website says watches
again not watch it again yeah I'm aware
of that a couple of students posted a
screenshot and reported to me on mail I
will update that probably today or
tomorrow you know it's Sunday it's lazy
Sunday so definitely please make
tutorials on CSS grid that are already
being made on to a separate CSS course
but I haven't imported that course into
learned code online I'll do that very
soon okay please say Hindi why are you
typing it in English you should be
typing that into Dave Nagori script we
are talking about India or you should be
writing that in Tamil that's the oldest
language I believe all you should be
writing in Sanskrit your website says oh
come on I am aware of that come on leave
that a little bit stuff you know little
bit fat finger type of okay scikit-learn
the best way to get started with machine
learning yes like it is an amazing way
to get started machine learning but I
think the first step is bitin Sunday is
exciting only because of you thank you
so much I am very soon trying to fix a
particular time slot for Sunday's no
matter what happens it's gonna be that
time but after I release all the apps
and do regular stuff I will fix up the
time to make Sunday even more awesome so
that more people can join up thank you
so much for that okay which is best
stack mean or Jango okay you need my
advice or my opinion on that I would go
for me because all these things it comes
with a Mongo and angular
I prefer with that not with the Jango
not because Jango is bad it's amazing
but somehow I prefer main stack okay how
to get a job in Google or at least
some Indian for shaking the latest bra
products saw us last Sunday feed yes I
am involved with a couple of projects
going on at Google I was previously
involved in a couple of projects going
on at Facebook I did had some early
updates and products in fact I am
recording a few videos for the latest
product that is Google that Google is
about to launch in September I think I
cannot reveal the place where it's going
to be it's going to be the United States
for sure but I am recording more videos
for that and as soon as the product is
launched being launched I will roll out
those videos on my channel you have to
be a little bit good in programming and
you have to launch a lot of products in
the market you have to show a presence
in the market that yes I am here then
only these collaborations and NDA just
goes like that can I discuss more about
these NDA's otherwise maybe Google may
get mad at me and have not been thrown
such programming products to me but yes
it's amazing products it's little bit
buggy still a lot of bugs are there you
won't even imagine how many bugs are
being reported every single day on the
group that I am involved in but yes
these videos will come up very soon
which book would you recommend for
students to read which will inspire us
to enter into programming do you even
need books after watching this channel I
thought I have done a pretty good job in
inspiring a lot of people for
programming I don't think so you need a
book you are already inspired for that
but I will definitely look out for such
books definitely okay start from Android
or HTML CSS JavaScript I think I think I
mean now you should start with HTML CSS
in JavaScript a lot of people directly
start with the Android there is no harm
in that but I think you will do much
better in arranging the elements
designing your app very nicely if you
have knowledge of HTML CSS and
JavaScript it is not directly involved
and associated but yes somehow it is
associated legend oh it all just says
I'm learning Python hey good for you
okay a lot of repeated questions are
coming up
see step answered my questions please
should I start with Android development
how much money in it hi Akash actually
everything has the money even the basic
HTML CSS people can earn money it all
depends how much efforts you are putting
how much portfolio you are making what
are the resources that you are utilizing
what are the contacts you have how much
you are spending your time on the
websites like freelancing fibre up work
and all these things it's a very
subjective question because I have seen
people who have Android skills and are
just earning let's just say 25,000 or
30,000 Indian rupees and some people
with the same skill utilizing more
contacts and doing more hard work
earning even like 80,000 or 90,000 per
month as well so there is money in
everything even in networking and you
just name it there is money in
everything how to make a single page
parallax effect website and where from
where to learn it I have already talked
about the parallax website and affected
my course at front-end complete
front-end developer course have a look
on it at learned code online Totten okay
so can I have a contact number I would
prefer a Facebook page or maybe an email
chat not on the phone I'm working with
ionic a little confused yeah I think
it's little bit confused confusing thing
but it's awesome you will enjoy that
what is the best and easy alternative
for sketch for UI in Windows I think
there is a software with let me just
have a look it's the affinity software I
think they call it designer affinity a
designer affinity designer is available
for Mac and Windows
it's kind of an alternative for
Photoshop not for sketch but it's
amazingly cheap very very less price and
it's amazingly awesome so you can try
out that ok where can I learn Cortland
sir you can learn Cortland at learned
code online dot in so how you maintain
your time its stuff it's becoming much
more tougher for me I am
be good in managing time and everything
usually but the recent thing that I've
started in Android and Google NDA's and
Facebook stuff and lot of stuff it has
become a little bit tough for me to even
for me for managing time and everything
no js' versus Java which is good for
starting a career uh depends on which
state and which country you're looking
at for usually in India it's kind of a
big scope for Java but international
companies I'm more looking for the
people in nodejs more over there okay
okay
Jango versus Java Web Apps Jango I
somehow always avoid Java
I know JavaScript and koja why should I
start react native or native app map
making yes if you are aware with the
JavaScript go ahead get started with
react and then react native okay so
people give it a thumbs up it's time to
show some love let's look up four more
questions okay there is a question from
somebody who I know so I want to learn
wireless hacking from you I will come to
your state and I'll teach you personally
there yeah it's actually my brother
suction he is an M debuff right now and
very soon I'll be there in and about and
probably probably I'll post up a meet-up
there may be so definitely it's gonna
come up best for okay where did that go
can i US developer get skills are Hadoop
scrum master ok where did that question
yourself where it's literally getting
impossible to see the questions had just
keep going on like that ok is there
scope of hybrid apps in future is hybrid
app can detect question goes is hybrid
app can able make apps like Android some
companies do work on hybrid apps it's
not like it's completely bad the
performance is little bit in issue in a
hybrid app but it's not like that it's
completely crap but I won't recommend
you to go and get started in hybrid app
I would rather recommend to
in the react native okay what about
react gs+ fire base I have already
covered react gs+ fire base in my
react.js course have a look at that at
learned code online dot n love from
jharkhand thank you so much I do have a
lot of friends from bihar and jharkhand
during my college time these are amazing
hard-working people
I am still in touch with them so just me
laptop under 50k coming up tomorrow
coming up tomorrow
hi they said how are you I'm good I'm
good how to make a chatbot in Swift I
never thought about making a Chad Barton
Swift I did made a chatbot and in js4 my
facebook page because a lot of people
were just sending her hi and how are you
so I coded a simple script that replies
hi - hello and hello - hi and for how
are you I'm good how are you I coded
that script and just posted it on my
facebook so that all the people are
getting reply with that it's not there
now I have stopped it now because I
didn't felt good about it it's easy it's
not much of tough thing why don't you
post small projects in different
programming language one video per week
because in one video I cannot finish up
a project and there are other things
going on in my mind that I wanted to
share you so definitely I can think up
before that because I'm looking forward
to make small courses for small projects
like making a whatsapp clone in Android
and making a whatsapp clone in iOS and
looking for these small projects based
applications later on courses for that
right now the priority is iOS app
building genius or what business
opportunity you are providing a lot
depends what kind of business
opportunity you are looking up for
definitely we can talk up for that and
just to give you a quick update I have
been invited by a lot of universities
and a lot of tech fest for giving guest
lectures and sharing like my courses -
the winner of their competitions and
everything yes I am looking up for that
and definitely
I will be moving to a lot of
universities maybe some Skype sessions
sometimes in-person sessions yes that is
coming up and a lot of students who are
taking part in those university
competitions will be winning up my
courses and everything so yes that is a
killer update that is coming up
what's your males are my male is at age
at the rate today's Chaudhary calm
pretty easy to remember if you remember
my name by the way web design
competition date web design competition
I cannot be a very rigid about the date
but I think within this month the
announcement is going to come up within
this month okay when you are coming to
Delhi no I don't have any international
flights this month
so no Delhi plans usually my all of my
international flight goes from Delhi so
that's why I travel to Delhi coding
competitions yes that's coming up this
month okay it's a lot of questions are
coming up and they are just keep on
going I'm not able to read them even sir
you are not posting any videos related
to Microsoft technologies like c-sharp
Visual Studio as yours a marine no I'm
not a big fan of Microsoft tech usually
their alternatives are much more cheaper
and much more awesome I feel so I'm not
saying I'm totally correct but yes
okay google lens yes it's amazing
project and not associated in that when
they are coming to Chandigarh no there
is no such plan right now but surely if
some collagen writes me I would be
really happy to travel there I have
traveled which and eager to uncertain
times so okay it's a lot of questions
are coming up and I'm not able to read
any of them best place to start project
it's confusing how to start if you are
confused about that I don't you hit
learn code online dot in okay okay so
okay now we have been almost sitting
here is your else you have only where
the
use and what's the reason you have for
iOS app the else your app is now much
more improved I believe you are having
the older version if you are looking up
