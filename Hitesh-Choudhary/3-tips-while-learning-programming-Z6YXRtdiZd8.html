with another video now in today's video
we have something special to talk about
in today's videos I will give you three
tips when you get started to learn
programming or any other new language
these are the three things that you
should keep in mind and you're going to
get your success after that so let's get
started here in this channel we talk
about programming mobile apps websites
web development and everything related
to that so in case you are new here
consider subscribing now also I have
recently started an Android series which
you can watch on the same channel there
is a separate playlist so in case you
are interested in learning Android
absolutely for free go ahead and check
out that playlist and I have regularly
upload videos there now coming back on
to the point when we talk about three
successive of while learning programming
now I have categorized them into three
major components there and I would like
to discuss here and obviously these are
going to help you whether you are you
are a newbie there or you want to switch
onto some platform or maybe you are
already a programmer and we are trying
to switch into the new language now the
three things that you should keep in
mind first of all the number one is the
mindset the second one is good training
and the third one is the portfolio now
let's start with the mindset now I will
focus most of the time for a newbie that
you are just a college you have entered
into the college and programming has
impressed you quite a lot and now you're
trying to learn programming now the
important part while learning the
programming is actually the mindset now
you have to keep in mind that you have
you should have patience and you should
be consistent now if you're thinking
that the person who is teaching you the
programming is just flawlessly writing
the code make sure that you understand
that he is having a decade of experience
at least five or seven years of
experience in writing the same code
obviously he is going to be much more
fluent much more
smooth compared to you you might be
getting stuck in the situation where you
forgot to put curly braces or forgot to
put a semicolon or something like that
so make sure you have your patients
their programming is not a thing which
you can learn within a week or within a
month it comes over the ear at initial
days you will be stuck at kind of the
low level problems there but eventually
you will fix them up so have some
patience there now also you should be
consistent now you might have seen
programmers ranting about this all over
the internet that hey be consistent with
the programming let's say you are
learning the JavaScript stay with the
JavaScript for at least a couple of
years that's I would say is the minimum
there so and some of you might be saying
hey couple of years that's too much of
the time yes that that's it this is how
much it takes to learn programming at
least a couple of years nowadays people
are very inconsistent and having a
shortage of the patience that's not
going to make you a good programmer it
eventually comes to you the more you
will write the code the more you're
going to enjoy so that's number one the
mindset now second is the training now
here comes the controversial thing where
a lot of people will debate to me now I
have been into the community of online
training and instructors I know a lot of
them like from zero to geek I know him
personally and I know Rob Percy will I
know John person these are all big names
which are their mark prizes there all of
them are good friend of mine and they
know me I know them we hang out and
Facebook groups together all of them say
the same thing that the training is so
important now on to the off topic let me
give you a quick example in your high
school or in your 12 standard or
something
some of you were going exactly on to the
same tuitions of physics and chemistry
some of you like physics some of you
hated physics why is that because some
of the teacher actually gets connects to
you easily and it depends everyone with
differently some teachers are able to
connect to you quite easily while others
struggle in that now it's not a problem
of a teacher it's not a problem of a
student sometimes that
action bond is really hard to create so
that's point number one
whenever you are looking to programming
make sure you understand that the
teacher from your learning is getting
connected to you now also we were once
discussing all of our community the
programmers and the online instructor
were discussing that amount of we have
actually experienced this and this is
going to be a lot of debatable the
amount of student who actually purchased
the course or purchased the bootcamp or
go to offline while they purchase the
things actually complete the course the
ratio of completion of the courses is
very higher than the people who were
coming on to the bootcamp freely or are
just and getting enrolled in the course
freely and this is I know it's
completely debatable a lot of you are
going to come up and rant it hey I have
learned programming completely for free
on the internet yes you can I don't want
to sell you anything in this video at
least all I'm saying is try to pay a
little bit and you will be much more
focused because now your money is there
and that will be a good motivator to
learn something I'm not saying go ahead
and buy an online course I'm saying is
go ahead buy a good book don't download
it from the torrent because the
instructor has given a lot of dedication
there and you should buy the books to go
ahead buy a good book or buy a couple of
good online courses or go ahead and
enroll in some boot camps good quality
boot camps and that's important thing
your training will considerably shorten
the amount of programming that you are
learning if you are enrolled or you are
just learning on your own obviously you
can do so but it will take a lot of time
it will take you a couple of months
while on the other hand if you will buy
something like a good book or an online
course you can shorten that amount of
time at a reasonable amount you can
actually shorten that up to like in 15
days you can just brush up everything
complete a few projects and that's it so
all I'm saying is make sure you spend a
little bit amount of time in knowing
your teachers as well as trying to
understand that what kind of training I
am enrolling in or consider always time
constraint as well like what amount of
time do I have to learn this programming
so that's number two there so we have
covered up good things like what mindset
should be what kind of training you you
should be looking up
now comes the most important part that
is portfolio now whenever you learn
anything maybe just cool maybe it's your
college just work for your portfolio for
example you're learning C programming in
your very first semester okay that's
nice everybody should learn that because
that's in the curriculum that's going to
give you some math there but what kind
of portfolio are you trying to develop
with that see if you are correct trying
to create a couple of projects make sure
you put those projects online somewhere
github is a good place to put all your
project but you can put them on to other
websites like bed bucket or maybe on
your personal websites as well so always
and always work for your portfolio maybe
you are learning web development or web
design make sure whatever you design
whatever you create you put them
somewhere this is the most important
part because later on you might want to
do some freelancing or you might want to
get hired at a company all you have to
do is say hey this is my project work
check out this I have done this and
that's what your interview is over but
that's the great thing because if you're
working as a freelancer a potential
project that the one who is going to
give you the project can see what kind
of project you have done in the past
employer who is going to give you a job
simply can look out that what kind of
knowledge is already having so that's
one good thing now regardless your
training is including that or not or
your college curriculum includes that or
not if you know that programming you
should at least create four projects in
any language you're learning see create
four project and then that should be
good solid state project you are
learning let's just say javascript
create some good projects in that at
least four you are learning Java or
Android at least create four apps don't
host them on to Android Play Store or
anywhere but at least host them
somewhere so that potential employee or
a project-based line that you are
looking for can actually see your word
onto a quick summary let's revise that
again because we have been talking quite
a lot in this video so number one thing
is the mindset have patience and code
daily consistency is the key second is
training spend some time to know what
your teacher is like are you having a
action or bond video teacher also try to
spend a little bit amount of money if
you can spend that to save some time if
you cannot afford to spend some money
then obviously your client conjunction
will be little bit longer to keep that
in mind as well
the third one is always and always work
for portfolio that is the important part
of this video so I hope this video has
cleared up some of the good minds and is
going to give you some of the goals
there and I'm sorry for my itchy throat
I'm having some bad days I travelled
quite a lot in the country got some tan
at the Goa but again it messed up with
my system there and I'm having a tea so
but again I'll keep making the videos in
case you like the videos give it a
thumbs up hit the subscribe button or if
you think that somebody can get benefit
from these videos make sure that you
share them as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
