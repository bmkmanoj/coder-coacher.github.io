with another video in this video we're
gonna talk about something important and
before we even talk about that I want to
ask you a couple of questions because it
is very important to understand why we
are learning what we are learning so let
me ask you these simple questions how do
you decide that in your navigation bar
there is gonna be four components or
maybe it's gonna be five elements how do
you decide that how do you decide that
in your webpage there are gonna be like
four column grids or three column grids
when designing a mobile app how do you
decide that you're gonna choose a
scrollable item or a fixed item of a
fixed height where to put images where
to put videos all of these questions
need to be answered now yes I do
understand that at a basic scale when
you are designing a simple websites
these things are overlooked but for a
company like Flipkart or maybe Amazon or
uber these things cannot be overlooked
in today's video we're gonna answer all
of these questions that how these things
are designed and are being produced at a
higher company like big giant Google
Amazon Flipkart and all these things
coming up in this video
whenever you're working for a big client
or big company or you are working as a
job and in any big kind of company there
is a concept known as wire framing that
everybody follows and a lot of big
nerves when they move into company
scales which are good in producing
products they use wire framing and these
big nerds just look like Oh what on this
God's green earth is wire framing so let
me give you a quick introduction of what
is wire framing what are the tools that
you can use for wire framing and it's
the easiest process in the development
phase yes I do agree that there are
experts of wire framing and putting the
content on the webpage but it's not like
always you have to hire an expert and
have to deal with a many times your
company people like your head of the
company your team manager and your
developer just sit together do a
brainstorming and can come up with a
really good wire framing so what
actually is a wire framing a wire
framing is simply an idea of how you
want your data to be shown up there now
here's a quick hint about wire framing
if you think that something is in just
one color black and white that is
probably a wire framing in wire framing
we are not worried about how our buttons
are going to look like what color will
be choosing it's all about data what
kind of data we want the user to just
see at the very first end known as
primary data and what are the data that
can be moved on to the second page so
that user clicks on it and sees that
data now this is a really really
controversial decision sometimes people
do agree with that sometimes people
don't agree that usually that happens
with a vote being cast between
developers designers head of the team
and all these people in via framing we
don't use any kind of images any kind of
colors or any kind of video data it's
all about mocking up the screen for the
images just use a kind of a regular
image which doesn't even deplete the
image usually a cross sign is being used
for images now the goal here is I want
an image at this section and I want a
data at this section it is not being
talked about what should be in that data
what the line we should use what should
be our tagline all these are not being
discussed at this phase more important
question is what should be in our
navigation bar and very
be our navigation bar if we want to
display an image that's it we want an
image here how our website should look
like whether three grid columns or maybe
four grid columns how our app should
look like the tiles that you see at
Instagram the top image the button
should be there these are all first done
in the markups markups are basically
mainly of two types yes a lot of people
just disagree with their that there can
be a variety of markers but usually they
are just two types the one is low
fidelity and the second one is high
fidelity in the low fidelity you can
just pick up a pen paper maybe a sharpie
or a marker and can just start drawing
on a piece of paper now I always say
that it is far more easier in the design
process to change anything if you didn't
like it just throw out the paper bring
up a new paper and just start designing
on that these low fidelity paper work
always saves you a lot of time as
compared to when making these changes
with the development phase doing up all
these things on pen paper and sharpies
is known as the low fidelity fire
framing now yes sometimes people like to
work on the mid fidelity as well in
which the user flow is defined that when
user will be logging in how it will just
go through and how the login process and
all these flow work but usually it is
avoided in the wire framing because
there is a separate team working with
that along with the database guys and
all of that now here comes the second
stage of the fidelity now once
everything is being sorted out on pen
and paper
everybody just agreed or somehow
disagreed on that now it's final it's
done then you move on to the next stage
which is I call as high fidelity in the
high fidelity people like to use
software now one of the industry
standard software is Blaz m'q now I have
seen experts walking through with the
Blas mix like just anything but it
doesn't means that you also have to use
Balazs make all of these fidelity work
can be done in any kind of software like
Photoshop Illustrator sketch or maybe
you want to use anything else you can
use that as well now only thing that you
have to take here is don't use any color
don't use any kind of button format or
image at all you just want to go with a
very broad way of putting up the data
just use a cross for images or maybe
some blank bars for the graphics of the
text this is done so that you cannot
concentrate on what is data and rather
you concentrate on what data I want the
user to see at my front page or home
page or about page of whatever that page
is for such kind of high fidelity things
I don't use Blaz make I'm not an expert
in that I have tried and worked on it
I didn't liked it that much for that I
again use sketch but again this doesn't
means you also have to use sketch there
is one very good service known as
mock-ups and this is also being used
quite a lot in industry the reason being
that it can also design flows and
prototypes and all of that so it's a
very common service but again there is
no match for plasma it's just kind of a
rock-solid thing there are a couple of
other services that as a big nerd you
can try and use one of them is wireframe
dot CC totally free and completely
browser-based
so you can quickly design your website
and can just figure out what should be
the navigation bar how your app should
look like what kind of image you want to
put there again not being sponsored by
anyone just trying to share what the
industry is using and what I like it's a
well-known fact by everyone that the
more you're gonna sweat in the practice
the less you will bleed in the war I
always recommend to do more
brainstorming at the process of wire
framing and prototyping instead of just
having a developer and changing all the
things regularly and I changed this
butter and move this button here and
there this is not at all an ideal
practice you are investing more cost and
more money by changing all the things in
the developer phase don't do that always
work out in the wire framing and the
prototype phase now here comes an
interesting question and which is the
companies like uber flip card Amazon can
do these kinds of wire framing and
prototyping but if you are just a
freelancer who want to design a website
for a for a person who doesn't barely
know that what he wants on a website is
actually much more trickier than what
you are expecting doing all kind of
these wire framing and prototyping for
that person is obviously going to
increase the cost
so sometimes developer at a small
industry always like to skip these parts
but this is not a good practice and
obviously you will be
chatting with more clients investing
more time in that so make sure you tell
your client at first hey go ahead pick
up a pen and paper and just show me that
how your website should look like what
are the elements that you are expecting
there on your website
I have dropped number of clients on web
development and app development who were
not even ready of thinking about what
they actually want and these kinds of
clients who always just keeps you busy
and as I always say time is money so you
don't want to invest with these kinds of
freelancing clients who have absolutely
no idea what they are looking up when
they are building up a website or you
can charge them extra for the
consultancy that you are giving them
that hey how your navigation bar should
look like or what data you should be
putting up on I have even dealt up with
the clients that have absolutely no idea
what there should be on that about page
or what should be their tagline really
really hard to work with such clients
okay one more side note I have seen a
lot of resume a which comes with my at
my friend's company and sometimes we
just talk about it a lot of resume it
just comes up with having a panel in
there as you may a kind of a corner
we're just we say software skills and a
lot of people just put their microsoft
word excel and all such things hey
you're applying for a development
company IT company these software
doesn't really mean anything they're the
software that people are looking up when
they are hiring are such kind of
software's like Photoshop Illustrator
sketch plasmic and all such things so
stop putting down that microsoft word
there and start working on something
good the software that actually means
something maybe you want to put JIRA
there maybe you want to put Trello there
or maybe you want to put some Atlassian
software there so go ahead get started
with how the industry is shaping up and
stop just copying and pasting that
template that was being designed like 10
