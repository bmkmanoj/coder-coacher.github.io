back onto our usual setup you can see
everything is back in place I'm back at
home it was a good travel I will be
spending some good time with you this is
not gonna be a long life because I
haven't slept in like 26 or 28 hours I
need to get some sleep
but before that I thought let's have a
good quick iced tea and talk with you
all of you guys I have also rolled out a
video on machine learning just in the
morning
it's published now so let's just sip
some iced tea and say hello to all of
you and answer a few questions
so hey technical module hey Cal shake
hey retro resume that's a nice name by
the way and hey suck hey Balaji hey RJ
hey
technical UV good morning to you as well
and it's good to be back it's good to be
home it's good to be with you all people
so I'm back here and Heiberg is how are
you how is your website going on I hope
it is going pretty good and good morning
to everybody it's really live before I
went to I just go to sleep I thought
let's just say hello to everybody it's
always good to have Sunday life I'm
gonna finish up my iced tea and you can
ask questions in the meantime I'll try
to answer a lot of questions I'll try to
my best here so the meantime I'm gonna
sip my iced tea I just love it okay so
let's try to answer a few questions love
you too it got acquired by a German
company yeah that's good to know what is
that was actually by the way a good
product and luckily you sold it to a
company that's good to know always good
to know these kinds of things that are
acquired by some good company I liked it
okay hi today you started your live
video so early my videos
they don't have any specific time I
usually try to do them around in the mid
of Sunday around 1112 on something but
it's really some time it's really hard
to steal at the time from my busy
schedule but still I try my best to get
on to you on Sunday life so that's what
my main target is I know some of people
are expecting that I should fix up a
time and everything but right now with
so much of the work it's not at all
possible because I have responsibilities
for my existing apps that are running
for the clients some new awesome clients
that are asking me to design apps as
well as web application as well as some
personal projects like learned code
online these videos so it's a lot of
work so I'm not able to cope up with
that okay are is a good tool in machine
learning rather than Python yes I have
seen a lot of people working with the R
but the point is that R is not so much a
famous language is not so much
implemented quite a lot so learning the
Python can open up your door in machine
learning as well as other domains as
well so that's one kind of a thing what
is deep learning deep learning is almost
associated with machine learning it's
kind of a neural network based learning
I did read about it in my masters so
that's why I know it otherwise I
couldn't have learned that okay working
on the next word hey vergis it's really
amazing to see that you are working on
something good product don't forget to
look me in the email I would love to see
what you are building up next you always
build up something classic so I would
definitely like to check that out and we
also do have some plans for learn code
online to roll out a few good updates as
well as some of the client apps that I
will be sharing for you that have that
are being designed to be in the bootcamp
mostly 60% by me but 40% in the bootcamp
students so we'll share them as well
they are all iOS app by the ways so
suggest me industrial development
project I got in my college please
suggest some topics what kind of project
you are looking for okay I want to know
more about ml I recently rolled out a
video on machine learning that's a good
getting started point but apart from
more I have to rule out a course on that
and that will take a lot of time it's
not easy for me to get started machine
learning there is a lot of neural
network a lot of job and work that you
have to do it's not like you can just
walk on the syntax that most of the
courses right now are doing I am a big
fan as soon as I roll out the course I'm
looking forward to build something with
it at least 5 or 10 apps or websites or
products like that so that's why we are
doing what is best hacking course there
is no such thing as best or worst it's
what you know what you want to learn so
I'm not going to be bashing anybody so
should I go for internship after leaving
programming I don't like the word
they're leaving programming that's
that's not my favorite one hey I'm an
Android developer I want to start an API
development that's a completely
different domain shortly you can get
started with API development it's not a
big deal not a big issue you can design
your API as in PHP you rather node.js
would be a little bit easier depends on
what is actually a product for which you
want to design your API is okay tell me
about neural network and for the neural
network designing of neural network like
trade models and on trade models this is
not something that I would like to do in
such a live video or maybe it's rather a
separate video would be better I can't
recommend you a couple of books that I
read in my masters I can recommend you
that they are pretty amazing books
costly do remind let me remind you that
ordering that book is costly because my
college library didn't have that book I
ordered them and they were costly ok
should I buy macbook air in 2017 for all
the coding purposes yeah that's a good
machine I would say that if you can
afford a little bit more go for MacBook
Pro I know it's very expensive but air
is also going to do just buy an external
hard disk and I think you are done for
the purpose in case you don't want to
afford that even Mac Mini is by the way
a fantastic machine my early days of I
used
invent completely on Mac Mini in fact
this reminds me that I can make a
separate video on machines or machines
that I use in my daily life or have used
so far so I can I can make a video on
that in case you forgot to hit that
thumbs up button I think most of you do
so don't forget to hit that thumbs up
button keep going that hit that thumbs
up button come on I'm serious here okay
I can see the rise in number yep there
we go so let's ask let's answer another
question
Arjun says best technologies that can be
used to develop native Android app okay
obviously Java and Kotlin are there but
they are native app I think you're
looking for moreover is react native and
xamarin is also there not a big fan of
xamarin because of the closed source
environment of Microsoft but yes it can
be used and also react native is the
most fantastic one that you can use
ionic is also there not a big fan of
ionic but it's amazing
okay machine learning video was awesome
thanks for that thank you so much Nick
here for appreciation it is a very
essential thing we don't realize that
but you should learn to appreciate
because a lot of people don't do that if
you find that somebody's shoes are
awesome what is t-shirt is awesome just
compliment him it can make his day so
learn to compliment that's awesome I
have seen one of your videos about a
test fuel injection okay thank you so
much should I go for android slash I use
development or machine learning hey Garo
that's an very dependent question
because that's the subjective it might
good to you it might not good to be but
I personally am kind of a guy who would
go for Android or iOS development
because machine learning has to go cover
up a lot of distance still and it's very
tough nowadays
eventually in the feature it will become
a much more easier but right now it does
involve a lot of maths and it is heavily
dependent on data models which are not
easy to collect by the way and the model
that is being provided by Apple and
Google are just limited although if you
read the documentation there you will
see that Annette are seen the data model
can verify and classified thousand
objects and some of them can identify
250 types of object that looks like a
break but thousand objects hey I can
just name a thousand objects just around
me so that it's a very small there so
yeah I have learned some dotnet and NBC
I want working 3 lakhs package hi one
more package what would I do
learn more learn more that's the easy
way difference between MySQL and SQL
that's an interesting question by the
way I can make a video on that SQL is
just kind of a language or a syntax
while MySQL is a software that uses SQL
to do stuff so I hope that makes it
clear a little bit did you forget to hit
the thumbs up button I think some of you
how to decide technology for web
development or mobile development it's
heavily dependent on what is your target
audience if you're looking up for the
free tier quite a lot and you are
focusing more audience rather than
making money then you should be worried
about the load balancing and stuff react
native or react basically or node.js can
handle that pretty well or if you're
looking up a small-scale application I
think PHP can handle that nicely dotnet
can handle that nicely so it's it's a
heavily dependent question there so I
want to make a career in ml how you
going to do course on it
no as of now there is no plan for
machine learning course it's not in my
to-do list right now the to-do lists say
is design app on machine learning in iOS
so that's going to be
coming up next already i have made like
150 videos on iOS 11 that are about to
roll out very soon I think within the
next upcoming week apps related to
augmented reality machine learning are
also there for this legit course or
machine learning in Python is not going
to be soon at least for a couple of
months because I have one very amazing
course being planned that is for
everybody who is going to be in India as
well as I do have some plans from
traveling again so it's not going to
come up very soon let's just be honest
here ok so tell me about karma
Metasploit our karma Metasploit is a
Metis flight branch that came up for
special kind of exploits spatially
dependent on the wireless one I tried to
learn that quite a lot a long time ago I
didn't find it much interesting because
that was not actively developed by the
way if you're using Metasploit I do have
a series of Metasploit check it out it's
amazing oh ok I have developed so many
webpages for some people how can I
spread that I can develop web for them
I'm 17
it's have you designed your portfolio
because if you are designed for other
people have you taken the screen shot of
that and I've posted it on your website
as well because if you're designing
something for others as well make sure
you keep a track of your personal
portfolio as well once you have done
that then you can only show it to
somebody do you work on your own or for
any company I am open to work for
anybody who is ready to pay me and
that's what I do most of the time I I
like to take boot camps and small-scale
projects like contractor bases that's
what I do mostly but I certainly do get
hired for companies as well sometimes as
an evangelist some time as a technology
changing phase or they want to move on
some other tech
something like that sometimes as a team
lead so yep that I do as well but most
of the time just an independent
contractor
okay um which language is best for us
every language is best okay no js' or
react Cheers
not at all even a comparison because no
cheese is kind of a back-end react yes
is kind of a front-end yes surely react
genius in combination with fire ways can
be used but I would say there is no
comparison here because we are talking
about something like HTML as good or PHP
is good there is no comparison between
both of them similarly node.js runs on a
server side and most of the react Ria's
components run on the front-end side so
you can use a combination of that but no
good comparison ah I want it to be a
back-end developer but right now I'm
working in angularjs in my office so
what could I do if you are already
working in angularjs why don't you try
out my course on node.js oh gosh because
I think you already are quite familiar
with j/s and specially if you are in the
angular you must be familiar with es6 as
well 2016 1 so I think with an odious
within I think two or three weekends you
can get ready with the node.js and you
can become a back-end developer amazing
start would be no GS so I highly
recommend that to you I hope that
answers your questions which one is more
Iran Iran I don't know app or game Iran
I don't know what that is you are Indian
by wire using terms of dollars instead
of rupees most of my work is in dollars
or in Euros so that's kind of a mindset
that I like to keep because it keeps
everything as consistent surely I have
no harm in using rupees or like that in
fact all of the prices at
code online dot in are in rupees so no
such harm as well but most of the time I
am dealing up with the clients and
everything so you have to grow up your
mindset according to your clients if you
have been working in the clients with
Australia most of the time you will be
thinking in Australian dollars how to
charge them what kind of discount you
want to give so that's kind of a thing
you get over your work okay can you make
an SQL injection course I did it already
once I will try to update it very soon
and we'll try what we can do there okay
hi taste sir love from Pakistan left
from India too as well I hope both
countries can make some things there and
no issues with the countries so keep
watching the videos keep watching the
channel and keep learning programming
that's what random guy familiar saying
here okay remove job good companies I
don't know what that means
even it that was a question sure furgus
yeah surely why are you not replying
please reply okay I'm trying my best to
reply everybody please suggest me some
industrial development project there is
no such thing as I can suggest the
project there are so many things around
you design the clone of learning code
online maybe or maybe over maybe
snapchat maybe Facebook show some skills
about load balancing work on ns3
work on the bunt to work on comparison
of I three versus I five I don't know
what to suggest to you there are so much
of the things okay what's the difference
between date analysts and data
scientists almost kind of a sane job
fancy terms almost same no such hard
difference it's like something HTML and
CSS they go hands and am I know that's a
weird comparison but a data analysts and
data scientists are almost equal I may
be wrong there so don't take my word
what is the name of the book select H I
want to read it I don't remember right
now if you can drop me a message on
facebook I can take up into my Amazon
orders and can find that book
because I actually gave that book as a
donation to some juniors from my college
I don't have that book right now
otherwise I could have send it to you as
a courier because I'm not reading it so
you could have it
I will surely tell you that from digging
up my Amazon drop me a message on
facebook
good morning waiting for Sunday eagerly
yeah thank you so much I try to make
sure that I come up every Sunday so
sipping my iced tea hope you are having
some drinks as well okay I'm a PHP
developer what can I develop to impress
interviewer any application
possibilities for PHP cos are endless
but a thing that can impress an
interviewer would be a simple system
that includes login login with Google
login with firebase that should be a
login mechanism you can try off the zero
for that and then further few values to
be stored in database and retrieving
from the database non timely basis and
leading stuff I think that can impress
any interviewer because if you are able
to make some login system usage of
database and storage I think that some
of all of your skills okay is it safe to
use flexbox some browser does not
support it am i correct yes you are
correct some browser doesn't support a
flexbox and those are the naughty
browsers that nobody at least I don't
care about that and that is Internet
Explorer that browser is such a
nightmare for every designer it's it's
pure hate that's gonna come up from
every web designer towards the Internet
Explorer do you really know that the
Internet Explorer doesn't even support
the bootstrap quite often Lee we have to
use a library from Shiva and that only
makes it good so hate hate for that
Internet Explorer and still it's being
used quite a lot so that is one guy that
and support flexbox much so yeah you
have to sometime write your backup CSS
format
what about django Django is good pretty
good for stealing smaller apps not for
the scalable much so I like to avoid it
do you promote games yeah sometimes I do
plays good games mobile ones sometimes
and if somebody has made some of my
friends have made some games surely I do
promote them okay I want to them about
react native something amazing about
react native is going to come up that is
going to be a free update for all the
react GS users what is meteor meteor is
a JavaScript library and to discuss more
about it
I need a separate video okay join camp
cache so another spammer is that it okay
okay going on right away some uploads
are going on there hi fish where are you
from right now I am at home very good
morning it is I have good experience in
c-sharp should I learn angular 2 or PHP
4 website if you have a good experience
of c-sharp why don't you try Unity I
know that's that's a weird choice but if
you somehow are able to master unity you
will be thanking me for throughout the
life and I think you are all experienced
with c-sharp is going to come up handy
there so don't switch into angular or
PHP try unity first there a little bit
for your choice little bit weird
suggestion but I'm pretty sure you're
gonna thank me throughout your life okay
dotnet MVC skills I need more package
what will I do now first and foremost
dotnet doesn't have MVC as its own
property it's just MVC is a design
pattern dotnet uses it is uses it
Android uses it Java uses it everybody
uses it
so MVC is not kind of a property of that
net okay stop saying that okay which is
the best hosting provider now that's the
debatable
I think if you can somehow manage by the
way there's a one-year free tier license
for AWS it's highly highly trusted
trustworthy
go ahead try out amazon web server if
you are looking up for that i didn't had
a good experience with GoDaddy at least
so I don't recommend that for the big
rock I did face some of the down times
especially when the Black Friday sale
was going on and like that so at least
those are not my personal choice your
can be different Bluehost is one of the
guy which performed really well somehow
but let's keep that discussion here I
don't want to promote or D promote
anybody when they're coming to India for
bootcamps bootcamp sin India are gonna
be are under plan but right now my
schedule is entirely packed for just I
have finished one and there are a couple
of others going on in Europe so we'll be
traveling there again and boot camps in
India I'm planning very soon but since
the boot camps are little bit expensive
I'm not pretty sure that users will be
able to cope up with that or not
obviously they are expensive because
they are eight days or 10 days rigorous
training for like 6 hour or eight hour
per day but end of the day you just come
out with a lot of skills a lot of apps a
lot of websites along with you aren't
they costly yes are they productive yes
are they life changer for sure yes but
little bit cost issues out there because
if you think at LAN code online you are
getting a codes for like thousands or
800 rupees or something on the other
hand the boot camps cost around 300 to
400 dollars sometimes even $500 so
paying that kind of money for just like
15 days or 10 days
I don't think so people are ready here
yet but I will try very soon okay what
is your favorite language now I don't
have any favorite language honestly I
don't have any favorite operating system
then just tool for me like I have
I use have I don't love Swift for that
means it's good it's fast
it's easier to remember the syntax so
that's why I love it on the other hand
if I have to design an app in Android I
don't care if it is Java or Kotlin
because it's just all about loops syntax
applying some frameworks and just like
that so there's no such thing for me as
favorite language or something I just
have to do the job I love products not
the language itself okay
can I start asp.net MVC 5 not a big fan
of darknet I don't even recommend that
okay is ml and data science future
I don't think so they are only the
future because it's not like everything
like I used app and Android apps and web
apps are going to be shut down and only
that is going to be there and no it's
not gonna happen
surely they will be in demand but not
like they will be only guys uh okay so
there are a lot of questions going on
okay I have done Java but I want to do
carry the Python what should I do
there in Python that simple where are
where you were from last two days I was
quite busy in traveling and those
traveling's didn't give me time to come
up or upload any videos on and the last
days of the boot camps are heavy like
you don't get much time because a lot of
students need to ask a questions some of
their apps are not working I have to
tweak those apps and it's a heavy day's
last day of the boot camps are always
heavy that was that is there I was busy
okay how to translate code from one
language to another okay that reminds me
a really good topic I can make a video
on localization that would be fantastic
so let me keep that in my to do list
upon localization so that you can see
all of your apps in a local language so
that would be nice thanks for suggesting
that I will surely make a video on that
okay flexbox and bootstrap which is
better no comparison there because
completely different things you cannot
say that should I use CSS or bootstrap
similarly you cannot say that should I
use flexbox a bootstrap completely
different go with any of them or both of
them there is no such thing why you
don't like dotnet sir please answer
I don't like dotnet because it's very
closed and oriented for Microsoft you
have to be dependent quite a lot of
Microsoft and honestly most of my
clients in the u.s. don't use dotnet
much they like to prefer things which
are open-source everybody can see what
is going on what is happening I have
never got such big clients on the.net
haven't demanded like that so that's why
I don't use it and if something it's
more within the demand in India most of
the websites in India are being on
dotnet but I don't like it now the
performance wise and everything I don't
like it much okay so I have designed my
webpage and now I want to show it to my
friend how could I do that
register website on free hosting
websites there are a few of them triple
zero web host is one of them was there
how games like clash royale work that's
a very very complex game it requires a
lot of team a lot of variable storage
lot of bandwidth it's a gigantic game
reddit course this is oh is it okay if
you are giving all the reddit courses
properly without any cheating I know a
lot of institutes just give you paper
dumps and everything in advance if you
are doing like that there is no need to
do that it's it's just a cheating
otherwise if you are just facing them
honestly and directly without worrying
about certificate they are amazing
courses I have done like three or four
four or three certificates in Red Hat
pretty good level ok so we are getting a
lot of question as a student how do I
know I am ready for freelancing Android
app development there are already a lot
of projects on freelancer which give you
all the details just try to make app
with all of those details because they
are pretty comprehensive details if you
are
to come up with all those details that
means you were ready okay
tell disadvantage of using AMD processor
I had a laptop that uses AMD processor
AMD heats a little bit higher than
Nvidia and I'm not making a nice super
super imposing had rules or kind of
outcome here but I have faced this issue
so probably that might be okay so what
would you suggest to me learn Swift or
Python if you have an Apple device go
for Swift
no thinking no thoughts nothing if you
have an Apple device or even a Mac Mini
go for Swift that is amazing because
most of the paying crowd who buys that
now listen to me here those people who
buy the app are actually in the iOS not
in the Android or in the Python so you
can make some quick good money there and
that's the truth I know a lot of people
might bash me over there that hey
Android is amazing Android is awesome
but no Android is good if you want to
hit mass popularity there but if you
want that your app should sell more then
obviously iOS is the way go for react
native yep go for react native always
say thanks a Dacian thank you so much so
these okay how much time it will take to
learn Java for Android development for
bigness I think if you can spend a
really good amount of time I think two
weeks you will not be master of the Java
within two weeks but at least you will
get the syntax if you can work like me
in a beast mode I think a week is enough
more than enough okay so we are having a
lot of questions going on I can bring
your videos offline courses because I
have slow Wi-Fi connection no I cannot
give permissions for offline access
right now because recently there were
some piracy issues being going on I had
to send a couple of legal notices people
try to just download
videos tried to sell them on OLX and
even try to upload them on torrent so
lucky me B we tracked them down because
their videos were having some major
data's and like that so we have to send
a legal notice to them and all of that
so right now it's going pretty messy for
sure in the future I will try that okay
so there we go have a lot of questions
are coming up a lot of them are just
keep going on I cannot read hedge both
of them okay so it's almost 30 minutes
and I'm feeling really really tired my
eyes are getting red now I haven't slept
in the last 26 or 27
I think 27 hours that is a big time I
think from yesterday morning I haven't
slept during him in the night time there
is one good question there by the way
from Charles he says is there any
apparent difference in performance
between natives swift code and react
native surprisingly there is no such a
lag or difference that you will feel I
know everybody hates that highbreed app
so that are just a wrapper being
enclosed in a web app so basically it's
a browser being running in a hybrid app
usually that's the case but in react
native that's not the case and I have
made pretty good apps that are handling
right now the traffic or four of 4000 or
four thousand and five hundred users
actively react native is handling them
nicely no lag or nothing at all so I
would say there is not much difference
in react native and Swift code but but
you should be aware of one thing that
react native is something which is four
kind of already existing web app for
example if I would have a website like
something like learn code online I would
like to push that through react native
but if you want to give some features
like machine learning augmented reality
which are fairly new they are not
available in
act native so I hope this clears up a
lot of your doubts Charles there so
that's all about it okay so a lot of
people are watching this hey can you
give it a thumbs up here please
everybody I hope everybody can get a
thumbs up there at least okay so some
people are asking questions even about
the Donald Trump I don't know why but
