today we are going to talk about the top
5 reasons to learn JavaScript first of
all don't get me wrong when we code out
there we eventually develop some love
for a one particular language for me it
was fightin but it's kind of a wrong
thing that when you stuck with one
language out there you are losing a lot
of opportunities maybe I got stuck with
a one company and you cannot just lead
that company because you are not aware
of the other languages or maybe you are
losing some app development or other
fantastic things that are right now
popular out there so you might be having
your favorite language out there but
today I'm going to give you five top
reasons that you really want to learn
with the JavaScript out there now if you
are a big nerd in any programming
language then javascript is a great
option so reason number one is the
language is pretty forgiving to get
started with out there now a lot of
people will argue that forgiving
languages are bad languages because they
don't forces you enough out there to
learn the proper syntax but I would
disagree with that when somebody is
getting started with the language he
should get a feel that yes I'm learning
something in case he has forgotten to
write war some there or some other
keywords the JavaScript is pretty
forgiving language because it's a web
language and that is one of the main
reason that big nerd can get started out
there and instead of getting stuck with
a syntax out there he can get started
with the logic building that is pretty
important out there later he can learn
more about the syntax can use different
IDs that can guide him out there so
that's my reason number one my reason
number two is that when you start
learning in JavaScript you immediately
get the product out there okay so what
does that mean now when we learn the
JavaScript or let's just say let's take
this off topic a little bit
now if most of you are enrolled in the
boot camp of the iOS development
remember the feeling when you get your
code onto your real device out there
that is the best feeling the same
feeling you get out there in the
JavaScript as well you write the code
you run it on the web and you get an
output out there as soon as quickly out
there and that is not just an output on
the black screen the scary black screen
like the C or somewhere
it used to be in the early in the late
90s out there but JavaScript is much
more better out there in getting the
output quickly although there are some
issues with getting the errors out there
but yes we can just forgive that out
there my reason number three is the
front-end development now let's just say
you know how to design a website in HTML
and CSS but that website is pretty
boring
let's just be agree on that now if you
want to add some interactivity or some
great features out there you have to
learn JavaScript now JavaScript later on
can be evolved as a jQuery or other some
plugins out there of frameworks that can
enhance your features are there the
sliders that you see moving out there
the images that you're seeing a see
moving out there are actually a product
of JavaScript so that is why I recommend
for the web developers that yes for the
front-end developers it's kind of a holy
grail you should definitely get started
with the JavaScript out there reason
number four is the back-end development
and I know most of you didn't saw that
coming but nowadays JavaScript has been
asked to do a lot more than it was
eventually designed for now with a v8
chrome engine that is being placed out
in the in the servers like node.js and
dozens of other things javascript is
doing a whole lot more things like
Emmett and nodejs and they are dozens of
J's everything that you see J's at the
back that really does means that it's
kind of a dependent on the JavaScript so
if you want to get started in the
backend development and don't want to
get started with a new language out
there javascript is kind of a perfect
choice out there so why are not getting
started yet go ahead and get started out
there now the reason number five and the
final reason is the mobile application
development yes I know the native
application are far more great but don't
get me wrong but hybrid application are
also very good and are quite out there
in the market let me just give you an
example Netflix is designed totally on
an hybrid platform out there and yes
JavaScript will help you quite a lot in
getting started with the hybrid mobile
application development so if you want
to get started with the mobile
application development and yes why
javascript you can just put your app in
the JavaScript and can export it as
Android app or iOS app or maybe
Windows app as well so that is the great
reason you want to get started with the
JavaScript out there now if you really
want to get started with the JavaScript
or let me give you more if you get stuck
want to get started completely into the
front-end development I have a killer
online boot camp for you now don't get
me wrong
I'm not selling you anything out there
just yet I'm just saying
check it out if you like it then only
take it you are the boss here so I would
