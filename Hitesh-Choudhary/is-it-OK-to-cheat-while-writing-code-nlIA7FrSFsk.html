with another video and in today's video
we are not going to talk about anything
in fact I'm going to be answering a very
interesting question so make up and re
asks this very interesting question on
one of the comments on the YouTube and
she says is it okay to cheat from the
Google while writing the code and this
question is funny as well as interesting
at the same time so let's discuss about
this in this video in this channel we
talk about programming web apps mobile
apps and everything related poorly to
the technical things and technical stuff
so in case you are new here consider
subscribing now coming back onto the
question and we'll try to keep this
video really short and sweet and the
question is very interesting is it okay
to cheat from the internet while writing
code and I'll tell you my personal
opinion about it and then for sure we
can discuss it in the comment section
now I considered it perfectly okay and I
would say it is more than okay to cheat
from the google now I would say why I
think about it now when I write a code
to build up a project or maybe exercise
files for the courses I look around on
the web quite a lot in fact recently I
was designing a project and before this
project I have actually designed a
project in the node.js and that was
completely using a lot of API and when I
moved into the react again I have to
make a couple of requests on the Web API
and I actually completely forgot how to
request a Web API now I know this sounds
a little bit dumb but yes I completely
forgot that what did I did then I simply
went on to the stack overflow look onto
the quick syntax and everything just
reminded me there and I did a few edits
and there we go my web application was
completely ready to make a web request
to the API now living behind the
complete technicalities there it is
completely okay to cheat out there now
in fact you are not cheating this is
called as something taking a reference
from because you are aware of the things
then obviously if you would be too
about how to declare the variable how
the stuff life would not be much more
easier for you in fact you should be
cheating around when you need to look up
for a couple of concepts maybe you
forgot how to generate a random number
or maybe you forgot to how to generate
an API request there or a web request
there and it's completely okay to look
around here and there because obviously
you have to rewrite that code
particularly and you have to change a
few variables few constant and make it
make that code usable for yourself so I
consider that it's completely okay in
fact if not more than that but at least
80 to 90 percent of the programmer look
around quite a lot from the Stack
Overflow and that's actually how the
programming is being done if you are
thinking that hey some programmer is
generating all the things from his mind
that's not at all even possible
everybody here and there or some point
of time looks around for the Stack
Overflow now what I will tell you on top
of that as well is when you write a lot
of code a lot of things just become kind
of the practice for you like for example
when I make a lot of code in the Swift
and most of the apps that I have built
up uses a table view there so writing
the code for table view is just like a
secondary to me I can just do that on
the go or maybe just after waking up so
I can do that quite a lot but in fact if
I have to make a web request or maybe
use the sound drivers there then it
would be little bit tricky for me so I
look around for the web for the
references or maybe looking at on for
the documentation so on a whole let's
wrap this up and I would say that yes
it's completely okay to cheat around I
do completely agree that I do it quite a
lot I look out the reference for CSS I
use websites like CSS tricks calm and
thus that is one of my favorite blogs
therefore the rest of the things I like
to use Stack Overflow quite a lot I'm
very active there searching the
questions on filling the equations and a
lot of stuff like that so this was my
overview about that and just onto a
quick note there all the people who are
still watching is I'm very soon going to
launch a separate video about Q&amp;amp;A
question and answer and I will be
picking up the questions from this video
so if you have any special question and
I will be picking up a few questions
from this video only so make sure you
put down your
and I will pick you up along with your
name I will give you full attribute
there and I'll try to answer your
question and I know this video was not
that much enthusiastic because I was
little bit tired it was quite a busy day
from 10:00 to 1:00 I was working on the
desk then just in half an hour break
then from almost 1:00 and aha maybe from
2 o'clock
I was working till 6 then hitting the
gym now I'm back in here so it's a
little bit tiring day and still I have
to work almost 3 to 4 days so life is
sometime not that much good but again
just sharing some thoughts so I hope you
have enjoyed this video quite a lot in
case you think that this video can be
usefully give it a thumbs up and in fact
don't forget about the Q&amp;amp;A section we
are going to have a very interesting Q&amp;amp;A
section so make sure you put down your
question there now pick up your question
and the very next video that we'll be
doing is going to be all about Q&amp;amp;A and
I'll be answering all of your questions
one by one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
