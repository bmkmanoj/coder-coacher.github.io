again with another video in this video
we're going to talk about five
programming language that you should
really look forward to learn in 2018
now before you move ahead in this video
I will also mention that where you can
implement those programming language
this entire list is made on based on
four criterias the trend on the stack
overflow the trend on freelancer
websites the trend in the job market at
MNCs and the trend in the job market at
startup
so really the four essential thing that
we are going to talk about now this is
not only the list of programming
language and their implementation I have
also got five honorable mentions these
languages were so amazing that I
couldn't stop myself that yes these
languages really need to be get some
credit there so these are honorable
mention at the end of the video so
without any further ado let's get
started
just onto a side note here it doesn't
really mean that a language is at 5th
position that means it's a bad language
and the language is at first position
that means it's the best language these
are just the positions that I have
figured it out this doesn't mean it has
to be true you can completely disagree
with that so hear me out on this list at
number five
I'm putting c-sharp here now the reason
putting up the c-sharp here was not at
all the dotnet framework in the recent
here I have seen that the popularity of
dotnet framework is reducing a little
not by much a little but the reason why
I have put a C shop here is because of
game development as well as the xamarin
now game development with unity and
everything is booming quite a lot and
that's why this language made it to the
list here also with the xamarin you are
able to make mobile applications
cross-platform are the Android as well
as on the iOS native apps using the
zamarons so that is the reason why I am
putting up c-sharp here amazing language
very easy to learn and really a lot of
people who were already into the dotnet
market are now trying to move into the
zamarons or in the game development so
that's why this language made it to the
list at number four I would like to put
Swift here the reason behind putting the
Swift is whether you are talking about
top 10 programming language top 5 swift
has to made the list and the only reason
behind that is Apple now yes I do agree
here that there are a lot of haters of
Apple on the internet but we cannot skip
the fact that Apple is a big deal
it sells insanely crazy high amount of
devices every single year regardless of
whatever the prices or whatever the
highest quality they are building up
they sell the product and this makes a
huge ecosystem for you so if you're
looking forward to design any apps that
include any kind of Apple ecosystem
maybe that's an iPhone iPad maybe a game
for Apple or maybe any kind of desktop
application the Swift has to be here
there is just one way to go inside Apple
ecosystem and that is Swift yes I do
completely agree here that there is a
big hurdle that in order to get into the
Apple ecosystem you have to have an
Apple device whether it's a macbook Mini
Beaucaire MacBook Pro you cannot just
code for the Apple ecosystem outside the
Apple ecosystem you have to be inside it
here that's a big hurdle not everybody
can afford Apple devices so that's the
downside but still the market is
extremely huge the jobs are really good
it's high paying job so that's why Apple
made it to the list and yes we had to
put it on number for read Swift at
number three I would like to put Java
here now alongside with Java I would
also like to put Cortland here so this
is part is shared by two programming
language Java and Kotlin this is no
surprise this language had to be here
the Java is insanely crazy powerful and
popular language and specially the
recent increase in the Android apps and
the demand of Android developer this
language is growing like insanely but
not only because the Android there are a
lot of web applications being totally
designed in Java so that's why this
language is gonna be on this list but
here's a quick word here that I would
like to add on the Java now if you want
to become an Android developer Java is a
great start but in order to make sure
that you add a little bit cherry on the
top of your existing resume I would
recommend you to learn Catalan as well
the Kotlin is now officially supported
language for Android development and in
fact already a lot of companies have
started to build up their site projects
in the Catalan as well so if you want to
get an extra edge as an Android
developer get started with Java make a
lot of apps in that but make sure you
also learn about the Kotlin as well this
will make you stand out from every other
person who is there at the interview
this is really an essential edge that
you should get at number two in this
list I would like to put up JavaScript
now this programming language looks like
is on steroids this language is growing
like insanely crazy now the JavaScript
that you are aware of possibly is not
the JavaScript I'm talking about
javascript has evolved quite a lot and
with the 2017 edition here it has
evolved quite a lot and there were a lot
of flaws in the JavaScript it was not
the most personally favorite language
for a lot of programmer but it has
evolved quite a lot and makes sure we
are on the same page we are talking
about the 2017 and 2000
teen edition of JavaScript now
javascript is perfectly capable and
powerful enough to handle almost
everything you can work with the node GS
and can rely on the backend with it at
the front end you can go with angular or
react and completely rely on this this
is really the hottest trend in the
market if you want to talk about the
mobile apps the ionic framework or the
react native framework are completely
capable of handling all the iOS as well
as the Android app and yes there is a
big reason why big companies like
Facebook are completely shifting towards
this JavaScript scenario and JavaScript
globe here for their web for their
mobile Android iOS everything this
language I have seen I haven't seen any
language growing this much quickly and
this much powerful this language is
growing quite ly insane whether they
talk about web or mobile this is doing
something at our number one list I would
like to put Python here now Python has
to be on the top of this list and the
whole credit goes for machine learning
now this language is already super
powerful ready to talk about the pen
tester whether talk about the frameworks
like Django for designing web apps or
maybe you talk about the analysis of the
things like machine learning numpy
pandas this language has got a great
comeback previously this language
actually showed a little bit dull sign
in the recent time but now again this
language is shining like anything talk
about any companies whether it's Google
it's Facebook it's Apple all the
companies are after the engineers who
have strong and thorough knowledge about
Python the recent startup are also aware
that if they are going to implement
machine learning anyhow in their product
their product is gonna scale up quite
easily they will get a high market value
and there are great chances that they
are gonna be somehow being purchased by
the big giants so yes without a single
doubt in my mind I would say that Python
has two made it at number one in this
list ok so this is the list but I do
have five honorable mention and I'll
mention them really really quickly
because these are really good and they
had to be here 5 PHP amazing awesome and
still the highest projects on the
websites like freelancer and upwork are
and PHP
amazing for NGO or also known as goal
and really powerful can use a lot of
your course and a lot of big companies
are looking forward for the engineers of
golang number three are really kind of a
rival for python use quite a lot of
machine learning as well as well as for
data visualization so yes it's stealing
a limelight of Python a little bit
number two C++ implementation in game
development as well as for high end
research like NS three this language had
to be here
number one SQL are also known as sequel
really the heard of the internet still
and a lot of projects which are still in
MySQL or somehow related sequel is the
way how you query to the database not
specifically the programming language
but still the hottest trend on stack
overflow so had to be mentioned here so
this was my top five list of programming
language that you should be looking
forward to learn in 2018 you have full
right to disagree with me and I
completely respect your opinion there is
always a thing about programming
language some people favor one
programming language some people favor
other programming language and it's
completely fine completely okay don't
forget to check out the link in the
description below to download the learn
code online app for iOS and Android as
well
there are also some of the links in the
description below to learn these
programming language so that's it for
this video I hope you have enjoyed it do
share it with your friends so that they
can also know what's going on what's
trendy in the programming market that's
it for this video and I'll surely catch
you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
