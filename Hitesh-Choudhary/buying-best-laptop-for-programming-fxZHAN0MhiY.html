again with another video in this video
I'm going to touch up onto a very
different subject but I am getting this
in a lot of comments a lot of emails so
that is why we need to take care of this
topic which is the best programming
laptop that you can buy or in other
words which is the best laptop that you
can buy for the coding purposes so we
are going to answer that in much detail
in this video so let's get started here
in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps and
developing and designing all of such
things and everything related to
technology so in case you are new here
consider subscribing in today's video I
want to talk about a very different and
very subjective topic which is the best
laptop that you can buy for programming
purposes now let's get started by saying
that if you can afford the best laptop
with i7 processor heaviest possible
graphic card lots of RAM then of course
it's not a problem it's not a creation
for you but for the rest of the guys
let's try to answer what should be the
best laptop that you can buy for coding
purposes or programming purposes now the
first thing is that whether do you have
existing laptop or you want to just buy
your first one then it's going to be
again a different question now a lot of
people a lot of college going students
want to just buy a laptop because they
want to play games on that now if you
are on that case go ahead buy a new
laptop which is high-end there there is
no point of discussion with you because
you obviously want to play a lot of
games on that and that's fine completely
ok this is don't you say that hey I want
to do programming on that too as as well
as I want to play high-end games on that
that's not a discussion at all you are
just completely different from a change
on rate and you might want to watch some
other videos which talks about the
high-end game computers or just stuff
like that so go ahead do that now for
rest of the people let's get started by
making a few notes that what kind of
programming what you want to do on your
laptop so getting started with that now
before we even also begin with that let
me tell you that whatever laptop you
want to buy is actually slightly out of
your budget and that's completely ok it
happens to all of us we are humans and
it is an hour later that we always want
to buy the stuff which is little bit out
of our reach and that ok is completely
ok we will have to adjust a little bit
lower than that so keep in mind in that
that whatever laptop you really want to
buy is little bit out of your reach so
that's ok it happens all over the globe
it's not about you now coming back onto
the point Star
making notes on what kind of laptop you
want to buy now first point is whether
in the nearby future you want to do some
kind of iOS development or not whether
in the nearby future you might you
slightly might want to go in designing
the iOS app or the apps for the MacBook
or just like that or watch apps or
something like that in case you have
slightly mind of that no question at all
just buy a Mac device there it might be
a MacBook Air it might be a MacBook Pro
or the cheapest option is Mac Mini you
can go for that now keep in mind when
you go and visit to the store the Mac
Mini is going to be your cheapest option
because it's just a CPU there obviously
it's going to cost you a little bit
extra onto the screen the keyboard and
the mouse but still it's a Mac running
OS X that can be really helpful while
designing the iOS app now in case you
are onto the other range the else case
who really don't want to go for the iOS
app or something then obviously you can
leave the Mac because it's an expensive
thing and not everybody can afford that
but again make sure that if you can
afford it's a good piece of hardware
great performance but again obviously
you have to adjust a little bit onto the
Mac environment which is not at all
tough it's much more easier than the
windows consider this and it's much more
easier so don't just get afraid that I
don't want to go for the Mac and just
like that okay that's enough of the Mac
I'm not going to talk about the Mac much
more that because I think all the people
who I wanted to convince that yes it's a
good machine are already there now let's
talk about what kind of risk of the
programming you want to do now if in
your programming it's going to be lot of
usage of heavy end software's like Maya
3d or for the rendering of your scenes
you might want to go into game
development or mobile game development
or mobile app development just like that
these are your fields you definitely
need a good hardware there the hardware
should at least have a one gigabyte of
graphic cards and at least four or
preferably eight gigabytes of RAM there
this is the minimum requirement on the
hard disk I
I would say you can go for whatever the
minimum is there but in case there is an
option of SSD available or the fusion
drive is available go ahead for that
obviously it's going to cost a little
bit more money but again if in case your
programming is going to be related to
some kind of game development you need
your hardware to be high-end because
there is a lot of rendering being done
lot of processing being done with that I
would also say that on those machines
are running the software's like Adobe
Photoshop or InDesign or maybe
illustrator is completely easy and fast
working there but again in case you are
not in that genre and you will be
designing a lot of websites in PHP ASP
Python or maybe C C++ Java just like
that programmers you don't need that
kind of expensive hardware you can just
go for four gigs of ram and that's it
you don't need any graphic card although
it would be great but you can just work
without graphic card as well so any
laptop which is good for browsing
purposes is going to be good in case
you're designing simply websites in PHP
or WordPress or just like that so it's
completely okay now also with that I
would like to touch upon the Android
developers as well now people might be
thinking hey I might want to go into the
Android development what kind of
hardware should I buy for Android guys I
would say graphic card is again an
essential requirement for you although
on to the official people say hey you
can just go without that as well but I
don't believe so it's not at all
possible to work smoothly without the
graphic card on the RAM side I would say
go for the eight gigabytes of the ramp
although in my official video series on
the YouTube as well or the official
documentation it says three gigs or four
gigs is completely ok but trust me when
you run the simulators a couple of
simulators obviously you'll be testing
your app onto a couple of devices at
least then running these apps or
switching between the simulator is not
at all fun in three gigs of the RAM or
four gigs of the RAM so for the app
development for the game development is
it's needed that you need to have a
little bit high end of the computer now
I know buying a hardware is not the
cheapest option and especially in the
college days it's
it's not affordable but I personally
believe that while buying a new hardware
is not an expense it's the investment
that you are making on yourself as soon
as you learn that you can just pay on
the installments just by a laptop on the
investment on the installments and later
on you can learn to design your own apps
or websites do a little bit of the
freelancing and can pay off that it's
really that easy but again I completely
do agree buying a new hardware is not
that easy it's little bit confusing but
I would say don't go for the company
specifics look out for what
specifications you are looking for don't
go that a sous is better than HP or HP
is better than Sony or Sony is better
than Dell at the end of the day what you
are paying for is the internal hardware
that you're looking for so don't go for
the brandish'd thing go for what you
really need and again if you are Windows
fan go for the windows if you're a Mac
then go for the max fan Mac kind of
stuff but again make sure you also
understand one thing that whenever you
buy a Windows laptop or something look
out for the cost that are extra there
now I never ever recommend the pirated
softwares and everything to go ahead
include the cost of your windows of
eight nine ten I guess mine is not there
eight or ten whatever you are planning
to buy your Microsoft Office if you are
planning to buy that as well as some
kind of other softwares like Photoshop
or whatever you are trying to buy make
sure you include that cost as well I
know I have talked quite a lot about the
laptops in this video specifically about
other programming I hope this video
helps you to sort out a few things but
again my advice would be make notes on
what kind of development you want to do
and show me you can discuss in the
comments section below or can drop me a
mail on Facebook so that we can make
more videos about your specific problems
as well with this I would say if you
have enjoyed this video then make sure
to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to
the channel as well and if you think
that this video can be helpful for
someone then make sure you share it on
your social accounts as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
