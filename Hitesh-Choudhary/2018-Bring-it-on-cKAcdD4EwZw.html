with on the video and welcome to 2018
within a few minutes or few hours 2018
is about to arrive 2017 was amazing year
for me and I hope for many of you it was
really a starting point of something new
if not yet 2018 is full of opportunities
I hope you have learned one thing from
2017 no matter how hard you work how
good the results came out or no results
at all
one thing is consistent the time they
were weights it's just gone like that in
this 2018 also I want you to make sure
that you remember that time is not gonna
be waiting for you once it's gone just
like that it's gone it's never gonna
come back but hey it's a new year it's a
new start
so regardless how much consistent you
were there in 2017 or how hard you were
trying and not getting result and all of
this just forget about all of them just
forget about that
it's 2018 it's a new start get started
fresh now whatever your goals are maybe
want to learn a programming language
want to become an iOS developer Android
developer maybe want to live a healthy
life whatever that is newer always comes
to just get started
fresh my journey of 2017 was amazing I
found a family on YouTube I was able to
push myself beyond the limits I thought
like handling clients and writing code
was like that's pretty much it
but I was able to somehow integrate
YouTube in my life and it got dissolved
so much well in my life that it has
become now a part of what I do every
single day so yes you can always push
yourself beyond the limit forget about
what happened bad things and all of
these it's a life everyone just like you
just like me everybody face some good
phases in life some bad phases of life
what life is all about keep moving and
yes of course we all think like we could
have done a lot more better in 2017 it's
it's like a feeling which is constant
for everybody but yes what we have done
we
best we could have just given our mole
things into it but whatever we have done
it's the best and it's gone so let's not
just worry about it let's think about
what is going to come in 2018 and one
thing is for sure what is going to come
in 2018 a lots and lots of opportunities
you know the good thing and the bad
thing about the time is it will never
remain same if you are experiencing bad
time in your life right now just be
happy because it's not going to remain
same if you are living a happy life
right now just be worried a little bit
because time is not going to remain same
throughout the life so just like I
always say the good part and the bad
part about the time is it's never gonna
remain constant and same it will change
in this upcoming 2018 I want you to come
along with me and push yourself beyond
the limits let's try together to make a
beautiful and wonderful 2018 let's try
to live a little bit better life by
working a little bit harder a little bit
harder on our healthy life a little bit
hard towards what we are already doing
whether it's a gym maybe you are looking
for a job maybe you are trying to learn
programming maybe you're trying to be a
better person whatever that is 2018 is
for sure gonna be full of opportunities
so let's work hard for that and try to
grab every single possibilities that is
about to come let's together work so
much hard in this 2018 so when the
December comes we can say ourselves that
yes we deserve a break we deserve a
grand party we worked so hard in 2018
but we have crushed down every single
goal and we deserve a big party this
time we will not be stopping by
circumstances we will not be stopping by
any single thing we will work hard we
will take down that challenge and we
will come out rising weather we have to
reduce one extra hour of our sleep or
whether we have to say no to that
amazing party that we want to go but one
thing is for sure we will be working so
hard that everyone
we'll be saying hey have you gone mad
and we'll be saying no this is not
madness you haven't seen us madness is
about to come be so much enthusiastic be
so much crazy about the thing that you
do that people say this guy is crazy
let's just not talk about it let's show
them our work maybe you want to become
an Android developer or iOS developer
don't say a word about it just get back
to computer start working so hard that
your apps say all about it maybe you
want to hit a healthy life maybe you
want to hit the gym don't say a word
about to anything and just make sure
people look at your physique and say yes
this is the guy who went nuts about it
and just crushed it down people might be
more hard-working than you people might
be more brilliant than you that one
thing that is under your control is
consistency and we're gonna beat
everybody with that consistency the only
moto that you should have in 2018 is do
it every single day just say it out loud
with me do it every single day all you
have to do is just join me up on the
Facebook and I'll be posting every
single day that have you done it today
and you just have to write day number in
the comments it doesn't cost you
anything but it cost you a big thing
which is determination which is
consistency which is the costliest thing
in the world nobody can buy it for sure
all I want you to do this year is work
so much hard that people just say this
is craziness I want you to experience
that madness this year come along with
me in this madness in this year and
together we're gonna crush down a lot of
things and for sure one thing is sure
you will be consistent and you're gonna
get a better life but actually you
deserve 2018 is coming up and all I have
to say is happy new year bring it on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
