another video in this video I'll give
you just one perfect tip if you are
confused about getting started with
programming let's get started with that
in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps and
pretty much everything related to
technology so in case you are new here
consider subscribing now I'll keep this
video short and precise now let's talk
about two type of people who are trying
to get started in programming the one
type of people who are dedicated towards
a motive let's just say they want to
design a very killer website or they
want to design a very awesome mobile app
now doing a lot of research for that
kind of person is completely okay
because they are bored or project
oriented they want to design an app they
want to design a website and if they are
trying to do a lot of research which is
perfect for them which is not so perfect
for them it's completely okay for them
and to the others this video is not
about them this video is about
completely opposite type of people who
want to get started with programming and
want to learn it not having a very big
motive they just want to learn
programming they are interested in that
and my number one and only tip to them
is just get started now I have seen a
lot of people getting worried about hey
should I be getting started with C
should I be getting started with Java
should I be getting started with PHP and
all these things now when I ask them
what is your end goal do you want to
design a product they say no I don't
have any specific product in mind and by
the way that's completely ok at this
point of time now they just say that I
don't have any specific project in mind
I just want to learn programming
programming impresses me Allah and if
programming impresses you quite a lot
why are you worried I have no particular
reason to describe it but you shouldn't
be worried about want to get started
with C that's completely ok want to get
started with Java that's ok
want to get started with PHP that's ok
too now all I'm saying is don't wait get
started now programming is a thing which
doesn't just automatically comes up
within a few weeks it takes a
a lot of time to understand the basic
concept of variables loops and functions
and moreover toward object-oriented
programming things like a polymorphism
and all those classes and object concept
takes some time so all I'm saying is
don't wait and don't get worried too
much about it's not like once you have
opted for C you cannot switch ever with
other languages obviously you can switch
on and only thing that's stopping you is
too much worrying so stop getting
worried about these things just get
started now in order to get started with
all of the languages there are a couple
of ways you can get started obviously
there are a lot of books there are a lot
of online tutorials a lot of online
courses and hey I'm not selling you
anything in here all I'm saying is just
get started
I personally am little bit biased
towards video based learning because I
think that is far more interactive for
you if you are looking up on this
channel - moreover learn about things
while I buy a video visuals then
obviously you are a visual based
learning and so I would recommend highly
to go on with some video based training
I am NOT saying behind my words are just
like that you can go ahead and choose
any one that is look good for you but
again coming back onto our topic just
get started okay that is the number one
thing that you are lagging behind so let
me know in the comments section below
that after watching this video how many
of you have stopped worried about the
things and have just got started and by
the way if you haven't yet subscribe to
subscribe because I usually go live and
YouTube has just given me a kind of a
feature that I can go like from my
mobile apps and that feature I have read
in the in the mail that is being live
for the people who have gone to 10,000
subscribers hey by the way we got the
10k subscribers so I do get life quite a
lot now and you can catch me up there so
this was just a quick intro there now in
case you think that this video was
awesome give it a thumbs up and in case
you think that this video can be helpful
for somebody but make sure you share it
as well and notify me in the comment
section below how many of you got
started with programming and what
language have you chosen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
