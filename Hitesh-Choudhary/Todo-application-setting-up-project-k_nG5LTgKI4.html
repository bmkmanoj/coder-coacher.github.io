code online Datsun and welcome back
again to another fresh new section of
JavaScript this is a brand new section
and in this section we are gonna use
whatever the knowledge we have learned
so far so now we have a little bit solid
understanding of how JavaScript works
and also we now understand how we can
target any any element or how we can
fetch that element and can create them
or delete them and stuff like that so
we're gonna be using that so now we are
gonna create a full-fledged to-do
application where user can enter an
input we're gonna display that as a list
item in our web page and also user will
be able to check mark that something
like this to do is done and also will be
able to delete all of the done or done
to do is now we will not be deleting all
of them I'll leave that as a simple
exercise for you but most of the part I
will be doing it once do the heavy
lifting and you can do some of your
assignments as well so let's get started
and we need to do some of the changings
in our code system because this is right
now serving on to our GS exercise file
as a base home folder and we don't want
to do that we want to create a separate
folder for our projects so let me open
up my GS exercise files and of course
all these files will be available to you
once we finish up this course I'll push
them to github or we'll give you the
links to download them anyways for now
these are not available but surely by
the time you'll be watching this video
and the course would be completed and
you will have an access of it so we're
gonna call this as project zero one so
this is something which I want to have
as a root folder so what I can do is I
can select my code vs code and create a
new window open a new window okay and
once I have this open new window that's
a nice purple color and I can just drag
and drop this project here and that's it
that's all the settings we need to do
okay let's have it so that the bottom
one doesn't really bother us there we go
so there we go we have our project zero
one section it has nothing inside it so
we're gonna create a couple of files
here so first of all is gonna be index
dot HTML we will not be bothered much
about the index tour
HTML because it's just HTML file and
this course is moreover dedicated to our
JavaScript also we need couple of more
files and that is gonna be style dot CSS
for styling purposes we will not be
focusing much of the Styles in fact I
would not be talking anything at all
about styling just will point out a
couple of things that you have to
implement there are compulsory apart
from that feel free to explore your own
styling stuff or maybe from my front-end
developer bootcamp okay and obviously we
need one more made file which is gonna
be our to do dot J s or some people like
to call it as script or Qi as so however
you like it feel free to explode it that
way now go into your index or HTML and
we're gonna press exclamatory and hit
the tabs since Emmet is already
installed or comes as a default in my
code I can just quickly get a
boilerplate code and we're gonna call
this as title as simple to do
application there we go
okay that should be it and what I would
like to do is add my styling files so
after just the title maybe before that
we are gonna link Colin's CSS and there
we go style dot CSS so in case you are
wondering how this is getting all things
work out this is Emmet I do have a free
course on Emmet online code online make
sure you check that out to write all
these HTML exactly faster as I do also
in my style dot CSS I'm gonna say first
of all I'm gonna select the body and I'm
gonna say BGC for background color to be
red and this is just for the testing
purpose don't worry we will not be using
such kind of a very vibrant color in the
to do dot GS I would like to simply
write a script that says alert and that
is gonna say connected so that I can be
sure that everything is connected what
I'm expecting is body should become
turned into red and we should get a
pop-up that says connected but we
haven't connected our star our script as
well so we are gonna be connecting it at
the body and we're gonna have a script
there we go
and this is script is gonna have a
source that is gonna be to do J s so
everything is already connected
you can just get lost here and we can
just get started here these pop-ups
sometimes annoys me and still I'm
creating one anyways let's just roll it
up here and on the index now I can start
my life server and actually you know
what I can just close this down and I
can just turn it off okay we don't need
it and probably my life server is from
where I can start my life server okay I
think I need to go back here and can
figure it out that how can I start my
life server and there we go and we can
start the life server let me just look
at the documentation page everybody
looks and it says it's here but not in
my case okay probably let's just say
what we're gonna do is open workspace
probably because of that it's not having
it and there we go still opened up but
nothing shows up here I think we can
look into documentation a little bit but
that's not a big deal I can figure it
out a little bit later there was some
documentation written here and okay so
it is here we can start that following
the server okay come on there is some
open live server we can right click on
the editor and choose the options that
is actually nice right click and open
with live server that is nice so see
reading the documentation always pays
off
so there we go our script is being
loaded and color turns red and that is
really really a vibrant color so there
we go everything is connected I can just
close this extension and there we go now
in the next video what we'll be doing
will be writing our HTML script so that
we can have a base structure for that
for the styling I will be writing some
of the styling part I will be showing
you that but will not be discussing much
of it as this is not a course for CSS
okay so that's it for this video and
let's catch up in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
