WordPress series in this video we're
gonna learn how we can install WordPress
and that's it nothing more nothing less
and that's it now I hope you have
watched the previous videos in the
continuation because it's really
important that you learn how to install
these servers like Apache MySQL PHP and
stuff like that so we're gonna learn how
we can do that and let me just show you
what you need I have already told you
that what we're gonna need in the
previous video but just for the
formality sake of go to wordpress.org
not wordpress.com go to wordpress.org
and make sure to click on this download
WordPress and then click on this blue
button it's a very small size file like
8 MB very tiny one and we have already
learned how we can install the samp and
everything for these guys now just on to
again a side note in case you haven't
watched the video for the Mac guys go
ahead watch that and the in case make
sure that when you hit this go to
application let me bring that up back
again when you hit the PHP myadmin you
should be able to see this this is
important in case you're facing some
issues go ahead watch the videos in that
videos I have told you in the detail
that how you can mount the volume and
once you mount that click on the
Explorer go to EDC extra and open up
this as httpd slash zamp
- config and replace one very simple
line of code which is at line number 20
usually say is require and says make
sure you edit that after require it says
localhost but you change that to all and
granted this is required and again after
that make sure you do hit a reload a
restart of the entire server process so
that changes become active okay we're
gonna keep that aside for a minute now
make sure you have downloaded the zip
file and I have downloaded a zip file
it's somewhere let me open that up there
we go
so when you'll be extracting the file
this is what you're gonna get and we
will be talking what this is all about
which are the important files which are
not so important files should be deleted
and all these things later up about
right now these are the all things that
you are gonna require the important
folder is WP dash admin
it has a lot of stuff a lot of cool
stuff which we're gonna explore
obviously and that's all what you have
now how you can install the WordPress on
any website is let's explode that and
we're gonna go to okay let's find the
folder where that is let's explore that
and inside that folder you have to look
for htdocs and inside this folder you
can create a folder name whatever you
like to have now I'm going to create a
new folder for let's just say L Co
let me know in the comments what is LC
you're here okay and open this folder up
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
copy this entire content and we're gonna
copy this and paste that inside this LC
oh it's a very small copy and paste
thing should not be taking much longer
in case my computer doesn't hang up
there I hope so
okay there we go finally has started
it's just a 23 MB not a big deal and
since it has a lot of just files files
and files the completion is gonna take a
little bit while not much usually the
bigger files are easy to move the small
small files are a little bit they take
little time okay
so let's wait for a couple of seconds I
won't be fast forwarding this time
because it's so it's not much long you
get that okay now let's launch up our
application go to application I have
gone through application quite a number
of times okay and let's explore that in
a full screen I'm gonna close all of the
rest of the things we don't require that
now what you have to do instead of the
dashboard you have to say whatever the
folder name is it in this case it's lco
so see it saves you a couple of things
welcome to wordpress and you will need
to know the following items before going
in proceeding it requires you to proceed
with the database name a database user
database password database host and
table prefix I welcome to onto that
where you can edit that where you can
find all of that first of all I'm gonna
say let's go okay so in this case the
database name default one is WordPress
don't recommend that to you go on with
the defaults but right now let's just go
with the default and I'll tell you where
are the places where you can actually
edit these
if you edit them right now that's
completely okay so let's go ahead and
let's just try to hit a submit now we
are gonna face a couple of errors but we
are gonna deal them up so let's just hit
the submit and notice the username
password are correct so we're gonna try
again okay now what is happening and in
case you haven't edited anything like
that so I'm gonna copy this and I'm
gonna show you the MySQL so let's just
go for the PHP myadmin there we go now
this PHP myadmin has a password to
access and there are some user name and
password as well for example the user
here is root at the rate localhost
so our user here is local is root and it
doesn't have any password unless you
have set explicitly a password there so
it is requiring for that now also it is
saying that you need to create a new
kind of database here to work on with
that don't worry if you have no idea at
all I'll explain that in a mess in a
second but for example they just say our
username is actually root and we don't
have any password so we're gonna delete
that and our database host is localhost
so that's completely fine so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna hit submit now
again and notice it's saying that we
were able to connect to the database
server this x means your username and
password is okay this time but we're not
able to set any database and why is it
so because there was no database with
the name of WordPress there okay get
that let's try again
okay now although the process of
installing the WordPress is pretty fine
but I want you to understand each and
every basics of why the things are
happening okay so let's just go ahead
click on to the new and we're gonna
create a new database name and we're
gonna call this as let's just call this
as lco press and you can write them in
all short or in all cases it's totally
dependent on you I'll prefer the lower
cases else you press just like WordPress
LC you press it's a good name and I'm
gonna copy this and I'm gonna hit create
whatever the things are the default
things are let's just be that and let's
just create the database I don't need to
create any tables or any values or any
field and inside
that let's just go in the default okay
now finally coming out to this this time
we're gonna press that the database name
is Elsie oppress our username is root we
don't have any password so I'm going to
delete that our host is localhost and
the table prefix is WP underscore now I
will come on to that what is the stable
prefix right now all of our information
is now perfectly okay and you have
learned how to go with that so notice
why this PHP myadmin is super helpful
and why I told you all the things before
handed so that you can reach to the PHP
myadmin
hit the submit this time and notice it
say sorry I can't write that right the
WP config file and you have to manually
create an act add these information so
what is happening again and after we
have done that you can hit the run
install okay okay I can understand your
frustration but let me also try to
explain what is happening so now we're
gonna go into zamp
okay not this one this guy and we're
gonna go into our htdocs and where we
have pasted all the files notice there
are a couple of files here okay and the
important file here is it says WP dash
config - sample very very important file
this file contains all the configuration
information about your root localhost
and all these things which we have been
trying to hit from the local host
environment and that graphical view so
what we're gonna do is first thing is
make sure you rename this file in my
case I can just hit enter and rename on
the windows right-click and rename we're
gonna remove this sample here okay hit
the that's the first rename being done
now what we're gonna do is we are gonna
right click onto this and we're gonna
open that in any of your editor I'm
gonna open that in sublime text and
there we go okay now in the sublime text
you can see there are a couple of
information database name database user
password host character set and Colet we
don't need to worry much about it what
we're gonna do is we're gonna first of
all paste the database name which is lco
press what is our database user here
our database user is route okay done
what is our database password we don't
have a database password not a good
practice but let's just say we don't
have a password right now our host is
localhost so we're gonna save this right
now
now finally we are gonna do and hit run
install now you will notice that now the
installation is done it's almost done
it's just the formality that we have to
do now so what is the site title let me
just go with the site title as LC oh
okay
the user name it's gonna be the user
name from which you're gonna be
enrolling I'm going to call this as 8h
you can use a little bit a complex one
there and we're not gonna be using a
strong password because this is just a
demonstration here so I'm gonna go with
one two one two
and a a just like that so confirm I
confirm I'm using a weak password
because I don't want to create a lengthy
password and always have to fill up that
now email address is gonna be useful
when you're gonna forget your password
and it's gonna reset the password on
that I'm gonna put up my email address
there everybody knows that a t-shirt hit
a shot recom I don't want my you can
just check mark it if you are just using
it for a test site so the search engine
doesn't populate that on to their web
pages totally on you now just hit on to
make sure that you keep the eye on the
username and the password because we are
gonna be using that so let's just
install the WordPress and within a
second you harden out and that's it I
know we have taken a lot of time in
installation but these are things
required you should be understanding
that now as soon as I hit the login
notice its URL then it says lco then it
says WP - login now there are a lot of
debates and that you should remove this
developer login or WP dash admin some
people will say that hey these are
completely ok because it this is just a
login like Facebook and as soon as long
as you are using complex username and
password it's completely ok some people
will say use some plug-in and move it to
on to a different URL totally on to your
choice I usually move that and also use
the strong password so we're gonna
choose that hit H and that's my username
and the password that we are gonna be
using is one two one two AAA I already
use that password that week and let's
just hit the login
there we go finally we are done okay
WordPress is done but how does our
WordPress looks like when it's out there
okay so let's just see and we're gonna
remove this WP admin and we're gonna see
how our website looks like this is our
website looks like not bad just within a
few seconds of install okay so one last
thing that I would like to recommend to
you is open this WP dash config file and
you'll see a couple of art keys and
these things are there so what you have
to do is go to on this link this guy
slash salt and as soon as you install
this WordPress go to this salt guy and
copy copy all the things which are
mentioned here and just make sure you
paste them exactly same here now every
time you're gonna be hitting a reload
there are new values being generated and
you will also notice we have been now
logged out if I hit a reload it will
automatically log you out so this is the
important process we will learn more
about how the securities and things and
how we can change the table prefix and
all these things later on for sure but
this is just a basic how you can install
the WordPress so that's it for this
video in the next video we are going to
explore what are these files what each
file does means and how the plugins and
themes a lot of things are about to come
so that's it for this video and I'll
surely catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
