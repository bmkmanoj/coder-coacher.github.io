wait for a few moments so that people
can join up can ask their questions and
just like that so wait for a few seconds
hi vague hi they go really good to see
you people all at every Sunday it's
amazing to be on Sunday like let's wait
for a few seconds or a few minutes so
that we can build some audience can
answer your questions and in the
meantime keep joining and keep hitting
that like button so that I can see that
you are joining up oh that was quick
within a few seconds we have crossed
over a hundred Watchers or a light
people here and we are building up so
that's good we are building up a good
community who joins up me every Sunday I
am trying my best to answer all of your
questions and a lot of things are under
plans so that is going to be amazing and
I might share a couple of insights from
learned code online what we are what I'm
planning right now there are a lot of
good news that are coming up so stay
tuned with us okay so hey everybody good
to see you okay so we have got a pretty
good audience almost across 150 there
okay so hey coach hey Arjun hey shake
hey vineeth how are you how is it going
on okay so let's try to answer a few of
your questions you can throw up your
questions I'll try my best to pick up a
lot of them and we'll try to answer them
but if your question is not getting
answered don't worry you can always
paint me at Facebook or you can join up
in others
we do sending lives every single Sunday
so let's get started here don't forget
to hit that like button that's an
indicator for me to see that yes you
have joined up and I should continue
these Sunday lice okay so the question
starts why you always wear the same
t-shirt in all videos it's not just in
videos I wear the same t-shirt for
everything regardless if it is my
birthday I have to go to a party maybe
travels foreign trips whatever that is
it's it's just this thing and it makes
me much more focused okay say something
about how to keep patients in bug bounty
ok the that's an interesting
question now this is the only thing that
I don't like about the bug bounties now
bug bounties are awesome
they are pretty nice way of proving up
your skills but relying totally on them
is not a good thing and why is it so
because when you find a bug at some
website let's just say you found an SQL
injection or maybe cross-site scripting
or maybe CSR whatever you have find out
you report that bug now obviously you
put that bug through a channel like
hacker Earth or there are dozens of
channels so through those websites now
it's totally on that website how much
they are going to pay to you they might
pay you like five hundred dollars or
fifty dollars or just a lousy t-shirt so
that's the thing I don't like about them
because there is no stability of the
income let's just say for example I'm
making a website or a mobile app for a
client I just say hey I'm gonna charge
$700 for this and that's a negotiation
let's just say he says no I'm gonna pay
600 and whatever that is it's done it's
final and it's totally on me how to
charge them for my skills or for my
service but in bounty hunting that's
nothing so that's the thing I don't like
about the bug bounty but again it's a
good skill to enhance your skill but
don't totally rely on that just do it
for a couple of fun things and that's it
because what they are paying to you is
availing paying just fifty dollars for
finding attacks like SQL or cross-site
scripting is very low but again since
you are not hired that's the max you are
going to get so that's my thoughts about
bug
okay again I could be wrong but these
are just my thoughts I'm trying not
trying to justify that I am totally
correct I just try to prove what I think
about it okay so I hope you don't take
it otherwise at lunch bro yep I just
finished up my lunch I like to have an
iced tea with lunch as well I'm a big
fan of iced tea don't know why and I
don't know when I became of that big fan
I love black coffee and iced tea totally
crazy about it
so just did that okay please give advice
um game designing I'm a good at
programming and story design ah that's
good nice arm that you are good in story
designing because all the games are
heavily reliable on story designing now
since you're good in programming I would
recommend you to focus a little bit on C
shop and you can go with the unity now
there are other game engines like unreal
and a lot of others but unity is booming
quite a lot and for a new game developer
or indie game developer it's a good
choice so focus a little bit on game
physics as well it's not your usual
physics by Etsy Verma or something it's
a different physics yes it does follow
all the rules like gravity collisions
and everything but it's far more easier
to understand them in unity again if you
just want to get started as kind of
indie developer for mobiles you can also
try out couple of other things
especially the sprite kit in iOS is easy
but I would highly recommend to check
out unity and for that you have to get
friendly in the sea shop ok so I hope
this answers your questions ok rishabh
says I like your teaching thank you so
much I'm always always really happy to
see their appreciation coming up and I'm
trying to make a difference and trying
to make sure that people love what
actually the programming is ok so how to
build a server for Android app why do
you actually need a server that's a big
question because you can also do a lot
of things on firebase itself it's by
Google Android is by Google so they are
both highly compatible just
few clicks you can do all of that but
again let's just say you have some needs
of getting a server up and running I
would recommend to go with the Amazon
web server AWS and on that Amazon
instance just try to put a parse there
and parse is a project being developed
by Facebook so upload that and just
tweak out a little bit I think that's
the easiest and the most scalable
solution that you can have okay oh how
can I get a job as an apple developer in
Apple that's gonna be depending on your
resources on LinkedIn your profile what
kind of code you can write what kind of
app you have designed in the past what
is your command over the skills so it's
a lot of factors there okay I'm a Kali
Linux users starting Java suggest me
best text editor for Java go with the
IntelliJ
I used to work on Eclipse then I
switched for a couple of days on
NetBeans I didn't like that I would
highly suggest go with IntelliJ even in
the community the free edition is very
superior than anything I have seen again
my personal views so go ahead try that
out okay your channel is great hello
Shaboom thank you so much for being on
the channel that's it is growing sure it
is a growing channel and it's growing
with a lot of speed I didn't thought
that kind of speed is gonna come up on
this channel but yes it's it's going
really really amazingly sharp I like it
I like it okay
I took coaching of Java but I'm unable
to understand that please suggest me
some other language if you are not
comfortable with the Java go ahead try
out web development bootcamp I have seen
that a lot of people who are not good in
programming like Java or Python they
feel really good and amazing in web
development it's not like there is only
one class of programming the scripting
part and everything back in part is
completely different the front-end part
is different so I've seen I've seen
these people who don't like Java Python
or C or that kind of program
language they feel really happy in front
end so go ahead visit learn code online
dot in and check that out and just onto
a sidebar update now the learned code
online is completely on HTTP it was a
shaky move bumpy ride to transform
everything from HTTP to HTTPS but we did
it finally really good job there so
check that out ok and did you forget to
hit the like button there I think a lot
of you did
so go ahead hit that like button I want
to see that bump see that number rising
up okay it's going up thank you so much
which is the best programming language
for web page development web page
development if you just drill it down it
just always comes down to HTML CSS and
JavaScript and that's the basic whole
base scenario on top of that you can
sprinkle a little bit I like a bootstrap
or flex box or some jQuery plugins so
it's all about how much you're gonna
sprinkle it's gonna glow up like that so
base always drills down to HTML CSS and
JavaScript but don't forget to sprinkle
a little bit of jQuery as well it makes
things amazing okay how to get started
on code share code chef is easy if you
know how to build logics and everything
so eventually with the time just try to
get things like solving the problems and
everything so go and try that are you
trying to be marked by varying grey
t-shirt no I cannot become mark by
wearing just by a grey t-shirt he's a
big guy big gigantic fundings and stuff
if I'll become just like a few times of
it a little bit tiny I would be happy he
is the prodigy I cannot be like that but
still I'm happy with what I am and
there's a lot of history behind these
t-shirts so maybe someday I'm gonna talk
about it ok so i am ENT c student ok
this is a question by Shubham but i want
to do career in machine learning and
data science how do I start ok the very
first thing very
first thing to do get started in machine
learning and data science get your hands
at python obviously you can go and get
started with our as well but I recommend
to go get started with Python there is
an amazing course at learn code online
dot and check that out but again if you
want to get started with machine
learning make sure you have your solid
hand at mathematics now I'm not talking
about the ordinary mathematics like
linear algebra or something you should
be really good in something like Fourier
transforms and neuron neural network
building up and all these things it
looks very interesting but it's not that
much easy trust me
machine learning is not a cup of tea for
everyone it requires a solid hand over
maths and a lot of theorems and
probability and linear algebra and
Fourier transforms and all these things
are required so make sure you do
understand just by seeing that hey it
looks impressive I'm gonna go with that
it's not like that make sure you
research a little bit a curriculum go
ahead check out the index of a couple of
books on machine learning and you will
realize it's not easy it's not easy
surely doable but not that easy okay
looks like you just woke up oh yeah I
was I was working late night just got up
about a couple of hours ago and then had
my lunch and just what I was working was
something amazing I'm working on an
Android app that I'm planning to roll
out very soon let's see how that goes up
probably I'm speeding up my word -
almost like 14 hours or 16 hours a day
so that I can push this app maybe within
this week it's a gigantic app but I hope
it's gonna work out that so it's gonna
be a good news don't want to just throw
up everything right now because things
are not stable but yes very soon you're
gonna see an app so let's see Rahul say
is hi how are you I'm good Rahul how are
you doing please give an advice for game
design okay we have already answered
that okay
please make some video on SEO yes surely
we can do videos and s
because if you did notice we have
recently moved in an Indian ranking to
almost 13,000 which is a big big
achievement for a website which is just
three months old is moving and crushing
down all the websites and moving
adjuster on to the top in Alexa ranking
so surely we don't know a couple of
stuffs about SEO and everything surely
some videos on SEO can come up ok so I
love hi there hi mad engineer hi Raju hi
her okay so what about angularjs
angularjs is amazing Tech in order to
get started with angularjs first get
your hands really really deep in
JavaScript not just any JavaScript
JavaScript and es6 version which is the
latest version of that on top of that
with angular you have to learn
typescript as well so these are a couple
of hurdles before getting started with
angularjs on top of that you have to
move quickly with angular because things
moves really fast in angular and you
have to learn quickly quickly quickly
just like that so there is an
alternative for angular which is react
comparable to angular so you can also
try that out okay have lovely Sunday
yeah we have do a couple of plans for
Sunday maybe they're gonna go out with
friends or something
right now nothing so much decided but
yes we always try I always try myself a
to have some food and just some chitchat
with friends and smell it like that so I
like it I like it battery is it
necessary to stick to one language only
no it's not at all a good thing I won't
even recommend but doesn't don't take me
my words and other sense what I'm saying
is once you have learned it take stick
to it until and unless you have mastered
it by master I means you have created a
couple of projects in that once you have
done that you can explore other
languages because once you're
comfortable with one language it's
really easy to move in
language okay which laptop is best for
me by a MacBook Pro it's really
expensive but I like it okay
best monitor size for web developers for
coding okay I'm gonna see my views there
you may disagree you may disagree what I
think is best setup for learning
anything or designing the web or maybe
editing videos is a two screen setup so
by two monitors just actually not big
gigantic just a resolution of 1920 by
100 years ear oh so put them side by
side and I found that at one wid at one
screen the videos running at one screen
you're writing your code or at one
screen there is your web browser and one
screen there is your code so it's far
more easier setup again not a cheap one
but I find it best solution okay I'm a
kali linux user studying java so suggest
be best accelerator and some tricks to
learn as well no I don't believe in
tricks and tips like how hard this
whatever this trick I don't believe in
them I am a coding type of a guy who
likes to write code execute that and
expect expected result okay so I don't
believe in tricks in tips I call me
what's your salary you never tell um I
don't like to discuss how much I earn or
what I'm making with YouTube or what I'm
making with the clients or it's enough
for living a happy life and afford a
Harley Davidson and some foreign travels
it's a decent not gigantic I'm not
making a huge fortune I'm not a multi
billionaire here but it's decent it's
good enough and I think that's it C
sharp or Java which is better there is
no such thing as better or worst both
language are amazing so travelogue what
does mean by scripting language there
are a few language which can do a really
good kind of scripting like a Python is
one of them Ruby is there shell
scripting survey
so these are meant for most of the time
back end kind of a job but maybe I'll do
some videos on a scripting language what
they actually are so just like that okay
oh okay
let's pick up another question here I'm
a program big nerd best of luck for you
Karthik and is dotnet course useful I I
did try to learn dotnet in my graduation
I think probably in second year or
almost in third year I did learned it
little bit I didn't liked it so I left
it there and after that didn't face any
dotnet kind of a demand or just like
that probably it's just me I don't like
dotnet I don't like it okay how to get
internship third year I'm gonna make a
video on internship and I'll show you
what the reality of actually the
internship people a lot of people
believe an internship they're gonna
learn no internship is not for learning
internship is for working there okay by
working I means you should know the
stuff before you applying for the
internship okay I'm gonna make a video
on internship very soon I have a very
interesting email being thrown up to me
showing what's the actual reality of the
internship and probably you should watch
that it's going to come up on the
channel very soon did you forget to hit
the like button I can see the light
count is not going up hey guys show some
love hit that like and cheers okay so
looks like a lot of things are going on
in computer and you can see some results
on the app very soon it has been a
successful compiled there okay so I'm
asking a lot of a long time but still
not answer my question this time please
okay my question is how to improve my
problem solving skills and
that any book for this thank you okay
Krishna there is no such big book that
is going to increase your
problem-solving skills
and definitely not aptitude and all
these books are going to help problem
solving skills comes with project
because in the project you face
different kind of situation you have to
deal with them up so if you want to
become a good programmer you want to
improve your logic building skills you
have to have to stop doing all those
programs that adds metrics that finds
out even or odd stop doing those kinds
of small scale work go into something
big start designing something big or big
project wherever you are working in java
javascript HTML CSS PHP wherever you are
working start building something big
that is useful stop writing the code for
matrix and all that if you are just
gonna printing those patterns it's it's
not gonna work
it's not gonna help you in building your
logic skills start working on some real
life projects okay is machine learning
is the future there's no such thing as
this technology only is going to be the
future yes surely it's gonna get a lot
of demand in the future but it's not
just one stuff how to get hired for the
first time freelance
it's a struggle it's a struggle it's not
that easy I'll be honest with you
getting hired on the freelancer website
operating the starting days it's a
struggle and on top of that you have to
play a little bit of games sometime as
well I like getting your first review
for rating getting your first project by
some known guys you have to play a
little bit like that and once you have
proved that you have got a portfolio you
know your job how to do that it's rather
easier in the future and also if you
maintain the quality of the code and you
will do
on some technology which are not so
common you get behind like for example
if you are good in designing the web
you're gonna get paid like a $200 or
$300 for a project if you're good in
designing Android apps you're gonna get
paid like four and a half you're gonna
get like 600 or $700 if they're good in
iOS app you're gonna get like 800 or 900
so it's a little bit higher not much and
if you can give any client like both
like an iOS app an Android app for a
client you're gonna get much higher than
that and what you're gonna get is like
$1500 or $1200 for just one project so
it depends on your skill okay
any prerequisite for your Android course
now I'm planning to purchase your course
that's I'm clarifying there is no such
predict you set for that course if you
are aware with the programming in the
previous days that's surely going to
help but if you're not aware of
programming or loops or function anytime
soon I highly recommend to check out my
learn C as your first programming
language first and then you can move
into the Android again the Java and apps
are all are included in the Android
course so do check it out okay if you
still face any problem with that
you can always pick me up okay please
shout out our names Kishan and Feroz hey
there
and sir we are learning from lco thank
you so much for teaching us maybe we'll
meet you if we'll get a chance to come
Jaipur I'm about to travel quite a lot
so a Bangalore Goa is planned and
probably if I'll be there I'll try to
meet you up okay so I'm receiving a lot
of emails as well okay a lot of emails
how to determined Android want to sell
my Android app to other organization
there is no such thing to decide pricing
for AB depends on how much you have
worked on it how much features this app
is gonna do it's a personal decision you
may sell it for thousand dollars or ten
thousand dollars it's totally up to you
hi Oliver hi hello sir and rusty how are
you nice to see your first time why
hey thank you so much for being on life
I do Sunday lies to solve your questions
and problems and it has been almost two
months now I guess every Sunday haven't
missed any so do I need to learn Java to
start with cuddling if you will have a
base of Java it's gonna be much more
easier for you to get started in Kotlin
but you can start directly with that as
well how to deal with errors in any
coding there is no such rule book or a
guideline book to help you in problems
in or errors with the coding it just
comes with the time you have to learn
how to solve that how do you how to get
your first freelance project we just
talked about it native versus react
native okay let me tell you this mr.
Mahesh working with the native apps and
react native is different okay let us
say you want to build an app that uses
something like maybe machine learning or
augmented reality for that I would go
for the native app but if if I'll think
for a business perspective then react
native makes sense for a lot of
organizations especially for example if
you'll see that react like Netflix
Netflix upload a lot of content on their
website and obviously they want their
user to get an access of that content
web by mobile app as well for them react
need it makes sense
let's go to maintain you don't have to
maintain for each platform like for iOS
and Android it's it's far more or less
so for some organization like Facebook
they have a lot of heavy traffic on
Facebook website so they want to
transfer that traffic to web application
so for some organization react native
really makes sense but for others they
can always jump into the just native
apps but again do take care of the
costing because you have to set up a
team for Android you have to set up a
team for iOS and then the maintenance
issues and app updating and a lot of
things are there again it it depends on
what kind of project you are doing what
kind of organization you are working
okay so how is material UI not a big fan
of material UI it
good initial days I was really impressed
with that now I'm not a big fan of
material UI design it's too blocky block
block everywhere CS alrighty which is
better they go hand in hand they are all
amazing ok please post a course on
machine learning with Python on your
website hi and chill yes there are plans
going on that machine learning but it's
not easy to post a course on machine
learning
until and unless you are involved
already in machine learning in a big
project because it requires a lot of
clarification of machine learning and
mathematics and all of that yes you may
see that up in future but not in
upcoming three months for the next three
months
there is totally different is being
going on so not at least for three
months so Intel G or endo studio for big
nuts if you want to just learn Java
Intel J if you want to go ahead with
Android development Android studio any
day oh okay how to get started in
ethical hacking I do have a course on
ethical hacking and weapon testing as
well as web bug bounty hunting and
everything go check that out at learn
code online dot in ok Rajan's
I hope I answered your question give me
a laptop why don't you give me a million
dollar and I'll give you gift you a
laptop ok how does that sound ok oh hey
sir after a long time I'm seeing you so
hey back welcome back ok so a lot of
questions are getting repeated there
what I'm trying to pick up the questions
ok so questions are getting repeated why
do you prefer PHP for small projects
only no it's it's not like that you can
always go get started with the PHP for
big scale projects as well but a lot of
new people are coming up new
organization are using things which are
more advanced like nodejs or reaction
so you can always try that but again
there is no such thing as you cannot use
PHP I prefer and I recommend that to use
node.js for a big scale projects but
again you can always go get started with
the PHP it can scale quite a lot quite a
big but yes I would like to work on a
project which is unknown GS rather than
PHP oh okay Shiva means back again in
another life hey Shiva
that was good hi this this is Kiran hey
Kiran how are you hey - there are so
many programming language so which one
should have to choose you want to choose
one for which you are interested in
making a project so if your goal is
making an Android app go with the Java
if you are interested in making an iOS
app go with the Swift for web dev choose
JavaScript it depends it depends on what
you really want to do and what's your
end goal don't learn programming like
madly I just want to learn programming
and I'm gonna get started with that no
don't do that
first think out what you want to build
what you want to create okay so
high-tech tube hello they said good
afternoon good afternoon to you a junkie
ah that's a nice name okay I am B e
computer science fresher 2017 dropped
out that's bad I don't know why you did
that can I take a full stack developer
course mean stack through some Institute
or work on it because I want it to be a
full stack developer I know Java for
full stack developer you can try my
complete front-end developer course and
then react to use for back-end that's
how you go how to integrate video
calling in Android hmm that's
interesting and ever thought about it
probably I have to look up in some api's
maybe Skype gives you some API s or you
have to look up for third-party solution
I haven't thought of that
given its try that would be worth taking
okay okay please make video on your
daily programming routine it's it's an
exhaustive routine and keeping in camera
in between that it would be really
really
still for me because most of the time
it's just a chair me sitting up but on
top of that I spend a lot of time in
working out as well almost two hours
every single day and then most of the
time goes on this chair my decoder on
this computer like that it's not going
to be much interesting so that's why I
don't do that okay so hardly right
didn't went on to write today because I
got busy with the new Android app that
you'll see very soon so that's why I
didn't got for a ride today some people
are asking me to speak in Hindi but
don't they understand a lot of people
are from other parts of India especially
the southern part which don't understand
the Hindi so Hindi is not just the only
language on the planet but English is
far more easy for communication okay I
have no kind of a preference for any
language as long as you understand me
that's okay that's good okay
please reply me bin bin des without
words name I don't know PHP has a right
future obviously PSP is not going
anywhere
Etsy Verma seems like you appeared for
IIT je no I didn't appeared for iit je I
went appeared for air Tripoli which is
an exam which don't happen anymore I
think it's it's gone I did scored really
well in that my rank was almost like
4000 or something it was not like I was
in the top ten or something I was in
4000 or something didn't like that exam
pattern on everything this is too much
going on didn't prepared for any IIT and
everything but let me just point out
this thing that I have delivered a lot
of lectures especially in iit bombay and
iit guwahati and a lot of an IDs
countless nids i have delivered lecture
on programming
so yes I'm quite frequent there and I
can see a lot of likes coming up
automatically thank you so much and how
people are just hitting the likes
without me saying that and in case you
haven't done that go ahead do that I
always love to see that number rising up
that like button it is not going to cost
you anything it's gonna make me happy
and smiling so go ahead do that okay how
to make a website and then I have hosts
and a domain name whatever the website
you have created and just pack that up
upload that on a web server look for
that www folder and that's it it's
simple it's super easy so your front-end
developer bootcamp course is awesome
thank you so much I always appreciate
that
when machine learning course will be
coming on LC not soon not in this three
month maybe after that sir what is
front-end and back-end developer
probably I'll make I'll write a blog for
that maybe it would be better okay to
start with react native it's necessary
to learn our react GS it's not heavily
compulsory but you'll feel right at home
right at home after learning react GS I
would say if you have a knowledge of
react yes moving to react native we'll
just takes max a week maximum week
because all the concepts are almost
saying okay can I be a millionaire by
programming surely no big deal at least
a million rupees in India that's easy
that's easy with programming not a big
deal okay
so do on Python Django oh yeah Python
Django is amazing probably we can try
that out someday has PHP a bright Fisher
obviously how to get hired first time
okay questions are getting repeated okay
a lot of questions thanks thank you so
much
hi Akshay how are you hi talented tuber
okay that's an amazing male talented
tuber TT that's awesome
love Kumar hi sir how are you
okay ha Kevin okay I don't know how to
spell it but I think it's Kevin hey
Kevin what what is your internet speed
not good not good it's just 16 Mbps I'm
not used to that speed because in some
part of the globe I travel I find really
amazing speed like 50 Mbps or 60 Mbps
it's at least a minimum 16 Mbps right
now I am I'm on an errand line which is
far more reliable and compared to other
local vendors it's decent
not amazingly good sometimes it takes me
like two hours to upload a single video
on YouTube because I shoot on a heavy
camera there so sometimes it does take
your time and on top of that I do kind
of correct my video I spend a little bit
time on editing as well okay so can we
collab on an app surely just send me up
an email at hit H at hit eachother calm
and we can surely talk about what kind
of calabria are looking up for a
promotion what kind what kind of thing
you are looking up they'll drop me a
mail surely we can do that your
challenges are very useful thank you so
much thank you so much I have just
completed front-end developer course
what to do next now I would highly
recommend you check out react.js course
ok so hello sir hello because how are
you can learn machine learning a 35-page
I have little knowledge of Python at any
age at any age you can learn programming
even at the age of 70 didn't I heard
about the one person from Japan he
released an app at the age of 70 I guess
yes 7-0 that's a big number
ok looks like a lot of questions are
getting repeated my github is Kevin tah
ok so I can look up but after this life
all these messages and these are not
going to rest as a comment they are just
going to go so probably they are high
chances that I'm going to
forget this so it's always good to drop
me an email all the ways reply that
meetup probably we can think about that
right now we have a lot of focus going
on instead of the meetup because meet up
yes they are productive but I want to be
a little bit more productive than meetup
I want to serve you more by releasing
more awesome courses an Android app
maybe an iOS app and all things so that
they can help you to learn something
rather than just a meet-up so surely
meetup will be planned up but not right
now right now I I want to get more busy
in serving you okay so that's what I
want to do do you have a github yes I
have a github bitbucket all kinds of
sort of things my github is github.com
/hre that's my public rep own not
amazingly awesome but I do have some
private repositories as well which I
I'll just keep for my clients and for
personal use if you are looking up for
any project anything I can send you of
my private repo as well ok ok Heike sure
hi lemon
tech ok it's nice to see you online it's
my first time hey thank you so much
nomads tube that's nice ok how to get
started honk out chef I think we have
done that I'm looking for a job switch
is it a good move to learn web
development front-end knowledge without
knowing Java for front-end Irani Java
you don't need Java you just need my
boot confront complete front-end
developer boot camp at learn code online
doubtin yep dot in just like that ok so
where are you from I am from the most
beautiful city in India Shepard it's
amazingly beautiful I love the city
which camera you used for recording I do
have a lot of cameras but let me show
you what I use this is the camera that I
used
it's canon canon 1 I love this this is
mostly I use there's a big heavy lens
going on in top of that I do have a
couple of other lenses
but what makes a video awesome is not
the camera or lenses it's about editing
so focus on that learn that okay make a
video of your daily routine it's not
amazingly exciting but probably I'll try
that okay I'm also from Rajasthan good
to see you
do you always work alone yes most of the
time I work till on but it's not like
that I haven't worked on team I have
been hired by a couple of companies on
monthly basis just like that and I have
worked quite good in their team but most
of the time I'm highly productive when
I'm alone I'm just focused on my work
okay so let's pick up more questions
hello anonymous hello to you how many
hours a day II learn programming as a
big man as a big NER
at first I was not crazy about code I
used to hate it for a couple of months
starting couple of months antennae
analyst I found and cracked the way how
to learn it actually instead of just
seeing that on a whiteboard or just like
that once I got an interest in that I
used to spend like almost five hours
said hey hey or just like that so I used
to get really crazy about programming
okay should I go for cybersecurity or
machine learning totally on your choice
totally on your choice what makes you
more interesting or more thrill just go
in that predictive analysis and
Authority is that super important
especially for the inventories like flip
card and everything predictive analysis
is amazing important some more free
courses please on lco our courses on LC
are pretty affordable if you'll just
watch out a movie by two tickets or by a
course it just batma cheap free courses
does consume a lot of bandwidth and they
are not easy to manage I will try to put
a few but most of the courses are going
to be little bit paid to support the
platform and support what I am doing
right now because I hope you understand
when I sit here talk to you guys it's my
time that's I'm consuming here if I'm
working on a code or a course that I'm
trying to release for you it's
time and I have to pay my bills I have
to buy food and I have to live a life as
well so again these this money that you
are buying the course and everything
this helps to support the platform and
do keep doing what I'm trying to do so I
hope you understand that
okay so hello from Pakistan hello from
India how to make a great github profile
I saw your resume video thank you so
much just upload a lot of projects
simple way to impress anyone from github
okay so you can ask your questions in
English that would be more far more
easier for me to understand as well as
to answer them okay MongoDB vs. SQL
that's an interesting questions if I had
to build up a project I probably would
use MongoDB because it's easier to use
but the knowledge of SQL is super
important super super important whether
you are in marketing you are in
development whatever that is
okay so discus about your starting age
of undergraduation I did my graduation
and engineering and electronics and
communication and that is a long time
ago I start to just fade out those
memories probably I'll talk about that
maybe someday how important our degree
scores to get into good company now
nobody asks for that at least didn't ask
to me thank you Sarah for your videos
thank you so much hey didn't realize
that we have been talking for 41 minutes
that's amazing didn't realize that
that's being so long
ok you didn't reply my question what was
your question
tic-tac-toe game oh yes we have a video
on tic-tac-toe game okay it's a lot of
Facebook questions as well and you start
a plan no I'm not looking forward for
any startup at least not for now I have
a lot of going on personal projects so
nothing is planned for kind of a startup
right now just working like my own okay
a lot of questions its MacBook Air HEV
code for Android development it's more
than good it's more than enough because
Mac machines have solid rock solid and
you can do Android and iOS all kind of
development on that machine react Jesus
of no cheers for backend react jeez
doesn't work come back and you can tie
that up with anything like nodejs
firebase on anything no GS is mostly for
front-end but with some tricks you can
use it as a complete solution no GS is
more for back-end okay so II I okay I
can mix a couple of videos on AI cloud
computing or Hadoop
I'll go for cloud because awsm is on the
web server clouds and all these things
are pretty high in demand
okay how to create a tic-tac-toe game
I've already told how to create a
tic-tac-toe game in my Android course go
check it out okay should I learn every
technology or focus on just two three
good ones I would say focus on just the
good ones why to learn all of that you
can pick up a lot of on the way as well
okay react.js versus angularjs I think
it requires a separate video to be a
thorough comparison between react GS or
angularjs they are both good both
amazingly awesome it's really good to
have such an amazing choice because if
you even choose any of them they're
gonna serve you really good but again
there are few variables there are ups
and downs
but probably I'll make a separate video
on my channel for comparing react GS vs.
angularjs okay so okay are you single hi
yes I am pros and cons in cybersecurity
that's a topic for video that's a topic
for separate video doing red hat is good
our focus on programming is better right
it is something that you can pick up
just on a couple of months I did my dad
ad certification I think three or four
certification in red hat it's a good
thing you learn about Linux you learn
about systems you learn a lot about them
so reddit is something that you should
do and just forget about it maybe you
want to do a build up a carrier totally
on Red Hat that's awesome as well it's a
good thing it's a good thing ok what's
your experience in bhopal I had a very
very unique experience in bhopal because
when I was traveling from Nepal back to
Jaipur
I got an Air India plane and that was
the most terrible thing I have taken a
lot of aid India flights but the flight
from Bhopal to Jaipur on Air India it
was like it
chartered kind of a plane very very
small plane it was so shaky
tick-tick-tick like that uh I thought
I'm not gonna make it to the Japanese
the behavior of those in that day is for
here India not a big fan of that right
that was most terrible right I have ever
taken care rest of the Bhopal was good
but that experience
finally from traveling back to Jaipur I
cannot just explain that it was so
nightmare for me okay discuss about your
starting days in ug probably will do
that Sunday
what about ec-council course I don't
have good words for that Holly I'll say
that later on but hey Danny I don't have
an amazing things to say about
ec-council courses
how can i how can I because just by
filling up dots out of four answers how
that can make you a programmer or hacker
or whatever you call that but not a big
fan okay so it's MacBook Air eight I've
already answered you on and it's a good
machine don't think just go ahead get
that single yeah what is that only
people are so interested about my
relationship status I have no idea how
old are you I don't know what people are
coming up with my age and my single
status committed status I don't know why
that is happening okay let's leave that
for some other day where is iced tea I
just finished it up just finished it up
while I was having lunch but he reminds
me of having get to get one probably
I'll get it up to subscribe
after I subscribe to your channel now
I'm very much interested in programming
my base is B e ECE is it good to switch
my career into programming field let me
tell you an interesting fact
I'm also an engineer from electronics
and communication engineering ECE doing
really good that means decently good in
programming I think so so yes you can
easily switch so a lot of questions
going on there married or not
come on why so much interest no I'm not
married
how could I travel insanely to any part
of the world if I would have been
married
you are not replying Python or Java
depends there is no such thing as what
you want to do you want to write some
script do want to some regular
expressions we want to do something like
systems or InfoSec choose Python if you
want to build Android apps or do
something like that
choose Java I don't know what you want
to do how can I tell that tell you that
okay hi Charla there - Indra
how's it going on I think for a PHP
developer is good option yes you'll feel
right at home okay so can we do the 5s
app on Windows no you you can surely
there's no legal way of doing it you can
build up a hacking torso just like that
or you can choose Mac in cloud comm
which is $1 per hour I guess but yes
there is no such legal way of doing it
so I don't recommend that
I recommend designing iOS apps on Mac
hardware only that's my personal opinion
but feel free to just ignore that
okay so a lot of questions are coming up
but the elephant can you do it can you
do it tutorial on using s3 with no
cheers probably I can do that Charles
because we recently did a finished up
one for a client look for that client
and ask him if we can use your s3 for
Noches
demo I feel like we I can surely do that
make a video for you let's see how that
goes on but it's amazing it's amazing s3
is awesome what is Amazon Web service
it's amazing you haven't heard about
Amazon Web service yet come on go ahead
look that out what's your daily diet No
did you forget this is a story not guru
man or something like that
no this is not this is not a Phil Heath
channel this I'm not about lighting a
gym or anything like that this is not a
channel for that did you forget to read
the name they're not guru man okay
so just getting there okay I send five
times the questions you didn't answer
oh my bad I have done Android and
kochava the basic one I need a project
idea I need a project idea design an
uber design a snapshot design a Facebook
design an Instagram I hope you got an
idea okay
why angular react not view you can go
with the view as well no problem
CSS sources sass difference sass is
modernized version of CSS I
predict I I coat here I predict in the
future all the variables kind of thing
that you see in the sass and less are
gonna come up in the regular CSS very
soon just like CSS has evolved to css3
very soon you'll see that in the CSS you
will be able to use variables and all
these things so this is my prediction
I think CSS is gonna move up in that
kind of thing okay
so I want to make my own product and I
to give me unique idea give your email
id if I were to have an idea of such a
unique product that can compete with
Facebook or snapchat or uber I probably
would have got funding for that I would
have started working on that so let's
just say okay by your mail id my mail ID
is already available almost everywhere
still I mention it hit H at the rate it
is chaudhary calm you can look up for my
website
everything is mentioned there as well
hit a shot recom so go ahead check it
out okay his IT industry is in recession
right now I didn't think so I don't
think so
skilled people are still hired nobody
can fire skilled person if a person is
kind of a burden on a company he is
going to get fired that's a rule in
every business if somebody is not
profitable is going to get out and I
don't think yeah
so it's bad because if you're not making
profit following the company you're
gonna get throughout that's how the
world works there's no such thing as
recessions or regression it's not like
that you're not answering my questions
I'm going by good day okay if you could
have mentioned your question in the same
thread I could have answered it
maybe next time Priya okay hello
attending a live session on every Sunday
whoa that's that's a good thing
Rasika I hope I pronounced that Rasika
cantare I think you're from Mumbai I
I do have a lot of friends from Mumbai
so they're amazing people so thank you
so much for attending all the live
sessions I really appreciate that okay
let's move on ah
Priya sauce superb ah I don't know what
the context is going on there
okay so let's pick up more questions
while repeating questions okay I want
okay they just asked hi this it's my
first time on live chat I wanted to know
if it's a good idea to start with
Cordova for the mobile development I
have been working on web development
mostly if you're working in mode web
mostly in the web development I highly
recommend to check out to react native
instead of just going into Cordova or
something you can easily switch into
mobile development using your web skills
using react and react J's if you need
further help on react GS you can check
out my website learn code online dot in
and on top of that very soon a good news
for react native users is going to come
up a lot of videos are almost ready for
react native and it's going to come up
very soon okay when is your website
creation program it's gonna come up soon
should I choose carrier in WordPress to
be full time WordPress developer it if
you are just choosing a wordpress
developer just by installing it and
uploading a theme and just like that
it's not gonna go very well for you if
they're looking for a kind of a career
like designing WordPress theme
customizing it
your own plugins then it's gonna go
really good for you
so all these hot things always produce
good thing okay can i do i OS
programming in Windows machine using
virtual machine probably you can do that
I don't recommend it not my choice
so if you face a lot of tons of problems
with that when the next update or
anything like that I'm not gonna be
helping you in that so because I don't
recommend it okay let's pick up more
questions okay I can see a lot of people
are pressing that thumbs up button I
really appreciate that question why are
you single
why people are suddenly so much worried
about me being single today I have done
my bulb app thank you sir oh really
that's an interesting app I hope you
enjoyed it there it's an amazing app I
have installed android studio many times
and uninstalled why you have done that
okay
so questions I like your Sunday likes
hey Karthik thank you so much I
appreciate that I really do okay you are
not replying php-based project we do
have a project already in my course on
PHP course at learn code online dot n in
the future more projects are going to
come up project on that please speak in
Spanish no it's almost equal if I'll
speak in Spanish it's almost equal that
I'll speaking in Hindi most people will
not understand that and that's not a
good thing okay techno ash me too like
gray Gray's love for devs you can say
that you can say that Karthik you did
does answered my questions I'm sorry
about that okay a lot of questions are
is WordPress good yep it is
it is good okay a lot of questions are
getting repeated okay let me pull that
up are you a fan of Game of Thrones no
not a big fan of Game of Thrones I have
just only watched one season of game up
yes the cinematography the film how it
is being produced it's amazing it's
awesome I didn't got time to watch the
Game of Thrones honestly I'm always
lacking behind in time I prefer to give
most of the time to my work instead of
just watching any season but yes I have
watched a lot of them right now I'm
watching scorpion which is recently
included in the Amazon Prime I love that
season I'm watching it I'm on season 2
of scorpions but no Game of Thrones I'm
not I haven't seen it so I cannot tell

with this I must go to bed but I wanted
to express my gratitude for making these
videos every week they have been really
helpful thanks Charles I really do
appreciate for getting up really late I
think you are in the States and this is
an odd timing for the live yes thank you
so much so so tell about any course on
internet for AI or machine learning
probably I can recommend that on a male
ok it's a lot of questions future of
cyber security yep it's gonna grow like
boom it's it's gonna have a lot of
things how you're improving your
knowledge I read a lot lot of blogs
I keep updating with a lot of recent
text what the Facebook is doing what the
Google is doing what delay this project
are going to come up on github so I read
a lot I serve a lot on the internet not
on Facebook but on the real internet ok
so that what helps me in updating my
knowledge
okay dislike surely feel free to dislike
because not everybody can be happy with
what I'm doing some people like it some
people don't like it so it's your choice
you are free to do so
so meetup in Pune no I
have any plan to go to Pune tell some
blogs you read I have a list of couple
of blogs that I read but recent years I
have been directly being approached with
the people that who work at Facebook at
firebase at Google so I chat with them
and that gives me latest update or
what's gonna come up I do write blog at
learned code online dot and slash blog
so you can read that out I post a lot of
information there okay so like like
thank you so much do you like reading
books yes I do like reading books I read
a lot of them I recently I moved into
audio books and video books they saves a
lot of time so just like that your
course in react.js is really good thanks
so much Avinash like this like okay I
don't know how that saying what's your
Sunday program rather than coding no
sunday is not that much code I'm gonna
hit to some restaurant with some friends
and I'm gonna sip up a coffee or maybe
an iced tea I have some good food and
that's like that I would like to spend
some time with my friends
on Sundays okay a lot of questions or
repeat dating there and information you
can provide on mark flow and data
probably telling me your daily routine
okay I'll try that I'll try to make a
video on that if you are requesting it
so much I'll try to make a V log on my
daily routine it's not like that okay
there is a lot of questions just
scrolling like that okay I also want to
make tutorials on react on YouTube can
you give tips just make some projects
record your screen be tracked what can i
save more in that okay okay so not
answering my question sir which
certificates or internships should I go
during my first year of IT studies along
with when learning the car plan you
don't need much certificates so what you
need is projects and other
okay this light because you're not
answering my questions you are my
inspiration by the way thank you so much
but again you have a full right to
dislike and like anything what you want
it's it's your your choice but thank you
so much for the nice words as an
inspiration I like it I like it how to
plan the websites okay a lot of
questions just going like that okay how
do you charge your clients for mobile
apps this will help terms of deaths out
there you have answered it yet for the
past three weeks depends how do I charge
my client now if it is just a plain five
page website which I don't do anymore I
used to build those websites as well
just five days in a contact page I used
to charge based on what kind of design
and what kind of work I have to do if I
have to just buy a template and edit
that let's just say a template is
costing me like $20 $50 and I'm spending
my two or three days I'll charge like
150 dollars or $200 for that it depends
on how much your time is valuable how
much efforts you are making on a website
and if the project is deep that uses
some database MySQL MongoDB or
firebase or anything like that then
obviously the cost is going to rise up
significantly because these projects are
not being designed and just for a couple
of hundred dollars they may raise up to
around 600 to 700 dollars if the client
is client is in budget and wants to do
something I always recommend to these
clients who are Titan budget for
WordPress we do custom designing of the
WordPress as well so that are not that
much expensive but around 300 ish
dollars for the mobile apps I do charge
a lot because not everybody can design
quickly apps for their existing project
and I can do that so I usually charge
around 600 to 800 for an Android app for
iOS I do get started at the minimum of
thousand dollars so that's kind of a my
price list there it may rise up if I'm
full in the projects already like I'm
working on a project and one mode is
lined up and still one more client is
forcing me to take this project
obviously my price is going to rise
for him if I'm just sitting around and
just being lazy no project at all then
obviously the prices go down a little
bit because I want a project so yes it
depends on how much effort you are
putting into a development project and
how much time it is going to take to you
for that and one thing I always do I
always tell my clients to give me a full
list of your expectation and what the
feature you want to have and what's once
that is being signed between us no more
updates no more updates if you want an
updates that's gonna be chargeable
because it's kind of a in the nature of
specially in the ending clients then
just keep on asking you for the updation
like change my phone number change my
email address change the color I said no
it's not gonna happen it's gonna be
chargeable every revision is gonna
charge I'm gonna charge you and just
keep on throwing me your revisions and I
hope this answers your questions Krishna
I have tried to answer it very
thoroughly okay your favorite movie
I like Christopher Nolan movies
especially the Batman series and
inception and all these things he's a
great guy you know how to do his work
your client are from which places most
of the client that I serve are from
United States and some from the London
as well recently I am seeing increase
and rise in the client from Italy and in
Switzerland as well I don't know how I
got popular there but yes I'm getting a
lot of projects from there as well ok
github what you want to ask forget huh
just visit github calm okay a lot of
questions ok
a salam-o-alaikum from Hyderabad
assalamu alaikum how to reply that
bother kumar salaam ok I hope I did a
good job I learned it in Egypt I learned
a few words in Arabic in Egypt so I hope
I did the decent job I did learn from 1
to 10 in Arabic I forgot that I forgot
that now but
once you travel in a lot of place you
just like that please tell me my name
don't you know your name okay that
hi there in which technology did you do
most of your projects in the recent days
I am trying to make sure my clients are
switching into JavaScript a lot because
by javascript they can make a web app
Android app and iOS app so most of the
time I recommend my clients to go in the
react or react native but in case they
have a special request to go only for
the Android or iOS I have no problem I
can work in that ok huh ok a lot of
questions are going on I'm watching
every Sunday live it's really awesome
are talking about programming and Dec
thank you so much use ok some people are
advising me for grammar I'm not good in
grammar I'm not a good in English I just
speak it's barely good I it does the job
for me and that's it this is a
programming channel and we don't focus
about much on the grammar I can
recommend you few grammar such channels
which talks only about English and
improving that probably want to go with
that what do you do for living I code
for my living ok you're in sparing you
are inspiring dude Tata bye bye for you
thank you so much for attending thank
you so much the page your word some
freelancing would have helped many
people out there to the point clean and
crisp yes I try everything to be clean
