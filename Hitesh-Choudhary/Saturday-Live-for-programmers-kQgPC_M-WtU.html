Java Spring Framework no I don't work on
Java Spring Framework in fact I work
only with Java in only and only an
Android nothing else so far so DevOps
yes I do have plans to make a few videos
on DevOps and darker and all of these
things so yes hello sir without watching
your video week will not complete thank
you so much this is your love
guys I really do appreciate that how
much you have loved this channel and how
much really good quality audience we are
building it up this is really the most
important thing so how to protect your
eyes from screen rays you know this is a
one issue that everybody face and I
would say just get good quality screens
probably an Apple device Dell is making
some good screens if you are going with
that so it's really good so cold in
Rajasthan yes so cold in Rajasthan still
we are chilling out with ice tea
AWS yes there is there is plan do get

good good credit from AWS Amazon Web
Services and after that I will be able
to like help you out in dealing up with
on Amazon services I invite you over a
nice tea I would love to in fact some of
you if you want to just share more love
with me you can just pick up the address
from learn code online dot in and can
send me iced tea I drink
Nestle I stay sir if you want to do that
you are most welcome just put your name
as well okay what to learn after core
Java I would recommend Android would be
good choice in fact if you have learned
like basics like loops function a little
bit about classes then just move on into
Android what is the internet speed there
pretty decent like I'm getting an upload
speed of like around 12 13 Mbps around
like that hey this your hiss tile is
looking very nice thank you so much Huma
didn't made it just it's just like that
please come to NI et Greater Noida I
would love to come if you can invite me
surely love from the hey you there thank
you so much guys any okay it's it's just
going really fast here okay when I
should learn Android there is no such
age to learn any stuff you can get
started at any age whether that's an
early stage or like you are quite old
there is no such thing so get started as
much as as quickly as you like there is
no such thing that you have to first
learn see then C++ there is no such
thing the procedure if you are following
that it's completely wrong
you can directly get started with Java
at any moment from any course any book I
do have learned code online dot in for
courses but if you want to wish get
started from other resources that's
great
the important point is you need to get
started get started with Android don't
get too much into it and then move on to
Android okay
hello enough raw love from Nepal hi I'm
Ellen thank you so much any tips for
salesforce developer yes i am planning
to make a couple of videos for
salesforce development i don't do that
personally but I have a few friend that
can help you hi from Pakistan hey I'm
Joe thank you so much your love is
really the most amazing thing okay it's
going really read had certification
value in organization honestly yes Red
Hat do if you are giving those exams
like properly and all these things it's
really good why your video is not in
full screen because it's not that much
easy and gonna be good if you wish I can
just turn that up into full screen I
hope you're happy now
hey Dee run G five five five thank you
so much for the super chat I hope the
video is now in the full-screen I looks
like pretty big ish let me move that a
little bit okay
might be in the full screen now angular
or view or react okay let me tell you
I'm a big fan of react if second option
would be I would go for view these are
really the most competitive I consider
that I don't like angular that much
because the speed of development is
really fast there's not that much
backward-compatible but yes of course
going with the react you can never be go
wrong with that and obviously view would
be amazing I love from Chennai amazing
thank you so much I love Chennai hi sir
Abhishek hello what is okay full screen
looks good
okay as you say if you say full screen
we're gonna go full screen ok please
shout out my name
hey Cooney Mohit how are you Python
future in India Python future is
everywhere buddy everywhere so okay how
to convert my node.js code into a PK I'm
not sure on which you are working and
why your code is actually into node if
you want to make an Android if you're
talking about react it automatically
does it for you but a higher ish it's
12:30 in the Malaysia and going to sleep
yeah I really want to wish Malaysia I
want a picture with that whole bridge I
will probably do that have you ever
talked over TEDx no I haven't talked
over TEDx it's like I'm getting
invitation quite a lot of TEDx are
happening all over the India and they
are approaching me quite a lot probably
that's a YouTube stuff that every
youtuber gets a lot of invite over TEDx
probably because sometimes I was not
free sometimes like flights were too
expensive and I was not like in the
travel mood things happened and I
couldn't talk to any of the TEDx
probably in the future
speak in Hindi please once more I would
prefer English because a lot of audience
is from South and you know this is how
this channel works it's not like I'm
against anything or not
I do love Hindi so do I love Marathi so
do I love Gujarati so do I love Tamil
English is a way how we discuss the
things you understand what I say you I
understand what you write in the
comments section that's how the things
are important it's not about getting
about any language if we would have all
have been speaking in the French and we
would have understood each other that's
it that's pretty much it
okay penetration testing and bug
boundary difference I am about to talk
about penetration testing and the
importance of code and everything in one
of the upcoming conference in Jaipur I
will be talking about it it wasn't about
anything promotion it's going really
fast guys thank you so much okay
it's a single yes of course is that an
invitation me from Kerala hi Praveen
thank you for joining up is there any
chance to get an iOS developer job as a
fresher
of course of course ayahs developers are
always in high demand the reason being
is a lot of people are going over the
Android stuff and lot of developers are
not in the iOS that's why the demand is
really high and yes you can actually get
involved in iOS but make sure before
applying you have like two or three apps
in the App Store and if you have an app
which just uses like in-app purchases as
well that would be amazing any any
company would like to hire it okay
importance of Java certification is it
compulsory these are important yes of
course is it compulsory not at all these
are important when then once you want to
go into the companies which are already
high like Microsoft and all these stuff
but again if you are already in the
company and you want a promotion
then these certificates do really get
handy for a fresher job it's all about
portfolio cracking up the interview and
all these things okay tensorflow or
psych it ah psych it to get started
scikit-learn in fact would be great
machine learning library if you are just
getting started or building a chatbot or
something I did build a chat bot and
uploaded it on the face on this YouTube
the moment I just uploaded a video on
YouTube I got hundreds of requests
within that moment so I just made that
video private and took it off it was not
variable behind my servers but yes
probably in some videos I will discuss
about tensorflow and scikit-learn and
all of these things and getting started
in this year so we're just getting
started buddy okay why you haven't got
job in Google I never applied for Google
crazy cricket I was I was selected in
amazon.com at United States I did work
in a couple of startups to to startups
in New York and a couple of more
information I'll be sharing in the
upcoming I never applied for Google I
did apply it I wanted to work at Amazon
but somehow I left that and started this
YouTube thing and my own learned code
online and clients so yes it was not
tough for me probably if I'll try for a
few months I can get into Google but I
don't want to I don't want to just spend
my time on a desk in that company in
order to get a job at Google Mike
soft Amazon should I be an IIT and I was
not IIT in but I still got job at Amazon
that too at a headquarter of Hana and
the United States so I think everybody
can do that
Nisha Raj shout out my name hey Nisha
Raj shout out to you Gurpreet ask what
to learn for back-end I am coming up for
a solution for the backend very soon you
are gonna love it and just wait for a
few days just like you have learned and
enjoyed the course front-end developer
which was the best seller globally yes
you would like to know that it was best
seller in the United States it was a it
is a best seller in India so very soon
back and things will be sorted out what
about selenium course yes selenium we
can try that out but it would I would
like to grab like more of the things and
project words in the selenium then I
will be doing it as of now it's not on a
priority list and light us on django
Django is an amazing framework totally
in Python and it's simple the reason why
everybody loves Django is its simplicity
you can just within a few lines of code
you can just build up like amazing admin
panel and front-end and kind of a blog
post and stuff like that so that's why
everybody loves Django it's an amazing
framework I love it okay how to become
data scientist be good in math that
would be step number one be good in
finding mean mode and these progressive
analysis and the linear algebra may be
Fourier transforms these this is the
first step of becoming a data scientist
and based here and probability you
should be amazingly expert in that then
you should know all about programming
like Python and stuff and how you can
implement that of course anaconda is
going to helpful for you so it's gonna
be like that room tube please what's
there in the room it's it's like nothing
much it is this much it that's it I
don't have a big studio and stuff like
that so
yeah big rock or godaddy none none of
them and I have worked with a variety of
clients and they hated GoDaddy and big
rock both so they're so hard to transfer
their domain anywhere else so that's why
which language is used in AI variety
love from Tamilnadu thank you so much I
get so much of the love from the
southern part of the country it's it's
amazing I love it
okay hello - from USA hi Jignesh how are
you I am about we are having a few stuff
from USA and there is a good news to
come for a variety of people who are
watching it from United States so very
soon we're gonna talk about it
how many coding languages you have
learned I have learned the base of
programming and it doesn't really matter
now for me whether I'm coding in
JavaScript or Python it's all the same
concept it takes a few days of course
few weeks maybe to get into the syntax
of that language but after that it's
like yeah when in Jaipur I think the
conference is in 3rd and 4th of Feb so
yeah job job job somebody is trying to
spam here don't do that buddy Ubuntu or
pirated Windows of course is that even a
question
Mac future of Kotlin amazing amazing
future ok
huh it's it's going how is your gaming
rig will you make videos yes bro I will
I will probably I'll go live just reply
here yes go for gaming I am planning to
go even live and you can see how badly I
play some games I will not be proud on
that but if you wish I can go live with
that rig and can just share gaming video
guys probably we can talk about
programming stuff as well in the
meantime ok say about obvious feature
its rocket hi ok I know HTML CSS ok
there are a couple of people's who I can
ban right now they are just abusing
quite a lot don't worry if you can
trihard and puts Pam's a lot of people
and can abuse I can look again into this
chat and can ban you no problem if you
can work hard I am gonna work harder and
I'm gonna ban you if you are gonna abuse
here if you don't like it just don't
watch but don't hit abuses especially to
other viewers who are here these people
are spending time let me talk to you
guys first those people who are abusing
other people on this chat
these people are here to learn something
they are talking about programming they
want their life to be better and on the
side you are just abusing those guys
it's not good don't do that if you don't
like it turn off the chat and turn off
this life
go watch KC nights that are probably
that's too high for your standard I'm
talking about all those people who are
abusing because people who are here to
inspire who want to do something do
watch KC night stat and channel like
this channel so go ahead and just good
so ok let's just come back and talk
about meaningful okay very interesting
question by because what's your thought
about hum cable Thu n K a ble okay it's
a platform through which you can design
Android apps but to be honest I don't
recommend that especially for beginners
yes it can design a few like toy apps
can design even have a fire based stuff
and like that but you know why you get
hired you get hired because you have a
knowledge about Java you get hired
because you can deal up with Android do
you really think that the things like
tongue cable can design apps like learn
code online app no these are not
business solutions these are just toy
apps to play around and if you'll just
make an app from there and we'll get
higher in the company you're gonna face
trouble I'm not bashing on cable it's a
good platform to explore but if you want
to get job
learn the things hard way learn to write
code that's the only way to get job and
it's it's not something that you can do
shortcuts with thank you well okay
again I'm not bashing them they have
done amazing job but for kids we are
grown up we want to get a job so learn
the things in the hard way lots of love
from Kolkata
I really missed in the December when I
just get a little bit spaced and wanted
to take off I wanted to visit West
Bengal and I tried to ring a couple of
my friends and student they didn't
picked up I really want to visit and
click some awesome photos of those
colourful taxis and stuff in West Bengal
I'm dying to get there I will do that
very soon what our progressive web apps
okay Peter blue is our progressive web
apps are interesting and are booming in
the market quite a lot these are the
apps that somehow you can use when even
you are not internet connected
yes it sounds a little bit crazy but
without even internet connection you can
serve information on these apps I will
talk a little bit more about that
probably will give you a little bit of
more demonstration of couple of news
websites that are using this feature you
cannot literally transfer the images and
all these things like really with the
hot internet connection but it just
works I will explain that in a separate
video so definitely I'll go for
progressive web apps very soon in fact I
should write that somewhere that I need
to make a video on progressive web apps
this is why these sticky notes are
always so helpful okay so I'm gonna
write PW a progressive web apps make a
video on that okay Python verses Swift
both are amazing Baidu code in both of
them when you are visiting Hyderabad I
did visit at Hyderabad the end in
December I didn't informed anybody but I
was there in Hyderabad during my
vacations okay why you don't reply on
LinkedIn I'm so sorry about that you
know there are so many social media
platforms Twitter is there Facebook
Linkedin Instagram it's so hard to
maintain all of them I am active on
Facebook so I recommend all of you guys
to check out my page as well and just
follow me there I'm not so much active
on Twitter and not also on LinkedIn ok
so how much to hang out over hacker rank
quite a lot if you are interested in
InfoSec quite a lot you should hang out
there do don't forget to read the docs
and the
pocs that people are publishing reading
is the ultimate way to enhance your
knowledge so don't you know Kannada no I
don't know that that's a good language I
wish I could learn that okay when is
Chennai visit probably I am gonna visit
Chennai just to watch Rajnikant festival
for all those people who don't know
whenever the Reznick and movie is
released in Chennai one day before on
Thursday there is like night festival
kind of a thing in Chennai I am about to
visit Chennai just to witness that
because I think this is the last last
time that Resnick aunt is gonna be
rolling out the video or movie so I
would be in Chennai to just watch that
so I will let you know Shirley love from
Pondicherry hey you are from Pondicherry
amazing place thank you so much macbook
air in 2018 invest a little bit more
money and why don't you go for MacBook
Pro you will forget about buying a
laptop for like next three or four years
at least okay
oh okay it's going really fast react
native or native Android for beginners
react native I know I'm saying it but
it's really so easy in react native but
of course you need to have good
knowledge about android base like core
Android as well it's always helpful the
more things you are having in your belt
it's gonna be more easy
is there any vacancy of engineers in
your company I am just working alone
right now so probably in the future I
would plan to hire a few lots of love
from Hyderabad thank you so much so much
when to visit in Himachal I haven't
gotten what invited sing a song no I'd
have I'm not gonna do that
that that's the wrong territory okay
where you get clients I used to get
clients from up work fiber and
freelancer mostly from up work but right
now the clients are just popping in the
email probably due to YouTube or stuff
but I'm receiving a lot of clients now I
am picking my clients I don't have to
bed or anything they are automatically
coming up to me for a
and website and all these things and
really that's good I like it okay it's
going hi - can you say hi my friend
I knew limit hey I knew I'm ill and
you'll omit how are you okay campus
placement tips I have made a couple of
videos on that go ahead check that out
do you invest in cryptocurrency not
right now it's a bad time to invest in
cryptocurrency because everybody is like
talking about it just give it a few days
when people will forget about it
then you can invest back because these
are like bubbles people are talking it
about right now that's why they are
hyping this is the time to sell your
currency wait for a few months and then
people will forget about it then invest
in it and then again there will be in a
hacking incident and then again
cryptocurrencies will rise so that would
be the time okay simple math very slow
internet why today your internet is slow
because mine is saying all green are all
green no problem at all can you mention
some learning sites of course the great
one
the learned code online dot n so go
ahead type learn code online dot in
amazing website okay say my name a param
hey param how are you when the machine
learning course is coming up cannot tell
you about upcoming things that's kind of
a policy I personally follow don't
reveal until it's all done okay how to
become full stack developer just start
with my front end developer course and
in the meantime you will be finished
I'll be ready with the backend as well
very soon react course sir already there
the react.js course is already there at
learn code online okay then we will
start Sunday training yes very soon
because right now I am already having an
online boot camp I am teaching to to one
of the University ten students are
learning every single day from me with
its kind of an online personal boot camp
and I'm already teaching them so that's
why my Sundays are always busy I am NOT
able to roll out Sunday's stuff on
YouTube once I get free from their
training their learning react native
from me
it is being done I will surely start
with that can you provide me an
internship enemyÃ­s
at any IT company probably not come to
Mangalore surely surely surely ok when
we will start sunday training once i get
free from this paid training stuff at
sundays i will start that ok ok it's
going really fast hi bro say my name hey
read her read her how are you ok how
much hours do you code every day I never
counted that probably 5-6 hours maybe
more because about from making these
YouTube videos and everything I'm just
sitting on this exact same place writing
codes the place that you can see there
this this thing here this is all the
animation table this is all the
animation table if you haven't seen the
animation that I do go ahead watch my
what is API video and that's how the
animation is done come to Madurai Tamil
Nadu I would love to love to is there
any giveaway in your channel love from
Bhuvaneshwari let me tell you a thing
about giveaways giveaways is giveaway
simply means that you are inviting
people on your channel who are not
interested in your channel rather they
are in interested in the things that you
are distributing I tried the ginn
giveaway only one time at this channel
that was giving away a book I think book
giving away book is a valuable thing and
I'm giving a book fresh new book was
delivered from Amazon to a person's home
I'd simply asked him that once you
receive that book you can just give me a
selfie with that book so that I can post
it on my YouTube that yes this giveaway
was given to you I tracked the order on
Amazon it was delivered I asked the
person did you got it he said ok but he
never replied after that and instead of
giving me that photo he never even
talked to me so I realized that giving
these giveaways is not a good idea so
that's why I don't do much of the
giveaway instead I just try to give
knowledge ok what do you need what do
you do when you get bored and never
bored that's that's the thing the
work is always being bagged and packed
up like there's a live session that I
have to record a video then there's a
client work then there's a client
meeting then I have to go to Jim then
swimming it's not for happening right
now because too much cold but then Jim
then swimming then probably running then
again back to things then learning the
new stuff reading the documentation it's
so good and like I'm never free even
forget about getting bored I'm never
even free
how do you know Ramon Chaudhary he's a
good friend I know him
great CSS designer I like him okay best
site it's going to name right now I
don't want to come to porn here because
I read in the news that couple of things
are going on but a couple of my good
friends the childhood friend are there I
would love to I frequently visit Tony as
well lag the lag is on your side not
mine it's going all good right now
forget Bitcoin and all these Tron is up
okay it's just gone Jaipur Meetup I'm
not pretty sure whether if I'll host
such kind of made-up even people will be
showing up or not even like 5 or 10 even
I don't know how much people do even
really live here do you know her sugar
wall I'm really sorry I'm not able to
recollect named her sugar wall right now
if I know him I'm really sorry I
couldn't just get you right now okay
okay hello sir hello Pulkit how much
time do you sleep and when uh it's a
tough question because I don't sleep
much probably around like 2 or 3 in the
night and then I get up like six or
seven probably some time less than that
because you know I like my videos to be
much more edited much more quality I
like to cut my scenes like to color
grade them because YouTube is a game of
videos and you have to bring up your a
game so that's why I spend off most of
my time just like here and learn the
things so because I have to learn the
things as well it's not like I know
everything I learned from documentation
reading those stuff creating projects
failing in them then try to recreate
them and this is how the stuff goes on
so a lot of time goes in that
okay so how to get first few project as
freelancer building up your own
portfolio is the best way spend some
time and create a lot of web site
construction website tech website a
couple of hospital website or gym
website and create all these
full-fledged website and then just
approach your client that we have
already worked for a client for this so
this is the best way can you say hi to
my girlfriend minger Sunita that's
awkward but pay Sunita your boyfriend
says hi that was awkward
who designed your learned code online
website I designed it totally from
scratch Python or Jay SGS the awkward
choice but yeah any tips for new
youtuber who is your favorite youtuber
when you are visiting Orissa our
favorite YouTube but I have lot of them
in fact this particular channel was used
to watch a lot of youtubers of course
kc9 stead peter mckennon and these are
like my the most top most favorite guy
never miss their videos then of course a
couple of like c4e tech from India is
doing amazing job a couple of youtubers
which are small nobody knows about them
likes an algo savvy he is an amazing new
movie reviewer he has just like 13k
subscriber but he's amazing I like him
it's not about how many subscriber he is
having or not if the content is amazing
I love to watch it okay do you always
get online on Saturday from Pakistan yes
I always do get saturday Saturday night

hope everybody has given up like some
kind of thumbs up so I can get to know

somebody is just sending his number as
well not a good idea buddy I'm not even
gonna call you okay
do you watch Logan Paul no I don't like
his content that much he's amazing but
he doesn't do all the things on his own
it's nothing like I can get inspired
from Logan Paul I do get inspired from
other V lagers like if their things are
really good like amazing editing and all
these stuffs and they are doing it for
Logan Paul somebody else is doing it and
usually he likes to get into
controversies so yeah that's why I don't
follow him much I haven't watched like
many videos like two or three videos of
him that's it okay I know Android what
to do next
probably iOS that would be good choice
or good move next
techno right ah he is good probably I
haven't checked him out tecnologÃ­a a
lot of techno people here
techno there's tech days like this all

love you guys Mac Mini or Mac here okay
interesting question Mac Mini because I
started my Mac stuff from Mac Mini Mac

MacBook here and it was really old then
I bought a Mac Mini and I loved it
absolutely and I think Mac Mini is like
good really good starting point okay we
wish to get a trillion subscriber I
would be really happy to have only
hundred thousand meaningful subscriber
who think with their logic ask me the
question about Android or iOS or nodejs
or react having these kinds of hundreds
of servers is more valuable for me as
compared to a million subscriber these
are the people I love they are all
meaningful they love what is being
served at this contact this channel and
I absolutely love you guys so it's not
about subscriber number for me it's more
about you guys
so connected with me and we are having a
bond that is much more important for me
I really don't check out much how much
subscriber I have got after 100k I
checked it once it was like 120 thousand
then after that I didn't check how much
subscribers I'm getting all it's about
how much I'm getting connected with the
people so that's really more important
for me do you want to come to bits in
redone bath why not

is your education background I am an
engineer master's dropout from doctorate
because my project was bought I sold my
project for money yes of course I did
that don't judge me on that but yes I
sold my project my girlfriend is Java
with whom I spend hours daily
that was pretty nerdy like it profession
matters or knowledge choose your
profession in which you have knowledge
so are you having Twitter account
hey pocket I do have a Twitter account
which I don't visit honestly there is no
sense
but you can obviously join me there I
rarely rarely show up at Twitter
probably almost once in a month or two
times in a month I don't show up on
Twitter much Facebook is like my thing I
like Facebook and you can say hey you
are old done do you think is Twitter I
am still not on Twitter
hey this you don't like Microsoft
technology if yes then why it's
something that I just don't like it
it's not like it's bad I just don't like
it honestly it's like I like iced tea
but I don't like the regular tea I have
never I am never fought a regular tea
I'm always for iced tea

then please tell me some Android please
tell me some Android apps developed by
you apart from L see you on Google Play
most of my apps are there on github I
don't like to push them for clients I
have developed a lot of apps but you
know it's no sense of putting up these
toy apps on the Play Store I like to
just push them on github so check out my
github account github.com slash it they
show there you'll find a lot of my apps
there more than ten are there already
but if you want to just give things for
a project base if you want to hire me
for a project base or something I can
give you my private repository on bit
bucket and you can test them out I don't
usually push my code on Play Store
because there's no sense in that
but I'm thinking to push my upcoming
codes on Play Store so check out the
learned code online it's really awesome
hab I am planning to roll out a couple
of more apps especially for the
international clients we will see that
in January I hope I answered your
question and thank you so much for
superjet super shared this guy Anil sir
Duvall thank you so much I really do
appreciate that okay let's pick up
github repo name my github is hit a shot
come slash hit github.com slash a based
Chaudhary and that's like public repo
that's not included all of my
repositories I do have a lot of private
repositories as well you like cricket
yes of course my entire childhood was
first in the cricket and then in the
basketball so I do love it which movies
you like Bollywood or Hollywood not both
good movies are good movies so if there
is a movie like there is a question PHP
or nodejs best web development language
see the Ranji the point is if you are
looking forward to get started with
freelance and freelance development then
PHP is the thing that you should go for
there are tons of projects on freelancer
up work and fibre that requires PHP and
there's no exception we cannot do
anything clients demand its we have to
deliver it so PHP should be there but
again if you want to have like crush
down big projects more than two thousand
dollars and something like that go for
node.js it's rockin it's amazing but
start with PHP if you want to make like
initial base amount of money the
advantage that you will get with PHP is
you will get WordPress development as
totally free if you know PHP so that's
like things only 400 views that are more
than enough more than enough 400 people
are watching this this is good is SEO
permanent job yes of course please
consider in including offline watch and
chromecast support in LCU app chromecast
support I'll think about it
surely offline due to recent like
there's piracy issues and I don't want
to mention that but yes of course there
are issues so I saw your YouTube channel
broad advisement in Jaipur I think you
are from Jaipur yes of course I am from
Jaipur okay
best thing in coding for creative people

debatable question top hacker that's
really debatable and I'm not sure if I
can answer it publically here or not a
lot of issues

MongoDB that would be my preferred stock
but of course I would prefer Django as
well it's super easy so yes I would
prefer that as well okay product based

you'll learn tons of things so I am that
kind of guy

never looked about it I'll try that hi
from Greece thank you so much hi from

WordPress development start by exploding
