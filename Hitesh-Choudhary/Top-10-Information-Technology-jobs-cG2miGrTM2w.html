with another video now in this video I
have sorted out top 10 as technology
jobs that you can look around for now
before we get started in this video let
me just put a statement there that these
by no means these jobs are top 10
highest paid jobs are topped in only
jobs or just like that anything like
that is not here now these are just the
jobs that have looked up and I actually
wanted to share with you because I think
that you have already started your
career with the IT industry like
computer science or information
technology or an engineer and now you
want to get much more clarity that where
you can move on further
so with this let's get started with the
top 10 IT jobs that you can look up for
in this channel we talk about everything
about technology programming coding app
development web development a lot of
things all related all revolving around
the computers so if you are new here
consider subscribing now I have cleared
up and sorted out a list here there is
going to be a cheat sheet for me for the
top ten jobs that I want to discuss
these are my bullet points and I'm going
to lookup them and I'm going to show you
that how you can get started with these
jobs as these are the most lucrative job
offers that you can look along for with
a big giant small Giants medium giants
that you want to have so let me start it
on my list the very first job is for the
UI and UX designers now a lot of people
join into the engineering but still they
have their heart with the animations and
designs and sketches and all these
things now the great part is now all
those guys who are designers can
actually move into the technology now
for sure you have to learn a lot of new
skills and the basic job of a UI UX
designer is to make sure that how your
mobile apps looks like or how your
website or web product looks like now in
the recent days if you live in India you
might have noticed that one of the best
job being done is by the book my show
app in case you don't know about then
I'm not actually promoting them or
anything just wanted to make sure that
if you have used the previous version
and now version you will eventually
notice that a lot of jobs is being done
by the UX and UI designers now everybody
knows that there's going to be certain
tabs in the app and they will take you
to the next page but how that page will
look like and how actually the entire
structure is being designed hi we want
to make sure that the user actually
preceding our app is all the role of the
UI and UX designer furthermore they also
decide what kind of colors should be
used what kind of team we should use how
the user should propagate navigate and
all these exciting stuff comes up with
the UX and UI designer now obviously you
need to be good in little bit sketching
you need to learn the software's like
photoshop illustrator or in case you are
on a Mac there's the one great software
that I personally use every single day
is sketch app now obviously it's paid
and all the software that I mention
here out paid but I don't want to
promote any product I just want to give
you an overview of that so number one on
our list is UI and UX designers let's
look at the next job that we have got is
the web developer now web development is
something which is always going to stay
in the computer industry you cannot get
rid of all those websites I know most of
the things are switching to the mobile
but you cannot get rid from the website
now web developers also break down into
the two main job categories the
front-end developers and the back-end
developer yes there are developers who
are full stack developers as well but
mostly in most of the major Giants have
seen that people goes with the front end
and the back end development as well
now the front-end development or the
front end developers are responsible for
designing the website making the
structure or what the people actually
sees there now it usually involves HTML
CSS and JavaScript and there are a lot
of others as well like to react or
angular but that's a different topic it
usually gets started with the basics of
HTML CSS and JavaScript that's the front
end part now at the backend part there
is lettera of options there now nowadays
javascript is actually overcoming - a
lot of things especially with the
involvement of the node.js and firebase
and a lot of other things but I would
say there is a lot of option like you
can go for the Python you can go for
Ruby on Rails you can go for the angular
no J's and tons of PHP is already there
dotnet is there so a lot of back-end
development now usually the back-end
developers are the ones who design the
databases who designed everything that
runs on the backend the front-end other
guys who just put the things neatly and
nicely and of course there is a great
contribution is required and they should
have been planned and like that to make
the product really look outstanding but
again a lot of people eventually with
the time become the full or full stack
developers as well but that's again a
personal choice if you want to become a
full stack developer or front-end or
back-end that's actually I've
categorized into the web developer
let's look at the next one next one is
the network engineers now obviously
their job is not the one which everybody
sees but we meet some guys definitely
who can look out for the server's who
can look out our connection from the
computer to the Internet are really good
our servers are maintaining how the
things are working nicely there what
protocols to follow their job is not
being seen by the world but actually
they are a very important they are
responsible for a lot of networking
stuff again you might have heard about
the cisco dealing up with a lot of
certifications the network engineer is
again an exciting job you don't face a
lot of people there but it's very a
high-end professional job that we have
now next up is everybody's favorite
cybersecurity professionals now
obviously every product needs the
security so security jobs are booming
quite a lot nowadays especially with the
involvement of the bug bounties and
everything it's nowadays pretty much
easy to find security professional
because of these bug bounty things but
again I would say a security
professional is a very tough job to get
started and even as the learning process
is quite a lot to make sure that you
choose it very wisely again just
learning about the security tips and
everything is not going to work for you
you need to be good at some of the
scripting languages as well you can get
started with Python or Ruby as well but
a venice security engineer or security
professional actually moves into the
programming then the actual potential
comes out of that person now of course
you can just stay and survive in the
industry with the knowledge of SQL l fi
RFI whatever other things are there but
again make sure that you also learn
programming as well that's the key
element of becoming from a good security
professional to advanced and high level
security professional make sure that you
keep in mind now next up we have is the
mobile engineers everybody knows that
how the mobile world is going on now
especially in the iOS and Android sector
there is a special boom and special ER
in the last couple of years after the
launch of the swift Android is actually
booming iOS is actually booming to end
there
native apps that are coming up as well
so mobile engineers are under rocket
into the nearby future and I expect much
more higher growth in the mobile app
development and a lot of fundings are
also being provided for the new app
ideas and that's very lucrative offer so
you can get on to the mobile engineer
job as well now here is a quick tip that
I would like to give to all the mobile
engineers now always get started first
of all with the native apps yes you
might want to get started with the
hybrid app but if you want to get
started with the mobile engineer Jobs
get started as a simple native app
developer first later on move into the
boats platform or move into the hybrid
app development but at least get started
with the native now why I'm saying this
because and when you start with the
native app development you actually get
the ins and outs and what are the actual
things that you need to do and what are
the things that you are missing in the
hybrid app that's very crucial and
important point now my favorite is iOS
but that doesn't mean Android is lagging
it's actually booming equally but it's
always a personal choice and preference
that you eventually develop with that
now next up we have is the data
scientist now this is relatively a new
job but it's growing quite a lot and
it's actually completely almost empty in
most of the companies now with the data
scientist I want to cover up all the
guys here who are talking about the
machine learning who have come up
talking about the data mining and all
the suggestions that you get in IMDB or
maybe flip card or maybe Amazon so all
these things are relied heavily on the
data and yet the Hadoop guys and
everything also gets covered up in there
as well so if you are trying or you are
looking to learn how to or you are
looking to learn machine learning or
anything like that then definitely you
are looking for the data scientist jobs
there after that comes up the business
analyst now I've seen a lot of
engineering students who are good in
maintaining the stats and it's still
working quite greatly in the excel sheet
now the good thing is they can go into
the business analyst because every
business need analytics but again you
need to learn
the technology so that you can
understand what is actually happening in
your company and then you can provide
some graph data as if stats so that you
can pitch up new ideas and how that idea
can escalate you can also go for a B
testings and everything these actually
everything happens as a business analyst
now the next step is not that much
booming right now because a lot of
companies are not switching on to the
cloud but yes cloud architect is again
one of the very advanced job that you
can look around for now the reason why a
lot of companies are not moving into the
cloud architect is one they are not
getting the idea how much cost-effective
it's going to be and how much stable
it's going to be and one of the reason
is they are not finding enough engineers
or architects who can move their entire
architecture onto a cloud-based service
yes if they are directly getting started
onto a cloud-based service like Amazon
AWS
or maybe he Roku or everything then they
are completely fine but moving an
existing architecture to the cloud is
not an easy thing so yes a very very
highly paid job but again requires in
terms of skills and direct exposure to
the live environment live project site
is actually quite a lot required in
these kinds of jobs at number nine we
have got the testers now you might have
heard about these tester jobs quite a
lot and these are little bit different
from the cybersecurity testings or the
security professional because they are
worried about the security loopholes and
the testers are worried about the
working architecture or how the links
are broken or if certain things are not
working or not working actually how they
should be working actually goes into the
tester now if you want to become a
tester selenium is booming around the
word and actually the mobile version of
the selenium is also growing quite a lot
and there is a huge demand of the
selenium right now now yes there are
others Qt and everything that you can go
out with the testers but I would
personally recommend to go and get
started with the selenium if you want to
become a tester now finally we have got
the last number ten via finally step now
is the CMS developer now you might not
be
that as coming up because we have
already talked about the web developer
but CMS development is one of the best
job that you can look around in any
particular city now what is CMS
developers now CMS are actually you
might have heard about the WordPress or
Joomla or other things like that they
are actually already built up cooked-up
content management system kind of ready
to move WordPress website and you can
just deploy that website and voila it's
done but there is a tons of things that
you can do now you might have already
seen the fact that WordPress is actually
dominating all over the development
things that you can see around your area
that is why I have specially kept this
at the number-10 because you can just
learn the PHP HTML and basics you can
just start with exploring the CMS and
can quickly get a job done now you can
move on to a company as well you can
start your freelancing because there is
a tons of project related if you'll just
check out the freelancer com you can
look out how much projects are there for
the WordPress and all these root
Commerce ecommerce based things so
definitely if you are looking for a
quick job or you are looking to become a
freelancer understanding and getting
deep knowledge of the WordPress or any
content management system is really
really crucial so this was my very
thorough list about what kind of jobs
you can look out what kind of knowledge
you can look out and I gave are these
are the 10 ways that I've shown to you
every ways good with a little bit
difference and of course a person can
choose more than one path there but
again make sure that you understand this
list properly because this is going to
shape your future in the nearby things
okay so this was quite an intense movie
and quite a long one as well and that if
you have enjoyed this movie make sure
that you give it a thumbs up and if you
think that this can be helpful for
somebody then make sure you share it on
your social media accounts like Facebook
and Twitter as well and I'll catch you
