and this is 60k special so first of all
thank you so much for all the love that
you have been showing around on this
channel this is really an overwhelming
situation because I've never thought
that I'll be reaching this big number so
quickly on the youtubes and all all
credit goes to you this channel is one
of the most loved channel that I've ever
seen for the programming and everything
people are getting connected people are
not only getting the videos by which
they just write the code but also get
the videos by which they can start
learning programming get some motivation
of that and all this is happening
because of you your love your support
that is just keep coming keep flooding
on this channel and that's why I make
these videos so I thought that I'll be
doing something special on this 60k
special video and I asked all of you to
just post down some questions on my
facebook page now in case a lot of you
don't know where I actively stays on the
social media it's the Facebook not the
Twitter I do have a Twitter account but
I don't maintain it much so I most of
the time hang around on my Facebook page
I asked a lot of you to put down your
questions in the comment section below
so that I can answer them in the 60k
special video and there was again an
overwhelming response and I just love
the way how you people response and this
makes my day so I have picked up a few
of your questions I'll try to make this
video as well as valuable as possible
and let's get started and answer fee of
your important questions so we're gonna
go and get started with a good one first
and I really love the way how you people
just support because it's not easy to
say that hey you are doing a good work
because it sometime takes an effort and
sometime it's take a courage to just say
something good for it now imagine how
many times have used have you ever seen
the t-shirts that you'd really like that
somebody is wearing and have you said to
a stranger that hey that's a nice
t-shirt so you are just doing same thing
for me and I really appreciate that so
the first comment is so thanks for the
learned code
online without this we can't learn such
an easy way and many things in short
period of time I want to meet you surely
I'll post some of the details about
where my upcoming travel plans are and
I'll try my best to meet a lot of you
guys and thank you so much for all the
nice comments and compliments that you
post down at my channel at my Facebook
it really makes my day this is the very
first thing I do just after waking up in
the morning that I check up my emails I
check up my comments and this gives me a
big smile that haze people are liking
what I'm trying to do the next question
is again rather a good compliment here
and it says I want to learn web
development and learning html5 and your
productivity hack for html5 and css3
helping me to code like a pro thank you
now yes again this is one of the very
fantastic and free course available at
learn code online I highly recommend
everybody to at least take this course
what this course does it helps you to
install a plug-in on your existing
editor which can be sublime text which
can be brackets which can be atom or
maybe some other you are using and just
increase your productivity by having
simple shortcuts just by remembering
these shortcuts you can make your life
much more easier faster and you can
produce much more awesome code and yes I
have recently rolled out Android app for
the learned code online this app I would
consider as in beta the official one
will come up in the next month this app
is just kind of a test run that I'm
trying to do with that the official one
with all the awesome graphics and all
the problems being solved is going to
come up very soon the next question is
actually very very interesting one it
says make a video what to do when you
frustrates a development job it's easy
it's easy a lot of people like me when
they write code and sometime your code
doesn't work or sometimes the client
doesn't like your artwork or graphic
works or the code that you have written
it's okay to get frustrated it's a part
of the job and it's not like it's only
available in the programming field it's
there in every job in the doctors and
engineers in the construction line it's
everywhere so make sure you exercise
daily and accept the know the moment
you'll be start accepting the know
thing things are gonna be much more
easier for me particularly when I get
frustrated with these kinds of
development job and everything I usually
hit the swimming pool a very first thing
in the morning that makes me relax keeps
me calm and the second thing I accept
the situation whenever somebody says no
or things don't work I just accept that
hey it's not gonna work so I need to
take a break and my advice would be just
keep yourself engaged in something else
rather than just sitting around and just
staring that code it's bad thing go out
have a walk in the nearby park or have a
glass of water or something just
distract your minds a little bit because
ever mind has a tendency to work much
more awesome when it's less stressed out
so relax your stress and just relax out
it's not the end of the day if the code
is not working or you are frustrated
there will be another day
so go ahead relieve your stress and it
will surely help you the next question
is not a question it's a request and I
will fulfill it very soon so make a
video on what path to learn to take
after learning front end there are so
many frameworks and technologies for
back end I'm learning front end from lco
now front end is your gateway is your
path to learn all those awesome
technology but at least everybody should
understand the front end basics and yes
I do understand your frustration because
back end is pretty pretty vast and it
has a lot of options like PHP nodejs
react firebase dotnet Ruby on Rails
Django probably I have missed a hundred
still so yes this is a big thing to
decide first of all yourself and then
again a lot of variable comes in like
the market demand market value the jobs
you are going to be getting which cities
you are looking up to get jobs so it's
it's a big decision to take and I'll for
sure make up probably the very next
video on the path to take for getting
started in the backend technologies and
thank you so much for the requests and
I'll try to fulfill it very soon now the
next question is being hacked and by hag
I mean I asked you to ask one question
and somebody just get a equation in the
part ABC so yes that's the kind of a
nice hack but let's read out a few
of them because there are a lot of
questions being asked here and the
questions are most over required or are
being asked on the cybersecurity or
information security domain so what our
carrier opportunities in cybersecurity
how to play CTF it's a capture the flag
is there any possibility to get Android
iOS pen testing course at LC or in
future like complete front-end course
when we get complete back-end codes like
PHP react or more how to maintain the
consistency in this field journey from
HIPAA Chaudhary to D heathaze Chaudhary
oh that's a lot of questions I'll try to
answer a few of them there are hundreds
and hundreds of opportunities in cyber
security in pen testing in regular
testing with selenium in development the
IT sector is booming and all those
people who are saying that IT sector is
in the downfall probably are not aware
of what the situation is actually every
single day hundreds of jobs are being
posted but still there is one thing to
take care here that jobs are only being
posted for the people who have skills
not the people who just have degree and
have no idea how to install even a
Windows or a Mac on your system for
those people yes definitely there is a
big struggle for the oldest people who
are skilled enough there's lots of
opportunities and cybersecurity is one
of the growing field out there now
coming up to your point like CD f's and
courses on Android iOS pentesting yes
there are they are in the pipeline not
very soon especially for the Android one
iOS when testing is not yet planned or
anything
Android pen testing may come up very
soon but not very soon because there are
a lot of other courses which are planned
which are far more more in demand
compared to these guys what was the next
one like complete front-end course when
we are going to get complete back in
already there are back-end course they
are not named as complete back-end
developer course but yes there is a
course on PHP there is a course on
react.js and few more stuff are going to
be added in those courses as well so
stay tuned more updates are going to be
coming up about the react.js and
everybody of you is going to like
immensely love this update so it's going
to come up very soon stay tuned for that
for the question journey
from a theory that they to deihi
Chaudhary I don't think so and that big
enough to talk about that probably maybe
in some later on videos I'll talk about
how I have maintained the consistency
making these videos taking hundreds of
projects traveling around the world
everything so maybe we require a lot of
more videos to come up in the future for
this topic ok next question is almost
related to freelancing and it's an
interesting one it says congrats on
hitting 60k thank you so much what
factor do you consider for charging your
website and how to avoid being underpaid
now this is a debatable question because
the amount you are charging for
designing a website depends on your
skills your past experience and the need
of the client as well so a lot of
variables are involved in this situation
usually I personally start my pricing
legislate for 200 or 250 dollars because
I have been I have got a lot of
experience in web development I have
handled a lot of clients and by just
involving me companies actually saves a
lot of money because I I tell them what
kind of technologies you should be
working on which are future-proof and
everything so they saves a lot of money
by just paying me a fees but again it
depends how much labor work is going to
be there how much manual work is there
that's my number one variable to charge
those companies and after that how much
revisions they are going to take for
that for example if they are saying that
hey we want three divisions so that's
gonna be a different charge if they say
hey I'm gonna be having like eight
revisions then obviously it's gonna cost
more and this is the thing that I've
seen especially in the Indian clients
that they don't pay you they don't like
to pay you for the revisions for example
after three months or four months a
person is going to come up to you and is
going to say hey I just want to change a
phone number on the website can you do
that obviously it's a small thing for me
but I don't take those requests because
these are just the revisions and
probably sometimes people just come up a
we have changed the logo could you
change our logo there hope we have
changed our color schemes now would you
like to change our color scheme for free
I said no this is considered as a
revision and if you want to do a
revision because it's consuming my time
it's consuming my skills I'm going to
charge for it so
make sure you keep all those variables
involved and specially how much manual
work and time you're going to be giving
to the client all these are going to be
involved for the big nurse it's usually
not that much good it starts from like
$50 to $100 but after a couple of
projects you can increase your price
pretty easily because now you have got
projects portfolio and experience so go
ahead charge a little bit more okay this
is very interesting question and it's
going to help you a lot
it's say sir I'm a slow learner is
Android development or web development
is made for me or not
now let's keep a side whether Android
development web development or iOS
whatever you are talking about this is
not about that this is about the line
when you say it I'm a slow learner
now nobody nobody on this planet Earth
is a slow learner let me give you a
quick example when you try to make when
you try to fill up a form on maybe
Airport or maybe your board exams or
anything when you are stressed out quite
a lot there are high possibilities that
you are going to make mistake in that
form while on the other hand if you just
have to casually write your name on a
piece of paper you don't make ever those
kind of mistake so it's inside your
brain when your brain is stressed out
quite a lot then at that exact moment
you become a slow learner now another
good example would be when you simply
are traveling from one state to another
state you see a board on the highway
that simply says hey NH eleven fifteen
kilometers away now you just read that
board in just a glance you just saw it
there and you have read it that's it
while on the other hand when you're
trying to read a book or documentation
you want to give extra stress to that
you read it word by word and that
decreases your productivity so I think
for you your stress is actually
decreasing your productivity you are not
a slow learner but you are taking it too
much stress that whether I'll be able to
do it or not whether I'll get a job
after learning of this or not and lot of
other such variables so my advice would
be first of all keep yourself calm make
sure that you are not stressed out and
you focus just to learning that's it
that should be your goal and this is
going to increase your productivity and
after that web development Android iOS
it doesn't really matter you're going to
learn just like that and very fast okay
last one is interest
and we're gonna take this as well sir
when you had started youtubing at
initial stage for a long time you didn't
have the amount of followers or viewers
what keep you motivating that today you
are at this level now yes this is a
little bit awkward situation at the
starting days of the YouTube because
you're making videos and obviously your
videos are not this much of the quality
that I have right now and obviously it's
going to increase in the future but it's
really awkward situation that you are
making videos and nobody is watching
that but hey if you're expecting the
result on the day one it's something
wrong it's it's something that is
conceptually wrong in you you should not
be expecting that now for me I was
little bit lucky that within a few
months I got really good amount of
subscribers but that is all because I
have spent huge number of time and
amount and dedication in learning all
those web technologies so that people
can come up here and can listen some
good advice and can see some of the good
courses here so it's not being built up
in the day one everything takes time
there is no such magic that is going to
happen and you are going to be lucky one
of your videos is going to get viral and
you are going to get millions of
subscribers this is not an entertainment
channel because for those entertainment
channel it's possibly a chance to go
there like if it's a Casey Knight start
video it can go viral but these kinds of
videos
don't go viral because these videos are
just meant for special kind of audience
programmers and they don't make do that
kind of money as well they don't go
viral as well so yes all I'm saying is
be consistent don't expect the result in
at least initial six months at least
whether it's a YouTube programming or
whatever you are trying to do playing
sports doing YouTube being or whatever
you are doing don't expect result in at
least four six month and try to improve
yourself every single day and that's
what makes you better and last but not
the least how can we forget haters yes
if somebody is saying that hey you are
having 60,000 subscribers a lot of
people love you on YouTube shows all
these loves and emails and Facebook
comments and chats don't you have any
haters yes I do have it's okay it's okay
to have a couple of
them it's not like whatever I'm going to
do is going to be loved by every single
person and that's the truth and that's
the fact everybody should expect
whatever you are doing it's not
compulsory that everybody is going to
like that some people are going to just
hate it and literally hate that and it's
okay
it's democracy it's a freedom Internet
is a free world you are free to hate it
you are free to love it and that's it
that's all about it so it's okay if you
don't like the videos that's okay I'll
try to improve in the future stay tuned
and things are going to change really
quickly so this was the 60k special Q&amp;amp;A
and this happened because of you because
you hit that subscribe button and we got
a 60 K subscribers and that's what makes
it possible okay so finally I know this
is a long video but I wanted to give you
a little bit more updates we are trying
to move everything from in the learn
code online dot in to version two and
you're gonna see some lots of good
updates that are going to be rolled out
in the first week of the next month
which is September and I think all of
you are going to love it and also in
case you are new to this channel and you
love this content and there are others
hundreds of contents being available at
the channel what are you waiting for
