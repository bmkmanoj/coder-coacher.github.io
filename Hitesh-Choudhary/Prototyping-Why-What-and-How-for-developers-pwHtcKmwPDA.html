with another video in this video we're
gonna talk about prototyping what is
prototyping why is it important how it
can save you money and time when you use
prototyping and what are the tools that
I used while prototyping so all of that
coming up in this video let's get
started first and foremost let me talk
about what is prototyping and why we
should be using it what is the problem
that prototyping is solving for us let's
just say you are a guy like me who is a
one-man army who designs everything
codes everything talks to the client and
does everything like that now one of the
thing that always bothers me is if I
will design an app for a user or a
client whether he will like it or not
let's just say I present a cap to the
client whether it's an Android app or
iOS app the client might say hey you
know what I don't like this green color
just change it to the red and I can do
that not a big deal but then the client
says you know what I don't like these
button to be too much circular I want
the square buttons and I just say ok
that's ok then client come up with
another demand and says you know what
these things should be at bottom these
things should be at right these things
should be at the lower end and these
things can be shifted to the bottom of
the things or maybe at the mid of the
things and then begins the nightmare
because all of these things when you
change the code it's not so easy to
present in an app or in a website as
well these small changes whether they
are in an Android app iOS app or maybe a
website are not so easy to design and
this is all I'm talking about the client
situation the clients can be handled
they are always gonna ask you for
revisions you have to provide them but
when these things are taken care in
in-house or in a corporate situation
when you have hired a user experience
design guy and he just comes and say you
know what I want to just bring these
components at the bottom you say ok I'm
gonna do it your design user experience
and I'm gonna just do it and then he
comes back to you and says you know what
the previous one was better just revert
the changes and you just want to murder
that guy because it takes so
much effort for just writing the codes
of all these things and it is not so
easy
and for years and years people has been
doing all these things now at early days
people who remember the early days
freelancing we used to provide clients
the Photoshop of the website how it used
to look like then the things move on to
the app and then he used to provide the
Photoshop link of these apps and client
doesn't really know that how it's gonna
feel like and how it's gonna perform on
the devices and all these things still
somehow you have to convince that this
is the final design because when you ask
a programmer or a coder or the person
who writes the code changing all these
things is not so easy for him simply
because it takes a lot of time and time
is money this brings us to the concept
of prototyping now I don't know what you
have learned in your computer science
degree of what the prototyping is but on
an industry scale almost everyone is
using prototyping prototyping simply
means it's not an exact app but it's
like moreover a photos of the app it can
be designed in Photoshop Illustrator may
be sketch or whatever the platformer
tool you are using these are just photos
and in photos somehow we use these
photos to just put it into a mobile
phone or on a website and somehow user
is allowed to click on the places where
it was meant to be clicked and then move
on to the next photo so this is how the
prototyping is being designed and is
being served to the client this saves a
lot of time and money because at that
right moment the client can say you know
what these things are missing this
should be there or these colors are not
accurate or somehow the layouts needs to
be change all these things can be done
in design now of course I do agree here
that the making all these changes for a
designer perspective is not so easy but
looking at from a coding perspective
it's far more easier in the design while
changing all these things when things
are into development phase and coders
are writing code for that a lot of
people think that designing the apps
like Twitter Facebook Pinterest Dropbox
Airbnb
some guy might have just got on to his
chair and just start writing the
gibberish gibberish code on Adam
maybe Xcode maybe Android studio and
voila your app is done no this is not
how the things are done in industry the
and very first step is designing a
prototype now yes of course there are
variety of steps were a lot of people
get involved in it like UI expert user
experience expert designers colors and
then finally doing a prototyping writing
code then rolling out betas and all this
this is a complex process and the more
steps you are gonna be involving in that
phase the more shiny the product is
gonna be okay if they aged now we
understand what is prototyping and why
is it important how it can reduce our
work with the clients or maybe the final
product so what are the tools that you
use for prototyping I'm glad that you
asked that
okay just pause there right now right
there this is not a sponsored video I
know whenever I name any product I'm on
to a stage on a platform YouTube where
anybody just names out any product it
means that it's a paid it's a sponsored
video this is not nobody sponsored me
for this I wish they could have but no
this time they didn't sponsored me in
case you have been following me around
you know that I am a sketch guy I use
sketch for all of my design things now
there's no wrong that if you use
Photoshop or illustrator or maybe
affinity design studio or maybe affinity
photos or design whatever you're using
I'm a sketch guy now a lot of people ask
me hey is there any alternative of
sketch for Windows and sadly there is no
yes
you can argue with me that Photoshop is
even better and all these things but you
know most of the designers are switching
to sketch for designing app these mobile
you eyes and web view hires and pretty
much everything and sadly there is no
alternative of sketch on Windows I use
sketch for all of my designs and for
prototyping I use a tool known as
envision now for you envision might be a
new but envision is here for a while now
now it was not always the case there was
no such thing as envision and I'm glad
that startups are coming up all over the
globe and envision is solving a big
problem of prototyping it has been here
for quite a few years now and the
surprise thing about the envision is I
have worked with variety of companies
and whenever I go to the companies and
companies just tell me that we use for
prototyping and vision I just it amused
that yes so many people are using
envision and yes honestly it's a great
tool every
just loves it it just works and whenever
I just say it just works
I love these lines big nerds and
seasonal freelancers who just like to
work on one project at a time can use
envision absolutely for free there is a
free tier in which you can just work on
one project at a time but if you're a
bigger company obviously you can afford
envision as well now in the envision you
just open up your account you can just
put up your images and can just mark out
the places where you want something to
happen maybe you want to move to next
screen or next view whatever that is you
can just mark that and when somebody
touches that on the phone it just moves
to the next screen now the biggest
advantage been with envision that I like
is you can use everything on a mobile
phone in their app it gives user and
more control and more sense of freedom
that yes this is how my app is gonna
look like this is how it feels in my
hand this is a great advantage for
freelancers and ad developers the guys
at envision knows it really best that
people are shifting towards sketch and
that is why they provide like
extraordinary support to sketch you can
directly upload all of your sketch file
just like that and they're gonna extract
all these things like screening screens
and icons and all of these directly from
your sketch file and - this is amazing
I really like these guys that they know
how the industry shaping and how the
industry is moving towards sketch and
all these other tools that are coming up
every single day I like when things are
updated and people know what they are
actually doing and envision happen to
know what they are doing I highly
recommend for the new beginners and the
people who are in the college right now
to get to know about these tools so
whenever you reach to the company stage
and you reach the stage where you are
working at some company you don't just
see these tools for the very first time
you're already aware of it and one good
way of finding about for such all these
tools in this channel go ahead and do
subscribe this that was smooth
integration of subscribing the channel
isn't it in the upcoming few videos I'm
gonna walk through and we'll talk more
about prototyping and designing such
things in the upcoming few videos we're
gonna fire up our sketch we'll design a
few login screens few test elements and
all these things in sketch so that we
have something to work and then we will
move on to envision in the envision we
will be a flow
images and all these assets and and I
will walk you through that how envision
works how you can have your envision app
and can just make sure that how your
apps looks like in the phone and how the
user experience and all these things so
stay tuned and in the upcoming few
videos we are gonna have a lot more fun
with the designing the things and
envision app a lot more new technology
are going to be discussed at this
channel that's it for this video at this
channel we talk a lot about programming
stuff at new tech stuff that is
happening around the industry so in case
you are new here do hit that red
subscribe button and I'll surely catch
you up in the next video
hey just more one side thing in case you
haven't checked out the learn code
online app at Google Play Store as well
as iOS store go ahead check them out
they're pretty awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
