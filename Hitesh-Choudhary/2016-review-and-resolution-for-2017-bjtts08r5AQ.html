back again with another video so
obviously you might be noticing a lot of
changes in me I got rid of my beard and
2016 is almost over so we are coming up
with a new year 2017 everybody is
excited for that some are making
resolutions some are just reviewing what
they have done in the past year and I'm
going to be doing exactly the same so
this movie is about what I did in the
2016 what were the best part which were
the worst part and most importantly what
I'll be doing in 2017 a few plan that I
can share with you so let's get started
so first of all before we move on to the
2017 part because a lot of good stuff is
coming up in 2017 and this is going to
be very beneficial for you so what I did
in 2016 now by 2016 was not tall a good
year in the very beginning it was a very
bumpy ride I got operated twice in the
very first of the 2016 the one operation
did really got well but the second one
was I was not going according to the
plan and eventually it turned up really
bad for me seven days continuously on
the bad and it was something that was
pure a demotivating to me and after that
I got a lot of weight but the best thing
that happened in 2016 was my right so I
had to say no to quite a few projects
that were good for me I wanted to really
take them but due to bad health
condition I had to get them down and
slipping of those projects from the hand
was really trusting for me I didn't like
it at all nobody likes such a good
amount and good knowledge that you are
about to learn and it was about to go so
that was a rough start of the 2016 and
the next thing that happened to me was
the Harley ride I did road to my dream
Wright from Chapel to go it was a pretty
big right for me and two on a bike such
a goer nice environment and I did learn
a ton of thing on that right I learned a
lot about how you can make
yourself up how to rely on the people
how you can rely on yourself relying on
the technology especially on the GPS
system and it gave me a lot of time to
think about what I'm doing with my life
what I should be doing with my life and
go as such a nice place to be on the
beaches and think a lot about it so
after coming back from the Goa I decided
that I'm gonna be spending extra ours on
focusing on what I do creating content
approaching people approaching clients
earning more and a little bit like that
so things got started really things got
really started to grow up in 2016 and I
was hugely focused but the one bad thing
that was going up along with me was I
was getting really really fat I was not
hitting the gym although i did promised
myself in 2016 that i'll be hitting the
gym every day but that didn't happen
just like most of you so i started to i
started to getting much more fat and
although i was approaching good clients
I I started to make a little bit of the
money and all of that it was really
going well so around in the mid of that
2016 I decided something very harsh for
me I thought that I need to be focused
much more and how can I get much more
focused so I started reading a lot of
books and especially the david dave'
Crenshaw's book about time management
really helped me and started to
motivating me and I decided a few hearts
decision for me like I'm going to grow a
beard for myself because it's a it's a
testing of your patience level so i did
grew up it for about six month or so and
also I decided that I'm gonna be wearing
this gray t-shirt not this for the
entire six month but this color only so
I successfully did both of them I
recently I got rid of my beard but again
it was thoroughly a good experience for
me and in the last three month or so I
was able to hit the gym continuously I
got rid of a lot of fat but still I'm
not yet perfectly fit I want to reduce a
little bit more weight but yes I'm in a
good shape now and I'm really proud of
that so towards the end I worked really
hard and one of the great achievement
that I did
was I hit the best month with the online
earning so I was doing a lot of project
app development designing online
teaching youtube marketing videos
youtube and all of such things and
really it helped me a lot and I did hit
the best month in the earning wise
throughout my life and this this is
something a big a huge achievement for
me so this was all good and what I
learned in 2016 I learned a ton of
technologies in 2016 I tried really hard
with a design perspective and I got
really good in that I previously i used
to hate design part photoshop and
everything so I overcame with my fear of
that and now I'm a pretty solid designer
in fact for a couple of companies I have
designed logos too so that's that's kind
of achievement for me and apart from
programming and stuff I moved really
deep into the game development and iOS
programming not kind of a Unity game
development but again the game engine by
Apple our game simple de the SDK game
development by Apple it was pretty nice
although I was more into the 2d type of
game design and AB development for Apple
but it was really awesome for me and I
also did try to write a book on iOS
development for iOS 10 but in the Midway
I thought that it would be much better
than just taking the screenshot and
putting on them book it would be much
better if I launched online course on
iOS development or maybe launched a boot
camp for that and both of them really
did I did a really great job for me so I
was invited for this offline boot camp
in a couple of countries I really did
earn quite a lot in that and I did
travel a couple of places a canada and
china china was the greatest expend of
experience for me and I really
thoroughly liked what the Chinese are
doing and how the technology is going on
there and especially how how the food
and everything is there so it was a
thoroughly great experience for me but
later in 2016 I did really well and I'm
happy for myself and for my family as
well the best part of the 2016 was the
youtube so i decided in the last couple
of months then I'm gonna do something
different
with myself I'm not going to be just a
geeking out on the codes and everything
although I love to do that but still I
decided I'm going to do is something
different thing so I worked in a company
who was basically into the all YouTube
stuff so they were designing channel for
other people are making content making
that exclusive marketing content on the
YouTube and everything so I applied on
them up for the for that company and
obviously I got hired there and I was
not making a full time job there I was
an intern and in return are they were
taking a lot of my services because I
was experienced coder so on the tech
side they were taking a lot from me but
I was happy that I was learning YouTube
from them like how the lighting words
how the audio works how the green screen
works how the background effect
editing's talking in front of the camera
using the camera nicely what camera you
need to have what lenses do you need to
use so a ton of knowledge was just
getting into me and I was loving it all
other than on so I decided that I'm
going to be using that knowledge and
putting all of that on the youtube so i
decided to give it a go for my youtube
channel already i was having a youtube
channel but i was not working on it so i
decided that i'll be working on my
youtube channel now and obviously within
the last two month i got almost a 3000
or 4000 subscriber right now the channel
is hitting almost six thousand
subscribers so this was the best part i
suddenly how I was feeling that I'm
having a community here people are just
coming down watch for your videos wait
for your videos talk to you making new
friends youtube is such such a
tremendous thing i really hate myself
that I didn't started it earlier it it
is something that you should all try it
and maybe in the future i'll try to
upload the videos on youtube DIY series
how you can get started on the youtube
as well i did earn pretty good at the
youtube and in fact I did bought an
apple watch completely from the YouTube
money that I earned also I did bought
Final Cut Pro that was completely from
the YouTube income so that was something
great but obviously I didn't started the
youtube channel for the money it was
something for the community and I
Allah so that was kind of a review of
2016 and what you can expect in 2017 so
I'm making some good promises from
myself and I'm trying to make sure that
I'm taking more out of myself in 2017
the first thing that I will be promising
myself and in fact i have already
promised to myself is uploading 300
videos on the YouTube in the next year I
know this is this is a huge and 300
videos means in out of 365 days I have
to work at least 10 months every single
day and uploading a video and obviously
uploading a video is not easy because
first of all you have to look out for
good quality content then you have to
set up Lighting's audio camera recording
stuff then editing stuff post-production
and after that you have to upload on a
slow internet speeds so it takes a lot
of things and consume a lot of good 8r
or maybe six hours of your time every
single day I don't it's a big thing
because I have to keep everything like
my work my other content my clients
everything I have to pay my bills as
well but on behalf of that I'm assuming
if I will be not able to do so i'll be
just making excuses of myself so my
promise is to upload 300 at least on at
least side 300 videos on the YouTube
that's going to be a pretty big deal for
me now apart from that I'm not just be
uploading any stuff i'll be uploading
very meaningful and question-answer
sections some tutorials on design coding
and all those stuff that i'll be doing
and in 2017 i am planning to launch out
a couple of video series on game
development on I us as well now i'm not
into the android yet i'm not going to be
uploading CDC's and all that all that
stuff on the android yet but again our
2017 is going to be full of surprises
for you i have a lot of planning that i
am already i have already started doing
that but again that's gonna be one major
announcement so look out for in the
thumbnail I'll be setting up 300 / 1 300
/ 22 keeping a track of myself that how
many videos I'm uploading in a year
again 300 is a big number so this is my
first resolution and of course just like
always like all
you I'll be hitting the gym i'll try
that at least if I be able to hit the
gym at least three times a week that
would be much more good because in the
last year I saw a one may may saying
you're near resolution is my everyday
that's the gyming I don't like to say
that I I made it there but I didn't
obviously hate there I'll try this year
that if i'll be able to do so so three
times at least a week I know these are
some big promises that I'm making myself
but I realized that in the last six
month or so if i'll be able to focus so
much by wearing a single color t-shirt
growing a beard it helped me to focus so
much i can do much better with my life
and obviously that's going to be my side
now i would expect a lot of you might be
taking resolution as well and that's a
good thing there is no harm if you're
able to and I don't say sometimes you
like to keep your promises sometime
situation just are different and you are
not able to keep those promises but knew
it is a great time to make sure to make
new promises let me know in the comment
down in the comment section below that
what our new promises that you are
making whether you want to learn
uploading new videos on the YouTube

development back end or app development

that you hit down in the comment below
and tell me what you are up to in this
2070 now with this i would say bye bye
