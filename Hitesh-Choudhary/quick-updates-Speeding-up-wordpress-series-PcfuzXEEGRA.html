with other video now this video is a
quick update and the update is basically
I'm really thankful for so much of the
kind comment you know YouTube is such a
place you really feel so much connection
with the audience and I do really
appreciate after my last video where
some incident did happen
I received a ton of emails I like to be
precise like more than 155 emails a lot
of comments and on Facebook messages as
well all of them were filled with so
much of the love that I couldn't believe
myself that this can even happened to me
and I really feel so much connected with
this YouTube thing so yes things
happened and we cannot just sit back and
just keep on worrying about the things
we have to move forward of course
necessary measures have been taken care
so that this doesn't happen in the
future but regardless of that let's move
on and carry forward with our amazing
journey of programming now here are
quick updates we are working really hard
at learned code online and you will be
seeing much more content at much more
rapid speed now and just because some of
my plans have been rescheduled we can
actually focus now much more on our
WordPress series so all I can say right
now to you is buckle up this WordPress
series is gonna be moving really a lot
faster than what I was expecting it and
in the upcoming week or so I would be
dedicating an entire amount to this
WordPress city so definitely you are
gonna get a lot of content and this is
all gonna be amazing now just onto a
site quick note we have learned quite a
lot already about the WordPress now we
very soon we are gonna move on to a live
actual domain with a hosting and domain
and how to set up everything there as
well as how each and everything can be
optimized reused okay so it just was a
quick update and definitely you'll see
much more active nasaan on the youtube
channel because of the rishi dealing of
the tasks and everything but yes there
are a lot of performance optimization
and everything is going on really really
smooth now that was a quick update so
just buckle up and let's carry on on the
WordPress in the next video catch you up
