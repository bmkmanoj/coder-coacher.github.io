WordPress series now in this video we
are gonna talk about the categories and
the tags so if you'll go on to the post
you'll hover over it and you'll see
there are two tabs here apart from all
post and add new which are which says
categories as well as the tags now just
on to a side note let me just click on
the post and just go back on to our only
single posts that we have written so far
and you can see there is a tab it says
categories as well as tax and if you'll
go in here into the categories you can
see all the categories here as well now
before we talk and discuss about what is
category and what are post and how they
are different it is very important to
understand the essential concept that
brings up with this WordPress now
Internet is an amazing thing but it's
not well arranged and the reason that
it's not being so much well arranged
this is probably the reason why the
search engine like Google YouTube and
maybe Yahoo or in case you use it Bing
are so much popular because internet is
not well arranged but it has a plethora
of information and everybody wants to
get it sorted and filtered out
information coming back on to the point
which is related to the category now
since you are already into the WordPress
maybe you want to host a wordpress blog
for yourself or maybe for a client
eventually tons of content will be
coming up onto the WordPress website and
the classic mistake that most of the
Bignell does is not thinking much about
how this data is going to be arranged
this should be prepared in advanced so
whether you are working for a client or
for your personal use make sure you
understand that this arrangement of how
the data will be arranged needs to be
done right now at the time where you're
setting up a blog for somebody or maybe
for yourself okay and this is where the
categories and the tags pops up now
categories you might have seen the
categories as a simple example on a news
website the news actually are
categorized on to a website like in a
really nice manner there are technical
technological corner there is a
political corner there is a science
invention corner there's a sports corner
and the sports you have being further
divided as like cricket news bus get
ball news and fit
so these are all categories but there
are sometimes tags also being used like
for example in the technical world if I
want to see all things which are related
to machine learning now machine learning
can or cannot be a specific category but
there are other world other posts that
can use some ways of machine learning in
that case the tags can be used but yes
in most of the cases you will be using
categories I'll talk a little bit more
about these tags in a minute but first
of all let's try to get how you can add
a tags and something now what I
recommend is you can grab the tags
anywhere maybe in the post directly or
in the category section here so I
recommend to give it give it up a
category directly in the category
section so for example let's just say
you are building up a news website and
there will be many news let's just call
this as sports news ok and you can also
give a URL friendly slug to it like for
example I would be giving it something
like sports - news this is how you you
go with that and it says it is usually
all lowercase and contains only letter
numbers and hyphens so this is important
make sure this is something which is URL
friendly now again there are a couple of
in from in important information here
first of all we are not setting any
categories here ok I'll talk about that
in a second for the description I am
just writing a test description here now
most of the themes as in 2017 and 18
doesn't really support the description
even going on to the homepage but your
theme may be so make sure you don't
write a test or anything like that
either leave it a blank or just write
couple of words which are relevant to
the category ok so let us add this
category so we can see now we have a
category which says sports ok nice what
is the big deal here now another big
deal comes up when there is this further
category may be in the sports I want to
have cricket although I'm a big fan of
basketball but maybe just for some
reason I want to use a cricket here and
there's a cricket now you can also
select your parent for this category so
this can be arranged for the like a
hierarchical content of information like
there
is a sports then further cricket then a
basketball and some information so in
this case I want to make it apparent as
sports news so sports news will act as a
parent and further in the child we will
have a cricket so I'm going to add this
category here and this is how it looks
okay so this is how it goes now what
will be the difference here let me just
go on to just save these things and go
to the all post and going back to this
guy now what will happen if you'll check
the cricket here it will be available in
the cricket section as well as in the
sports section
but things which are in the sports
section doesn't necessarily be there in
the cricket section a little bit
confusing how to understand that but
make sure if you are checking this like
subcategory of that make sure you check
mark of this as well because technically
speaking from the content a managing
perspective if something is there in the
cricket section it should also be there
in the sports section but the reverse is
not true it can be in the sports section
might not be in the cricket section okay
might be another some section but yes
arrangement of these things at a
starting level is really really
appreciated now one thing that usually I
also forget and I don't recommend that
is deleting this uncharacterized maybe
give it some better name like rest of
the others or maybe general or something
but uncharacterized is not something
really good so make sure you delete it
as quickly as possible so this is all
something related about categories now
let's move on to the tags so tags are
here
these are comma separated and you can
have tabs like cricket and you can have
like sports and all these tags you can
add them now one thing that you should
keep in mind about the tags is the they
are case sensitive so cricket with a
smaller C and cricket with the capital C
are two different tags not a good idea
to have them but really totally on you I
usually prefer that all the tags should
be lowercase but completely my
preference if you are having like mixed
cases or something make sure you do keep
in mind that they are case sensitive and
their gonna be different now the last
thing that I wanted to discuss in this
video is
make sure that you don't overdo the tags
this is a common mistake a lot of people
just for the sake of SEO purposes just
stuff a lot of tags which is completely
bad and bizarre and search engines have
their like own criteria of kind of
ignore those websites which are
unnecessarily stuffing the tags there it
is not at all a good idea okay so make
sure you keep the tags precise I usually
prefer at max of five tags in the blog
whatever I'm writing but again depends
on you your subject might be a little
bit vague than that but again make sure
you don't overdo anything now again
going back into the tag stuff you can
also click on the tags and can actually
just add these tags and all these things
here I don't use the tag thing actually
directly here I just use it only for
categories for the tags I usually go
with the post as the post also suggest
you for the previously used tags there
okay so this was a quick introduction
about how the categories or tags should
be used and again I always always really
give a lot of stress in planning out
before you roll out your website so make
sure categories at least are sorted out
before launching a content obviously
there is going to be a lot of content if
you are going through with the WordPress
maybe for yourself or maybe for the
client it's gonna be there so that's it
for this video and let's catch up in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
