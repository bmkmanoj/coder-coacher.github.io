hey there everyone today's year back
again with another video I know you have
been missing me a lot and I haven't made
video in the last two weeks or so of
these camera types of videos I have been
consistent making a flexbox series but I
was on a travel and I could only afford
making a screencasting videos on that
but regardless of that finally I'm back
and today's topic is really interesting
I'm going to talk about machine learning
what is machine learning
in layman's term and how you can get
started in machine learning a lot more
is about to come so let's get started
now the terms machine learning and AI
artificial intelligence is closely
related and it's not wrong to say that
the abstraction level of between these
two words is fairly thin line and they
can be interchangeably used but when I
say machine learning or artificial
intelligence II what most of the people
saying is the same oh it's Terminator
movie you think that there is going to
be some TX 9000 machine that is going to
come up from the future is going to
destroy entire humanity you start
panicking and you will you just think
that there is not going to be any need
of programmers in the future and a lot
of theories like that hey hold down
there this is not actually a fictional
movie if this could have been true so we
should stop testing about with a
gamma-rays because it can generate a
Hulk and we should stop looking into the
space because we may find aliens and
that may invade into the earth there
might be a tour coming up to save all of
you and there might be a Spider Man
roaming around and who knows there might
be a battement too so hold on your
horses we need to talk a lot about
machine learning and what actually it is
so putting down your Terminator movie
theory aside for a minute let's talk
about machine learning and AI now
machine learning and AI all these are
branches of computer science with almost
poor doing their masters and PhD might
have studied in their curriculum as well
they are closely related but according
to me what my personal thought is
machine learning is closely related to
data mining rather than AI AI is
completely a different thing but what
you think of machine learning is closely
related to data mining and you have been
already using it quite a lot
now you
might be asking hey there we are already
using machine learning now although you
have just heard the term machine
learning but you might already be aware
of the term known as data mining
now data mining has been there since the
evolution of data and computers which
have been into the world quite a lot and
all the things that you see simple
examples would be spam emails you see
that some of your emails are in your
inbox and some of them are into spam box
what is that that is machine learning
rather closely that is data mining there
is a huge chunk of data and your program
and algorithm is designed in such a
manner so that it can predict that
whether this email is spam or is it a
good email that needs to be delivered in
Inbox is it always perfect no not at all
sometimes good email also land up in the
spam and spam email ends up in the inbox
so that is basically a good example of
machine learning at a very small level
but now things are changing that was
version 1 of machine learning now what
we are seeing in our day to day life is
machine learning version 2 so how
actually this is working all nowadays so
if I talk about the machine learning at
a very broad scale there are a couple of
components that you need to be worried
about first of all is a huge data set
data set that can predict a lot of
things for example if I just show you a
chair you can say hey that's the chair
but if I say that that's the wooden
chair that's a glassed year and there
are tons of gazillion bazillion type of
chair you can see the difference between
all these chairs and can still predict
that that's the chair but if I just ask
you to write a program for that that
could have been nightmare for you for
example if you're just writing a program
that it should have a four legs and some
wooden texture that would be a chair but
what about when I say that hey it can be
just a centralized table having a
central base and a glob a sitting area
that is also a chair but you cannot
write a program for that and for such
situation we require a huge number of
data sets that's problem number one
the second thing that data set is being
pitched to something known as classifier
which is again a big term big big term
but rather I would say that is just an
algorithm which can determine the output
based on whatever the data is being
fetched and as we all know the mode
we are going to have the mole prediction
capability is going to be there so now
based on what kind of data you are
supplying your classifier can classify
the image or any other thing in this
example we are just taking an image of
chair so it can predict that image of
chair with some certain amount of
confidence that it can be chair it can
never be 100% sure but it's always about
the ratio of how much confidence that
it's showing that AB is that 99% chair
is that 80% chair and is it 70 percent
sheer so this is all on a broad scale
what the machine learning is what we are
trying to teach with the machine and yes
I know some of you are worried about hay
in the future it's going to be the AI
and the machine learning are going to
learn to write the code so there will be
no need of programmer hold down your
horses who told you that first of all
with the evolution things changes quite
a lot I do agree but this is almost
similar to the strike that I saw in my
childhood when people were opposing the
computers everybody in the government
department private sector was saying
that hey if computers will come up they
will take our job did computers did that
perhaps but did it open more number of
job as compared to that the job that is
taken for sure it has done the same
thing is applied here is it going to
take the job of programmers who knows
but is it going to open up more more
responsibilities and more scenarios of
working jobs or sure it is going to be
there so on a whole note there is no
such thing to be worried about that
machine learning the future is machine
learning and AI and we don't need
programmers and future in fact we do
need more programmers in future so now
that you understand that how machine
learning work on a simple scenario a
huge number of data set being given to
classifier and based on that data set it
just do some processing and tries to
predict the results that's basically
your machine learning being applied at a
lot of places spamming is one of them
recently if you saw the Google's new
product you can just open up your camera
app and can see the restaurants name and
based on handwriting prediction image
prediction and logo prediction it can
query to the humongous amount of data
set that is presented by Google and can
find out the ratings of the residents
the name of the restaurants and some
reviews about the restaurant that's just
one example of machine learning have you
used some kind of app which predicts how
you will look like in your 80s or your
90s how your face is going to get at
some deformation your skin is going to
get some kind of deformation this is all
based on machine learning small level of
examples but yes this is all based on
machine learning so now that on a very
big scale you understand what is machine
learning how you can get started in
machine learning now there are a couple
of ways of getting started in machine
learning and everybody has its own
implementation of machine learning now
let me walk you through how you can get
started in learning machine learning of
activating learning machine learning
okay so how you can get started with
machine learning machine learning is
first of all dependent quite a lot in
math but not all the time it's going to
be like designing your neural networks
or designing your patterns and all these
things it's not all the time about that
but based example or base core setup of
machine learning is dependent on that as
well but the first language that you
should be looking up in order to get
started with machine learning is Python
Python R being the very first language
for took advantage and brought up the
libraries like PI kit and tensor flows
obviously the language has it first and
it is being heavily used in machine
learning now before you get started and
jump directly into the psyche it and
tensorflow documentation and everything
let me tell you that python needs to be
there in your pocket nobody is going to
teach you in a machine learning course
that hey how to write a loop or how to
loop through an array or how to define
these set of lines into a function or
create a new classes these are all
basics that you should have already in
Python just onto a side bar here you can
see the link for amazing Python course
at an affordable rate go ahead try that
out all I'm saying slide bar over now
let's come back here so python is the
one way of getting started with machine
learning and most people think that's
the only way but that's not true most of
the other languages are also coming up
with the machine learning but again
depends on how much data set you are
having or how much data you can collect
it's heavily dependent on that now other
one language
it's not called language it's the
company which came up with the
implementation of machine learning for
public user is Apple so if you got an
apple machine like MacBook or iMac or
Mac Mini you can get started in iOS 11
where just like we used to have core
data and avfoundation we now have a new
kit ml kit which is machine learning all
you have to do is patch it a data set
and it can produce a result it always
just show you there what kind of input
it is expecting and what kind of output
it will give to you very very easy to
implement recently in the bootcamp just
a few days ago we created an app which
you can just take a photo of anything
and it will predict what that object it
it can be a light a camera remote
control a hot dog a phaser we had a lot
of fun playing along with that in fact
we spent almost half a day in playing it
on with that app so yes Apple is trying
hard so that everybody get an access to
machine learning and everybody is able
to design such apps possibilities with
such kind of ml kit are endless and I
can see a huge future there as well now
one of the other thing that has
impressed me a little bit not much is
the implementation of machine learning
through JavaScript so the libraries has
came out in the node.js and basically in
the cold JavaScript as well that are
able to do machine learning are they
good not at all
are they going to be good in future for
sure I have a huge I'm optimistic I
always see the future in some place
because version one is always bad
version two is always amazing so what I
think the JavaScript have some future in
machine learning but there is no such
rigid proof right now that it's going to
perform really well so I would say yes
it may come up in the future
somehow or maybe some library does come
out of the blue and we might get
something amazing so right now Python
and iOS 11 are the two good ways of
getting started in machine learning and
this is the condition right now in end
of July 2017 surely this is going to
change up in near future
so these were all the views about what
basically the machine learning is and
how you can get started with machine
learning was this an entire
comprehensive thorough discussion about
what is machine learning classifiers
and tensors and like it of course not
this was just an overview so that I can
answer some of your questions and you
can get some answers about machine
learning and getting started and that if
there's a trouble no nothing is the
taboo anybody can learn machine learning
programming or anything like that even
if you are bad at math with practice you
can become good in depth so that's all
I'm saying here so that's it for this
video and I know you have missed me
quite a lot I have missed you too guys
as well but now the constant videos are
going to come up because I'll be staying
home for a few days more so that means a
lot more videos and don't forget to join
me on Sunday life at every Sunday we do
Sunday live and you can get the
information about it on my Facebook page
the links are in the description as well
as on the screen so that's it for this
video and I'll surely catch you up in
Sunday live</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
