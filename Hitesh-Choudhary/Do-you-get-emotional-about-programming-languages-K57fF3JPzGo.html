with another video now in this video we
are going to talk about the emotions now
emotions are great they can take you to
the next level of success but in coding
and programming emotions can let you
down let's talk about this in this video
in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps and
pretty much everything related to
technology so in case you are new here
consider subscribing now coming back on
to my point
you should never attach emotions with
programming now let me take you with the
scenarios as well as I'll show you or
share you a couple of incidents what I
faced during the life and that will
surely help you to understand why
emotions are really bad so let me just
put it in this way that a lot of you
might be in love with Python language
now obviously it's pretty common to see
a lot of people liking the language not
because it's so much good and awesome
that's that's completely another way
because you're coming from a background
of maybe C or C++ or let's just say Java
in that you write a lot of code and your
code does a very little so you have to
write a lot of things there but in the
Python you don't have to write that it's
so much clean and that you don't have
the curly braces and all these things so
and obviously a lot of big part of that
reason is since it's the scripting
language it is used in a lot of
information security stuff so eventually
people develop a lot of love for the
Python but that's that's completely a
wrong way of going into the programming
let me tell you why now
for example let's just say for me I love
C++ let's just say that I don't that
much but let's just say I love C++ so
I'm doing X project in C++ and that is
very good and then eventually I got a
project about web development I'm still
trying to figure out hey is there a way
in which I can render my HTML or CSS via
C++ that would be completely wrong
because I'm since I'm emotionally
attached with a C++ and looking forward
for the ways to do the stuff that was
not meant to be done in the C++ and I'm
trying to do that that is simply
something bad you can do with your life
now not only it becomes very complicated
it's completely a wrong way of handling
the projects as well so what I'm trying
to say you is that there is no such good
language or bad language thing in here
Python is good Java is good too but
again these are meant for different
scenarios and a focus try to try to
focus a lot on the programming itself
it's not about language it's not about
Python is good and Java is bad or Java
is good Python is bad it's all about
syntax and eventually in the life you
will realize that it's all about loops
function classes and object orientation
there so my number one tip would be
never ever get emotional with the
programming languages yes it's good to
fight about Python is good and all of
that but it's it's just a fun fight
there apart from that if you get down to
the lis real life scenario it's it's
never going to be good in that way so
number one thing just try to figure out
the lot of concepts that you're looking
up for the programming don't just get
emotionally attached with that it's
wrong now second thing is also related
to the emotions as well don't get
emotional about your code as well now
let me tell you about that once I was
working with the stadium graphic company
the company's job was simply to put
stadium graphics there on on various
kind of stadiums of baseball stadiums
and all of that it was a us-based client
and lovely client and it was pretty big
project more than thousand bucks so we
really enjoyed working on that project
and there was one appointment system on
which I was working on and eventually
what they were looking on is some good
way of having an appointment system
which is pretty much automatically like
as soon as the pointment is done the
payment should be paid off and then they
should receive an email and
automatically that should update in the
calendar and as well as set a reminder
alarm on their mobile app as well it's a
pretty complicated project and we were
working really really hard on that
project and eventually we did a really
lovely job on that but what happened
after that the client said we didn't
liked it and we really worked really
hard on that it was complete a mess and
Klein didn't liked it and that's it we
had to literally throw that code in the
garbage now that was not a waste of our
valuable time because obviously we may
try to use that in some other places as
well but to be honest at that point of
time we felt really really disheartened
there because it was so much of the hard
work we loved the code that we designed
but hey it happens it happens all the
time sometimes you put
feature there and people don't like that
feature and you have to literally throw
that in the garbage gam it happens it
will always happen so what I'm saying
it's just a piece of code don't get too
much emotional there it's it's meant to
be there just there and your job should
be looking up for getting better
programmer and don't get emotionally
attached sometimes you will design the
product you will design a feature and
eventually you have to just delete that
and somehow it felt like that so my
advice is keep that emotions aside and
keep that coding thing aside and always
I'll talk more about the programming
languages and all these things but my
number one advice is look out for many
languages there once you have mastered
one then look out for others because
there are other languages we can which
can does the same job much more
efficiently than what you are doing
right now so I hope this tip really
helped you out and in case you think
that this video can be helpful for
somebody make sure you share that on the
social network as well and make sure you
give it a thumbs up as well I am really
really liking this community on the
YouTube I cannot thank you enough I'll
keep making them old videos and I'll
surely catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
