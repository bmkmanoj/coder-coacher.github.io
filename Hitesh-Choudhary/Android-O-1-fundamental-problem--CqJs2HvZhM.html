with another video in this video I want
to talk about one fundamental issue that
is wrong from the developer's point of
view in the Android Oh stay tuned and
let's get started and talk about it
now before we begin with anything I know
some of you might be seeing an Apple
machine there and might be thinking that
this person is heavily biased towards
Apple no that is not the case although I
like the machines being produced by
Apple because they are very high in
quality and performs really well but
this is not the case I have recently
switched from iPhone 6 to 1 + 3 T and
I'm loving it I'm liking the Android
quite a lot in fact I tried Android once
before that was not that much good I
switched back to the Apple but this time
I'm sticking it I'm loving the Android
interface and one of the reason I'm
loving it because my phone is having the
latest things in here like the Android n
is there now but one thing that is
fundamentally wrong from the developers
point of view when you will try to
design apps for Android oh now I don't
know what be happy to say that there are
rumors that they are going to call it as
Android Oreo but I don't know what that
would be it's going to be a surprise
let's just see and waits out what they
call it coming back on to our point
what is this fundamentally wrong going
on with Android now if you have been
developer in the previous past you might
have seen when you try to design an app
and say that my app would be compatible
with Android and there is a block
message at the bottom the message simply
says that are you sure you want to
design an app for Android n because less
than 1% of the devices are using Android
n now here comes the fundamental issues
now if less than one person devices are
using Android n I know Android takes a
very huge masses of the audience and a
huge number of cell phones are using
Android but again still on top of that
if less than 1% of the Android devices
are using marché Android n the nougat
but on top of that you roll out Android
Oh what do you want to convey to me that
less than 0.5% of the devices will be
using Android Oh No
here comes the fundamental issues for
which nobody is talking about and we
need to discuss it so that it reaches to
the ears of the Google now whenever a
new phone is being launched I know the
phone is being controlled by other third
like Samson Bebo and one plus and all
all those brands that are out there
so whenever the Google and launches out
and update their the fundamental issue
that goes wrong in here as a consumer
that then this update will be available
to me to my phone that's the problem
arises if you design an app that uses
the latest feature no your phone is not
being installed with the latest
operating system and hence you are not
going to get that latest feature now
some people have to think that whether
my phone is going to have that operating
system or not or some people have to
wait for three months or four months
after the rollout of the things now this
is a complete different scenario when
you design an app for Apple because when
I design app in Swift and take advantage
of the new features being rolled out in
iOS 10 I am pretty sure that more than
90% of the devices are using the same
version of the operating system that I'm
designing for now I'm completely aware
that Apple is a closed ecosystem and
it's pretty much easier for them but
again the air the google has to come up
with some kind of solution in which more
number of devices the low end devices
are also compatible with their latest
operating system if that would be the
case it would be fantastic and it would
be a killer step in the Google air
environment there because now and I also
want one more thing that whenever the
Developer Preview or maybe a final roll
up version is being rolled out actually
on the same day or maybe within a ten
days or five days it should be rolled
out to mass public as well so that they
can take advantage of that operating
system otherwise it just in the U news
and that's it everybody is going to
forgot that people who are using let's
just say one-year old devices of Samsung
or maybe any other brand are maybe not
going to get that operating system and
it's bad your product is not reaching to
the consumer that is something we need
to deal up so I think this will create a
little bit buzz around and Google will
listen to it sometime in the future
maybe and we'll try to roll out
operating system that are much more
compatible with the low end devices and
more
can enjoy their latest operating system
regardless of whether they have bought
the phone one year ago or two years ago
or maybe they don't need to buy at least
a new phone now also there is one more
thing that since Google is not handling
or not is governing the companies like
Samsung and everything they like to just
customize this operating system quite a
lot and then roll out to the user and if
it this customization takes around six
month and everything it's no use and on
top of that when you give a message like
less than one percent of the users
devices are using this it doesn't make
sense to me to make an app there I hope
you got my point what I am trying to say
in here and in case you like this video
make sure you hit the like button and in
case you are new here consider
subscribing this channels we talked a
lot about programming and the tech news
around in here
so with this I'll catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
