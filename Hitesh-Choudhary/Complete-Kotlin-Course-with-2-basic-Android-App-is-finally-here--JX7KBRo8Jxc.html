course where you will be learning about
the fundamentals of Catalan as well as
will create two Android apps so that you
can understand how Catalan is being
utilized in making Android apps
my name is Satish and I'll be leading
you through this course I have been
programming for ten years and for the
last five years I have been teaching
students the tech that they want to
learn I have created successful boot
camps on iOS 10 testing web development
and react and I'm really happy to say
that this these boot camps are now
serving more than 60,000 students all
over the globe and I'm back here with
one of the finest course on Kotlin
Kotlin is already a big name in the
android development community but after
the announcement in the Google i/o that
now will be officially supporting the
Kotlin it has become a hot topic of
discussion it is very clear that in the
future the demand of Kotlin will rise
companies like Pinterest and uber are
already using Kotlin and a lot of
companies are using Kotlin to provide
additional feature the great thing about
the Kotlin is you don't have to rewrite
your Android app you can integrate
Kotlin with the existing Java project or
can use Java in the Kotlin and they are
completely interoperable now is the most
perfect time to learn Catalan because in
the future companies will expect you to
have the knowledge of Catalan even in
the future you will see that entire
Android development process will be done
completely in Catalan the goal of this
course is to make sure that you
understand code length properly the
course will talk about all of the things
like variables functions loops classes
objects and pretty much everything that
you can imagine in the Kotlin will not
leave you just with the cotton will also
make sure that you understand the
experience of designing the apps
although this course is not focused on
Android development still we'll be
creating two basic app completely in
Catalan so that you can understand how
Catalan is used in designing Android
apps the ideal student for this course
is somebody who is having a basic
knowledge of computers basic knowledge
like surfing to the
of installing a software at creating
files and folders on the system no prior
programming experience is required for
this training but if you have prior
programming experience it will surely
help now is the most perfect time to
learn Kotlin I'm really excited to see
you in this course
now hit the big green button that says
take this course or read the description
below for more information don't forget
to watch the introduction video which is
included free in this course and I'll
surely catch you up in this course I'm
really excited to teach Kotlin to
amazing audience here let's catch up
inside the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
