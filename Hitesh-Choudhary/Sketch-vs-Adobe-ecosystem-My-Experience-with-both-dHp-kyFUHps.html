code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey did everyone they
share back again with another video and
in this video we are talking about some
of the design stuff now first of all
don't assume that I'm a designer by
profession I'm a programmer and I like
to design my own stuff as well and from
last three years I've been using sketch
which is a great user interface design
stuff like tanks and I also do have some
experience with Adobe ecosystem I'll not
call any of the particular product like
Photoshop Illustrator or xD entire Adobe
ecosystem this video is going to help
you to understand a lot of things about
Adobe ecosystem as well as my experience
with sketch and you'll be able to make
better decision which one you should go
for and it's going to also help you to
understand that how the design industry
right now is working and on which
product you can focus on for enhancing
your scales and stuff like that so this
is going to be really helpful video for
all those designers who are looking
forward to start their journey in the
tech domain
first and foremost I would like to share
my journey of learning a few things
about the design now I'm not at all an
expert in design because my main job is
to write codes and coders or programmers
are usually not that much good in
designing things aren't changing now but
also let me get on to the point here so
first of all I got introduced with just
like everyone else I got introduced with
the Photoshop first I didn't heard about
the sketch and all these things in my
early childhood of course these things
were not there so I got introduced with
the Photoshop I got a little bit
intimidated with that because there were
so much options still it was fun to
learn I did brushed up a few skills on
Photoshop during early days and then I
moved into the illustrator that was a
strange choice because at that time
nobody was learning illustrator at least
in my surroundings a lot of other
peoples were doing it I have a good
experience with the illustrator I enjoy
designing some of the graphics I icons
some really bad cartoons they're not at
all good so I do had an experience with
that but I was not at all a designer I
was in fact a little bit afraid of the
designing stuff I used to just give
these stars to somebody else or
outsource them and I was into most of
the programming stuff but just like
almost three years ago I got introduced
with the sketch I loved it absolutely I
still do love sketch and it introduced
me the whole new era and whole do whole
new realm of the design aspect the
simple reason was it was having not so
many options like Photoshop Illustrator
they have so many options it's really
hard to find the tool that you are
looking for and in the sketch the things
were sorted out and it helped me to move
as an designer as well not a perfect
designer but I learned a lot of things I
was now designing my whole buttons and
my whole UI and of course when you make
sketch with things like envision and
stuff it becomes really awesome so
during those three year I learned quite
a lot about the designing stuff I
enjoyed that quite a lot now let me tell
you also some of the stuff which a lot
of people don't like to talk about it
but let me just answer them as well now
the industry is moving towards sketch
and in fact a lot of designers now are
switching totally on the sketch if they
are apt
app designers or maybe the web designers
as well but still most of the industry
is on still the Adobe ecosystem and by
the Adobe ecosystem I mean the Photoshop
Illustrator XD by the way I also do have
Adobe ecosystem in my computer as well
and I have tried given a shot some of
the Adobe XD I liked it little bit
because it is again precise not having
so much options and it's easy to
actually concur as compared to Photoshop
Illustrator so I like that now coming
back onto the whole point which is the
whole point of this video is which
product should you start working with
now if you want to just get with the
sketch again that's a really beautiful
choice but there is one big downside and
that's not the industry side that's a
big downside on the computer now in
order to work with the sketch you need
to have a Mac operating system it's a
Mac based product and that's it that's
the whole standard here now since I have
seen in the last years that most of the
designers are mostly working on a Apple
product so it's a no big brainer that
most of the industry is already
switching there but the important issue
is that there is still a huge community
which is using the windows and are not
able to just get the power what the
sketch is able to deliver and Adobe
actually realized that we have a lot of
market space that actually sketch has
created that's a market gap and we can
fill that up using Adobe XD amazing
product serves on cross platform for
Windows as well as for Mac I really
liked it I would say that it's honestly
a copy of the sketch what the sketch
actually came up with the tools and the
simplicity that are being copied exactly
in a variety of tools figma is no
exception
Adobe XD is no exception so obviously if
you want to become a designer for app or
web you can choose now Adobe XD as well
now also let me address this question
that a lot of people ask me that all
these things really cost money sketch is
not so much pricy but it cost money and
you need to have your Apple ecosystem as
well Adobe product also cost money it's
not really much it's around like 700
Indian rupees for just one product usage
but I think you can get a better deal if
you get like the whole flower
syntax thing the whole product thing
which is far more efficient as is a good
deal the thing that you get is really
amazing but sometimes people cannot even
afford 700 rupees per month as well but
here is my point with all of you once
you understand the product and you have
a mastery of learning that getting back
that 700 rupees is just a matter of time
and of course you're gonna get that
because the skill that you are learning
for designing can easily be outsourced
and can be provided to other companies
may be on the freelancer site and
obviously you can get your money back
pretty easily also let's address this
question which is quite common as well a
lot of people say that hey we have some
alternatives of Photoshop which are like
open source version maybe Inkscape or
other things which are out there maybe
GIMP that a lot of institutions use
because it's free now let me tell you
the fact that how industry works and
this is like some of the people are not
going to like it but this is how the
industry works you will find a lot of
jobs for the open source world in the
programming domain but when it comes to
the design ecosystem you will not find
various job opportunities that say hey
we want to hire a designer with the GIMP
or GIMP skills no it doesn't really work
most of the design jobs that you'll be
seeing are based on hey we want
designers who have skills in Photoshop
Illustrator
maybe sketch maybe XD whatever the job
is but basically it's either the Adobe
ecosystem or maybe the sketch so that's
the only option you can just argue with
me here base that hey there are some
exceptions people are looking for game
designers but as far as I can see in the
industry what I have been interacted
with the people based on that I can say
that it's either the Adobe ecosystem or
the sketch and there is not much market
for the people who have skills in GIMP
yes it's being taught quite a lot in the
institution because institutions
sometimes like to cut off their budget
in spending good amount of money for
Adobe or sketch licenses and that's why
they use Kim but yes your design skills
are always going to be helpful because
you now have understanding and knowledge
of how the colors actually contrast to
each other or how the colors can be used
these skills are always these skills
really do matter a lot but again I would
say that invest early
with money and time in learning either
the Adobe ecosystem or the sketch and
that's gonna be really helpful for you I
am sharing a lot of parts in this video
I hope you don't mind that one more
thing that I would like to talk in here
that recently our client work is
actually booming quite a lot and we are
getting a lot of clients and that's the
reason that's the main reason why I have
switched back on to the Adobe ecosystem
for last almost more than a year I was
using totally sketch and some free
online softwares for whenever I need
some of the basic Photoshop skills
that's basically what I have been doing
but you know what when you work with the
industry close to the Vedas startups and
Vedas client works they sometimes and
most of the time they're gonna send you
files and artworks in Photoshop or
illustrator being design some of them do
send us in sketch as well which I am
really happy because I can just because
you know when you want to have some
things like hey this button is not
looking good for 15 pixels of square of
the radius on the borders and we just
want to make it 10 sending back those
files back to designer is like really a
time-consuming process you can just if
you know the skills of sketch or
Photoshop or illustrator you can just
click on a few buttons and can change
that query pretty easily so I like to do
these stuff I don't like to send back my
designs to the designers and for that if
the design is coming in the sketch
that's good but know how the designs
don't usually come in this case they
always do comes up in mostly Photoshop
Illustrator so that's why we need to
have these software's as well here so
that's why we moved back into the Adobe
ecosystem as well as on the sketch as
well now since I do have my skills
little bit in Photoshop not much
honestly be here some more skills are
there on illustrator and I'm loving the
XD as well so probably in the future you
can expect some videos in these three
topics as well mostly on Adobe XD
because I love that product it's a good
competition for the sketch so probably
in the future you can see some of the
videos here again I openly accept that
that I'm not at all in designer but
since we have this huge and good
community at my youtube channel people
are really amazing here and really
skilled I am learning a lot from you
guys by making these videos I check out
all of the comments below
and there are really some good advice
and good tips so probably I can become a
better designer if I make videos on
these Photoshop and XT and programming
and all those stuff so that's why I
basically I'm gonna be posting most
videos on XD as well okay so I know this
video was more over a general talk about
my experience with Adobe ecosystem as
well as with the sketch and this video
is going to help you I'm pretty sure of
it if this video is going to help you to
take better decisions so that invest you
can invest your time as well as money
both in more reasonable places of course
I'm pretty open to have a discussion
with you guys in the comment section
that which product you like the most and
what are the reasons behind that
obviously it's gonna help me to learn
better and understand the things really
better and I have given you some insight
Peaks that how things are working and
how the clients actually sends you the
stuff and stuff like that so that's it
for this video I hope you have enjoyed
this video and yes I would like to also
make one more point here the Bell icon
is actually made for guys like me I do
post regularly every single week I post
like five or six videos but there's no
fixed time when I post video sometime
it's like 12 o'clock in the night
sometime it's like 5 o'clock in the
morning and sometime it's the daytime so
hit that Bell icon so that you can get
notified when I'm uploading the video
I'm consistent but there is no fixed
time when I'm gonna be posting the
videos so Bell I can is my best friend
so that's it for this video in case you
have enjoyed this video give it a thumbs
up and in case you want to stay around
with programming and design and tech
stuff do hit the subscribe button and
I'll surely get you up in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
