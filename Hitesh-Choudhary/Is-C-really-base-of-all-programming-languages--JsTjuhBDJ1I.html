another video in this video this is a
serious serious video this video might
change of your life might change the
entire perspective of how you see the C
language now a lot of people say that C
is the base of all programming language
now this is actually a true statement
but there are a lot of things that are
going on wrong with this statement and
in fact the kind of feels that this
statement gives to you and the
understanding that you're getting with
this statement is completely completely
wrong so let clear of all the myths and
discuss that in this video
in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps pretty
much everything related to programming
and technology scindia TR new here
consider subscribing now let's go ahead
and move on to our today's topic which
is C is the base of all programming
language now you even hear this
statement in all of the books all of the
teachers in the university in the
schools and even I have stayed this
statement quite a number of times but
I'm here I'm here to tell you that this
is completely a Gong statement now the
statement is in itself is completely
right that the C is the base of all
programming language but the meaning
that this sentence is conveying to you
is completely wrong now let me put up in
a much more detail so that you can
understand now what is happening see was
actually one of the very first
programming language I know a lot of
people are going to say hey they were
this programming language that were much
more previous than the C but let's just
say that T is one of the most primitive
language now what happened after that a
lot of new advanced languages were
developed like C++ and Java and they
they share a fair amount of syntax with
the C as well so it's not completely
wrong to say that the C is the base of
those languages okay that's okay but
what I'm trying to say in here that
since C is the base of all language the
fast to learn any programming language
doesn't necessarily need to be get
started with the C I have seen this see
this loop of C C++ Java enough of my
life this is completely a desired look
that people are going around in order to
learn Java you have to first start with
C because that's the base of a
programming language and then further
you have to move into C++ and Java this
is completely ample now don't ever ever
ever believe that and Who am I to say
this I've been programming for overall
over ten years and I do code every
single day I push my github repositories
almost every week I submit client
projects so I'm quite a lot into the
industry of iOS apps web apps and
everything and as this I would like to
share this great piece of advice if you
want to get started with a particular
program
language just directly get started with
that every language has been designed in
its own curriculum and its own paradigm
itself every programming language starts
from the basics of variables and all the
things that you can imagine so there is
no need to get started with C now in
case I'm not saying that C the bad
language you should not get started with
that but getting if you want to design
Android apps and you want to get started
with Java there is no need to waste your
time with C and C++ just directly get
started with Java you can learn any
programming language indirectly now a
lot of people will also jump up and say
another statement that when you know and
understand the C language since you are
already familiar with the syntax you can
actually grab the Java or maybe PHP
quite easily now again one of the
graphic statement this can be now if you
know PHP you can automatically switch
into C as well so all I'm saying is most
of the programming language shares
almost exactly the same syntax there are
a few - here and there things but this
is this is all about it a person who is
having a great amount of experience in
PHP ask him to shift into JavaScript C
will be he will be easily because a lot
of syntax and a lot of concepts of
programming in the PHP shares the syntax
in JavaScript as well ask any programmer
of Java to shift into Swift and he will
be for sure there is a lot of similarity
of the syntax like loops and variables
there as well so no need to get worried
about that so the myth that says that
hey C will help you to get started in
other language this is completely a
wastage of time because you pick up your
favorite language that is already your
favorite and just directly get started
with there so all of the submarine here
is choose your language though there is
no prerequisite of other language to
learn about it just directly get started
with lack that particular language
interested in JavaScript get started
with that interested in Java get started
with that there is no such loop like you
have to first learn C then C++ then Java
and maybe PS reason is there is no such
loop you can anytime take up
language and can get started there so in
case you think that this video was
helpful give it a thumbs up
in case you're saying that this video
can help can be helpful for somebody
else make sure you share it on social
media I'll catch you up in the next
