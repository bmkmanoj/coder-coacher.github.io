again with another video and yes I'm
excited super happy and super thrilled
to announce this exciting news this is
not our regular video stuff this is so
exciting amazingly exciting that are not
even gonna be rolling the intro this
time so let me just don't waste any much
more time here let me come directly to
the news learn code online is now
learned code online incorporation
registered at Delaware in United States
of America I am super pumped and super
excited to tell you this news that
finally what started as just a side
project learn code online is now a
registered incorporation and that to
United States of America so what does
this means to you so this news actually
is having side by side effect for Indian
users and non Indian users as well so
let me first come to the Indian users
how this is going to affect you for all
of the Indian users there is only and
only good news for you nothing is going
to be affecting you much because all of
your payment things all of your course
access and all everything is gonna
remain exactly same the only good news
is that now all of the certification are
much more valuable as we have got
registered in u.s. a and also recently
since we got registered here this news
got out through some of my friends and
everybody they have approached me and
have asked me that hey could you
recommend some people so that we can
fast forward our process of hiring so
very soon I will be recommending a few
people who have done exceptionally well
in the courses and those people will get
some of the opportunities to work as an
intern or maybe full-time job in two
companies and the companies are in
Malaysia in India as some of them are in
USA as well so definitely I'll be
recommending some of the exceptional
people there also since our
certification is now off much more
valuable you can just completely rely
that courses are going to be of much
more quality and the certification is
now much more valuable as compared to
previous so again nothing to be worried
everything is awesome here and this is
Ana super exciting news for you
coming to the international students I
will be referring to non Indian students
all the students from maybe Sri Lanka
maybe USA maybe from
Paris and London and all these people
yes I was getting a lot of requests that
we want to have an access of your course
and some of my courses are having
exclusive content as well as some
courses are exclusive that really we're
having were only be uploaded at learned
code online so now you can just visit
global dot learn code online dot in and
you can access all those courses yes the
website is gonna remain same because I
don't think that there is much sense in
dividing all these websites so yes
website will be again same learn code
online dot in courses dot learn code
online dot in is gonna be the website
dedicated only for Indian users and for
international users it's gonna be global
dot learn code online Dakin also I would
like to share some of my thoughts that
why I have chosen to register learn code
online in United States and why actually
there are two separate subdomains
courses and global for different kind of
students Indian and international one
let me tell you a couple of inside story
or backstage story for this as well a
lot of people don't know that what is
happening at the backside when somebody
makes a payment now there is a whole lot
complicated process when you take a
business or do a business for such thing
just to give you brief of that thing in
India when somebody purchases any online
course or something 18 percent of that
goes straight to the government for
Texas yes for restaurant there is five
percent tax and for education there is
18 percent of taxes not only the taxes
management there is a whole lot process
known as compliances and all such things
when you follow up any payment gateway
or such service so obviously I was
looking forward for something that I
don't have to get worried about Texas
and all these things I want to keep
everybody separate for Indian users as
well as for overseas payment and that is
why the two sub domains the courses one
and the global one and to be honest
nobody likes to pay his taxes but again
there is no option when you are doing
such business or you are moving forward
we have to do it but again you don't
have to worry about any such things I
just wanted to share such things with
you so that's why I have shared it again
you don't have to worry about any single
thing about that the whole news is that
finally we have got registered ourselves
in Delaware United States of America and
can keep focusing on what I am doing
already making amazing courses making
sure that the technology actually
reaches to you directly via code and all
such things also there is a huge
increase in the clients that we are
getting from overseas as well regarding
app development web development and a
couple of other tasks as well so I have
already hired a couple of interns as
well
there will be more interns and all these
things obviously if the things are going
to grow big I will be hiring more people
more interns more hand that can just
assist me and all such things so I'm
right now really more excited more
pumped up that I cannot just share much
more things I'm really excited here
sorry about that but you know it's an
exciting news
so I'll get a little bit settled down
and we'll probably talk you in the next
video right now it's a party time for us
and I'm super pumped up so catch you up
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
