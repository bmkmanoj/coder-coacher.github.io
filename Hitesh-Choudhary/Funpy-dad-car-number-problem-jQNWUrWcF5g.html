begin our very first problem now before
I even start to write the code for this
problem and teach you how to write the
problem or solution three points three
very crucial point point number one the
complexity of the problems is going to
increase as we proceed with this series
now right now in the very initial movies
you will feel that hey this is something
everybody can do but later on the
complexity will increase quite a lot we
are even going to tackle down how to
analyze the data or web scrapping and a
lot of things will come up for sure
point number two is whenever you see
these a streak mark in all of the
problems that means your job starts from
here now very top will be the problem
and I'm going to be solving it along
with you and as soon as we hit the S
trick this means you need to solve
further of the problem obviously this is
going to be based on our first problem
set then you'll be doing this a lot of
you are going to say hey boo you are not
giving us the solution for rest of the
problem no I'm not going to be giving
you because programming needs a little
bit gentle kick in D you know the word
so you really need to push yourself a
little bit harder and these are not
extreme problems after this so go ahead
try it yourself now the point number
three is you can find these kinds of
solution anywhere on the internet but
the whole point of the series is to make
sure that I teach you how the solution
was built up so quite a lot of talk we
have done now let's read the problem so
the problem is really simple my dad
wants to buy a new car and he's very
picky about getting the number plate of
the car he went on to the Transportation
Department and they have given us the
direction that we can choose any number
between 4,000 to 6522 okay sounds good
and now my dad is saying hey I believe
so much in the numeral
so seven is my lucky number I I can get
a number which is a multiple of seven
but multiple of five is not lucky for me
so he's not looking for any multiple of
five he's looking that it should be a
multiple of seven okay right that's cool
and we need to write a problem for the
solution so that's going to be
interesting and once we write the code
for it then I'll show you what the
remaining part is here okay so let me
get a lot of enters here and I need to
remove this okay that's cool so first of
all let's write a pseudocode so what is
the problem going on here first of all
we need to confine our obviously you
have understood that we need a loop here
so we need to confined our Rube on some
range so we have to say take a range
between what can i say 4006 522 okay so
that's the problem number one okay we'll
take a range and we'll do a loop or
between these numbers that's cool and
then the second problem is it should be
a multiple of seven that means if I just
talked a little bit programmatically
then let's just say I is our number
which can be any number in between that
particular range then if i divided the
by seven the mount and the remainder
should be zero so if I talk about
programmatically if i divide it by seven
then the modulus or the remaining should
be zero modulus gives you only the
remainder the percentage sign okay
that's cool and now here's the
interesting part we need to apply and
logic here it's not about our logic
either one should be true or the second
should be true now we need to apply both
of the things so that's the first part
and that's the first problem set of the
solution the second is it should not be
a multiple of five and how can i do that
i can simply say and the eye when i
divide it by five for example when I say
person by five it should not give me
zero so if i write this this is going to
be wrong because it should not give me
zero so i'll put an exclamation there
there we go we have built up a logic and
finally we need to print all
words there we go sounds simple and this
is how exactly every problem is being
solved so now we don't need to look at
the problem we just need to look out
here so we need to find out what is how
we can actually loop through a range so
let me just quickly give you a simple
browser there radish my browser there we
go so we need to look for something
range in Python and range in Python okay
and obviously we are looking for Python
3 so Bison Range function explain okay
we are looking for something which we
can rotate through it and obviously we
can see there is a range function and it
has a couple of parameters like rain
start stop and step okay so we can give
it a start we can give it a stop and
there we go a simple cool example range
in five and it print start from zero to
four so it's not inclusive if you want
to include it make sure that you give it
a number afterwards okay particular
example now we have learned it and
that's pretty good for us so now let's
write a code for it so first of all we
need available to store all of our
values so let me call this as a num cars
or columns and that's going to be a
simply list let's give it an empty list
for now we'll be storing all of our
numbers here now let's write a code for
I in range and that's how we write the
loop there and notice it gives us a
physician they're all thanks to the
add-on of Python suggestions so we are
looking for the ships let me write it
again and there we go so start and stop
what are the ranges for us so let me
give it a start reindeer and the start
range is 4000 so there we give 4000
comma now we need to give it a stop
range which is going to be 65 to 365 23
because range is non-inclusive so we
have to give a one number ahead okay we
don't need to give the step because
that's an optional argument if you don't
give it the problem at all okay looks
cool and i'll put a call in there okay
there we go now we are inside the loop
now we need to test for every I so I'm
going to be writing a very
simple logic here so let me just write
it there if I is and exactly i will be
copying and pasting double logic here so
pretty easy I modulus by seven if it is
there then it's good now we need another
kind of a condition here and then I'm
going to be saying I should when I / 5
okay it should not be equivalent to 0 so
equivalent to 0 where is equal 0 there
we go looks nice so it should be a
complete divisible by 7 but when I
divided 55 it should not be completely
divided okay there we go we have built
up a pretty easy logic now let's just
have our numb coach dot up end this is
again a pretty easy method that we have
here and there we go now we would like
to store all of this here we can do it
right now it's going to be pretty easy
but let me show you one trick here
pretty interesting one and what I'm
saying is here that you can give it an
eye and that code is going to be working
really fine but I like it to be
converted into the string how can i do
that i just have to apply spr function
there and now it's this i is actually
being converted into the string and why
am i doing it because when i actually
print it let me just get out of this
loop when i print it let me just give
you a print when i print this I want it
to be separated by the comma so this is
how you write it this is my separator
and I want it to be joined this is the
syntax here join and now you need to
give it the variable or the list in this
case it's numb car ok let me get here
how what's happening here so this is
what we are appending every time but we
are storing not the numbers the strings
here because I want a string to be
presented as comma separated and this is
how the join works here pretty simple
pretty easy we have started very very
basically so let me just open this up
let's see if it works or not python3 and
it's going to be a dad car number 0
py let's hit enter okay so we have got
here a huge list here which start as 400
for and 400 1 and you want to do a quick
check then you can simply open up your
spotlight and can say 40 11 / 7 and it's
divisible and right now just a divisible
but you know you got the point V we want
a complete divisible here so this is the
entire point now let's go back and talk
about one more thing now what you have
to do we have done this problem simply
now make this code modular what you want
to do is right now we have written every
values as hard coded you want to convert
this code as modular so that upper range
should be asked the lower range should
be asked and the multiplier should be
asked avoidable and preferable multiple
should be asked so I hope you can do
that it's going to be pretty easy you
just have to use a little bit of your
brain I hope everybody will be able to
do it pretty simple example that we have
followed up now I'll catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
