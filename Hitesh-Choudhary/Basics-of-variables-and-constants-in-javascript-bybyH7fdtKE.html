learn code online dot n and in this
video we're gonna be talking about more
stuff on JavaScript now first and
foremost I would like to mention that my
dear friends have patience without
patience you can never be a good
programmer so when people start with the
stuff like readable z' and loops and all
these things people just are so much
eager that they they don't want to focus
on these basic concept rather they just
want to build big stuff and remember all
these big stuffs arpa are built using
the small chunks and these are all the
small chunks like your loops and
functions and what are other things we
are going to learn here so we're gonna
be starting from absolutely scratch and
I expect that by the end of the series
you will be able to do more than a lot
of things and well that can be a simple
example here notice on my website here
on my recent videos I don't push these
videos on to my website they
automatically get fetch from my youtube
channel so this is all done using the
cold JavaScript and yes you can actually
do that that's pretty easy stuff and
even the things like Dom manipulation
this can all be done using the
JavaScript so this is like one of the
many example that we can possibly do
with that but in order to do all of that
what we need to have is a lot of
patience so let's get started and talk
about few fun stuff and basic stuff
about JavaScript so we're gonna create a
new file in the basics and here we're
gonna be creating a new file and let's
just call this as variables
'drj yes I'm keeping all of that as
lower and there we go
okay so first of all we learned about
how we can have just a console dot log
but now we're gonna be moving more
further now imagine you have a bank
application that you want to design or
maybe a game that you want to design now
you don't want to just always say
strings and all of these things you
might want to store some of the name of
the player maybe some school from the
game or something like that
so for that we require the concept of
variables now in JavaScript the
variables are defined using let now the
only difference between a variable and
constant
variable can vary and constant cannot
now we will talk about constant later on
but just to give you a brief idea
constant start with this keyword see ons
T Const but we're gonna be just talking
about the let which is variable so what
is available basically it's a it's a
space in the memory that you say is hey
you reserved it for me I'm gonna put
something into it now javascript is an
amazing language like for example let's
just define a simple variable called it
as name and we're gonna keep it really
simple we're gonna be using a very
simple named John here now that's pretty
much it you have declared available and
you have got into it into your variable
the name John now JavaScript is a smart
language in some of the other
programming languages you need to
mention beforehand that hey what kind of
value will be storing in that variable
now this is available and this is the
value in some languages if you are
storing like a string like this one John
or if you are storing something like 2
which is a number or maybe 2.3 which is
a float value yes we call them as a
float if it is a decimal number then you
have to explicitly mention that what
kind of value is about to come into my
variable but in JavaScript you simply
don't it just is a smart enough to
determine what kind of value is coming
up now here is a quick thing that always
always you should keep in mind so let's
just declare another variable which
we're gonna call a score now let's just
say you make a score of 100 now this is
not a number here now whenever you put
anything inside these codes then it
automatically becomes string now some
people like to use the double quotes
that's also fine but still this is not a
number this is still a string anything
inside these codes automatically becomes
a string and it's translated into the
string now if you want to store any
number here like for example 103 is the
score then just directly mention the
number without the code so there we go
you have learned how you can create your
very first variable you have learned how
you can reserve some space in the memory
and call out whenever you need that so
the good point or the question is how we
can use them further it's really simple
whenever you want to use it you just
name the variable there for example we
have learned that we can have console
dot log and in here previously we were
saying
world notice this hello here is written
inside these single codes that means we
were directly printing this string here
now since for this string we have
something which is name we can directly
mention that and again notice here if
you if you're gonna be mentioning the
name here then it will be printed as
directly name because it's a string you
want to print a variable when you want
to do that you don't write any codes you
just directly say is name here
okay so let's first run this thing and
then we're gonna figure out rest of the
stuff as well there's a lot more to
discuss so we're gonna be saying node
and then simply the file name variable
jeaious
so there we go we have got our John
being printed on the console okay now
the common question is why didn't school
print it out simply because we never
asked it to do so the question again is
hey why we didn't used any semicolons
here we use the semicolons here we are
not using it what about that javascript
is pretty forgivable about using the
coasties semicolons so even if you don't
use them that's totally fine that's
totally okay not at all a big deal in
some other programming language it can
be but here it's just simply fine okay
so these are some of the basic stuff now
as I was talking about these things
which are code and let's just say you
have hundred here and let's just say we
have one more variable this is something
like a bonus maybe and you got a bonus
of let's just say 20 points for your
user and what next you want to do is you
want to calculate the total score so
let's just say let total score is gonna
be equal to score plus bonus there we go
and you're expecting that total score
now consists of score plus bonus so 100
plus 20 is gonna be hundred and 20 now
notice when I just try to print that out
total score you're gonna be seeing
something different because these are
not counted as numbers when we have them
in the codes these are string so notice
when I just go ahead something like that
and run that command again notice there
is a there's a spelling mistake that I
did I shouldn't have done that my bad so
there we go save that and now we can
run that again and notice here you're
getting a really big number here which
is 120 so this is what exactly happens
when you have strings in the strings
they are just concatenated beside each
other but when you want some complex
operation being performed maybe just an
addition then you have to actually use
the numbers here so for example if I
just change back to a hundred and this
is not 20 now it will give you
drastically different result just save
that and run that again and now you have
got 120 so very very big difference
between what is considered as number and
what is considered as string and this
should be the first thing that everybody
should understand while learning the
programming okay so there we go
let me quickly summarize what we have
learned so far and then we're gonna move
further we have learned that we have two
types of things the string and the
numbers and obviously numbers can have
decimal values as well that's totally
fine too and we usually call them as
float values numbers should never be
wrapped around in the codes and we
always wrap around in the single quotes
about the string if you want to print
out the variable name we just mentioned
that variable name without the codes if
you want to print out exactly the same
like John just like what we did in the
hello world we'd wrap that around in the
single codes okay so there we go
all basic stuff now we're gonna be
having one more code example here let's
just say you want to have name of a
person it's a very common thing in the
banking applications that in one form
you write your first name in the second
form you write your second name and then
the website prints RP or a combination
of first name and last name so let's
just do how we can do that now let's
just assume this is coming up from a
form from a website but we are gonna be
holding that in two variable so let's
just say we're gonna be calling it as
first name now notice here one more
thing I'm using a camel casing here
which is a common practice in
programming now I'm using f as lowercase
and n as uppercase now I don't need to
use that I can simply say first name
that is also fine I love to use camel
casing it's read it's more readable
that's why I use it but what I cannot do
is I cannot say something like first
understand first space name and that is
gonna be something like John I
cannot do that variables names cannot
have space in them for sure if you like
you can have underscore that's totally
fine
but I'm kind of a programmer who likes
to use camel casing because it's more
readable something like total score
that's I have done already so there we
go we have got our first name as John
let's just say we have got our last name
that is gonna be equal to Joe very very
famous people John Doe and Jane Doe from
the programming world everybody uses
them as a reference and I'm no exception
so how we can concatenate them now there
are a couple of options how you can go
let me just walk you through with all of
them so first of all we're gonna be
saying something like a console dot log
and inside in here I'm gonna say
something like this first name and then
I can add a plus here and I can say last
name there we go so this is your method
one say that and if we run that you will
be noticing something strange which is
your John Doe is printed but there is no
space between them because we never said
we are gonna be having space so you can
add a space here that's one way of doing
the things
remember in programming you always have
multiple ways of doing the things and
probably all of them are correct or this
is the one way or the second way could
be you can add one more string so you
can concatenate it you'll be seeing that
quite a lot and just like that so what
we are saying here is this is our one
string which is variable this is our
another string which holds just space
and then the three so we are basically
concatenating three strings here imagine
John is written here just exactly
replace this with this guy this last
name is exactly replaced by your toe and
the space just prints out there so there
we go save that and run that again and
there we go just to visualize this
example instead of the space if we would
have something like - then it would be
replaced by a - so that's a good
visualization of the example okay so
there we go that's nice thing that's one
way of doing the thing and there can be
another way like for example you can
have something like let full-name and
that is gonna be equal to first name and
then you can concatenate
it with a last name so exactly the same
thing multiple ways of doing the things
now if you want to add more spaces in
between them and one more string here
just like that and can have something
like space or maybe - or anything what
you like let's just say for some weird
reason I want to have a star to star in
here that's weird and what I can do here
is I can just have a console dot log
whoops and a space there console console
dot log and I can directly mention full
name there we go so that's it
all of them are exactly same ways and I
can just run this file again and here we
go we have God John star star Doe so
there we go pretty easy stuff and this
is your very first introduction about
variables so now you might be wondering
that hey things like school changes all
the time maybe name is allowed to be
changed multiple times so we should be
using this variable quite a lot and
there another thing is something known
as the Const which we'll be talking
about probably later on you might be
thinking that hey constant is like fixed
we cannot change it once it's declared
like for example here I have said that
the first name is John I can change that
later on using this so you might be
wondering hey what's the use of constant
and I would say probably more than the
variable and trust me it's coming up
from experience you might want to use a
lot more constant as compared to
available because you might want to set
up things fixed like for example your
bonus score should be 20 all the time so
you might want to replace that with a
constant when you're opening up a bank
account for a person you want that his
pan ID pan card or his probably bank
account number should always remain same
so you might want to have a constant
there instead of variable and there are
tons of cases like that now this brings
up the question is how we can change the
name here so let me just walk you
through how we can change the name first
and foremost don't ever ever really
clear your variable don't do this
there's something like this let first
name is equal to be leches
Jane no it is not at all allowed and as
soon as you'll save this and run that it
is going to give you a lot of errors
this is not allowed because you can only
declare a variable once this is the name
for it we have declared it that's it
forget about it
you cannot read Eclair it if you want to
change it just don't use the Lett and
that's it as simple as it sounds and
there we go
so this is what we are having so run
that again and it's gonna run fine but
things actually change when instead of
the let you use Const now Const is for
constant and it can change things
drastically right now it doesn't give
you any error but constant simply means
once you have declared and setup a value
that's it that's it I'm really really
rigid and I'm not gonna change anything
so when you run these kinds of things
you again get an error simply say hey I
don't know how to change this you have
said that hey it's gonna be constant and
then you are trying to change it how is
it that possible so don't just kind of a
misguided your program don't do that
if you want to use your variable declare
it as let and if you want to use it as a
constant be prepared and declare it as a
constant so this is your very first
introduction about variables some
constant some of the quick data types
that you should have don't worry if it
is not much clearer eventually when will
be writing the code building some
applications things are gonna get much
more clear so that's it for this video
keep visiting learn code online dot in
and I'm gonna surely catch you up in the
