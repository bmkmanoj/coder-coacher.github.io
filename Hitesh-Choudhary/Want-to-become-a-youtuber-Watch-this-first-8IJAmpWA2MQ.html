year back again with another video in
this video we're gonna talk about
YouTube so some of you might be very
influenced by youtubers you watch the
content of boo and bomb amazing
storyteller little bit well here some
time but amazing storyteller of India
you watch the content of KC night staff
amazing storyteller a lot of efforts
being put up in cinematography and all
other things and you see and you catch
up your mind that hey I'm gonna start on
my own YouTube channel I will become the
next face of YouTube but before you get
started and become the next youtuber
there are always certain questions in
mind how much money can I make from
YouTube what are the amount of efforts
that I have to put up in YouTube what
camera should up by up what mic should I
buy up and a ton of more things now this
video is going to help you to understand
what is YouTube how you can get started
in that and whether you should be
getting started or not so this is a well
planned video that you are going to
enjoy for sure if there is a little bit
hint in your mind that I should even
start my youtube channel so let's talk
about the way you do
well Before we jump on and talk a lot
about YouTube let me give you my
perspective on making money now I
consider that making money is an
essential part for everybody for you for
me for everyone we all have to pay bills
for our internet for our food for our
house rent or whatever that might be the
scenario money is an essential part now
if you offer your services in an
exchange you are getting money for that
I consider this as totally ok now what
it depends is how much you are ethical
in offering your services and how much
you are not being ethical is a
completely different debatable service
so we are not going to talk about that
now let's talk about the YouTube the
hero of this video now I would only
consider the creator community of
YouTube here only now we are not
considering the how many types of
Watchers are there on YouTube and
everything let's just categorize the
people in only the category of who makes
video and upload on YouTube now easily
it can be divided into three categories
here the big chunk of this is people who
are after the money the very small
category is of influencers and then the
rest of the others people who just
upload some videos get a few subscribe
or get a few views and then just leave
it and all other categories who upload
it on a random basis just for sharing a
video or sending some files video files
to other person and all these categories
so let's just keep this other category
aside we are not worried much about it
the only category that we are worried
about is making money and influencers
now I will not be beating around with
the bushes
I would directly like to introduce first
of all this category as with money
makers now in this category I would like
to categorize all those people who want
to make money directly with YouTube and
when I say directly with YouTube there
is just one way that is having
advertisement on your videos it is all
controlled by YouTube so you have
nothing to do in that now I am not
putting up here like patreon and people
who are donating for your work and all
these things because they are different
categories and they for me consider Lea
they thumbs up into the influencers so
let's start
a little bit in detail about all the
people who are just after the money on
YouTube now also hunter a given fact I
don't consider this offensive if you are
on a YouTube platform to make money
that's okay that's completely fine
everybody has to make money somehow now
for making just money on YouTube just
with the advertisers platform you don't
need to buy expensive mic you don't need
to buy expensive camera you don't have
to work on your skills the camera
editing color correction nothing nothing
at all
you can directly getting started by
making money on YouTube so you might be
asking hey how is that possible now in
order to just make money since you are
heavily dependent and only dependent on
the YouTube video ads you have to push
up videos on YouTube regardless of
whatever the video content is how much
the popular is it or not you just have
to push the content whether that content
can be created just for a mobile phone
from a laptop or any other camera or
anything like that your goal is just to
push the videos the only thing that you
have to take care is that video should
be trendy trendy likes our top 5 haunted
place in the world top 5 expensive
hotels in the world these videos do
really well now it is not guarantees
that you will build a really loyal
audience or subscriber for you but you
are not after the subscriber subscriber
has nothing to do with the views views
have a direct relation of making money a
person who is having like a million
subscriber and have like just hundred
thousand views per month will make far
more less money or with the second
person who is having like 10 million
views per month and having like zero
subscribers so that is what you are
after views views and that set views now
in order to make such videos like
trending on like movie hints and
top-five Marvel heroes to 5 DC heroes
you just need a video editing software
there plethora of them on the internet
all you have to do here is pick up some
random images through a voiceover and
that's it you are done easiest way to
get started with the money now don't
expect that people will know you and you
will make an impact know you are after
the money so go directly for that don't
just beat around the bushes go for your
target go for money now if you want to
go after the money there is also another
way which I call
read repeat this is really the easiest
way again a little bit tough than just
making taking an Audi a software and
just putting some in audio and clips on
that and throwing on the Internet there
is another way which I call read repeat
now what you have to do you have to read
a little bit not much because all you'll
be doing is mugging and throwing up you
are reading some content from a blog and
just present it on to your audience yes
of course I don't like that much of the
content but you are not about liking
what I like or not you're just after
putting your videos getting a view
getting a watch time that's it
so go ahead read what is in the trend
recently a lot of Geo thing was in the
trend in India so everybody was making a
videos on Geo now it doesn't really care
what you are serving to your audience or
not since you are having these trendy
keywords like geo or what is happening
currently right now in your keyword
title and your keywords your video will
be searched and will get views on that a
lot of people also does is a news format
which is which has proven a great on
YouTube always being searched trendy and
generates a really good amount of money
get yourself some news news about prime
minister or something happening
technical whatever that is because
you'll be able to put a lot of good
keywords in your video legally and in
your title as well so news format is
again the most favorite for all the
youtubers who are after money search e
trendy makes you money now let's move
ahead on to the next category which is
influencers now will I will come back on
to this money topic again because there
are a couple of few things that I really
want to talk about in this but first
let's move on to influencers now
influencers are solely responsible that
you have thought that I should have a
youtube channel and get started on that
they are really influencing they know
how to deliver the topic and are doing
amazing job here now you might be
wondering does influencers do not make
money with YouTube yes they do make
money with YouTube video ads and all
these things but they are not solely
dependent on that kind of income now
these kinds of influencers are really
skilled and I will not call them as an
extraordinary Pro but yes I would not
even call them as a beginner whether
that's a storytelling singing acting
direction or entire series makeup or
maybe programming or maybe anything
technical they are serious here and they
make a lot of impact by just showing off
what they actually know now it usually
looks like that they're all money
they're lavish life is coming up from
the YouTube money yes it might be
possible that a kind of a big chunk
might be coming from YouTube but to be
honest that's not the whole story most
of their income doesn't come up from
YouTube since they are influencer they
are very skilled they are doing a lot of
other jobs than YouTube's method whether
that's a programming job maybe singing
dancing acting Direction whatever that
might be and since because they are
doing such other jobs they are making
really good amount of money they are not
directly dependent on YouTube ad revenue
and thus they'd really don't care about
that they have all these expensive
equipments and they can invest a lot of
money in making their YouTube videos
extraordinary awesome and thus a lot of
people just worry about hey I can make
that amount of money from YouTube and
I'm gonna be the next rock star of
YouTube so yes the ultimate question is
if these people are making already good
amount of money why they are coming on
YouTube now YouTube is like a social
media just like you have a Facebook
account a Twitter account YouTube is
also a social media the reason why these
people come onto the platform like
YouTube is just to improve learn and
sometimes just for fun now you might
have seen that the people who were not
good with cameras and good wittle'
something like storytelling eventually
improves as the time goes and this is
the number one reason for being YouTube
I personally have found out that YouTube
is like the creative mining for me I can
dig up whole day on the YouTube and can
improve myself your speaking abilities
improve your confidence level improves
your impact on the society gets a pretty
bigger and it helps you to get even more
clients for whatever the work you are
doing so yes sometimes you become even
much more what you are already by
becoming a youtuber YouTube is all about
improving on the Facebook or Twitter I
can just post a text and that's it
becoming a youtuber is far more than
that we have to constantly evolve there
is so much to learn about
cameras color-correction how to upload
engaging content storytelling there are
tons of things and there is no end of
this and that is why most of the people
join YouTube it's so much fun
the audience is really connected to you
you feel like you're talking directly to
somebody it's really a great thing but
yes sometime it becomes really a hectic
thing because you have to manage your
clients your work and then on top of
that YouTube comments and everything but
yes it's the ultimate fun and you just
push yourself beyond the limits and
that's why a lot of influencer are on
YouTube now since we don't have much
talk about others these are the people
who are just getting started on YouTube
some of them will grow quite a lot and
some of them will just quit so these are
the categories which are also good in
number great amount of people but really
we don't have nothing to discuss about
them the two main categories are just
the money makers and the influencers now
let's just answer a couple of questions
that everybody has in its mind how much
money you can make on YouTube now let me
clear that subscriber doesn't matter at
all for how much you are gonna make it
all depends on your type of audience yes
it is not directly related to views yes
views who really do put an impact of how
much you will be making but it depends
on how much the quality of your audience
if your audience is like buying audience
they buy by seeing the ads and all these
things that means you're gonna make far
more money in your views now yes it is
also possible that a person who is
having just like 30000 views of really
the buying audience will make a huge
amount of money as compared to the
person who is having like hundred
thousand views per month whose audience
is not buying at all they are just
watching the content and they never buy
on the ads being served on to them so
make sure you choose your audience
wisely here if your content is top-notch
and quality content that means a quality
audience will be watching your content
and they are the community of the people
who just likes to buy and invest in all
these things so chances are high that
you can earn a lot more with the buying
audience even with a small amount of
views as compared to the other person
who is having huge number of news now
according to the YouTube policy I
not just disclose my exact amount how
much I am making but just to give you a
rough idea it's not personally my
everything it's a idea being discussed
by a lot of other youtubers as well who
happen to be my friend is simply because
simply just a rough idea once you cross
like 50,000 subscriber it's a decent
amount of income because you have like
constant views coming up and you'll be
making around three US digit dollar
income with like above fifty thousand
once you have crossed like hundred
thousand subscriber then eventually your
income may rise up a little bit more
than for us digit dollars
that's a brief idea that I can give to
you right now apart from this disclosing
the exact figure is not in YouTube
policies and I don't want to get any
trouble there is one very essential
thing that you need to understand about
YouTube YouTube is a business and just
like everybody else this business also
needs to make profit in order to survive
and YouTube will do every possible thing
to make sure that it becomes a
profitable business now it doesn't
really care whether you have five
subscribers five thousand or five
million subscriber if you're making a
mess around YouTube is gonna kick you
and they will show no mercy your account
may get closed now say whatever you want
to say to YouTube but it's ultimately
their business so make sure you also
understand that that putting all of your
AG in just one basket that is YouTube is
never ever a good idea another important
question is it worth spending time all
on YouTube I would say it depends now if
you are at initial level I would not
consider that you should be going out
and start a YouTube channel just like
that now yes this is not about stopping
here from YouTube obviously you will be
your own church and nobody to ask you to
stop right there and don't go for
YouTube if you want to go just go ahead
but hear me out on this now I consider
that if you are at a very initial level
starting a YouTube channel will give you
extra burden on your shoulder you don't
want that right now if you're a beginner
your stage is for learning stage now
whatever your domain is it might be
singing dancing acting story writing
storytelling whatever that is
make sure you enhance your goals whether
that's a programming even so you enhance
whatever you know already at the bigness
stage invest all of your time money and
energy in enhancing these things and at
a very early stage if you're going to
get started with YouTube you will get
extra burden YouTube is a platform for
sharing knowledge and at a big nerd
stage you don't have much knowledge to
share around if you want to become a pro
in anything don't just fool around
get yourself proper training proper
coaching whatever you want to become it
doesn't really mean only take
programming coaching's and programming
courses singing dancing acting whatever
that is stop fooling around
get yourself proper training and get
yourself really pro in whatever you
really want to do if you are getting a
proper training for whatever you like to
do and on the side note you are just
putting up a channel on which you just
show off your work whatever you are
doing that's okay that's fine but don't
take it as a responsibility that we have
to show up on YouTube every single day
don't do that this is also a common
question that I get how much does it
impact about having good title good
description and keywords and all these
things now what I personally would say
here is the content is the king and
there is no match for it you put up a
really bad title or maybe no keywords at
all just a couple of line of description
it doesn't really matter that much all
you need to have is the content if your
storytelling the way how you express the
thing or you are just able to convince
what you want to say perfectly to the
audience that's it that's how it matters
and one thing that I don't like is
mugging up and throwing don't just read
on a blog and throw it on to the camera
this is not something add your own
flavor to that add your own style add
your own thoughts that's what make a
content really amazing and influencing
on a final note to all big nurse I would
like to say that don't fool around with
making a YouTube channel if you are a
total beginner get yourself proper
training whether that's an acting
singing directing programming whatever
that is
stop fooling around get yourself
properly trained and be serious in life
you can make a lot more money as
compared to what you are thinking is
there on YouTube yes definitely on this
platform there is money but that
amount of money you can easily earn
within two or three days if you'll
properly get skilled in whatever you
want to do
I usually don't take stand on a direct
question like this but this time I have
to I have seen and I have received an
email from like two or three person who
are dropping out from their school and
college just to become a youtuber I
would like to say YouTube is not worth
it yes exactly
those words YouTube is not at all worth
it
that you should be dropping up your
education and starting a YouTube channel
totally yes in the past you have seen
that some of the youtubers are totally
successful in doing that but trust me
you can make a lot more money and a lot
of happy and good life if you'll get
your education properly and complete
that even if you want to drop out take
that decision really seriously if you
want to drop out for acting go for that
YouTube is not a platform for acting
singing it's a platform where you learn
something and then come back and show
off your skills my views on dropping out
for YouTube is certainly not at all good
I would not recommend that I know you're
struggling hard you're struggling in
making money you are struggling in
making an impact and if you're watching
this video just sitting in a your
comfortable bed that is not gonna help
you if you really want to make an impact
you want to really get rid of all those
money issues you have to work harder in
getting the skills first you can stay in
your bed enjoy a lovely nice awesome
night or you can just do a little bit
for making your life better get out of
your bed right now and start working for
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
