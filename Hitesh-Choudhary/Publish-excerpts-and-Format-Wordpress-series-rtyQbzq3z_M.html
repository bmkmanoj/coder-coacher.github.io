the WordPress series now before we go
ahead and move on into this video in
this video we are gonna be talking about
moreover this published panel as well as
one more panel which is excerpt now
before we move ahead and proceed to talk
about them let me just remind you that
this might a lot of things in this
series might sound a little bit
repetitive and might look like all of
this thing is going on same but it is
not everything has its important role
and depends on where you are working or
why you're using the WordPress is highly
dependent on whether you'll be using
that feature or not if you are a Content
writer who writes a lot of content this
series is very very crucial for you but
in case you are setting up for these
things for like a regular other third
party to be used on this may not sound
like super useful but again this series
is for everyone including the authors
the writers blog post creators
freelancers as well as for the people
who wants to set up everything should be
clear up to you okay so let's get
started and talk about first of all this
publish panel so we have created just
one post here and this is all what we
have now obviously the first button that
you see onto the publish panel is save
as draft now the most important buttons
that you'll be touching are these three
guys save drafts preview and publish
obviously save draft is to save draft
and publish and preview is to just to
preview that how the things are looking
like it as a moment of now as soon as
you'll hit the publish button that means
your post is gone out it is saved in the
database now the next button
automatically that transforms in place
of this publish is update so as soon as
I hit this publish button notice that
now it changed to update it is not at
all published now because this is now
life for everybody
okay now apart from this there is a very
key essential thing which a lot of
people just ignore this and this is
known as revisions now let me go back
onto the revision just click on the
Browse and even notice that this takes
you on to some kind of a timeline that
how your post was being created now it
depends on how you really want to see it
it's really helpful as well as some
people just don't see it that helpful
let me show you how it works now first
of all you can drag this timeline just
onto the back and this is how you are
post actually started to look like then
five days ago on 31st October it was
looking just like this and then it used
to look like this now depends on maybe
you want to go into one place back and
your entire thinks was perfect there and
you just don't want the new updates to
be there you can always go into this
timeline and can restore the previous
version here and this is how now it
looks like so it's really handy tool
honestly I haven't used it much but yes
just to make sure you know that yes it
is there okay so this is important now
next is status now this is usually
useful when there are a lot of people in
your team let's just say you are a
famous blog article or company these
things doesn't get actually published
directly all the authors are being
instructed to just look for the pending
review because the final editor is gonna
edit or just check out your blog and
then it's gonna go on to live public so
depends on that if this might be useful
for you or not now the next panel is
visibility it has a lot of options but
usually don't people don't use it just
one important stuff is there which is
sticky post that means no matter how
many posts are being written apart from
that this will be at the top of your
page now it is highly dependent on the
theme as well I haven't seen anybody
using these password-protected but this
is just for the internal may be used as
your just like that I haven't seen
anybody to use like that okay so these
are the important interesting ones the
my favorite one is the revision I have
seen a lot of my content creator friends
when I told them yes this is their they
were really happy to use it and they use
it all the way lon now another important
thing is published and you can edit that
so allegis say you have a lot of blog
posts being lined up to be released on
every single day you can just write them
and can kind of design it to be
scheduled post you can obviously do that
you have got your date time everything
is there so this is important so this is
well say a quick look onto the publish
panel now let's go on to the screen
options and make sure you enable this
excerpt now a lot of people don't use
excerpts simply because
your team might not be very friendly
with excerpt but as soon as you go onto
the bottom you can see that now we have
an excel talk ssin now let me tell you
one interesting fact about the excerpts
and by Ivan I'll be teaching you this
you will always be using the excerpts
okay now excerpts are being meant to
actually show you the quick look and
feel of that like let me show you this
is kind of fat this is a quick look okay
and I'm gonna just save this let's just
update this okay and now let's just go
on to view post okay not the view post
actually this guy let's just see preview
changes let's go there okay so okay due
to some reasons it's not editing okay I
think so now it sits there and let's
just go on to the visit website so we
can see that this is our post being
there now let me show you what is the
use of actually this excerpt so notice
this is actually a post about the 10
qualities of perfect programmer so I'm
gonna search for perfect perfect oops
come on perfect and I'm gonna hit a
search now notice this is this is a
quick look now this is exactly the use
of exert whether your theme supports or
not some time themes just pick up like
few words from your blogs at the top of
your blog and just displays it but when
somebody is gonna be searching for your
article then this excerpt actually
becomes useful so this is the reason why
I always recommend all the content
writer to use the excerpts now this is
not the only thing there are a couple of
things couple of places where these
excerpts are usage
number one thing is social media sharing
now whenever you share your blog post or
your article on to a social media
website like Facebook or Twitter maybe
on other some places as well maybe
LinkedIn then these excerpts are the
things which actually get carried on
onto a social post article and are being
shown automatically so if you want the
user to read something like interesting
on those social media sheer make sure
you use the excerpts without this they
will just pick up randomly
anything from a article and that might
not be interesting so this is really
really a key essential thing and I
highly recommend everybody to just use
this okay so let me just go into the
blog post all posts and we can go in
here so make sure you always turn on if
you are a Content writer this is super
important that you turn on the excerpt
and once the excerpt is there make sure
you write that now depends on what kind
of plugin for the su you have used this
might be added up already but in case
you don't want to use that make sure you
use the excerpt write some interesting
couple of lines here because that will
be shared on social media as well as
somebody will be searching up this will
be useful okay so this was a quick words
about how these publish panel and these
excerpts can be used I will take one
more moment to discuss a little bit
about this format which have actually
closed okay now I usually don't talk
about it I just leave it like that but I
really feel here that I should talk a
little bit about it now in the format's
this is actually a closed project by
WordPress it was meant to be a separate
project that WordPress team wanted to
integrate into the WordPress so that
articles who are using like totally
images or video based article or maybe
audio based article can be figured out
as a separate from the main articles but
eventually the team realized that this
is not a good project and it is not
going into the right direction and
that's why it has been closed now all of
your post and all of your themes that
you are using right now just to use the
standard here and apart from that they
don't touch it in some of the older
themes you may find some of the usage
for maybe asides or maybe code but
really the theme the team behind the
WordPress thought that this is not going
into the right direction that's why you
just see a one panel here and that's it
it's not being actively developed now
and there is no plan up for the
WordPress guys they haven't mentioned in
the in their blogs and everything that
they won't be working on it so this is
really important okay so three things
you have learned a lot about the publish
panel a lot about the excerpts as well
as some key important points about the
format so that's it for this video and
let's catch up in a next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
