with another video in this video I want
to answer five important questions
regarding Python now when you're getting
started as a beginner in Python these
are the five five most common question
that usually people get in their mind
while getting started Python as their
first programming language so let's
answer all of them
now before we get started with this
video I would like to mention one
important point here that I will not be
mentioning the pros and cons of Python
here I am expecting that you have
already set up your mind that hey python
is going to be my language of choice and
I'm going to just get started with this
this video is not about telling you that
python is based or is it suitable for
that particular stuff or that particular
stuff it's not about that it's just
about answering these important question
and rather just getting around with a
Q&amp;amp;A so let's get started here
the very first question that is being
asked to me is what's your favorite IDE
or editor for fightin now Python is a
very versatile language and it can work
on this variety of editors as well as
IDE now editor is something which is
less featured in IDE something which is
much more featured and comes up with a
lot of things now Python being a great
programming language you can directly
get started with the Python either in
sublime text or atom gifts that's
completely possible and in fact I do
write a lot of my codes in that editor
as well now in case you want something
more bigger and much more advanced than
just these plain editors like sublime
text or atom you can try out either
eclipse or pie chomp now in the past I
used to be a big fan of Eclipse and I
used to have installed these pi Dave
updates and dependencies and it could
have been working with that it it really
works like a charm
but nowadays PyCharm is there and I use
PI charm for all of my Python project if
I do so I am not much involved in Python
projects nowadays but still I'm a big
fan of Pi charm and a high I highly
recommend to check that out at least
once before you get started with that
the next question is interesting when it
says should we have knowledge on Python
previous version that's a very classic
question and it's okay to have this
question because a lot of people have
this question now because there's a lot
of confusion between Python to point X
and three point X it's pretty common to
see around and people just think and
assume that before learning Python 3
point X or whatever that is running up
right now we should have a knowledge of
pipe into point X something now I want
to take you a little bit onto the
history lesson here before we answer
this question now in the early days the
Python 2 was just only the language and
it was just one language that was going
on around there was not two languages as
of now which is Buyten two and three and
in case you didn't know that yes they
are two different languages
almost same name but a lot of drastic
differences are there so in the early
days it was just Python 2 and everybody
was quite happy there were tons of
libraries and everything we're going on
in Python 2 but
then the founder of the fight and
realized that it's not truly an
object-oriented language so I need to
remodel is language and have to start
from the ground scratch and therefore he
decided that I will leave the path of
going on with the Python - I'll start
with the Python 3 which is going to be
rewritten entirely from the scratch now
although it was written almost from the
scratch but it is not a drastic
difference from python 2 to python 3
yes there are some subtle changes and
Python 3 is far more object oriented and
truly an object-oriented language
compared to Python 2 so these are
completely different and I would
recommend right now you can directly get
started with Python 3 you should not
have a knowledge of PI's in - although
if you do have it won't certainly hurt
you
but right now there is no such need of
going into Python 2 you can directly get
started with Python 3 it used to be a
time when most of the libraries and
modules were not being available on
Python 3 so you have to go with the
Python 2 but now it's completely stable
and completely dependable you can
directly get started with Python 3 on a
whole story short notice here get
started with Python 3 don't worry about
anything
the next question is again a classic one
it is interesting as well it says what
is supporting language that we should
know before learning Python now this is
a common question and it floats around
quite a lot to learn Python you don't
need any prior programming experience
Python is in itself a standalone
language and it is not at all a
dependent language in fact no language
is dependent on any other as well for
example if you want to learn Java you
can directly learn Java there is no
requirement to learn C or C++ prior to
that similarly Python is a standalone
language you can directly learn that
language in fact many of the
universities in the southern part of
India as well as a lot of universities
abroad in the state are teaching Python
directly to their first semester
students so it's a great programming
language and you can directly get
started with that no prior programming
experience is required the next one is
more even interesting than this it says
once after learning Python would that be
sufficient to get a job in companies or
do we need to learn any other supporting
language
now it's a little bit harsh reality and
truth but no you won't get a job just by
learning Python yes there are hundreds
of jobs in Python thousands and millions
of jobs in Python that you can grab but
just learning with the syntax of a
language it won't be enough
now I'm not saying you have to learn
other supportive languages for that no
it's not required but what I'm trying to
say here is do a lot of projects
projects may be dependent on machine
learning made it may be scrapping of the
web maybe Django based project maybe
just scripting automation of some tasks
whatever that project might be you need
to get your hands dirty with some of the
project just learning the syntax of the
loop work how the function works things
are not going to be good for you so
focus quite a lot on the project now
this question has been thrown to me
quite a number of time hey so just a
project we want to do some project now
here's the point nobody is going to give
you or suggest you any projects just
like that you have to think up on your
own that what can we do with that maybe
you want to design an algorithm or a
simple script that can scrap emails from
a webpage or something like that so go
ahead think out yourself you have to
take this hard step I know at first it's
not easier easier to think around that
what we should be building up we have no
idea completely blank like that but as a
programmer you need to be a little
creative and have to think about what
kind of project you can do and you have
to do them project nobody is going to
come up to you saying that hey this is a
demo project you can do no that doesn't
happen at least not in the usual case
I'm not talking about the boot camps
where we come up with some kind of a
funny experiment with projects and we do
those projects along with you but in the
usual real case when you are learning on
your own it's something that you have to
manage up on your own and finally the
most interesting question is the
spiteful programmer has career in future
let's just say for at least seven to ten
years now I can understand your fear off
you just want to stuck around with one
language and want to just be completely
reliable on that unfortunately it's IT
industry it's a technological world it
is being changed every few months and
you cannot be dependent on one language
rather you can focus on learning the
syntax of
programming language or the loop work
how the function work how the classes
work and that should be your main goal
Python is just a tool which is really a
good tool to solve your word
if you think that for seven years or ten
years you can just rely on one
technology perhaps perhaps you might be
lucky enough to get around with just one
tech but again if you want to move on if
you want to grow with more salaries and
more stuff you have to have a lot of
programming language and a lot of skills
in your back again for seven years or
ten years it's a big time perhaps
perhaps the technology might stay around
for that much long but I would say that
this is this is not something that I can
answer I'm not good enough to answer
that because I cannot see the future
there I'm not sure whether I'll be
staying in India or Paris or London
where I'll be staying in the next seven
years I'm not sure for that so perhaps
I'm not a good person to answer what
will happen in the next seven years
perhaps somebody else but it means
nothing so very interesting email I
enjoyed quite a lot answering these
questions as they have been asked quite
a lot in number of other emails as well
I have enjoyed it thoroughly I hope you
