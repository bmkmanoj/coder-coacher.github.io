welcome back to the JavaScript course so
now that basics are all clear that why
we're learning JavaScript where we can
implement that on all of that thing
let's come to my favorite section where
we can actually start writing some code
and before that obviously we need some
tools to make sure that our environment
is properly set up now I'm gonna give
you a few options here some of them are
compulsory to have some of them are
optional and I'll be walking you through
as we go through with them now the first
option is no GIS so let me walk you
through there one by one so the first
option is no js' and you should have no
GS installed if you're gonna be walking
along with me in this entire series now
although I would recommend now there is
a kind of discipline see here I would
recommend all of you to have the LTS
version now LTS stands for long-term
support now if you're working on any
other project like react or maybe
angular you might need a new version for
it and you might want to get a refresher
of JavaScript through this course so for
those all people I would recommend this
LTS version that is long-term support
now you can also have the latest feature
support but latest features sometimes
can a little bit like break down
sometimes not for our course it's not
gonna break up at all at any point of
time but there can be chances that
you're working on some other projects
and going with that so that can break
out a few things so in case you're just
working on this series at all and you're
not using anything like react or angular
or electron anything at all then you can
also go for this current version as well
now it happened to be that I am working
on some other projects as well and for
that I require this current version here
so my system is installed with this
current version but again for all of you
I would recommend you to go through with
this now this is available for all the
platforms and of course note is really
popular you have the source code version
you have Windows installer you has Mac
installer so everything is covered up
and we have additional libraries for
others in case you're interested in that
as well
now it's a pretty simple install for
Windows and for Mac guys it's just next
next I agree I do we always do that all
of the stuff now once you have done that
open up your terminal or command prompt
and
just type this let me assume that that
is node - V and notice there is a node
space then - V and once you run that you
will be getting some number now
regardless what number you get make sure
you get a number and that's the
installation done now with this you'll
also be having an NPM and that is also
when you apply a space - V it should
return you some number now we are not
gonna be talking about what is node or
we will not be extensively using node
for our discourse because node is
completely a separate thing but in order
to run some of our JavaScript file we
may need it so I highly recommend to
have it here now as long as you are
getting any number here that's totally
fine for this entire series we are not
dependent on any kind of particular
version of node it just needs to be
there okay so this is our first
dependency that we need to have and I
always recommend that you should have it
now the next version or the next
dependency is the code editor now the
code editor choice depends on highly how
much you are into web development people
do have strong choices for that and I
totally respect that whatever the choice
you are having I'll just give it a go
maybe you are a big fan of sublime text
that can also work absolutely fine for
this course no problem at all you can
also work on atom that is also great
editor and you can also work on Visual
Studio code all of them are
cross-platform available for all Mac and
Windows so you can go ahead and pick
them whatever you like if you already
have a preference or anything others as
well that's also totally fine what I'll
be using for this entire series is gonna
be Visual Studio code now I was a big
fan of sublime text I still have I still
have sublime text all the time in my
system but I thought let's give it a try
to some others editor as well because
until unless you're gonna be trying
anything else how you can say that it's
bad or its worst or it may be good so I
tried sublime tech for long long years
then I moved into Adam for recent couple
of years and then um for this series I'm
gonna give it a try for Visual Studio
code ok so that is also a compulsion and
also for the browser I would be using
chrome throughout this if you're a
Firefox fan I would highly recommend
that at least for this series go ahead
and get started for chrome at least
that's what I'll be using here now there
is also an option
set up that you can use but there are
some things that you should take care of
that now there is one amazing website
known as jsbin a lot of people just like
to work on the go with these videos so
you can also work on that mostly we will
not be using the HTML we will be using
the JavaScript and the console most of
the time but here are a few things that
I would like to mention here now when
you are working on some product or you
are learning something really good I
highly recommended not to learn it on to
some unreliable systems and by the term
unreliable I simply mean that if you
have your own system computer or a
desktop or maybe a laptop whatever that
is you need to have all the tools
installed because the product that you
will be building up needs a very stable
environment and that stable environment
is your computer and not these online
tools yes there are various other mobile
applications as well there where you can
type your JavaScript code it can run all
of that but I I would say that hey
please as much as possible please avoid
that for at least this series because we
are not learning anything which is toy
apps or toy things these are like
full-fledged things that we are gonna be
learning in this course so my
recommendation is use jsbin like for
some understanding of the concept or a
few quick implementation of the code but
not for the full-fledged application
development for the development systems
are always good and that's why everybody
is still on laptop and desktop and
creating these amazing things which are
highly scalable ok
so that's it these are the few things so
go ahead download them and from the next
video onwards we can start writing some
code nodejs is gonna be the thing which
you should have for the editor I'll be
using the vs code and for the browser
I'll be using the chrome you can
optionally use jsbin for some of the
quick testing of the things but most of
the time I would recommend you to write
the code in a text editor so that you
can get a feel at how actually things
are done so these are all the tool
requirements and yes enough of the
theory everything is already done now we
can move on to our visual studio code
and can write some code so let's do that
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
