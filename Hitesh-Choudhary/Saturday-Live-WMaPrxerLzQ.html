minutes I know the Lighting's are not
perfect but yes this is what we are
having right now pretty little bit low
lighting I'll do something about it
I'm not at my studio right now okay so
hey everyone I'll wait for you guys
right now it just doesn't say anybody is
watching you can give it thumbs up
because it says 11 people gave it thumbs
up but three people are watching it I
don't know if about YouTube stats
alright okay now it started to jump up
hey Irwin hey Manu hey Raj nice name
wait Raj I like it okay
hey Vicky hey Amy I'm good yeah
how are you hi akela okay a lot of
people are watching it a really high
number as compared to what I used to do
previously definitely you will get a
better set of as we progress in fact if
I would be in my studio it would be
better lighting and all of this thing
right now I just have a lamp my night
lamp and just from the room so yes let's
just get started here first of all thank
you so much that you guys are along with
me here right now my Jaipur head my home
and doing this life from my home
Internet is decent not very good before
I get started thank you so much for
joining and again I would like to
mention here again that if you guys are
having any determination this year that
you want to go to gym live a healthy
life or to learn programming whatever
that is I am running an experiment where
I will be posting every single day on my
Facebook page that post like day 1 day 2
day 5 day 6 day 30-day 60-day 100 day 2
or 200 just like that so be determined
join me on the Facebook it is not
costing it even a single rupee just be
determined in what you are doing and
follow me up on the Facebook page and
post in my comments section day 1 day 2
that's it you just have to do this
whatever you are doing
just keep it doing
and just go like that okay thank you so
much love from Kerala love back from
internet I would call myself as an
Internet okay not completely Internet
but yes somebody from Internet who you
are okay so yes a lot of questions are
coming up ah where do you live I live in
Jaipur the beautiful city in Jaipur this
is the time of Big Boss I don't watch TV
so I have no idea actually I haven't
watched even a single episode of Bigg
Boss roadies and couple of others things
like that so let's just let's pick up
few questions why do many Java
programmers earn only 30k it's not
actually totally correct I do have some
of my friends who are earning like 50k
and a little bit more than that with
just Java so yes you can add pretty much
large but yes due to everybody is
learning Java there is a huge abundance
of Java programmer that's why companies
to usually find like better programmer
at a lower rate so that's why usually it
happens not much but yes this is what
happens okay which area in Jaipur I
would like to keep my home and is a
little bit privacy social visits are not
allowed at my home I like to keep just
busy in the work and stuff if I would
like to meet you guys it would be like a
public area or something where I can
actually give some time to you because
at my home I am just rushing from
wherever I work I just brush it out and
in so it's a lot of things going on so
yeah you know Vivek says mood off but
happy to watch you you just cheer up
it's just another day it will just pass
on so how do you dinner yes I already
had didn't eat much you know things are
really tough when you are leaving out
their favorite things like chocolate and
pizza and burger it's really hard at the
first I'm doing it I'm gonna be doing it
so you know okay what's our new your
gift I can gift
you something that nobody has given you
so far which is keeping your determined
and on the track so that's what I'm
doing at my Facebook page should I learn
nodejs or Django both are great
Grim Reaper your name is really scary
you can try both they are both amazing
but I would go for never genius a little
bit okay what is basically done in pen
testing and security job and services do
they have to make programs or test the
security level by certain methods
usually it's a reporting thing you just
run out a few tools and then you have to
make a report most of the pen testers
life at a job a real job is being spent
in making the reports and that nobody no
pedestrian likes it but ask any pen
tester who is working at it some job
probably I'll I'll do a some interview
with my friends where they are working
they are working at a fortune 500
companies and most of their time is just
gone in just making reports or whatever
they're finding is so finding is like 20
30 % of the time and the 70% time is
just presentation and report like that
so Java or Cortland please one-word
answer Java Kaplan is there but it's not
right just they're probably in 2018 it
will grab more market right now Java is
actually holding the market but I'm
pretty optimistic about Kotlin it's
really powerful okay okay let's pick up
more questions it would be really good a
learning decoding yet he can post
questions in English because there is a
lot of audience coming up at this
channel some are from mostly are from
like Bangalore ish area so it would be
really good your answer can't be in
English so that I can answer them a lot
of lot more people can get with that
so propecia say is hello 7:00 Happy New
Year same to you it's almost New Year
tomorrow day after tomorrow of course so
make with your data structure probably
sure okay future of JavaScript let me
tell you that it's gonna be rockin the
JavaScript has just started to evil
it's gonna go like insanely crazy in the
future really investing time in
JavaScript is the most valuable thing
that you can do right now so go ahead
and start with JavaScript nothing to be
worried it's really rock solid and it's
rockin everywhere okay how much Android
developer earner depends on how much
experience you are having and how much
apps you have built up in the past maybe
that apps are in the App Store or maybe
on the github or how much apps for the
clients you have made it all depends on
that like initial level programmer can
make like 15,000 or 20,000 something
like that depends on again if it of
course depends on where you're working
but around like 20,000 to 50,000 it's
like an easy area how's the climate
there it's really cold
hi Hershel how are you it's really cold
here sometimes we used to have room
heaters and all of that so it's really
damn cold in Jaipur I was really good at
Bangalore it was really lovely weather
there so let's pick up more question I
started YouTube channel how I can create
a video probably with your phone I don't
recommend using the phone a lot of
youtuber does that you should you can
get started with phone but you know the
quality that you get with the DSLRs is
absolutely unmatched so give yourself a
good night
use a decent DSLR learn about the lenses
bouquets and lighting and all of that
and it would be really better so come to
Bangalore I was in Bangalore I will
probably be visiting the Bangalore again
in the end of January as of now it's
planned so yes this time I'll be back
again in Bangalore okay when is when
Jaipur meet sir if you're in Jaipur you
can join me up in the upcoming
conference I forgot the name of it's
some kind of Conclave conference or
something it's happening in Jaipur I
have posted that on my facebook wall if
you can just join up there that would be
really great so join me up there how do
you use react with express it's easily
integrate able no big deal probably I'll
make a video for that that would be an
interesting thing sir which is more
preferable list view or recycler view
for products
Purple's recyclerview is actually much
more better but again it's not like it's
too much of like things but to be honest
I don't use any of them hi react native
has a better solution for these kinds of
things so I just like to go with that
but in case you want to use just an
Android recycler view would be better
option okay can we meet occupy chances
can we meet at the edge for a discussion
on carrier you can meet me on live here
every Saturday that would be really
great
you usually have not available such for
discussion and all these things I have
other stuff as well I if you found me in
some colleges or conference show me you
can discuss that ok so future of Python
a lot of questions everything has a
future it's not about node JavaScript C
Objective C what all that is everything
as future if you work really hard in it
okay come good ah yes yes good job I
have inserted last year like two or
three times good job probably this year
also okay take my name
Kaushik ready how are you so taken there
okay you'll be some competitive
programming honestly I don't like it
stay like that I believe that if you are
somebody who has experience in
programming and can make like few apps
for the clients that is actually the
competition competition is not about
making things like quickly design an
Android app that helps women in the
society or something like that
whatever that means computer programming
means that if you are successfully able
to just work through with the clients a
list whatever that is that is actually
competitive programming you are
successfully able to do what the client
has said to you in a given time frame
that is actually far more like
challenging so just try to build a lot
of projects and competitive programming
will look like a child's play to you ok
so come to be career sir that's I have a
few good memories with beacon and I was
there like twice in the beacon in
engineering
oh Jesus College I was invited as a
guest to deliver his talk there I went
there twice like three or four maybe a
more years ago I enjoyed their the food
was really awesome
being from Rajasthan I loved that food
it was really spicy and I loved it loved
from chickpeas girl that's a lovely
place I haven't been shut this girl to
like I have couple of friends there I
would love to visit that place I have
never been there okay
how beneficial is learning Linux now
that's an interesting question
learning Linux is like should be on your
number one list if you are from
computers you want to be in computers
anything like that learning Linux is
always going to help you like all the
things that you upload on the website
whether it's a website or Android at the
end of the day if you're not aware about
the basics of Linux like CD changing the
file permission creating a new user you
can be at a nightmare situation so the
first thing that you can do is try and
learn the basics of Linux at least learn
the basics at least don't be afraid of
the terminal and all of that so yes
definitely invest some time in learning
Linux that's the good thing that you can
do okay my name is Bobby will you just
please say my name with your voice hey
Bobby hey Bobby how are you
that's a nice name Bobby like at that
did you remember the Bobby from the
supernatural that was like the favorite
character I used to be really a big fan
of Bobby in the supernatural give it a
thumbs up if you remember like Bobby was
there
do like the video if you remember the
Bobby there that was my favorite
character okay some of the questions I
want to record videos by front camera of
a smartphone that would be challenging
this life is from the front camera this
is challenging I don't like the quality
so please suggest a budget by under
twenty five thousand twenty one thousand
is really a low budget I'm not aware of
if you can really get a good camera or
something in that twenty five thousand
budget I would highly recommend to buy a
Cameron Diaz
or something like that if you can invest
a little bit more recording from front
end see the quality of this live and
check the quality of my other videos
they are like a top-notch quality and
this is like the lowest grade I can make
so invest a little bit more it's all
worth it because YouTube is a platform
where you are known for the quality of
video and audio yes of course content is
that the top and content is the best
thing but again this thing also needs to
be there which is quality of your video
quality of your audio this is why the
people are watching our your videos on
the first place so invest a little bit
in that as well okay I call me my name
Prince hey Prince how are you I think it
says Bob via I cannot spell your last
name hyper via hi Prince see what do
that what is the difference between it
just goes away happy new year hi Kalpana
have been here - you make unboxing
videos of laptop ah I don't buy much
laptops like other laptops guy like
unbox therapy and all of that I just
have my macbook pro might be lying
somewhere here I don't know maybe in the
office so whatever that is I usually
don't make unboxing videos I didn't made
unboxing videos for my phones as well
I'm not good in that okay hey hello it
is I got to learn a lot from you you had
an Sperry you are an inspiration for me
keep motivating us thank you so much
this is your love that keeps me going
and pushed me to work harder I promise
you I'll be working more harder because
this love is coming up this is like this
is like a blessing to me nothing has
been more good to me as the love that is
coming up and this is the reason why I'm
being so consistent and I'm trying to
push you towards your goals whatever
that is I never say that hey just buy
from my courses only and learn from them
wherever you are learning just keep on
going with that this is what the country
and entire world needs more sensible
people who can have judgmental things
can think here with the logic you would
not believe it but there is a shortage
of people who can think logic
really yes that is the truth that I'm
trying to make a difference here okay
let's move future of Android development
awesome awesome awesome in fact we are
releasing another version of the Android
app for the rent code online for a
different perspective you'll get to know
about that but yes Android is amazing
my daily driver is Android right now hi
ketta advance happy new year hey Shiva
ROM happy near to you as well gonna be
lots of knowledge informative videos
with the year 2017 was amazing with you
with your YouTube journey thank you so
much 2018 would be much more amazing you
might have already seen the start it is
going to be much more amazing future in
react.js what should I learn first
reaction yes or angularjs you can choose
any one of them you don't need to learn
both of them I would say react is much
more easier to learn as compared to
angular simply because you don't have to
learn the typescript first of all that's
reason number one and react is a small
library you just have to know about like
props States a component lifecycle so
it's much more easier to learn with the
react further you can move into react
native and through which you can design
native ios and android app using
javascript so i think this answers your
question our karate thank you so much Oh
sir I am 15 can I start learning
programming right now yes you can do
that right now start right now start
today how we start learning a I focus on
maths that's the one thing you can do
then start with Python that would be a
pretty good start okay best IDE for C
programming okay if you're on the Mac I
would say Xcode is hands off the best ID
for writing code on Mac code block is
good decent enough there is no such good
ID for Windows but code block is good
okay
it's turbo C++ good it's like if I have
to scale it from zero to ten I would
rate turbo like minus one this days are
gone
if it is like this is terrible see and
this is what going on and world is
saying to you hey where are you going on
come on this side so this is what
happening okay okay what should be on
RedHat certification now I have like
good views for Red Hat certification I
myself did like three or four
certification in red hat when I was
doing my engineering it was all pretty
good now the main thing about the red
hat certification is if you are doing
that honestly it's like amazing and if
somebody has given you dump the question
that these are the questions that are
going to be in the exam and you just
have to pass it on that's really the
saddest thing that you can do dishonesty
is really bad so I have good views on
red hat honestly if I will tell you
about that it's really good
certification if you can do it's
expensive of course it costs a lot so if
you can't afford it really it's worth
doing okay please give me straight
answer okay that was rude
should I learn Django or low GS with
express yes if I want to build a bug web
application I know a little but of both
I just don't know how to go forward I
think go with node.js it would be much
more easier for you because you're just
building a bug web application and not
nothing much so no GS would be good
Jango is good when there is a lot of
admin work you have to do n it should be
a quick prototype yes both of course are
good but in one word if you'll ask me no
js' okay how about literature kind of
inter I have a big fan of that I used to
eat quite a lot because I in my college
days I used to have a lot of friends
from that side of country I have eaten a
lot of letici oka it was amazing dish
you should definitely try it if you
haven't
is there a job for hackers of course
there's a job even for like mainframe
developers as well so there is a job for
everybody
the thing is how expert you Adam dad how
much time you have spent in that's of
course and for hackers his job lying
around every single place but the point
is are you just a hacker or you you do
know actually something about
programming like just writing an XSS
script alert XSS and popping up error
it's of no use until unless you know
what can happen at the background and
how these things can be stopped
you know a little bit more about the
code its life is much more easier for
that okay so I think that gives you
answer and he planned to come California
I think in 2018 there is no plan for
California as of now but opportunities
always do open up like I am in between a
talk with one of the Washington
Washington DC universities for some of
the lectures there if I will come I'll
definitely let you know because usually
I don't announce my trip that much
because I just want to just complete
that quickly recently I had a trip at
Dubai I didn't told much about on the
Facebook I will try to post that but yes
of course as of now there is no such
plan of California okay oh so let's pick
up more questions okay how to use Swift
in Windows there's no much sense of
using Swift in Windows you won't be able
to do much apart from designing a few
parts that's not valuable that's not
worth enough spending time so obviously
go ahead get yourself a Mac and then go
on Swift if you are interested in that
kind of thing Haley Agatha mr. miacca
hello from Pakistan how are you things
I'm good I hope you are doing pretty
good too hey guys you forgot to hit the
like button can I see the like button
going on up so that I can stay here
otherwise I can just end this up I think
so go ahead give it a thumbs up so that
I can keep seeing that yes you are still
up with me and want me to just keep
talking and you talk a lot on camera so
yes thank you so much keep giving it up
thumbs up I can see like 300 or 350
people are watching it but still just
200
like go ahead give thumbs up completed
your Java course it's awesome thank you
so much already I came from Chandigarh
to Jaipur please check Gmail I would
check that there are a lot of unread
emails in my inbox right now I'll check
that okay
javascript is better to learn of course
it's it's awesome okay let's pick up
more questions how to earn extra money
in college freelancing vertic McDonald's
work at computer shops options are there
okay is it good to start a career as a
PHP developer on an Android developer in
Bangalore you are at a hub you are at a
Silicon Valley you are in Bangalore even
if you learn like HTML there is
opportunities of there as well there
okay he is dangerous why did Judas do
you think really someday Arnold is gonna
come up and say I'll be back people so
much afraid of the a I have no idea how
to find AP is for Android just like you
find API for any other things API is are
just API as they are available for
everything Android web iOS API is our
API is difference between front-end and
back-end okay that that needs a separate
video in itself to do me some animations
and you know paper animation that I do
it's it's really not something I should
discuss here sir Marvel or DC okay
Manish let's pick up this war Marvel vs.
DC if you'll ask me about the comics I
would prefer DC Comics and people who
know who have read the comics in their
past know that DC actually has more
better storyline in the comics but in
the movie world DC is somehow not
performing really up to the mark only
the Batman Christopher Nolan did that
really the justice with the Batman they
haven't done the justice with any other
character on the other hand if you ask
me for the movie fan I'm a big fan of
Marvel but again the characters in the
DC are super powerful and super awesome
you have seen the Batman it
awesome everybody liked it but they
didn't did the justice same justice to
Superman and all other characters see
the Aquaman it's so powerful that they
could have done that Superman
amazing character could have explored
that Krypton out life and all of that
really come on they are doing so bad
okay in the initial days how many hours
you used to program a day okay let me
think about it it's while ago in the
college probably at least like two or
three hours a day I used to spend on
computers and that used to be night
around like 11 o'clock 11 to like 1 or 2
always always in my college I was the
sleepiest guy I even slept in some of
the lectures and Wow
are usually being thrown out of my
classes in the college I do remember it
so yes I used to do that hey I am from
Bangladesh I love your videos I always
follow your videos best wishes hey thank
you so much story Kolko butchered your
name in the wait mastermind say
something really funny are you
Illuminati
you have tattoo on your right hand
haven't you seen my tattoo can you see
that I have a tattoo here on my right
hand so what do you think about that
am i Illuminati I lived it as a judgment
for you to do go ahead do that
Illuminati
come on that was really funny
let's pick up how are you a solder tech
nice name everybody is tech nowadays
soccer tech I'm good socket how are you
Steve
mark inspiration are you veer shades of
grey yes there is a long story behind it
and it really helped me to do a lot of
things that you're seeing I graze it's
not like about grey I could have picked
up any other color itch it was all about
sticking to one color I'll probably make
a video on why I hear all these these
t-shirts I love them by the way probably
I'll make that okay
so do you like Chester some idea about
that
check Gmail now if they sure I cannot do
that now I'm on to this live I cannot
check that night now
okay languages needed in iOS and Android
apart from Java and Swift okay let me
put it that way
I don't think so you'll need anything
else these are more than enough I think
that's it if you know a little bit about
more about Jason that would be helpful
if you know a little bit more about like
MongoDB or rapid io or maybe firebase IO
that would be really helpful because I
usually talk about firebase but there
are other services which are a little
bit more like in the production being
used you can learn more about that
specially MongoDB I would highly
recommend if you are into iOS or Android
development MongoDB is something that
you should learn it's industry standard
nowadays so yes it's good Herschel say
is Swift on Swift on Android or Cortland
on iOS okay I think you reverse it there
what do you think will be the first and
best Swift on Android or cuddling on iOS
okay that's that's like tricky why would
Swift be on Android so it is on like iOS
and Kotlin is on Android so okay you
have to live in naughty is really
bothered about that we want Cole Bhushan
back who is that okay
there is 21st night plan
I don't celebrate much of the teddy
first I like to spend time with my
friends and family that's that's like
the best thing I can do I don't like
like partying at a desk and all of that
I'm not that kind of a guy I am moreover
like it travel travel kind of a thing
peaceful I would like my 21st to spend
with my friends and a family and with
you guys on YouTube writing some code
that's that's kind of what I do are you
single is that an offer
how to earn million dollars as soon as I
earned that I'll let you know
probably why don't you reply to my mail
I'm really sorry that I missed your
email Facebook is actually the faster
way to reach me out I will try to mail
you like right now 160 mails are unread
I also brought t-shirt like yours good
that's awesome
Salesforce vs. EWS AWS AWS AWS any given
day ok hello sir you're awesome and my
inspiration thank you so much nice chill
really appreciate that releases that
come to Nepal if I will be coming to
Nepal I'll surely let you know on my
Facebook page that is one thing one
place that I really want to visit but
I'm waiting forward to buy a couple of
good lenses so that I can shoot really
good photos then I'll try got there ok
any book on IOT security ah yes yes
there is really a nice book by the
founder of edify I hope you know him he
has written really a good book from
packed publication it's really good I'll
probably post a link on my Facebook page
if you can search for edify he's really
a good author he has written really good
book there Illuminati you're struggling
period or topic while programming
struggled quite a lot why don't you pick
my question I cannot see your question
it's just a complain how to create a
secured website security is a method a
constant process my dear friend we just
try to make it as much secure as
possible nothing is like foolproof okay
sir please tell me about w3c I'll
probably make a video is iOS app
development a good career in 2018 of
course everything is moving on app in
fact you know before we launch the app
of learn code online it was not that
much of the traffic and eventually most
of our traffic is actually coming up
from the app and
that is a good thing because our server
doesn't have to get that much busy so
yes everything is going on app and how
us is always rock-solid and walking okay
you forgot to give thumbs up buddies go
ahead and give it a thumbs up
react or view react is also equally good
but yes react views on okay I don't give
views on other youtubers I keep a strong
opinion about not giving opinion on any
other youtuber so please don't ask that
it's really not good okay somebody says
Modiji rocks hey come on let's keep it a
like programming thing let's not make it
a political one okay please make video
on react native heard it you are gonna
get it very soon okay have you invested
in Bitcoin okay that's tricky yes a
little bit naughty
not now it was way back when it used to
be really cheap like $2 for a Bitcoin so
yes
why are Android apps done with Andrus to
the latest version not running I don't
know what that is it's not
understandable okay Edward Snowden okay
do you know that one of my friends saga
did attended a talk of Edward Snowden
recently I think he's in Switzerland he
I didn't talk of Edward Snowden I would
really like to attend his talk someday
definitely would like to are you coming
in Delhi in 2008 18 of course Delhi's
like all the ways I have to catch my
flight from Delhi so I'm reading like
regular there so let's pick up more
questions okay it's just going like that
okay I want to become a security expert
and love programming which one I should
I prefer first I would say go for
programming first and then eventually
security things will become much more
easier to understand because once you
know how the system login system and
everything
is working how the query is being passed
on it's easy to understand the attack
perspective so yes it's much more easier
C or Java - start directly with Java
Python yes of course it's awesome ok
about data science I will make probably
some videos on the data science about
like Bayes theorem and all of that it's
pretty much like OK to me not very tough
this like that ok hey do you know do you
know Goggin Chaudhary he's also from
Jaipur and he makes videos on automobile
no sorry I don't know him
just because myself my surname is
actually damn common every third guy I
probably think that in every state my
surname is common every like few guys
you'll see this surname is common I'm so
so common surname so I don't know every
other Chaudhary well it's so so common
surname ok reactor angular which is easy
react damn easy machine learning machine
learning you have absolutely no idea how
tough machine learning is everybody is
just going after it but it includes a
lot of things about mathematics and
algorithms like that sukh Singh you've
got a nice profile pic like it sucks
thing he asked Kali or parrot OS I
haven't give it a shot - parrot OS the
guys at parrot OS actually approached me
a while ago that hey you want to try our
OS and want to say a few words on
YouTube about it I haven't got much
chance to review it I'll do that
is it appreciable to develop an app
using thinkable not in the development
environment you won't be getting any job
if you'll say hey I can make a have
synth on cable nobody's going to give
you a job because you don't know the
core concept how the things are being
applied so if you don't know yet these
kinds of things are getting banned from
the stores recently Apple did band of
these apps being made up by these app
makers Apple have banned it in case you
haven't read that I think Google can do
that ok so man course on
selenium coming up not very soon
honestly sir come to my soo
I would love to spell my name okay
there is something mr. Roy I cannot
spell I am NOT good in reading the name
in fact in Java in India Java or iOS
India Java everybody's damn crazy about
it but if you want to get good package
good payment because you know a lot of
people learn Java only a handful people
of learn iOS so more people less people
more jobs but less paying jobs are there
but you know only this much of people
are applying so do the map okay
let's speak about questions okay
somebody has given this like a super
chat as well thank you so much guys I
can see that super chat is going on some
people are doing it thank you so much
I do really appreciate that okay gate or
MBA I will make a video on the questions
that I will never answer and this gate
or MBA is one of them so let's pick up
more questions your favorite musicians a
lot of them are there a lot of them you
probably don't know them because their
music is not so much popular a lot of
such music you see at my channel in the
intro videos so these are the some guys
which I do that somebody is asking what
is super chat can't you see the special
super chat because when somebody just
pays you money like ten rupees or twenty
two peas or something like that
it's not about how much amount they are
paying it's like a good gesture they are
providing so that is super chat okay any
good alternative for sketch software for
Windows are unfortunately I even talked
to the sketch guys that hey are you
having any plans to roll out on Windows
and they say no no plans at all I love
sketch and there is no alternative on
Windows in fact there is no alternative
of sketch the way this software is
evolving and
especially with the plugins that are
coming up it's insane it's crazy to
believe and if you'll use like sketch
with envision there is no match for it I
hope you know what the envision is okay
oh so let's pick up more questions okay
we have been doing this live for almost
38 minutes so give it a thumbs up that I
have been with you guys for 38 minutes
it's really good
okay your recently watched movie okay
probably it would be like lost Avengers
movie I think I watched that and I don't
watch much of the movie I don't remember
it actually I think Newton I watched
Newton in the hall so I think Newton was
my last movie sir okay let's move on to
more questions okay
digital marketing yeah it's good how
could he is good always you watch
Silicon Valley no I don't get that much
time to watch series is now I would love
to watch it but I don't have time so I
would watch it someday what is darker I
should make a video on darker that's
actually a very good topic I should
really make a video and what is darker
okay it's not a new thing everybody uses
doc not everybody but yes a lot of
people here is darker which Mac is best
to buy I would say a MacBook Pro is
really worth investing every single
piece of money which tools you used to
create online boot camps I'm not sure I
can share you with that all these
details there are a lot of details in
that online boot camps big marker
GoToWebinar lot of details are there
okay I'm not sure that I can share it
with you I have to think about it okay
never-ending message flow yeah it's kind
of like going really fast sometime I'm
not able to make it up maybe or tvf
boats I love their content in fact the
irony of our country is that AIB comic
videos are making
much more sense than our society's
politicians are making up I watched
their recent video son like it was like
society and rent and bachelors something
like that awesome script
I think AIB is rocking DVF is little
slow nowadays okay oh what is blockchain
a blockchain technology everybody is
working about blockchain cryptography
bitcoins all of that it's just going
pretty quick okay so you guys can give
it a thumbs up and I can stay for more
like almost an hour okay there's a quick
question hey how to get good in
designing you eyes let me tell you trick
here Raja mole I'm sorry about the name
but let me tell you a trick about
designing the UI go ahead get an account
on Pinterest I hope you heard about the
social media website where you can pin
the things Pinterest has got some
amazing UI design just see those design
and try to replicate them using sketch
or Photoshop or whatever software you
use just try to replicate them they have
like in the Pinterest they have the best
UI as possible and just try to replicate
them once you will replicate like 10 or
15 you eyes from Pinterest you'll get a
lot of idea detail about color selection
the gradient selection the new invention
of the designs and all of these things
that would be really super helpful and
step number one so go ahead try that out
it's really an amazing trick Pinterest
search for mobile UI okay I hope you got
that okay
so watch it what is Jack's Ajax you mean
or Jack's if it is there something
Jack's are not aware of it Ajax is there
but Jack's are not aware of it okay
hello hi - hello vinayak how are you
okay will you be wearing great t-shirt
even in 2018 as of now this is the plan
I had to stick with it in 2018 as well
let's see how it goes never be sure of
these things but yeah I like it so I'll
probably stick with it how do we like
you you had already better than me
always with a few days of hard work and
all these things you can be even better
than me so I think you're already good
better than me so don't need to be like
me okay life is back hi mr. Vargas how
are you it's been long
yes lives are back and they are now
fixed on time they are always on
Saturday night around 10-ish sometimes
I'm late like 1 or 2 minutes or many
more it will be between 10 and 11 okay
alternate language for Java developer
Kotlin haven't heard about it did you
watched baahubali - or not yes of course
I have mastered even you know what I do
have certain plans to watch a robot
robot - is coming up virus Nagant
and I do have certain plans to see that
movie in in Chennai I want to see how
the Rajinikanth festival is being
celebrated just the day before the movie
so I'll just fly from Jaipur to Chennai
just to see that because I think this
can be like the last movie of Rajnikant
I cannot miss that so I'll probably fly
to Chennai to just see that festival
I'll call some of you guys so that you
can see me just help me around I will
probably go there
what is dojo dojo is like what should I
call it was just like an expert in
anything there are a lot of dojos like
web security dojo coding dojos it's like
being expert in something or like it's
it's really hard to explain
do you sleep bro little bit later with I
compromise in my sleep a lot and yes I
tried to not do that in 2018 but I'm not
sure because whenever I am lying in the
bed I think that I'm missing something
then anxiety in me doesn't allow me to
sleep I'm probably watching a few videos
then I try to get back
buta and just things I could have done
that like that that would be better so I
do really miss a sleeping part sir are
you sleeping now a little bit little bit
do you meditate no not at all I just
make I code that is meditation for me
come to Hyderabad I was in Hyderabad the
life that you saw from my when I was on
vacation the life that you saw on my
channel was from Hyderabad Airport to
see the followings of Prabhas and saw a
movie release I'm not sure collab with
Saurabh Shukla one thing that I didn't
did in 2017 was any collab I think I can
do that this year
I'll try that okay so a lot of going on
like that it's going really do you like
Prabhas I'm not sure I do remember who
is promised like hero which one of them
is promise I probably have watched a few
videos movies of him do you go to gym
yes of course not ready that regularly
but showing me is regular not in the
winters of course but yes I I spent a
little time in gym and in swimming as
well good night sir I'm going sleeping
okay good night jack Beach bye bye we're
gonna stay like for an hour I like it I
love it here
you guys are so interesting you're
asking good questions so I'm just
staying here okay
I'm not confused developers are voting
Swift on Android or Kotlin on iOS what
do you think will be the first and best
use yes I have heard that some people
are porting codes of Android but I don't
think it's much feasible and it's a good
option a better option would be react
yes or react native it is too much of
the work even to import objective-c code
in Swift because there you have to make
a bridge and then it doesn't work like
that
so yes it's it's really a tricky process
I have read a couple of blogs on medium
people asking about importing and the
Catalan code on
and all of that it was like gibberish
didn't liked it so okay so let's pick up
more question is a WT and swing is
enough to make project in Java why you
want to go in a WT like go with the
JavaFX that's like the new thing you
should be working on that okay somebody
is saying can you say in I don't know
what that is Pro I don't know I should
be saying it publicly or not because
sometimes people are tricky are you
married
I don't know but that's an invitation or
not but no okay so there are some
interesting question going on collab
with sort of Shukla if I'll get an
option to collab I'll surely try haven't
got much so far
what is your nigger resolution I have
made a video on the near resolution on
my youtube channel you should try go
ahead and watch that okay so there is
like chats coming up there's like emails
dropping down there's like live chat
going on so too much of the things are
going on go ahead give this video a like
time required to become Android
developer at least like three or four
month minimum that's duration that you
can like decent then obviously you
should spend a year in just Android
development to become really good in
that okay a lot of questions are coming
up and it's just like keep on going so
link your another card I really I had to
cancel my trip because of that other
card
sorry about that but yes there was
something going on wrong with my other
card and I couldn't filed my taxes you
know I have to file up the taxes like
every month due to this GST thing and I
have to get this fingerprinting and all
that I really hate that oh okay let's
pick up more question can you say poppy

had your breakfast it's night here hurry
I don't know from which country you are
it's night here in India I am in India
okay
unforgettable movement in 2017 finally I
got the visa of Egypt although there was
an emergency in the country I still got
the visa of Egypt that was unforgettable
moment for me there was a bomb blast in
Egypt when I was about to visit like one
day or two day before that and I already
had a visa I wanted to see the pyramids
my visa got rejected in the past but
finally I got that that was like
unforgettable moment the second one was
I crossed hundred thousand subs on
YouTube that was like unbelievable when
I started I thought I would be hitting
like 20,000 or 30,000 this year and then
suddenly 100 thousand big deal link your
rocker come on
leave these Iraq are jokes I hate la
puckered okay sorry dinner yes I had my
dinner
okay difference okay why is it going on
okay it's going like really fast now do
you listen to did Jack puja song come on
here being a difficult duty of
government paycheck puja song it's
something I'm dead should I be listening
to did Jack pooja come on everything
that sensational doesn't means it's good
anything can be sensational but it's not
good the real music my dear friend
that's not actual music you should
really listen to the songs I'll probably
give you a list of songs that he should
be really listening go ahead and watch
the making of the recent popular song I
forgot the name of a shape of you see
the making of that song how much they
have part about it know about the
difference between what does a melody
and all these things you love that so
Mumbai meet up I can probably do a meet
up next time in Mumbai I'm usually like
very familiar with the eye item
I talk so probably I'll invite you at
IIT Bombay this time when I'll be there
finish is it possible to achieve Reddick
functionality only using react yes but
of course you have to use some kind of a
back-end that can be but yes of course
if you want to just use react and redux
it's completely possible
trust me Redux is not easy but it's all
worth valuable I have made a video on
Redux it's really popular it's really
powerful you should watch that but if of
course if you are making some kind of
edible functionality Redux is like a
super helpful so yes every single word
3x is there ok how to learn graphic
design where to start start with a
Pinterest look out Venus graphic designs
that's very good then choose a software
like sketch
maybe Adobe Illustrator maybe Photoshop
maybe affinity designer maybe affinity
photos and start with there start with
the Pinterest it's really a good
platform
I'm not like paid by Pinterest or
something but yes so how can a kid and
get freelancing programming projects hey
Doc over here you are not allowed to be
on freelancer if you are hundred
eighteen so you cannot it's your age to
learn ok somebody is making some abusive
comment I should really block them can I
do that right now yeah I can just okay
you have used some kind of a bad word I
can just block you or something okay I
can block you right now because I have
no tolerance against using the abusive
words okay let's just block you okay no
tolerance for using the abusive words
for other fellow viewers and Watchers so
definitely I'm gonna block you if you
use abusive comments for other people
who are commenting okay don't do that
okay no need to no need to visa for
coming to Nepal yes I know there is no
need of visa but I want I'm waiting for
my lens actually I want to click
beautiful photo I have heard that
it's a beautiful country so that is you
watch technical guru ji again I told you
making comments on any other youtubers
even a slightest one is inviting big
troubles so please don't ask questions
about other youtubers of course you can
ask questions about KC night stop Peter
McKinnon mkbhd they don't make troubles
so no questions no answers about other
youtubers okay not being rude just
trying to be a little bit like aware of
the situation's okay
goldang Gor Python Python CSS tips for
brand websites okay first of all keep a
color palette that's the tip number one
and then just under the color palettes
define all of your color in the hex code
that's the tip number one if you're
using like sass or less that's awesome
you won't be messing around with the
colors much and then try to be
consistent just design to page that's it
one should be the home page the second
should be like rest of all the pages
okay in that way you can have consistent
so the brand website you don't want
things to be more flunkey here and there
there should be subtleties like ripple
effect or maybe material design material
I cans this is how the brand websites
have been developed have you ever been
to Alicia no never substitute of
genymotion for windows your actual phone
use it with the plug-in known as visor
if you want to invest money just buy
that it's awesome plug-in on Chrome just
install the visor and you can have your
like app being mirrored on your on your
phone on your computer
I recently you I'm using it right now
actually in the camp that is going on so
it's awesome are you from AP if you mean
by AP from andhra pradesh no okay sir
you watch a ib then why do you have
problem with abusive words like EAP is
kind of an not abusing anyone in
particular they are just saying abusive
words in general still i I don't like
the abusive part of that when
you are abusing somebody like well it is
a beautiful place let's keep it in that
way world is so good so amazing we
already have so much trouble in the
world why to add up that trouble being
abusive you can be like generous you can
be humble
you can teach somebody like things like
that so this is my own perspective and I
know in this country right now having a
perspective is like a big issue and
somehow AIB is like having that like of
course I didn't like the roast that AIB
did on public but this doesn't mean I
didn't liked it so just don't watch it
it's not like I'll I'll fire and fi are
against them and all these things that
are going on if you don't like it just
don't watch it that's simple okay so iOS
scope in India so much scope but again I
drew a so if you'll just keep on just
posting one comment again again YouTube
automatically will filter you in like
spam so please don't do that just ask a
question once okay so how much we can
iron by freelancing endless limit
probably $1,000,000 in a month so
endless you're really funny I just try
to be justified here a little bit but
again the country is facing some big
issues how to hack your MacBook why you
want to like my MacBook there's nothing

go with TK inter it's really good how to
record protected videos and you don't
record protected videos you made them
protected afterwards it's like
encryption being going on certain
players are required and all these
things so you do them after recording
say my name Veritas Mishra that's a nice
name
really the heavy one okay so almost 58
minutes I'll be I'll be staying here for
like two or three minutes more almost an
hour we have spent here what about your
Harley beast I am planning to write
