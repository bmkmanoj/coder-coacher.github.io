again with another video now this video
is kind of a very good news for all the
iOS lovers and for the game lovers as
well so after releasing the first
bootcamp on the iOS trend I got a
massive response and in this video
you're gonna see what is the good news
that's coming up for all the iOS
developers and game developers you're
gonna love this for sure so let's get
started so after the launch of the iOS
10 boot camp which got really popular
and really one of the hit bootcamp that
I have ever launched people appreciate
the quality of the boot camp and have
really liked the way of delivering the
lecture they were fun and they were
engaging much more on top of that they
were pretty easy explanations so that
you can understand what's actually
happening so people appreciated that a
lot now in my previous few videos I
talked about the game development as
well so people like that as well so I
was looking on all of my series and I
realized that I haven't rolled out any
of the free CDs in quite a while
and if I do remember I might have
launched a free series on maybe
Metasploit or Emmet and but in a quite
while I haven't done that so I thought
that what could be the best new year
gift for the people and for the
subscribers to roll out the free series
and yes this is gonna be a completely
free series on game development now I
would be doing a game development entire
series which will help you to understand
what are sprites particle physics and
pretty much everything but I'll be using
the iOS platform and I'll be using the
sprite kit Iestyn and step 3 now I would
like to make sure that you understand
some prerequisite as well for this game
development now game development this
specially this series is not going to be
some big nerd friendly series it
requires some of the experience as well
so what kind of experience it only
requires you to have a little bit
experience with the Swift 3 and Xcode
now if you have designed any app in the
past that say is just a hello world or
changes the background color by hitting
a button or somewhat like that then you
are completely ready for this course now
in case you are not yet ready for the
course and you're looking to brush up
your skills or regain some surf 3 skill
I'll lick down a quick bootcamp and you
can just finish that quickly and come
back on this series now this is going to
be a really exciting series and by the
end of this series you'll be having one
game with you and which will be a space
retro game and the reason why I have
chosen the space retro game because in
the space game you learn a lot about the
particle physics and you learn about the
scattering of the particle how the
motions of the plane can be done and
it's it's pretty much fun so you're
gonna enjoy a lot now I expect you to
just a watch out for the channel 4 and
do hit the subscribe because I will be
pushing the videos a little bit slower
because if I'll just say I'll be rolling
out the videos every week and every day
just like that it doesn't work because
the reason why you like my videos is the
simplicity you like how I explain the
things in such a clear and such easy way
and all that is possible with a lot of
research and lot of advanced preparation
that I do so I have to prepare a lot I
have to prepare curriculum assets a game
what I'll be doing so a lot of things
have to be done and for this I'll be
pushing the videos on the YouTube a
little bit slower but again the quality
is going to be superior top-notch
quality videos that you'll be getting on
the game development and I believe this
is gonna be a great starting point for
everyone into the game development if
they are already into the iOS or just
want to go and see how the game
development actually is experienced and
how the developers do it so what I
expect you to do is spread around the
word now you are the one of the reason
why I am starting this series because
you have been so much of the kind
audience and I really appreciate that
and I expect you to please spread the
word around and if you're some younger
brothers your elder brothers your
friends family somebody's looking to get
started in iOS development or game
development make sure you spread the
word around maybe on the Facebook just
posted there are a lot of your friends
whom you don't know about and want to
get started with that so make sure you
suggest the videos to them and we will
be doing this now again make sure you
check out the link below I'll put a link
below in the description with a special
coupon code as well so that you can get
started with the iOS in case you have no
idea how the cave development or the app
development itself works on so this is
going to be a
fantastic cities and in the next few
videos you won't be seeing me you will
be seeing the screencast because I think
that's much more valuable in the game
development instead of seeing me but
again this is gonna be a fun series and
completely professional one
so with this I'll catch you up in the
next video in the meantime don't forget
to hit the subscribe button I really
need that so to hit the subscribe button
and let's create an awesome game a
killer game that you really wish to have
so let's go there and I'll catch you up
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
