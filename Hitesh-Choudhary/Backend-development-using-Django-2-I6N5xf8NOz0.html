back-end development using django for
beginners build eight projects I can
understand when anybody gets started to
start things in back-end development
things can get a little bit intimidating
because there are so many options in
back-end and honestly all of them are
correct I just asked myself that what
could be just one advice that I could
give to myself by going back into the
time that hey learn this framework this
would be amazingly simple to get started
in back-end and without a doubt it was
django django is amazingly powerful and
amazingly simple to get started with
back-end hi my name is Ethan and I have
been programming for almost 10 years now
I have created some of the amazing and
best-seller boot camps on front-end
development iOS Android react and
various other tech my speciality is to
teach the toughest topic in the easiest
manner so that learning becomes fun I
have taught more than hundred thousand
students from variety of countries and
right now my channel has got one hundred
and fifty thousand subscribers all
programmer and I'm finally back with an
amazing course on back-end development
using Django this course is not at all
for beginners there are a couple of pre
requested that you should know before
you take this course the first thing is
you should be aware of HTML and CSS you
don't need to be a guru in that but of
course little things are required here I
expect you to have some knowledge
because I won't be discussing things
like how I change the background in that
website these things should already be
familiar to you
the second prerequisite for this course
is Python will be using Python 3 and
Django 2 version for this course now you
don't need to be a guru in Python but
some small basics like if and else loops
function and classes are kind of a
compulsory before taking this course
again you don't need to be a guru you
can learn things on the go but clear
basics of the syntax is required for
this course so what we will be building
in this course will be building eight
different project and all of the project
are focused on big nerd level I am
expecting my crowd here that you have
never ever faced any kind of back-end
development and you want to just get
started will be creating a different
projects and will be taking down 8
different challenges in these projects
you'll be learning about how to make a
scalable web site using templating you
will also learn about the create read
and update functionality in the database
using django creating your own awesome
blog which are having all the features
that anybody really expect to have in a
blog or maybe designing a simple to-do
list or maybe you want to have a login
logout or sign-up feature we'll be
taking down all of them again the focus
is for absolute beginner so that you
feel right at home right comfortable it
through this entire course I highly
recommend to check out the description
and check out some of the free previews
of this course I am super excited to get
started with you in this course I will
surely catch you up inside the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
