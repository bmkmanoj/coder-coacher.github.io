with another video and this is December
Q&amp;amp;A in this video I'll try to answer
some of your questions that you have
asked me on my Facebook page and yes I
am still struggling with having an
active account on Twitter it's so much
hard to maintain all these social medias
so I just go with Facebook and YouTube
only there are others on which I am
active like not so active like Twitter
LinkedIn and all these things I do have
account but that's it so let's get
started with the very first question of
December
there
so the very first question is
interesting and I hope many of you are
struggling with the exact same situation
Hayate sir I'm trying to learn coding
but not able to learn every time I'm I'm
trying my mind distract and I move on
some other thing very common scenario
that people get distracted but this is
not how you learn anything the same
thing goes on not with programming with
lot of other things if you want to learn
let's just say basketball and if you are
struggling around and hopping on to
cricket badminton and baseball and all
these stuff you will never be able to
learn even one game so this is only the
self control thing that how good you
really want to be so make sure you keep
your mind just stay in one position and
this is the thing that nobody can advise
you trust me honestly this is the one
thing that you have to control it on
your own make sure you are at least
becoming a pro in at least one language
once you have understood the foundation
of programming it would be so easier for
you to move into various other languages
because the concept and underlying
things about all the programming
languages is same so just focus on one
language and just keep your goal that
this is the thing that I want to create
with the help of this programming
language and until and unless I'm not be
able to done with this I will not be
moving and of course always giving
yourself small treats always helps like
for example if I'll be able to done with
this app or this website I will be
taking a tour of Goa or I'll be buying a
new phone or a t-shirt whatever that is
so it really helps the next question is
for a lot of aspiring and budding
youtubers and this might solve some of
your problems with this question hey sir
is spending money on YouTube marketing
for YouTube channel good to gain traffic
and audience because in spite of good
content and great hard work people don't
get success on YouTube and one request
one line or song in Hindi yes let's
first talk about your very first
question about not getting success on
YouTube see first of all you need to
understand that having a big audience
doesn't means that you are successful on
YouTube a lot of people consider that I
have big audience that means I am
successful no it
it's not like that the main agenda for
YouTube channel at least what I think is
connecting with like-minded people I
would be so happy with only hundred
thousand people on my channel who are
like-minded who knows what technical
stuff actually means
who knows what programming is or want to
learn about it and they at given any
point of time they can fight over
Android or iOS or Java versus JavaScript
I am really happy with this kind of
audience instead of that like a million
users who don't care about what
programming is they are just here to
know about what is this gigahertz
processor and what is this Kega heart
process s no I I really don't want to do
that I don't want to just be a channel
where I just review a laptops and mobile
phones I want to get connected with the
people who think like me or want to
become a programmer so that is what
success counts to me if I am able to
grab that kind of audience regardless of
advertisement or whatever that is that
would be success for me and regarding to
your point about investing money in
advertisement every business is an
investment since you'll be making money
from YouTube that means investing a
little in advertisement or publicity or
anything I think it's completely ok
every business has a demand of investing
again back into it and that's what you
will be doing at YouTube if you provide
some ads and all these things so it's
completely ok and the reason why a lot
of youtubers are not able to hit their
exact audience that you are they're
looking for four because they are giving
up too early don't give up and just keep
on trying and improve your quality and
certainly maybe like in three or four
years you will be hitting your audience
and yes it sometime takes three or four
years even or maybe more than that but
trust me there will be a point when you
will be hitting your audience and yes I
didn't forgot about your last line
saying that one line or song in Hindi
singing would be a terrible idea
audience will be shutting out the audio
in case I'll start singing but yes Hindi
will kill HSA bolita home but kyoki
audience marries other third global
health or my English prefer car town on
a sidenote you won't be surviving much
long in programming if you don't know
like basic English because all the
questions that you'll be querying to
Google
and we'll be finding solution on
stackoverflow or in English not in Hindi
so even if you don't understand like
basic English weights I believe
everybody does because everybody uses
YouTube everybody uses Google so that
kind of English is kind of required in
programming harsh but this is the truth
you will be searching all of your
queries in English oh that's really an
interesting question tips for new
programming channel and video recording
tips for beginners I have got similar
question as well here but I'll be
answering both of them in just one reply
here now this can be easily broken down
into various steps first of all good
audio quality good video quality and
make sure your story is precise just sit
down relax and thought about what you
really want to say in a video don't just
stand up and just make video in just one
go I used to do that terrible mistake
don't do that sit down and try to just
make a video in various parts so that
you can just exactly deliver what you
really want to say to your audience
story line is the important part whether
it's a programming or it's an
entertainment essential part is you sit
down you think about your content and
then present it and of course once you
have done that make sure you edit your
videos all videos should be edited on
YouTube don't just record it and post it
since you have a lot of cuts of course I
am expecting that you haven't recorded
just in a one go I have done that
mistake don't do that
edit the video spend time in color
correction in your segment sections and
everything so it's really simple good
audio quality good video quality a
thoughtful storyline and content and
don't forget to edit okay this one is
cool so are you a web developer app
developer and how many programming
language you know apart from web
developing and app developing I have
worked in the past as a digital marketer
as well as penetration tester as well as
penetration tester trainer as well so
yes yes I have switched quite in a lot
of domains and I have never actually
counted on which language I can work
it's all about what is the project and
basically the foundation of all
programming language is same you just
take a week or so in just getting
started and friendly in
language and yes I concurred in a lot of
language another question asking sir are
you a graduate from ICI yes I am
graduated from electronics and
communication engineering if you want to
know a little bit more about that just
hit on to youtube and search for today's
show three resume a it is really old but
still it will give you a little bit idea
about my certification and engineering
yes I have studied a lot Android versus
iOS which should I learn why not both
you'll be increasing your demand
exponentially once there is a developer
who can code in both and obviously you
will be getting a lot of freelancer
project you will be able to convert your
client from web to Android to iOS that
means a good flow of money as well as if
you want to hire to any company company
always require people who have like idea
for both the platforms okay a very
interesting insight I can give you from
this question so what is the ratio of
technical and communication scale is
required in job please I want a course
on unity at last I am student from egg
new University distance university is it
going to have an effect have a bad
effect on my career a really interesting
question here okay first and foremost
for some company's degrees to really
matter a lot and big scale companies
like obviously Microsoft and Google are
their founders were like big solid guys
who have done really great in their
graduation and a post graduation so for
these kinds of companies you do really
require to have at least a degree
without that there is really hard
chances to get into that yes there are
still possibilities but it's really
tough now regarding what kind of job and
degree you are doing that is kind of a
different part and kind of a very small
barrier but again of course your project
and what you have done how
extraordinarily you can code how
precisely you can solve a problem is the
main agenda for hiring a programmer
and another interesting thing is about
communication skill now once you have
got hired in a company thing doesn't
really end there you will be hired to
write new code maybe to fix up
previously written bad code or maybe
writing a lot of documentation work on
top of that once that
project is finished sometimes you need
to present that project as well maybe to
board members maybe some conferences
that are happening in another continent
or wherever that is and at that point of
time the person who is having great
communication skill is only going to get
the ticket for traveling to that
continent
so yes communication skills do really
matter a lot and in fact I have been
hired by a variety of companies to just
present their software I haven't touched
their code and still companies to hire
me that we want you to present our
project which we have designed they just
explained me the whole concept
everything and I have presented their
project to variety of board members as
well as onto a conferences as well
so yes communication skills do play a
big role wow this is one interesting one
why doesn't Apple let virtually install
their OS and develop an app for them
what's the reason behind it now one of
the reason why Apple is known for their
product is their compatibility between
hardware and their software now this is
a compatibility which is not available
in Windows now the reason why Apple
doesn't allow it to maintain the quality
of their product as well as the apps
Apple knows once an operating system is
installed virtually it doesn't perform
that good as well as on to an actual
hardware now cases are different for
Linux but they know that this would be
really a tough situation on top of that
just like everybody they are also afraid
of piracy 'z and stuff like that so they
don't allow the other person to install
their OS virtually
now also on top of that this also helps
Apple to get rid of all those crappy app
that you usually find in Android now
this is a good thing as bad thing as
well
now since the Apple ecosystem is so
strict to get into you they will face
they'll give you a lot of troubles to
get into that ecosystem first of all the
price is heavy like $99 per year is the
Apple developer license fees and on top
of that there are so many barrier this
results in no crappy at all apps at the
iOS Apple App Store on the other hand
just compare the exact same scenario in
Android it's really the cheap piece and
usually the app just passed on just like
that in the Google store now a result of
that there are so many crappy apps they
just crash any any given time and a lot
of apps are just hidden and literally
are serving porn in the name of
entertainment these things are not
happening at the Apple App Store and yes
my own app learned code online dot an
app faced a lot of trouble in the apple
app review but at the end of the day we
made it and we are happy about it now
this is not the first case for Vedas
clients I have seen such trouble and
going through with that so yes it is a
hectic process but still are they they
do it all for keeping the quality at
top-notch have very interesting question
for all the bigness of Android and Java
for Android is it necessary to know
everything of Java how to start learning
Android now I have always said that once
you have understood the basics of Java
don't hang around for a long time in
Java if your goal is going into Android
there are a lot of things about
programming that you learn on the go
while making apps while delivering the
product there is no chance on this
entire planet that you will be able to
learn everything on even a single
programming language your job is to hunt
what you're looking up on the internet
and then just adjust that code in your
programming or just directly implement
that logic in your app that's how you
learn so don't just stay for quite a
long time in Java if your goal is to
move into Android yes of course it's
always a good idea to enhance your
knowledge in a particular programming
language but as soon as you move into
Android the thing
we'll be different and your learning
phase will increase exponentially since
you'll be excluding a lot of things and
obviously you can check out link in the
description to find out more about Java
and Android courses at learn code online
dot him a question that popped up to my
channel for a long long time and yes
this is something how important is
mathematics for computer science now it
really depends what you are calling a
computer science here if you're calling
just making websites then probably you
don't need much math apart from your
simple addition subtraction and
multiplication if you'll move on to app
things become a little bit more complex
not much because things like your
randomization like how to generate the
random numbers how to use that function
how to get factorials these things come
into the play as you move into the app
plus if you're using the GPS then
putting up the coordinates at right
position and calculating the screen size
subtracting it deleting it all these
things do really comes into the picture
as you move into the further back-end
things becomes a little bit more
mathematical like you'll be using some
formulas and all things to calculate the
stuff so and again if you'll move
further on the data prediction and data
analysis and machine learning that if we
do have a stock according to the last
year's market prediction then we'll be
sold out for this product and all these
things involves a lot of probability a
lot of algorithms and all these things
so it depends what you're calling
computer science that amount of math is
required for the bigness it's not much
but if you want to go into data science
and analysis and all these things it can
become really nasty a question that
everybody wants to know your YouTube
revenue so you want to know how much I
earn monthly from YouTube I earn dollars
monthly from YouTube what are the things
you should keep in mind while bidding on
any project in freelancing just two
things one I need to understand what the
project is make sure if the client is
saying you are just pitching up to him
in exact same words what client is
expecting you to deliver don't just copy
and paste in your templates and all
these things you
right precisely that we do understand
your project and we'll be able to
deliver that and second just make sure
you present the proof that yes we have
delivered in our past that can be a past
project or the project that you have
prepared in your spare time so make sure
you present the proof that yes we can
code and you'll be getting a project
that's it it's really simple and not all
the time you get lucky but it's really
simple okay this one is cool
if Linux is better than Windows why they
teach us on Windows in colleges now in
some of the universities they even teach
to write Java program on X pad can you
imagine that and some of the people are
using still turbo to learn C so C I have
no further comments on why they are
doing it they are doing it they will be
doing it and there is no solution for it
I really it really amuses me that what
kind of company do write their code on a
text pad if some company does that I am
pretty sure they won't be surviving for
long okay this one can be pretty
embarrassing but let's just pick it up
ever your site app software FB ID or
something got hacked regarding to these
things I would like to add up a line
here only those people who can create
something their creations sometimes get
compromised or get deleted so yes I am
proud to be a creator of things and yes
I have been hacked in past hacking is
like eventual process and there will be
always somebody who can outsmart you so
make sure you digest that fact there is
always a person who can outsmart you and
there is no kind of escaping from this
kind of hacking and stuff so yes I have
been hacked in past I have learned from
dead those mistakes and I am improving
okay this one is little bit personal
hey sir we all know that you are a pro
coder thank you so much but not exactly
a pro just learning the stuff but very
few of us know the story the struggle
and sacrifice behind the huge success
please update on this honestly there is
not much to tell about what previously I
was it was a rough childhood pretty bad
so there is nothing much exciting to
tell about it
I rent
our family was living just like in a one
single room apartment everything was
broken down didn't had even enough money
to pay my school fees and stuff so it is
nothing to just share with you guys it
was all embarrassing and like disaster
in my life but luckily I'm doing pretty
good now so nothing exciting to share
about that it was bad and it's good now
and I'm enjoying my life now okay this
one was random but this question popped
up I didn't expect it that it will come
ever but this is good what's the color
indicate red yellow blue on your lco
website and a student's student wore
what it's say about first of all it's
not student what it's a star student
section where people submit me the
project or tell about their project and
if I get time that is really hard I
published their photos and their project
just to give a recognition to these
projects and the color that you see on
the star like purple and red and green
they are completely random I just liked
the random colors the head that's why I
kept it there there's no further meaning
for that that's kind of a truth so quite
a lot of questions but I really enjoy
these Q&amp;amp;A session and I'm planning to
make this Q&amp;amp;A session every month these
are so fun question to answer and I'm
able to help somebody directly by
picking up their question it's so
amazing thing so that's it for this
video I hope you have enjoyed it and
keep watching keep learning I'll surely
catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
