me and I'm really happy that some of you
did missed me contacted me even on
Facebook followed me on Instagram but
the wait is over hey there everyone hit
a sheer back again with another video
I'm already bagged all pumped up to get
started for the new year but this year
not only I'm gonna get started you're
gonna come along with me yes this year
you'll be walking with me throughout
this year and together we're gonna crush
some new year resolution
all have new your goals every year we
decide that we are gonna do this we are
gonna live a healthy lifestyle
we're gonna learn a code we are gonna
learn a programming language or anything
like that but you know what crushing
down these goals is not so easy and
simply because of two reasons the one is
consistency if you'll ask me hey it is
you run for a 10-kilometer
just do a marathon or running for a day
I'll do that somehow I'll be really
surviving hard through that but somehow
I'll do that you know what's the tough
part doing it every single day whether
that's just one kilometer so consistency
is the most and the biggest evil that we
have to first overcome to that now the
second thing that is even the biggest
thing even on the consistency is the
willpower now this is a big culprit and
is always a hindrance in achieving what
you really want to achieve this will
will inside us is always responsible of
doing the things that we don't want to
do for example you see a sail there you
see a nice t-shirt want to buy that you
just buy it all you don't need it you
all we all know that Pizza is not so
good for health and broccoli is good for
health but still whenever we see that
Pizza whenever friends hang out we just
go and grab it
that's the willpower we all know that
working on a code or on a project of a
programming for one hour a single day is
all good but you know the urge of going
out in a party and not being consistent
is all due to this willpower and somehow
we have to overcome to this willpower
now I'll share a simple story couple of
them and I'm gonna walk you through that
how you can overcome all of this and not
just will tell you throughout this year
you'll be walking along with me along my
side and we'll together move along this
entire year to crush down whatever you
are looking for so this first story is
about my childhood and when we were kids
we all used to have these hundred meter
rays 200-meter race I was one of the guy
who used to participate in that
I was a young kid so all of her friends
were lined up and our a judge was used
to shoot that toy gun and then we have
to run and I used to just see my judge
and he's about to press the trigger I
used to just run ahead of that and all
of the sudden everybody just used to
blow the whistle hey come back you have
to start again you have got head start
and I did that again and the third time
the judge warned me that I'm gonna throw
you out of the competition if you're
gonna do that again and I know that is
cheating but I wanted to get that head
start because automatically it is built
up in all of our mind that if we are
gonna get a head start it would be much
more easier that was a competition but
now this is a near resolution this is
all personal stuff we can all get a head
start the second story is when I wanted
to join the basketball team of my school
now I was a kid who had absolutely no
idea what the basketball is and how to
play that but I wanted to play that and
I tried there but you know what when I
entered the team they said hey you're a
short guy I'm just five eight five nine
and all of my friends who had in the
basketball team were like six to six one
in the higher and that's that's really
tall so they say hey just take the ball
and try to shoot it I tried failed
miserably in that and the coach said hey
you are not that good so you cannot join
the team then you know what I did I
started to learn I started to be
inconsistent the time when my entire
team used to come to the school I used
to come one hour before that and I used
to just do 50 shots before when the team
arrives and 50 shots after the team has
done its play so just simply hundred
short day and you know what happened
after three months I showed up
consistency so next time when I showed
up for the audition of that basketball
team the coach gave me a ball and I shot
that it went the coach gave it again to
me and I shot five out of five and you
know why because it was so easy for me I
practiced 9,000 shots on that board and
it was not a 9000 at first it was just a
hundred shot a day then it became for a
month and then it game gave a
consistency of three months that
it was so easy but it's not so easy when
you lick it from your side so I'm a big
fan of getting started early and being
consistency throughout over my life I
have seen that these things gives
predictably good result but they're not
so easy to achieve so in this year I am
asking you to just follow me along on
this YouTube and Facebook and I will
walk you through through this entire
year being consistent and yes this is
all I'm asking I'm not selling you my
courses I'm not selling you my t-shirts
all I'm asking you is just join me in
this great experiment I've already taken
this experiment last year and before
that it gives predictively good result
you don't have to do anything much
bigger than this
just follow me along and together we
will again meet at the end of ear and
together in this entire year I'll walk
you through that how these things are
done setup first of all your goal this
is the most important part a lot of
people will say that hey this is all
child stuff and this these things
doesn't really work forget about what
the people say give a damn about them
just get started set your goal and I'm
asking you to not to set a big
unrealistic goal just said 3 4 or maybe
at a max of 5 goal that's it the
realistic number that I would like to
give you is gonna be 3 just set 3 goals
and that's it
now what next you have to do is take a
pen and paper now this is gonna be look
a little bit childish but trust me at
the end of this you are gonna get that
so take a pen and paper and just draw
out on the sheet 30 blocks yes we need
just 30 blocks or maybe sometimes 31 and
all you have to do is take three pens
each band denoting your resolution for
example this is my green pen this
denotes that I will not have pizza no
burgers no soda and not chocolate
throughout this year I know this is this
sounds insane and this sounds crazy will
I will be able to do that you will all
see that how much successful I am
getting with this or not
I have other goals as well which I'll
share later on but this is all you have
to do just take a pen and a paper and
every single day if you are able to
successfully do that you just have to
put a star on that
column so how many goals you are
achieving let's just say your goal is to
hit the gym every single day just mark a
star on that piece of paper if you are
able to successfully do that and you
know what's the best part about it you
cannot live with this because there is
only one and one person you cannot lie
at any given circumstances and that is
you I cannot lie to me inside of me
whatever I say to other people I know
that I haven't done that or I have done
that so be your judge onto yourself just
this piece of paper and this pen trick
will we'll be able to do all these
things throughout this year so the goal
part is done the paper part is done the
pen part is done but you know one thing
is still there which is a constant
reminder we have taken all these
resolutions these goals every single
year but some people are just able to do
that for half a month or maybe after a
month it's just gone like that but here
I steps in I will be your constant
reminder of achieving what you really
want to achieve whether it's going to
the gym whether it's a programming stuff
and all of that I will be posting on my
Facebook page every single day that
where is your goal list did you made it
or not and I'll be reminding you through
my youtube videos constantly this year
that how good you are doing in that are
you able to still with me or you're not
with me and all these fun stuff so you
can rely me on that here's my Facebook
link where I'll be posting every single
day that hey were you able to achieve
your goals today or not now I know I'm
taking a big responsibility here which
is not so easy to achieve because
everybody faces different phases in life
maybe sometimes we have family problems
sometimes we have not-so-good days
sometimes we have low days updates and
all these things but regardless of that
I'm taking a big deal here a big
responsibility I'm not sure I'll be able
to do it or not because this is
something big on to a public platform
promising that I'll be doing that but
hey just like you are sometime afraid of
doing the things whether I'll be do it
able to do it by the end of this year or
not similarly I'm also afraid just like
you that I'll be able to do it or not
but
still I'm taking a chance here I have
nothing to lose all I have by the end of
this year is something to achieve one
more thing that you I would like to
point out here is don't worry about the
365 days that we have here just worry
about the 30 days this is the 30 days
mission and that's it you don't have to
worry about anything else
worrying about too much long period of
time always gives a predictably low
result just break down your results into
smaller and shorter period of time in
this case the 30 days that's it so end
of the year I'll be shading you this
chart that how successfully I was able
to crush down the things that I have
decided are not now here's the
interesting part about this experiment
that we are gonna do throughout this
year thousands and thousands of people
are going to join me in this experiment
of designing this paper putting a star
mark with their favorite pen whatever it
says but you know what I am sure of also
one thing that there will be only
handful of people who will be staying
along with me throughout the year and
when will be doing again this talk in
the December next year
you don't realize only handful of people
are just there with me but trust me all
those people who will be sticking with
me in this journey in this great
experiment will be crushing down their
goals whether that goal is to design an
awesome Android app iOS app awesome
website learned react node go to the gym
may be running whatever that is I'm not
saying that your goal should be only
this whatever girl is feel free to have
it and together we are gonna crush it
down and he has just one final note
don't listen to the people people are
crazy and they're gonna call you crazy
for doing all of these things they'll
say this is all childish stuff don't do
that don't trust on them don't believe
on them you just believe in yourself and
a little bit small trust on me and
together we're gonna crush down this
year all the things that you really
wanted to achieve this Christmas give
yourself the world's best gift that you
can ever give to yourself consistency
and strong willpower follow me up on the
Facebook page and I'll put a constant
reminder everything
day that where we are with our
achievements also if you haven't yet
subscribed to my youtube channel go
ahead do that we are gonna crush down a
lot of things this year I'll catch you
up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
