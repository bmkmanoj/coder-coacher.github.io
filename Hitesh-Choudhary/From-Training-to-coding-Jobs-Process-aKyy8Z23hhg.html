with another video so last video was
about coding jobs and coding interviews
and that video exploded with the
comments thank you so much for that and
based on the previous demand now I'm a
game continuing back on to the entire
workflow or the entire strategy that you
need to follow on in order to get a job
okay and this video is specially
targeted from like first year to like
third year or maybe your final graduate
here of the guy this video is not also
targeted for the people who are already
graduated or about to be graduated but
yes if you are already graduate you
might be wishing that this video could
have been posted earlier I would have
nailed down all the jobs and everything
so there will be few valuable advice and
few workflow in that again this is not
like a polished video that I usually do
on my channel this is just a raw talk
that will help you to understand
everything about the job workflow if
you're watching it into your second year
maybe your first year of engineering or
maybe other kind of degrees you'll
absolutely love this video and first of
all we are forgetting to throw down our
intro whatever happens we need to throw
down an intro let's do it now
I'm a lonely hard hard feline I take
what's mine and I leave behind it
first and foremost before we even
proceed and talk about what should be
the strategy in order to crack down a
job this this is not just a strategy
that you can follow up like in two
months or three months it's it's a long
process okay and I'm guiding you for
next like two years or three years it's
I know it's a long process but
everything works like that you have to
be strategic in your life but before I
tell you all about that secret recipe
kind of stuff just do yourself a favor
and hear me out
on these two points these are really
important the point number one is say it
out loud I will be doing coding for the
rest of my life are you comfortable with
that I hope so
because a lot of people I have seen are
not comfortable with programming still
they want to become programmer and
eventually when they get a job and
everything they get frustrated with that
now coding and programming is not the
ultimate and the only thing in the world
there are a lot of other computer fields
as well like you can be a designer you
can be a UI UX developer you can be a
network engineer you can be a tester you
can be a penetration tester although in
penetration testing little amount of
programming knowledge is beneficial but
it's not compulsory okay so yes there
are a lot of other fields as well make
sure you are prepared for that but yes
honestly I would say that usually
programmers are the one who get like
good paid amount of job and that's
honestly the truth whether it's an
Android or iOS or web the core
programmers actually takes heavy amount
of salary okay once you are cleared that
yes for the rest of my life I want to be
a programmer and I will be proud on that
now moving on to the second part and the
most important part especially if you
are living in India get rid of all those
negative people in your life okay hear
me out again
get rid of all those negative people in
your life just for the sake of example
you will find a lot of people in your
relatives maybe in your college who
might be teaching you will be saying hey
there is no future in IT industry there
are layoffs going on they'll show you a
news article that hey this company has
thrown down like
hundred people now they are out of job
maybe in the future machine learning or
artificial intelligence will take over
over the entire coding experience and
all of that there is no future in IT I'm
struggling from last three years I'm not
getting any job just get rid of all
those people they are saying this
because either they are struggling quite
a lot and are not getting a job and
haven't even tasted what it's like to be
in the IT industry or are the kind of
people who have never even tried to do
some kind of programming job have never
tried to build a product on their a name
or something like that so do yourself a
favor and completely get rid of those
people more negative people's or
negative vibes not good for you so get
rid of that and again trust me and
whenever you feel down or depressed
you're not getting a job just come back
onto this video and hear me out today
was not your day
maybe tomorrow will not be gonna be your
day but day after tomorrow is surely
gonna be your day I trust in you
completely you will get job and it's not
that tough probably due to some past bad
decisions or maybe not full preparation
you are not getting a job right now but
eventually everybody gets a job and
trust me I have seen people and friends
who were like mediocre in programming
and had absolutely no idea doing even
installing of the computers yet they are
working in a very good company now so
eventually everybody learns the process
good way or the hard way and they get a
job trust me you will do it so coming
back on to the point what should be a
workflow in order to get a job now this
workflow is super important and this is
the entire workflow that we are going to
follow and discuss and I believe this is
kind of a perfect workflow for everybody
so coming back onto the topic before I
discuss this workflow there is an
important email that you need to read
here so go ahead pause the video for the
next like 2 or 3 seconds and read this
out
female might sound you a little bit
unacceptable because nobody is helping
these students and probably they are not
gonna get their internship certificate
as well the reason why this is usually
happens because students are not aware
what to expect in an internship or
usually some student even skip this
workflow that I have shown you just in
this video okay so let's just follow and
try to understand why this workflow is
important and what is the main step that
usually students skip step number one is
getting trained and there is no
exception with that yes you are getting
a degree in college maybe you are aware
of data structure you have learned about
it you have read a book but getting
training is unavoidable unskipable I'm
not saying that you need to get trained
offline or online or you can just get
trained by yourself as well there is no
big deal in that but usually getting
trained from someone else by taking
online course on offline course speed
ups this process
a person who is learned Android on
itself will take like six months or
maybe a year on the other hand you can
speed up that process to like one month
or one and a half month by getting
trained from an expert course or maybe
from an offline training so I don't have
any problem just go ahead and get
yourself trained step number one
unavoidable step number two and most
skipped step making projects okay hear
me out you are getting a job in a
company because that company is building
a product okay or maybe maintaining a
website or maintaining any kind of
product you have to write code for them
and you are getting hired in a company
you should be profitable for that
company it's a simple map if you are
going to generate profit for that
company you are useful there you're
gonna stay there otherwise you're gonna
get kicked out from there no exception
if you haven't made enough project after
your training chances are high that you
are not a mastering what you have
learned there and in the projects there
are like couple of types of projects
that you can do first of all the
projects that are instructor-led
instructor has taught you something and
has walked to you how to build a project
maybe it's
all scale and just like that but your
job is to take that to the next level
try to build up something from on your
own and trust me if you're asking me hey
I have no idea suggest me some Android
app to build suggest me some Python
project
hey you're not creative enough you are
not thinking enough to make sure you can
come out with some kind of project on
your own so be creative a little bit on
there and try to come up a project on
your own this is super important after
the project comes up the internship now
hear me out this and stay away from
these kinds of companies a lot of
companies are just kind of fooling
around with you and are just saying hey
we are offering an internship just pay
us this amount of money and we will give
you an internship and you are wondering
I haven't been trained on any subject
how I'm directly getting an internship
without an interview or without any
process chances are high that you are
getting a training not an internship in
an internship what usually happens you
have a big project or maybe that
company's already established or maybe a
training company it doesn't really
matter they should have a some kind of
project and an internship interns get a
side chunk to be built up for that big
scale project for example let's just say
we have a website learn code online and
we want to add one more feature on that
website so that student can like join
and discuss about their coding problems
so that small chunk will be given to you
and we expect that hey we have given you
a task and that's it forget all about it
there will be no help provided there
will be no further discussion on that we
need a product to be delivered within 21
days or maybe 30 days that's it this is
an internship you don't get any kind of
help there because in internship we
expect that you have already got trained
you have already worked hard on project
and you know how it goes internship are
usually to get friendly that how to work
on a deadline how to just find resources
on yourself how the work environment of
a company goes on what are the good
times in a company what are the bad
times in a company how to handle the
boss pressure and things like that so
expect these things to be learned in an
internship if some company again is
saying unit hey pay us this amount we
are going to train you as well as in
you probably they are mixing up some in
some projects and training and giving
you that so this doesn't happen like
that in internship you are completely on
your own just a side bar exception
sometimes your project managers are good
enough in internship and they try to
help you out when sometimes you are get
stuck but that happens really really
rarely okay so expect that most of the
time you're gonna be on your own after
once you have completed your internship
maybe 30 days internship maybe 60 days
internship the next most skipped step is
the job preparation usually people say
is I have got trained I have got
projects I have got internship why I'm
not getting a job because probably you
haven't prepared for that and you have
skipped the staff job preparation is an
important aspect and yes it the job
preparation itself is a long process now
one of the key aspect an important
element of this job profession is
aptitude now this aptitude test usually
happens during a college campus
placement as well as in the walk-in
interview when the there is an open kind
of advertisement that hey we are hiring
programmers and usually in the big
companies like Infosys or TCS or maybe
some scale like that the reason why
these companies are doing this because
it has nothing to do with your coding
experience or anything like that the
reason why these aptitude tests are
being done just to filter out the crowd
okay and you need to understand this
don't take it on yourself personally
this is just a filter or crowd we live
in India we have a lot of population and
a lot of people apply for the jobs so
one good way of filtering out these
people is aptitude now I will not
recommend to just keep on going with the
aptitude aptitude aptitude no you don't
need to that usually these aptitudes are
mediocres and can be done easily just by
any good aptitude book so 10 questions
per day within 30 days you will be
absolutely good to crack down any kind
of aptitude that usually these tech
companies take okay this is just an
insight tip that I want to give you when
you give aptitude test not all of your
question paper are being checked this is
a harsh truth this is reality not all of
your papers are checked especially in
the college campus usually some bunch of
papers are being picked up they
check out some of them and whoever has
done solve all these things they'll pick
them up kind of a disadvantage of the
college campus placement but yes this
happens quite a lot so if you haven't
got a job in the college campus
placement chances are high that you were
not lucky enough that your paper was
being picked up and then being checked
so don't just be harsh on yourself
it happens now these aptitude tests are
usually being skipped when you are
applying directly to a company maybe
through their job portals or maybe when
there is an opportunity in that company
or in the startup these apps these
aptitude test doesn't happen they're
usually usually the things get started
there is either with a phone call
interview or an in-person coding
interview trust me
the toughest one that you'll ever face
is a coding interview process and just
onto a sidebar again I guess I am
preparing a lot of questions and
solution and very soon I'll come up with
that and we'll try to discuss all of
these things that what are the common
questions in programming that are
discussed and of course with solution so
regardless of that yes this is usually
the process with that and once you have
faced this kind of aptitude test your
coding preparation and your tech
interview again after coding interview
the tech interview is super-important in
the coding interview you are asked
questions on data structure algorithms
heap stack and these queues link list
and all these basic stuff but once you
come into the tech interview process it
is little bit different
usually most companies don't do separate
code and tech interviews but in the tech
interviews is something where a
technical person is sitting in front of
you and he's gonna ask questions
regarding that kind of a similar to tech
but at this tack interview you can crack
this down if you have done a lot of
project and there was one chance when I
was asked a couple of questions in the
tech interview I had absolutely no idea
about that but I showed them hey I do
have a github repository here and what
you're asking I have actually done that
previously but right now I'm not
recollecting it and interior got so
impressed that yes this person has
already done it we got a project for
that and we we worked on that project
this was not a kind of a job interview
that was like a project
but still the interviewer got really
impressed that I have already worked on
it and the moment I showed him that the
interview got over we cracked down the
project and that's it that's really
simple so make sure you make an entire
good portfolio your codes are on on a
github or maybe on your website or
anything like that so everything is
planned out and if you if you'll follow
thoroughly this entire work process of
this this is a long process it takes
years or maybe couple of years to follow
this entire thing and I'm pretty sure
you're gonna land up in the job but
again whenever you get down that hey I
was not able to crack down this
interview you have learned something in
this interview and probably the next
interview that he will give you will
perform a little bit better than that
so the eventual key step here is to keep
giving the interviews the more
interviews you will give the more better
you will give don't be afraid of them go
again
a long long video i have talked just raw
to do to you directly and probably in
the next upcoming videos i'll come up
with like the best resume is that you
can prepare what should you should put
in your resume what you should not put
on your resume for intern as well as job
maybe some coding questions regarding
that what are the common questions how
to solve them how to approach them and
how to present the solution of these
questions are also important probably in
the upcoming videos i will come up with
those videos as well but for right now i
think let's just bind it up here so
that's it for this video in case you
have enjoyed this video give it a thumbs
up if you have some more questions
regarding the process of this such thing
post them in the comment section below
and if you want to be a still continue
with this thing and want me to come up
with those solutions and questions in
programming do hit down the comment
section and your feedback is super
important to make the next such video so
hint on that comment section hit down
that like button and hit that subscribe
button if you're new i've given you
quite a lot of tasks in this just
remember do so that's it for this video
i'll surely catch you up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
