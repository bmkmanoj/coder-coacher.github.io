with another video and in this video I
want to talk about something that Apple
did it and in case you had a blog reader
or you might be hanging around on
YouTube obviously might have seen this
but apple recently apologized and not
recently just actually today because it
wasn't done in the night and we got the
news in the morning so yes Apple did
apologize there and in case you're not
aware about the situation what is going
right now somebody posted on reddit that
Apple is downgrading the performance on
Apple devices with the new updates that
they are pushing on to their own devices
and it was not kind of an unknown fact
for us in fact everybody knew it that
somehow the Apple devices got slowed
down over the time and I faced the
situation over my iPhone 6 iPhone 5
iPhone 6s so yes it's an issue that we
already knew but nobody just addressed
it properly so this guy on the reddit
posted some of the performance check up
and all these things and Apple had no
auction at all they had to come out and
say that yes B are deliberately doing
that now the reasons that they are
giving is like battery issues and all of
that now this is of course debatable
that somebody can say that hey you could
have replaced the batteries and could
have handled the situation like better
but again there are other sides of the
situation that Apple might be thinking
or might not be thinking but whatever
the case is they were downgrading our
iPhones and this went out as an outrage
in the people and things went completely
in the wrong direction so yes this
happened now what impressed me about
Apple and some of you might be calling
me Apple fan just by saying that I am
impressed by Apple so whatever you want
to say so the thing that impressed me is
this release note so I was reading out
this release note of the Apple which is
on the apples official website is a node
and there is a very interesting word
here I would keep the link in the
description below so go ahead read that
out and on the very like fifth or sixth
line it says something I would like to
read out aloud we know that some of you
feel that Apple has let you dine we
apologize
now this is a is a starting point of
something great because of any company
or when a person is kid is like having
so much of guts that he can just say out
loud that we apologize this is a big
move
I wish really most of the other
companies or other people could have
come out and say for some situations
that we apologized it could have been a
changing world situation and we all know
that some of our politicians really need
to say out come out in the loud and say
we apologize for some of the statements
that we made but let's not make this
video like a political statement here
but really I like the move that it says
that we apologize and really I
appreciate the apples move here but yes
to be honest this is not just dealing up
the situation
we apologize is not just now and yes
Apple have made that we are doing a
couple of situations or things to handle
these things it would be the three step
process first of all they have slashed
down the battery processing it was like
$79 and they have thrashed it down to
just $29 still kind of a pricey I would
say because the batteries actually do
cost like it on 10 or $20 charging for
10 or 12 dollar batteries 229 is
obviously outrageous but this is Apple
this is how you have to deal up with the
situation and they're also releasing and
software update that will give you more
idea about the battery situation what is
in your phone but again they didn't
mention that we are rolling down the
back things like we will be upgrading
your performance and you can just
replace the bat you know they didn't say
that they just say it will give you more
information about the battery and we are
working on improving your user
experience and stuff like that so yes no
need to be happy that your witness
update your phone will get a performance
boost maybe silently they might want to
do that but I don't think so that's
gonna happen because it's a sale issue
so obviously just say out anything it's
a sale thing and everybody knows that
the world economy everything runs around
with money so I don't think Apple is
gonna be performing or improving your
performance of your device but yes they
will be giving you more information that
how your battery is dying now this whole
situation bring
down us to a very important aspect now
before I move on to that aspect I would
like to mention a point here that I love
Apple product and not the iPhone so much
I used to be a big fan of iPhone but now
I use Android as my daily driver I think
that there are better devices in Android
right now but yet again as you asked me
as a software developer I still love the
Xcode compared to the Android studio yes
I have to work in Android studio as well
because some of the clients to ask me to
make Android apps but the way how Xcode
performs and the simulator of iPhones
just performs so smoothly and so fast I
love this I really don't want this
company to see the downfall because
they're doing so great saying that now
let's go back onto the aspect thing I
really think there is something
fundamentally going on wrong with the
Apple and this apology move doesn't
really just straight up everything else
my biggest regret about the Apple is
recently in the Apple conference in the
release of iPhone X or iPhone 10
whatever they call it is Steve Wozniak
Steve Wozniak was there I really wish
that they would have given steel a some
minutes on the stage so that he can
share some words his thoughts about
Apple or maybe just in general because
the guy who is just a standing partner
next to Steve Jobs really deserve at
least a few moments on the stage when he
was already there in your arena so yes
really that's a regret thing and this
fundamentally Brooks down to the
leadership quality of Tim Cook really
obviously I'm not in a position to say
anything about it because I'm just a
small guy who is just recording a video
seeing in a camera and just like that
but yes this is how the things are going
up the leadership is being questioned
because the recent moves of Apple how
the things are shaping up how the PR is
working for Apple everything is
questionable a little bit the products
are awesome their laptops are expensive
but again their performance is really
awesome coders love them designers just
absolutely love them
I really want this company to grow up
it's not like I'm bashing them or you
I'm Justin being an Apple fan I'm just
putting out the facts that are
reasonably good so yes these are my
thoughts about Apple onto a very last
note I would say just link is in the
description below about the statement
that they have put out go ahead
definitely you should read that out it's
something that we should all look up for
word that when you make a mistake it
takes a lot of care to come out and say
we apologize Apple did that really a
salute to that we all should learn from
it that sometimes we do make mistake
with friends with families we should
definitely look forward to be humble and
just say that yes this was the situation
and I'm not proud on that so really a
good move there Apple at least you are
you're sending out some positivity to
the world really thankful for that so
that's it for this video sharing some
thoughts about the apples recent move
and in case you are new to the channel
