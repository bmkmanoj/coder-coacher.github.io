start it again take it everyone the page
here back again with another video this
video is a little special because this
is going to give you the updates or what
is going to come up in the next two
weeks or so so let's get started in case
you did notice that in the last a couple
of months or so I have been super active
on YouTube as well as making some of my
own personal projects like learn code
online and everything but again with all
those things in parallel I have to work
with the clients as well as my boot camp
that I regularly do so I have to get a
little bit busy and things are coming up
again and all those clients are reaching
me out by boot camps are already planned
up so in the upcoming next two weeks
I'll be traveling a little bit as well
as taking those boot camps and client
work is going to be there so not if you
might be thinking hey this does it mean
that we are not going to get content on
YouTube in the upcoming next two weeks
nope that is completely wrong in fact
you'll be getting much better on this
YouTube channel now I hope you do
understand that making these kinds of
video does require a lot of efforts and
post-production work it is not easy to
just open up your camera and record that
and push that online it does require a
lot of post-production work as well as
some settings of environment that is
ideal and perfect off shoot for shooting
these kinds of videos and I like to make
my videos little bit polished so that
it's good for the viewers to view them
listen to them and is amazingly awesome
and I will not be able to make these
kinds of video is in upcoming two weeks
so I thought hey why not to do something
better because I cannot stay away from
this making videos on YouTube and I
cannot be away from the YouTube you guys
are really amazing I see all of the
comments in the comment section below I
I see all of the love that is coming up
on this channel so I thought hey I will
not be going away from this YouTube
channel in fact we'll be doing something
awesome in upcoming TV in the upcoming
two weeks you will not be seeing
these kinds of face-to-face videos but
what you will be getting is the
screencast videos what does that mean
screencast videos are those programming
videos where I just write the code in my
computer screen and you get that
computer screen as a video so you might
be asking hey hippie-ish what we are
going to learn in those screencast
videos I have decided that we will be
talking about the flexbox
in the upcoming few videos with that you
might be thinking hey do we need to stop
whatever we are learning and learning
Android I'm learning iOS and learning
fighters no you don't need to stop that
just keep on learning with whatever you
are learning like Android iOS Java
whatever you're learning just just keep
on going with that but what you can do
you can just hit that Bell icon and
whenever I will be uploading the video
you can get a notification and just by
spending 10 minutes or 15 minutes on
this channel with that particular video
you can learn a skill side by side and
that is going to be flexbox
so now you might be asking what is
flexbox now what I think personally is
that HTML and CSS is debased
the bare minimum core concept that every
person who would like to call himself as
the programmer should know it now it
looks it look really really a kind of a
dull thing that when you say that hey
I'm amazing programmer in Java I'm an
amazing programmer in Swift and you
don't have the basic knowledge of HTML
and CSS now I do understand that
whatever you'll be doing with that
Android app or iOS app you don't require
HTML and CSS knowledge but I think it's
a bare minimum of guideline that
everybody should be able to write or
edit little bit codes in HTML and CSS
and flexbox is a new technique rather
fairly new not so much do is a fairly
new technique in which you write your
CSS code with the flexbox style of
writing code in case you are aware with
the CSS aligning the things and
everything it's not so easy sometimes
but what flexbox make it makes it
amazingly simple and amazingly awesome
to write all those codes in the flexbox
technique and everything just lines up
automatically and it's so much amazingly
simple compared to the old CSS do we
need to learn CSS flexbox only
this CSS is going to be deprecated in
the future I don't think so this is not
going to happen
flexbox is just a cherry on the top of
the cake with the existing CSS so I
would say just keep on learning whatever
you are learning spend a little bit time
on this channel and learn more about the
CSS flexbox so on a whole summary note I
would say just keep on learning whatever
you're learning make sure you just keep
on doing that
apart from that side side by side just
fire up your favorite text editor and
we're going to learn about the Flex bar
now I will also like to inform you that
flex box is an upcoming revolution in
the CSS as well as mobile world
development as well a lot of a lot of
new technologies are coming up which are
wholly and solely dependent on the Flex
box and upcoming few months or so you
will be hearing about the things that
are about to be launched in the tech
industry which are going to be hugely
dependent on the Flex box so I would
always say that learning new skills is
amazingly awesome whatever you are doing
with your existing domain just keep on
learning let's make the programmer
updated and this is this is something
that everybody should be doing so on a
whole note just keep on learning
whatever you are doing and in this
channel we'll be focusing in upcoming
two weeks on the Flex box and there is
going to be an entire series on flex box
so that you can master it in case you
are new on to this channel I would say
that do hit that subscribe button and
give this video a thumbs up if you like
the concept that we are about to start
and for a rest of the other users who
are already subscribed this is a great
chance to learn along with me in a 3ds I
really don't do this kind of thing
regularly where I just launched a series
on the go I usually make an entire
series and then launch it but this is
the perfect time to get me on the go
what you'll be able to do is post down
your comments in the below section on
the youtube as well as I'll be reading
all those comments and in the upcoming
videos I will be able to clarify your
doubts as well so this is going to be an
amazing way of learning flexbox let's
get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
