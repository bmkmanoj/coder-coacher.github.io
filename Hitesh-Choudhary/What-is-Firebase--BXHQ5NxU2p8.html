with another video now in this video I
want to talk about firebase so what
we'll be dealing up we'll deal about
what is firebase where it can be used
and what you need to learn in order to
master the firebase what are its close
competition and how good actually the
firebase is so let's get started here
in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps and
pretty much everything related to
programming and technology so in case
you are new here consider subscribing
because we discuss a lot about these
things so let's move on and answer the
question that we are having but in order
to answer that question first we need to
ask a proper question so what is the
question in here now when you design
apps like mobile apps like iOS or
Android or maybe web application the
database is kind of a big problem and
not because it's hard to design of
course it's little bit tricky to design
as well as sometime it consumes a lot of
bandwidth trafficking between a database
and your applications front end is kind
of a big issue on top of that the host
page is again a problem imagine if your
app is having photo sharing things and
you want to access all the photos there
so it's not easy to maintain all of
these things now on top of that managing
your own authentication system is also a
tricky bit either because everybody
needs authentication from Facebook maybe
Twitter maybe Google or even a simple
login system is not easy to design from
the scratch of course it's possible but
it's not easy to design
now what firebase gives you firebase
gives you a complete solution about how
things can be take down now it's a very
good complete back-end solution that you
can put up there now with the firebase
you can do all sort of authentication
most common ones are by user name email
and password but you can of course use a
log in the Twitter login with Facebook
log in with Google accounts and github
and all the things that you can imagine
which are most popular there so apart
from authentication it also manages a
very good problem of database it gives
you a real time database and by real
time I literally mean real type-a
students the user will clicked in and
you have written a code that the
database entry should be done there it
does it in the real time you can just
see the things magically appear there
and that is very very awesome for
debugging and rolling out increased
level in your application so this is not
about authentication and database here
this does the job really neatly nicely
and
awesomely but it can do a lot of other
things as well like cloud messaging app
notifications your advertisement
programs and there are tons of things
that you can see in the feature page
there but again I would say I love
firebase man in case you might have
attended some of my boot camps in iOS or
maybe react or any other as well I
always like to use firebase another
close competition of Facebook is parsed
now you might have seen that parts was
really really growing and in fact I was
one of the close followers of the past
parts really did a very good job but
somehow Facebook decided that we are not
going to work on this project and the
team that was working on the part we
want to dedicate that team on to some
different good things I don't know what
they come up with that good thing I
think that was probably just for the
first purpose maybe that team design
kind of a snapchat inside the water but
again that was not all about it now pus
is a very good competition for firebase
but now things are changed now it's not
like Facebook has completely closed down
the past it has actually moved it onto
the open source and now in order to use
the park you have to take your own
Amazon Web Services AWS servers there
and host your parts on yourselves and
you have to maintain it on your own the
good part about the part is you get much
more control there but the good part
about the firebase is you don't have to
even look out for your database and
manage bandwidth and everything you
don't have to do anything so everything
is being given to you for the small
scale apps I think that firebase takes
an upper hand because for the small
scale apps like from hundred to hundred
thousand users it can manage flawlessly
everything and in case your app is
having more than hundred thousand users
you probably would have money to pay for
the bigger plants as well so this was a
quick overview about the parts and one
more important question before I go off
from this video what you need to learn
in order to master the firebase now you
do not need to learn anything yep I'm
saying correct you do not need to learn
anything if you are working in the Swift
you can use it in the Swift language as
well it has a complete API that works in
v if you had an Android developer you
can use that in the Android there is a
specific
guidelines for Android as well in case
you are working with JavaScript based
based application or web application
then you can use the entire firebase in
JavaScript as well so again you do not
need to let anything your existing
language will work really great
it has API you just have to call them
update the database do authentication
and also funky stuff there okay so this
was all about a quick introduction of
the firebase and I highly recommend to
go inside the training some of the boot
camps that I have done there and I
always use the firebase in case you have
some other questions as well I highly
recommend to post them in the comment
section below and I'll surely make a
video for that with this I will say that
if you are enjoying this video in here
make sure to give it a thumbs up if you
are new here consider subscribing and in
case you think that this video can be
helpful for somebody make sure you share
it and I'll surely catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
