again with another video in JavaScript
covers so let's move forward and of
course in case you haven't visited learn
code online make sure you go ahead and
visit that now let's come back onto the
cities now I know this city is a little
bit different from your other cities or
whenever you have tried to learn
programming in other books or regular
ways here we are trying to just make
sure that we are learning exactly the
topic which we are about to use it's not
a regular thing like after the loops
only function should come and then after
the Clause should come now it's not like
that it's a little bit different module
and I have personally prepared it so
that learning becomes fun and don't
worry everything will be covered up at
all so let's move forward and eventually
in the series we'll be coming back to
this Trello project quite a lot because
the whole idea is to learn everything
with the help of these trellis by the
way if you don't know Trello ZAR like
modern world 2 dues I like to create to
do project every once in a while it
gives you the whole idea of the things
so as we will be learning more and more
things about like functions and objects
and all of that we will be coming back
onto this trawler Trello to upgrade of a
knowledge and implement that so so far
we have learned about the arrays not
much a lot of topics are still remaining
in the arrays we have learned about two
types of loop the for each loop and the
for loop ok so I'm gonna be doing one
thing for you and you have to do the
other things as an assignment so let's
just select all of that and hit command
slash to comment all of that so we're
gonna be creating a to-do list here now
notice the goal is not right now to run
everything from the terminal as will be
progressing other further on to the web
and other stuff you will be able to
bring up exact same knowledge in the web
or mobile or wherever you wish so let's
just have a simple constant here and I'm
going to call this as my - - duze there
we go
and we're gonna be starting with an
empty obviously you don't want to
populate any general - duze in here this
is gonna be how exactly we will be
building up our application later on and
right now I'll be using one of the many
method that comes with the arrays and
which is push ok now I will be giving
you a little bit assignment that will be
using different methods so make sure you
are prepared for that and you have
watched the previous videos here so
let's just say and we are gonna be
pushing some values in this array it's
really simple
something like boy
bread and I'm gonna be pressing command
ship D I'm using the sublime text
filters here you can write the whole
thing as well and let's just say record
videos for YouTube that's my fun part
and let's have a couple of more and we
are gonna say something like go to Jim
and I'm pretty regular this year this
year actually I'm nailing it so there we
go now we have an array completely
emptied and we populated it now the next
thing is obviously we want to loop
through it so that we can print it so
we're gonna be using my two deuce and
just like that we will be using for each
method for usually Aires I prefer for
each but for some other cases I prefer
the four loop but there are others as
well so little bigger and there we go so
this is how it works obviously you have
to write a function now you know how to
write a function in this will be writing
a function which doesn't have a name it
is usually known as callback functions
we'll be exploring that later on no
worries
so we'll be simply saying hey this is a
function a pair of parentheses and the
curly braces hit enter to make sure
everything is nicely indented okay so
obviously we know how things works we
get a to do back you can name this
variable whatever you like totally on
you you also get an index back you don't
need to name it index you can simply
call it I no problem totally on you and
then we are gonna be simply logging it
for the logging I'm gonna be calling
back my old friend which is these ticks
so we're gonna say I'm gonna be saying
something like this you're and then
let's just use these guys and something
like this and I'm gonna be saying you're
or something like this your task number
and then I can use a dollar sign
something like this and I can simply say
index then I can use is and there we go
have these come on I can write that
shortly and there we go and there we got
to do so there we go pretty basic pretty
easy stuff we have successfully created
a simple application which can take our
to dues and can print them up obviously
we are using push and all these things
nobody uses that like in a real world
application but
we will be reaching there very soon
notice when you started the cities you
had absolutely no idea with the
JavaScript at least what I presumed and
then we are moving further so let's just
open this up terminal here and we'll be
saying node and then Trello yes let's
run this and there we go
hybrid record videos for YouTube guru
Jim and perfectly fine but there's a
slight problem
your task number zero no we don't want
that so obviously that's a quick fix we
can simply say plus one and I think it's
fixed and let's run that again and there
we go your task number one two and three
so there we go
now comes up the interesting part which
is assignment so I want you to create
exact same - duze but instead of pushing
the things on - like this time we are
pushing it from the bottom I want you to
create a simple to-do app in which you
can push the things from the top that's
number one thing and the second thing is
you will not be using the for each loop
I know that's simple that's easy but you
will not be using the for each loop you
will be using the for loop to do exactly
same if you have watched the previous
video I think there should be no problem
at all in doing that if you do the
assignment notify me in the comment
section or to my Facebook page and of
course you can always visit learn code
online dozen so that's it for this video
and I'm gonna surely catch you up in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
