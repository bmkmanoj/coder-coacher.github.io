and let's get started with our
JavaScript to do list application I hope
you have watched the previous video
otherwise this one will not make much
sense so let's get started and first
foremost we are gonna take down our HTML
because that's the front-end part and
then we'll be linking up things on to
CSS and then to do list part I'll try to
make sure that in this video we actually
take down our HTML boilerplate at least
so what is the plan the plan is really
simple we want to create a one big
division that is gonna be container for
holding all of our two dues and we can
assign some stylings on that and inside
that further we are gonna have a simple
division for having our input our two
buttons for add and removing the to-do
list and in the outside part or probably
a second division what we're gonna have
is the list item basically we will be
using unordered list and that will
include our input check box as well as
labels so just it gives a fields of
today so that's the plan let's just get
started
so inside our body first of all we're
gonna have a division that is gonna have
a style of container there we go so
there we go this is our big main
division and inside this division we are
gonna have controls there we go
so this control division will have
probably first of all an h1 tag that
says my awesome to do in here we go so
that's our first part and in the second
part I would like to have an input and
that is going to be of type text no
problem there and ID is gonna be
probably let's use an input how because
we just have one input in this case so
that's our very basic very fast one I
would like to have a line break here so
I'm gonna be just saying BR there we go
got a line break and onto a separate
line we will have two buttons so I'm
gonna say button there we go and we need
to so command shift D or ctrl shift D to
copy and paste that and probably we can
hit command C because I can add some
more properties and then can duplicate
it so command Z and this button is gonna
say
new or add to do something like that and
this button will have some of the
classes I have written some of the
classes that I'll be showing you in a
minute so it's gonna have a class of
probably not the class actually we are
gonna go for IDs in this case because
we'll be using things like get element
by ID feel free to have class as well in
case you want to use like query selector
that is also totally fine first and
foremost let's have a type because
that's the one missing up and that's
gonna be button okay that is good and
then finally we are gonna have an ID for
it and this is gonna have an ID of
obviously add and now I can press
command shift D or ctrl shift e to
duplicate that all I have to do here is
instead of add this is gonna be ready to
move and we are gonna call this s remove
to do or remove done to do so there we
go and I should probably disconnect my
JavaScript alert because that can be
annoying so I'm gonna just remove that
and obviously this color is very way so
we're gonna for temporary we are gonna
have something which is gray C 1 C 1 C 1
a little bit gracious that looks pretty
smooth save that and there we go so how
does it look pretty decent we have my
awesome to do and an input box a button
that says add to do the move done to do
so that is awesome now let's have a
couple of things so we are gonna go
outside of this control and we're gonna
create probably can wrap that in a
separate division as well if you wish
I'm gonna go directly for ul unordered
list and this unordered list is gonna
have an ID of list there we go hit tab
and there we go
now in this unordered list I want to
create a list item and this list item
will have a class of my check there we
go
now inside this list item I will have
two things a input and a label now
notice very closely here how I am
designing this li first of all I'm
creating an Li then I'm generating an
input then I'm generating a label
because when I will be adding some to
dues I will have to do all these things
why am i JavaScript so I'll be using a
lot of create element create
Elementor create a limit create child
and all these stuff okay
so first and foremost I need an input
oops
input and this input is gonna be of type
checkbox' okay and it's also gonna have
an ID ID is gonna be called as check
okay
and i can toggle my soft wrap which in
this case called word wrap okay so there
we go we have an ID of check once we are
outside this input notice we are still
inside our li we're gonna go for a label
and this label don't need actually a for
we are not sending it anywhere as of now
if it would be sending it to something
like node or Mongo we can Charlie use
for right now it's just okay I just need
a label here okay and this label is
gonna say something like go to Jim there
we go now what I can do is I can copy
this and I can paste it one more time
and at this time it is all good but also
I want to check add one more property in
this input and calling this property
because I have been coding quite a lot
in react so what I have to write is
simply checked okay that's it so how
does it look instead of the go to Jim
I'm gonna say record YouTube videos come
on there we go okay how does it look
notice the first one is automatically
checked because we added a property
there called check again I say did
property but it's an attribute anyways
and we are completely able to do all
these things so this is our bare minimum
to do is in case you have this much only
feel free to work this much only because
all the things that we'll be writing in
our to-do rjs will be able to work on
this as well but since I don't like it I
wanted to make a little bit more fancy
so that is why I will be adding some
pre-written CSS for it I will be pausing
the video and you can just copy and
write that here since this class is not
based much on the CSS that's what I'm
not paying much attention to that but
still I'll be pointing out couple of
points here so we can just simply select
all of that and paste that and let me
show you what are the points that you
should be worried about
based on that we will be working on that
now first and foremost when you'll be
seeing this inside this container ID
probably we do have container ID and I
called it as class let me just show you
that yeah we actually called it class we
either have to change it here or there
so it's better that we change it here so
it's gonna be ID and rest should be fine
so there we go
save it save this as well so when you
check out inside this container and list
item notice when we are generating any
item by default the opacity is zero so
you will not be able to see it okay and
also notice this transition so we are
using an ease out so that everything
just smoothly comes out and goes on so
that's the one part opacity is zero by
default for this list item now until and
unless you go to the bottom of this and
you see this class which is my check and
then only we are overwriting that
property which is opacity is 1 and also
if we add this class visual then also we
are adding this opacity 1 and notice we
are using an important so that in case
anything else is being mentioned on this
style class we just overwrite all of
that so these are important point
because this is the reason why we will
be having some smooth transition in our
application so just save that and you
will be noticing that it looks really
amazing awesome it's still the same
thing but I just have styled it a little
bit differently and you know what I can
just add a little bit more to it and I
can just say somewhere if I can figure
it out I'll make it 800 so that it is a
little bit bigger okay there we go so
this is our to-do application and we'll
be working on it again if you don't want
to work on it that's totally fine now
let me just show you that so you can
pause the video and you can write that
so zooming out a little bit so this is
the fourth first part of it just right
here pause the video and then we have
this is the second part you can pause
the video here and can write all of this
and this is now the third part of it you
can pause it right in here and finally
this one
this part I know these are a lot of
style sheets and that's the final one
okay so I hope you got it now again
since this video is not about styling of
the stuff that's why I'm not paying much
attention to that otherwise we'll be
keep digging on to the Styles only so
that's it now our to-do application is
ready and we can start writing actually
the meat part of this entire course and
again I repeat that again in case you
don't have any styling still all of our
to-do JavaScript code will be working
absolutely fine I will be pointing out
the point where the opacity is needed
and how you can just avoid that as well
so that's it and of course once we have
done with the series everything of all
these exercise files will be available
to you so that's it for this video and
in the next video we will be writing
some JavaScript for this application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
