with another video and in this video I
want to finally talk about cyber
security information security ethical
hacking penetration testing you name it
it's just a variety of names but at the
end of the day it's all about how you
can secure your system or somebody's
system and it's all about that so this
video is gonna be all about that but
before we even get started with this
video I want to say one more thing this
is exactly the time when a lot of people
get started in information security now
your source of how you want to travel
into the information security can be
different it can be an online course it
can be an offline instructor nearby your
house or maybe you are getting some
trainings from some company maybe you
are buying some online course maybe you
are buying some online books some Kindle
books or some offline books you might be
reading some of the blogs but regardless
whatever you are doing to get started
information security first and foremost
it's an amazing field and you'll be
seeing a lot of like actions in this
field and on behalf of entire community
of information security I just want to
say welcome on board it's an amazing
field and you're gonna enjoy a lot here
I think one of the best thing of running
this programming and tech community
channel is I can welcome to a lot of
people who are just getting started on
onboarding onto various kind of
programming things as well as as
information security so with this I
would say hey welcome on board
officially onto the information security
regardless of whatever your resources
are to learn it's an amazing community
and you're going to enjoy a lot here but
the whole point of making this video was
not to just welcome you on board and to
say that this is an amazing field the
whole point of making this video was to
tell you that information security is an
amazing field yes we do agree that but
there is a line of constraint that
everybody has to keep in mind since you
are playing with the system's security
probably yours or probably others there
is a very steep line that you always
have to follow you always and always
have to play by rules and once you try
to bend the rules or anyhow you just
slip from those rules there can be harsh
consequences
now the goal of this video was not to
scare away from information security no
it was not at all the goal of this video
is to hear out this incident so that you
can take better actions than what this
person has taken as well as you can
become much more proficient by playing
with the rules so understanding what are
your rules and what are your the
limitations is like the most important
thing in information security yes you
can be an amazing penetration tester you
might be the best of the best you might
have found hundreds of bugs are probably
thousands of bug in the amazing good
websites but your one mistake if one
mistake when you are not playing by a
rule can obviously get you in a lot of
troubles and obviously at this point if
a lot of information security
enthusiasts might be listening to this
might be agree with me that yes we have
to play by a lot of rules we always have
to take care of that now I want all of
you to listen this incident onto a very
very positive attitude because you know
this story can obviously miss just and
can get emotional too a lot of you but I
am just saying be positive and listen to
the both side of the things and decide
yourself because I'm not a player in
this story this is an incident which in
this week happened to one of my friend I
was like viewing all the things from
kind of a top angle and I just wanted to
share with you is it right and wrong
it's not with me it's all about your
judgment what you call that but I'm just
sharing this incident to all of you so
that you can take better decision what
what this person has taken here
this incident is about one of my friend
who is having a big IT company not very
big he just owns a staff of like 30 to
35 percent he manages them and they work
for a variety of clients in designing
their web products and mostly the
web-based product not onto a mobile
design and they always take care of the
security as well but they don't take it
in-house about these security they
usually just outsource it to one or two
percent and those two persons happen to
be working for a police as well as a
consultant and the part time they work
for this company to test out their
latest product can find out the bugs and
wonder abilities and all of them and can
report back to the developer so that
they can fix them up so it's all going
good pretty good and this week my client
was having a big meeting with one of the
potential client where they were looking
forward to close this deal and in the
moment they were about to close the deal
the client actually saw that on their
about Us page onto one of the portfolio
that they sent it was written that hey I
mailed you about your security issues
you didn't took a step anything like
that so I'm replacing your about Us page
by this page and then there was a you
know the hacking stuff somebody replaced
that page with his own custom page with
some hacking stuff written over there
and saying at the bottom hacked by this
this this now exactly at that point of
time the deal went completely into the
other direction because whenever a
client is looking forward to give you
any project like that and things like
this shows up it can really take your
deal into the other direction and here
is my point when you are gonna be
touching anybody's business from who's
the entire family is running whose
entire staff is running people can get
little bit carried away and I hope you
understand what I'm saying if not let me
just carry on with this incident so my
friend got little bit angry that who is
the person who's saying that I try to
report a wonder ability and since you
didn't listen to me
I have uploaded a shell on your website
and then I have defaced your about us
page who is that guy he crawled through
his
because obviously if somebody is working
on to this scale the emails are pretty
often to be piled up there he looked
into all of his email and there he found
a buried up email actually two or three
email which was saying that hey there is
a vulnerability in your website and I
can just report it to you and you should
give me some money for reporting this
one durability the moment he found out
all this situation he had absolutely no
idea what to do so he called up his
consultant which was like a contractor
position for him and luckily for this my
friend or unluckily to the person who
actually hacked into the website this
consultant is really powerful one and he
has got really good links in the police
department as well so the consultant
went on to the company's office and
discussed all these things and he showed
the email that this is the email that
guys tried to approach me since there
was a lot of work it got piled up and we
were not able to forward this email to
you so that you can fix that stuff and
the consultant said the information
security consultant said there hey no
big deal we can actually solve the
situation even better we can get you
something more on to it so he just took
the email and actually the shell was
uploaded after logging in into the
website so the attacker who actually
uploaded the shell and everything all
these things first of all he logged in
from his email ID they had got all this
IP addresses and all these things and
the email was also there that hey I want
to report a vulnerability so there was
enough proof so that some action can be
taken against this person so this
consultant my friend was actually
getting mad on this consultant little
bit that hey you are checking so much of
her products why couldn't you check our
website first and the consultant said
hey we are also human sometimes security
get updated over time and probably we
might have missed one but don't worry we
can fix this situation the consultant
also got little bit mad here and he said
hey you know what this person actually
tried to unauthorized get an
unauthorized access onto your computer
as well as he might have tried to done a
cyber espionage or a corporate espionage
it might have tried to steal all of your
data and client information and might be
trying to sell that onto the market so
this can be a little bit
dangerous situation so you definitely
want to register an F IR in the police
station as well as higher up a lawyer so
that we can see that how much how many
of the IT acts we can pull up on him and
can just fix these issues and obviously
my friend wanted to present an example
in front of his client that me take
cybersecurity absolutely seriously and
we take full measure and step to stop
these kinds of things so my friend along
with the consultant who is having big
strengths in the police department went
on to the police station and lodged this
fi are now the police guy actually got
really little bit happy and said that
hey the consultant is already here so we
should not be much bothered here's gonna
anyway crack down the case because he's
been working for a very long time with
us and the email ID was there the IP was
there in fact just being contacting that
person would be not so hard so he set up
all the things and legal issues and the
address was cracked not at all a big
deal when you have like all the things
like IP is an email address and even
when the person is ready to get
contacted so that somebody can give him
bug bounty so within two days or
probably three days two or three days
they actually cracked up the entire
location and who is the person is so it
was just probably like hundred 120
kilometres from the Jaipur where my
friends offices and with the consultant
along with the police team the everybody
went to the home of the person who is
having this expectation of getting a bug
bounty now I am not aware of the
situation like what happened next
because I haven't got much updated
updates from my friend but the thing is
that yes police is now on to the door of
this person and probably will be
charging him for variety of acts because
the fyr has been launched now it's all
dependent on how they want to resolve
this situation but the big point that we
want to understand from this situation
is that when you work on to information
security or ethical hacking or anything
like that there is a very straight line
on which you have to walk you cannot
just cross this line on this side or
either this side there are a lot of
rules that you have to follow you cannot
just paint as to any random site which
is just online available and you can
not expect like anybody will be giving
you like a bug bounty or is liable to
give you some amount because you have
found a wonder ability on to that
now don't get wrong here because
everybody who gets started in fact me
also gets a little bit emotional about
security and probably might have been
seeing like hey he's having so much
wonder ability why do
why doesn't he fix up now fixing of that
thing or not is not at all my business
my business is all about reporting them
if they have asked me to do so and on
top of that even if you have permission
and if you upload somebody on somebody's
website these kinds of things like Shels
it can be extremely dangerous and
anybody can put you behind the bars now
the position of saying that whether the
company was right my friend was right or
the person who was doing the penetration
testing was right or not it's completely
out of the situation here I don't want
to discuss that thing all I want to
discuss here is that all these play by
rules when you are working in
information security it's it's a lot of
business here going on and if you want
to if you are trying to some trying to
defame anybody or trying to put all
these things on social media or on a
blog article without the permission of
that person obviously he can take
actions against it and that's all is
about the cyber laws that are there in
fact I would recommend you to go to any
bug bounty hunter or an expedient
cybersecurity enthusiast who has been
doing quite well into this field for
like five or six year and has reported a
few bug bounties he will obviously tell
you that hey it's not like you can just
report bug bounties to anybody there are
proper websites and proper channel
through which you can report these bugs
and when you're reporting these bugs if
you put anything on social media or a
blog article about that vulnerability in
detail they are not gonna give you any
bug bounties in fact they can take legal
actions against you because when you are
registering on these websites also you
obviously have read the terms and
condition you have agreed to them which
obviously nobody reads but there are a
lot of terms there in that policies that
says hey you just have to work silently
with us for that client
you cannot just show off onto social
medias or blog articles at least not
without the permission of these clients
now if client is ready that you can post
a blog about our bug that we have found
and we have fixed that that's a complete
different situation because now you have
got permission for the from the client
but if you haven't got the permission
from the client he obviously can take
charges against you and can say hey he
tried to defame us or he tried to get an
unauthorized access on our website or
there are a lot of things that he or she
can do for doing all these things
whether you get started in information
security or ethical hacking it's it's
obvious that you're going to get
emotional about these things because
these things contains a lot of actions
which happen live on the website but
being emotional about somebody else's
security is none of your business and it
should never be unless and until you are
getting paid for that or you are being
authorized to do so so always always
keep in mind that you always have to
play by rules as a summary of this very
very long video all I want to say is
cyber security information security is
an amazing field there is a lot of
potential here but keep in mind that you
have to read a lot lot of books a lot of
online courses a lot of blogs and even
have to read a lot about designing your
own exploits or script and all of that
so it's an amazing field but keep in
mind that you are playing with a lot of
rules and a lot of security of a big
companies can be at the stake and nobody
takes that as granted so play always by
the rule register through proper website
go through proper channel if you want to
report any bug bounty if the person is
not replying to you for those bugs don't
get emotional and make sure you don't
post them on any social media website or
blog at least without the permission of
that particular client they can always
get you behind the bars if they are they
are ready to take some steps there and
probably they want to make an example
out of you so please please do take care
of that so that's it for this video I
hope you have enjoyed this video and
have learned something from this video
if you have enjoyed it give it a thumbs
up and you can also hit subscribe
because we are all tech here talking all
about programming and tech stuff and

in
like it
