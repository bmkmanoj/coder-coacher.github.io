with another video and in this video I
wanted to give you an amazing update
regarding my website learn code online
dot in as well as the apps yes it's
available in the Android store and Play
Store with the name of learned code
online so here is the big news
finally the feature of offline access to
all the courses is being rolled out and
yes you might be really happy that
finally you will be able to access the
videos in an offline manner means you
can download the videos and can access
that now it took us a little bit while
to roll out this feature because you
cannot just directly allow anybody to
download the videos obviously the video
need to be encrypted so that they can be
downloaded only in the apps just like
what you see in the hot star or in the
Amazon Prime and all these other video
apps so all these features will be
available in the Android as well as in
the iOS app now as of now just for today
we are rolling out this feature for the
best seller courses only but don't worry
this feature will be available to all
the courses but you know since this
process of encrypting all the videos and
pushing them to you takes a little bit
while so probably within a few hours or
probably just like tomorrow or something
it will be available to all the courses
so yes I know you are really excited and
we have finally done it now this feature
is to help you so that you can learn
better even in the condition where
Internet is not good so there so that
you can take out your mobile phone can
have an offline access and can focus on
learning in a better way the whole idea
of this channel is to encourage that so
that people more and more people can
write code and can change their life now
this feature of offline access is
already available in the Android because
Android has an automation process of
updating the app as soon as you push to
it
so yes it is already available so in
case you haven't downloaded the app or
haven't updated it please go to the Play
Store and just update we have minimized
try to shrink the app as possible as as
we can so it's a really small app now
also for the iOS users our app is there
in the App Store but you know Apple
being Apple they take manual process to
release these kinds of update so we have
already pushed it on to the Apple server
so our job is already done now it's up
to the Apple when they will be start
rolling the updates so probably they
will
a couple of days or you know Apple being
Apple they can sometimes just push it
within few hours sometimes they do take
time but again this feature will be
available to you as well also there was
a small issue about some people were not
able to track the course properly the
course progress was not working properly
for some users now it is also completely
gone now this bug is completely fixed so
that's also a small news in the sidebar
so yeah that's it that's the big news
that the offline access feature is now
available in case it hasn't reached to
your course that you are interrupted
opted into don't worry it will reach out
to you very soon just have a little bit
patience I'm working all day long to
just make sure it reaches out to every
single person without any issues don't
worry it's gonna come up to you as well
and that's it in case you haven't yet
seen our app or website I highly
recommend what are you waiting for I
highly recommend to you to check out
learn code online dot in as well as our
apps in the App Store as well as in the
Google Play so that's it good news I
hope you have enjoyed it and I will
catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
