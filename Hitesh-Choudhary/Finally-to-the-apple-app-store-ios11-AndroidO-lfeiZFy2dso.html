with another video in this video I have
an amazing and exciting update for all
of you and some people really do ask me
why don't I use this setup yes this is
another setup I usually stand there this
is another setter that I love but the
reason why I don't use this setup is
it's too gigantic and too wide but
actually I love it
although I do need to install a few
lights it's not that bright but yes but
by the way this is not the update the
update is amazing and some of you might
have already guessed that it's related
to iOS let's talk about it
Oh finally the app is here in the App
Store yes finally the learned code
online app is available for all the
Android users for all the tablet users
that runs Android as well as all the
iPhone users as well as the iPad users
as well yes we have launched our app for
the iPad users as well I know it's being
a little bit while and we had some
trouble going on with the Apple here and
there and some updates some changes need
to be there which I really didn't like
to made but yes I had to make them
because Apple said so but regardless of
that finally our app is in the ice store
and you will find the links not in the
ice tour actually app store you'll find
all the links for both of the apps the
Android and the iOS in the link
description below as well as all the
update the links are being updated on
the websites and doing at them as of now
so yes by the time you'll be watching
the videos you will be seeing that now
with this also I want to say that
finally the phase 2 is over now first of
all we went into the phase 1 or the
version 1 and you saw that how things
got improved from like pure ugly things
to something better and finally we are
on to a much more stable state of
learned code online now we have a decent
website I would call that an awesome
website and the awesome website is
having all those courses and everything
we have it now an Android app as well as
tablet app and finally we have got an
iOS app so this was the part of
everything going on met to be done in
the phase 2 we are actually running like
a month behind what we were actually
planned but these things do happen
now in the phase 3 we are moving ahead
and there are a lot of updates a lot of
things are going to be going on in the
phase 3 and yes we are also about to hit
100,000 subscriber but this video is not
about it there will be separate videos
for that yes a couple of them because
I'm really excited to hit my third
hundred thousand I will talk more about
it in the upcoming videos but these are
all the few updates I know the video is
a little bit shorter I I really didn't
plan to make a video on this but
excited that finally phase two is over
and now I can move into Phase three
so go ahead download that if you haven't
yet downloaded the app of learn code
online go ahead and download that on the
Android as well as an iOS and show the
same love that you have been showing to
this channel do rate the app I really
enjoy finding your ratings on the I
store as well as on the Android store
