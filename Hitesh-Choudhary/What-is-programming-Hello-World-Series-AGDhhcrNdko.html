back with another video or a video
series out there so every day I get
letters of emails asking about how can I
learn programming what are the
prerequisite to learn programming which
laptop should I buy to learn programming
or which language would be suitable for
Android development or iOS development
or a tons of questions like that
in this entire series we are going to
answer a lot about them so let's get
started out here so far I haven't seen a
single day when somebody's email doesn't
pop up at my screen saying how can I
learn programming how can I learn
programming for iOS or which language to
choose in order to design for an Android
app or something like that there is a
lot of question enough and of course you
can see in the comment section art where
people ask a lot about the laptops which
laptop to buy which PC to buy and lots
of things like that so I thought that it
would be really really great to create
an online resource about programming yes
that's all about it and if you ask any
programmer out there who has a little
bit experience maybe five years or six
years he's gonna say you the same thing
that programming is a generalized
concept and language-specific concept is
a different thing in all of the
languages whether it's C C sharp C++
Python Swift PHP anything out there the
core foundation of programming always
remains the same yes the syntax does
really change but most of the foundation
always remains same look around there
the loops the function the variable the
constant in fact everything remains
always the same the syntax of course
does change a little bit like var the
constants the let keyword and all of
that so what we're gonna do in this
series so this is just an introduction
movie out there so what we are going to
do in this series is really simple
we are gonna first focus on the
programming what is programming how you
can learn it who can learn it what are
the prerequisite to learn about it how
much time you need to give every single
day to learn programming how much
consistency you need to learn
programming which language should you
choose in order to specifically develop
for your favorite platform what is the
requirement for gained
design game development iOS development
web development I know tons of questions
are out there and further we'll move on
are choosing the best machine for the
starters for the pros and things like
that so it's gonna be little bit tricky
because you might be asking hey since
you're going to teach what is
programming and what are functions and
what are loops which language are going
to you choose and here's the surprise
I'm not going to be choosing any
language out there I'll be discussing
the generalized concept that will help
you to understand the programming in
much deeper manner than just focusing on
the syntax in every specific video I'm
going to be talking about the loops or
the functions or let's just say any
specific topic then I'll show you what
basically it is and what are the syntax
out there that you can choose around
this is gonna be one unique and fun
cities out there I hope you are also
very excited for this cities and in case
you have some small cousins out there
the junior cousins or maybe some some
guys out there who want to really learn
programming who can get benefit from
this programming make sure that you
share this video with them because I'm
gonna be coming up with a full fledged
series fully on the YouTube fully free
that you can really get help out there I
would like to call this series as hello
world out there because we're going to
discuss that in one of the movie so
let's just get started with the hollow
world programming series if you haven't
yet subscribed to my channel do hit the
subscribe button I'm creating a lot of
fantastic and awesome content out there
on this channel in case you like the
video do hit the like button in case you
didn't like it no hit the dislike button
so see out there in the next movie where
we are gonna first discuss about
programming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
