with another Sunday live I hope
everybody is doing great and I will be
meeting just for a few minutes because I
know a lot of people will show up we
have been waiting for a little bit while
I am little early by the way it's two
minute early
hey there James hey Pascal hey B Burke
how are you I hope you are doing really
well
I didn't kill I noticed Nikhil there
watching and catching me up in all the
life sessions almost all so Nikhil do
sunny thank you so much for joining me
in you have been really constantly
getting all of this so I message you on
messenger please reply I will I will I
will surely no one can ask aku Hindi at
the hip bill could appear thank you so
much for asking
but it's really good because if I will
do all of these videos in English it's
better because a wider audience can
listen to me and can get benefit in
programming and as well because in the
southern part of the India Hindi is not
so much common so it's just a language
nothing much more to be there English
English is just a thing that conveys my
talk to you and your thought to me
that's it that's all about it
so let's ask get a few questions here
none mean Nandi your videos are really
good thank you so much I did really
worked hard on those videos every video
in fact and result is really amazing so
okay so late let's wait for a couple of
more minutes let's start it within the
one minute or two minutes or in the
meantime you can hit that like button
I'm waiting for people to show up a lot
of people have already showed up you can
hit the like button in the meantime and
we're gonna start our live sessions okay
so let's start the live session and i
hope you all of you have watched the
previous video where i
when I told you that I'll be a little
bit busy in the upcoming two weeks so
definitely you will be getting screen
casted videos more because I'm able to
carry my laptop and can record those
videos there and can push them to the
YouTube I will be back with these kinds
of face videos later on a little bit so
that's the update I wanted to give you
okay so let's start with the Q&amp;amp;A section
you can throw up your questions
okay so Akash Joshi asked actually I
want to actually I wanna ask whether I
can become app developer with Python
language probably there might be some
framework with the Python but I'm not
pretty sure and I would not advise you
to go in the direction in the against
direction of the veil if you want to
become an app developer your choice of
language should be really really good
you can get started in the iOS
development using Swift programming
language or you can use Java for Android
development or maybe Kotlin in the
Android development as well if you are
looking up for another kind of different
situation there you can go ahead and get
started with JavaScript using react
native but I highly recommend to get
started with the react G as first react
jess is kind of a bare bone minimum
basic for getting started in our react
native with react native using
javascript of course es6 version you can
actually write the code which can be
later on compiled or transpiled into iOS
as well as Android app so that I hope
that answers your questions really
detailed Lee any videos on JavaScript
hello
Partho JavaScript is there on learn code
online entire courses there so I think
probably for upcoming few months there
is not going to be any JavaScript on the
YouTube okay I started learning Android
from audacity for free hey usual that's
great yeah you have just got started so
I would say that's the great news
wherever you are learning what is
affordable to you that's completely okay
I have no problem at all in programming
important that gate Cesc
see paper I don't talk about the gate
BTech BSC because that's completely a
personal decision I don't talk about it
okay okay sir after 12 how to learn
programming hey open car I have started
a website learn code online you can get
started learning programming there also
you can be constant at the YouTube
channel where I will be teaching a lot
of new stuff so again go ahead check out
learn code online you can really get
started there okay Silvan say is from
Philippines hey Philippine is really a
great country I know I do have a couple
of friends there they are starting in
man they are managing actually owb a
speech after there they have invited me
couple of times to visit them but I
didn't have time to go there but yeah I
will be going up there okay how can I
make command in Java code every single
day code every single day and moreover
importantly to a variety a project like
calculator billing system Android apps
the more you will be doing the projects
the more you will be facing the problems
and problems makes you amazingly good
any and any programming language so go
ahead get started with that
Jas crooners say is have you ever worked
on a RF I am about to release a few
videos on AR and ml kit which is
augmented reality kit and machine
language a machine learning kit I have
worked in it but not so much because
it's just being released nobody is
actually a professional in that right
now because it's just about a couple of
months that it has been released but
definitely I will be releasing a couple
of apps app videos that will show how
this augmented reality and machine
learning can be utilized in iOS app that
is amazing and Apple has made it
amazingly simple so that you can use
augmented reality as well as machine
learning just like a breeze you don't
have to learn Python and all these
things everything is ready to use and
you can take an advantage of that
in your app so I'm really impressed with
that I will shortly be releasing a
couple of videos to show you how the
augmented reality and machine learning
looks like
okay so Rama says do you have a demi
courses yes of course I do have a lot of
udemy courses you can check that out you
can ping me at my facebook I can show
you the link there as well along with
the coupon so reach me out okay hi hi hi
Maharshi hi MSTAR sir make a video in
competitive programming for beginners
probably it's not in my to-do list right
now but surely I will try to do that
okay Maheen Wow
while back okay subhan shoe I hope I'm
not really good at pronouncing all of
the names but I'm trying my best okay so
okay
ib lb and book ID dot text book idea I
don't know what you are writing there
hello doing great job respect from
Pakistan hey hello from in the other
side thank you so much for loving me
there as well
what about NetBeans IDE know I'm not a
big fan of NetBeans IDE I rather prefer
IntelliJ which is far more effective and
far more awesome compared to NetBeans
but NetBeans actually gets advantage in
one domain that is creating other GU
eyes the NetBeans is far more amazing
and creating the GUI apps but apart from
that writing the plain simple Java code
I would prefer IntelliJ or maybe Eclipse
but moreover IntelliJ now I used to be a
big fan of eclipse but I write now right
every code whenever I had to I rarely do
avoid that but whenever I had to write
that I use intern C as my daily driver
okay
I mean BTech second year is it enough
time to grab skills in coding and
programming of course of course if you
are doing let's just say BTech you might
be having two more years and two years
are they more time very big time if you
spend let us say two hours a day within
a month you are spending 60 hours that
we
you can at least master one language
along with the products easily but you
have to be consistent and constant there
ok we'll never simply replace JavaScript
no I don't think so it's going to
replace JavaScript because the roots of
JavaScript are too deep into the web
it's really hard to pull that off just
like that
but again webassembly is looking pretty
good but I don't think so it's got a
replacement it's gonna be always a
cherry on the top
whenever the new thing comes up it's not
always a replacement like in the
objective-c case and stripped case but
always it's good to have new technology
they are being designed to help us so it
just they are so always welcome to the
tech ok sir please tell me about machine
learning ok Akash machine learning I
really wanted to make a couple of videos
on machine learning basically if you
might have heard about the term it's
really easy it's not that matured
machine learning is not a replacement of
writing programming codes it's all about
training your data let's just say you
write an algorithm that algorithm is
patched with the number of datas and
that algorithm get trained by a lot of
number of data sets and that data sets
helped us to predict further things
programmatically there so it's not
something which is replacement of a
programming but rather an advantage and
one of the key domains where machine
learning is impressing lis being used is
in the cancer detection because a lot of
doctors cannot just see that and can
find out the cancer detection so machine
learning is being applied by a number of
data sets being fetched to it so that it
can find the cancer cells pretty easily
so yes the advantage are pretty
humongous I highly recommend to check
out sundar Pichai he's video who in the
Google conference he has amazingly
demonstrated a couple of usage of
machine learning that Google is trying
to do so very impressive video go ahead
check that out ok can you explain why
most programmers dress so simple that's
t-shirt and jeans it's it's easy it's
easy it I don't have to be worried about
what I need to wear to go
like what I need to hear in that video
or what I need to hear and all of the
things are already going on in our
handout there are a lot of variables
constant functions that are not working
so we at least I like to be simple in
that particular case it's so cool to me
so that's why I'm here always a t-shirt
and jeans that's it okay in which I will
do BTech CS or EC completely a personal
choice which up there
I don't really say that hey always go
with the coding and programming hey
whatever you like to do best I'll just
do that because you always find me
passionate about programming because I
love it if you love that don't listen to
anybody just do that okay I read in
newspaper that 2018 there will be there
will be more than 1 lakh jobs in
hardware so is it a good time to learn
CCNA or Hardware course all the ways all
the way CCNA and all these hardware
related course are always going to be
there because whenever we write that
good like I'm using Amazon Web Services
there I need somebody to manage my
hardware I'm writing a code on firebase
or anything so hardware is an essential
part of everybody it's always going to
be there I started learning Android from
Udacity is it good I haven't taken that
course I haven't taken much look at the
course I cannot tell it is it good or
not if you're learning from it that's
good that's good if you're learning you
are able to make make 2 3 apps from it
then I would say it's amazing course if
you are not able to do that then I would
say it's questionable ok ok is it
required to learn Java for Android
development
unfortunately yes but it's not the
extreme kind of Java if you're
comfortable with function loops and a
little bit about classes and objects
that's it that's it you are comfortable
in going in Android development there is
no such requirement of hard core
concepts extraordinary concepts in Java
it's it's just basic thing ok is Java
knowledge enough for making apps no this
is
the thing which a lot of people a lot of
people are there who just believe and
assume that only with learning the Java
you'll be able to make Android apps that
is completely wrong that is completely
wrong because app development in itself
is a different thing you might be good
in programming language but there are a
lot of concept which does require you to
have a basic core concept knowledge
about app development for example
dismissing the keyboard or bringing back
the keyboard or text labels how you can
bring up those text levers how you can
move information from one intent to
another attendance is not being given in
Java yes this is applied via Java but
this is not being taught in Java so
after getting the basics done with the
Java I always recommend to get started
in the app development that will give
you more overview of how the things are
being done okay I hope that answers your
question Roger okay shitali hi hi Mac
prancin says Java or Cortland I would
say why not both why not both because
once you're comfortable with Java even
if you have basics of java learning the
cortland is just a matter of a week I
would say so why not both now you will
be getting extraordinary jobs if you
know both so I'm always gay I always say
that I go for multiple technologies all
the time ok ok questions are being
repeated which was your first language
which project was successful if I do
remember my first project that impressed
me was in Python I did created a GUI for
aircrack set of tools that was pretty
big and I got really appreciated by a
lot of information security community
that you have created such a nice tool
that was one but not a commercial
success commercial success was one of
the website which I designed in the
WordPress and some of the PHP codes that
was for a marketing company in Canada
that was humongously successful and I
really enjoyed there so yes you can say
personally successful was Python and GUI
based code in aircraft that repositories
till they're on my github account and
the first commercially successful
project that generated thousands and
thousands of dollars was in Canada for a
marketing company a medical marketing
companies so that was my first project
thanks for asking
okay Omer Iqbal asked which is good
focus on develop big application or
start making YouTube channel websites
and Android application for earning I
would say once you're comfortable with a
developing big application then only you
should do anything because YouTube is
not a thing where you can just come up
and say anything because eventually you
will run out of the topics and I don't
want you to happen with that because and
once you have a knowledge of developing
the application a lot of domains then it
would be good for people to take
knowledge from you so I would say go
ahead and get experience first and
YouTube is here you can anything get
started here okay I want to start my
career in selenium I'm working in RFP
coordinator please could guide me
properly sir my name is good there is
new one as well appium which is far more
amazing and mostly in demand so it's
like a selenium but for the apps so go
ahead check out that and again I would
recommend all the selenium can be worked
in Python as well in Java but all of my
friends who have told me about these
kinds of things and we discuss that they
always have recommended go for the Java
Java performs really well in selenium
Python lags a little bit yeah sometimes
okay okay let's pick a question which is
best GUI language there is no such thing
as best or worst it depends on what kind
of purpose you are serving you can make
gif since C++ are using QT or using
Python you ztk inter or Java of course
everybody knows it okay so let's pick up
a few more questions Java or Swift I
know a lot of people are going to rant
over this for me but I am a swift guy
I would pick up the Swift project if I
would be offered a project or working in
the Swift or Java I would be choosing
the Swift and there are a couple of
reasons behind that let me hear me out
before ranting about it because what I
have seen that the app that is being
sent to the App Store Apple App Store
are little bit hard to be pushed there a
while on the other hand if you push your
application in Android store it's easier
to get there what it does at the end of
the day is making more rubbish and
crappy app available on the Android and
on the Android and less crappy app and
more polished app on the App Store also
one more important thing the app that is
being purchased and the app that
generate the money is far more high far
more high in Apple environment because
Apple uses does buy more so that is why
the market where you can actually earn a
lot is in the App Store Apple App Store
and not in the Google Play Store but
again if you want to reach wider
audience Apple market is little bit I
would say smaller compared to the
Android so if you want to reach wider
audience your goal is not to make money
with that app then I would say I would
be going with the Java and Android in
that case okay I hope this makes sense
because I'm not being a fan of any
language I'm trying to just show you
what is actual scenario here okay okay
should we love the job or the company I
would prefer job any single day because
I have seen a lot of universities in
college what happens a lot of college in
lot of colleges companies do visit to
you and these companies just say hey
this this company is coming up to your
college and you have to get into
interview I don't like that I don't like
that because in that company my role is
not defined I am NOT being shown what I
will be doing for what post I am getting
hired it just companies coming up and
everybody starts preparing for that and
gets it in the interview I don't like
this concept because maybe you are
looking for all the jobs who have to
just answer a phone call and that said
oh I don't want to do that
ha I want to get into a technical job
but again it's a preference some people
like to do and be talkative on the phone
and just like that if they want to do
that that's ok
for me it's more a programming job if a
company is not deep and not telling me
in advance what kind of job they are
offering me I would not look at them
whether it's a big giant or a small
giant I always look at what are the
responsibilities they are throwing me at
ok so profit through kumaras Java or.net
Java Java there in between Java and.net
I would go for Java not the dotnet where
to start from website or Android
application I would say web development
because web development is something
that can be learned quickly and it helps
you to get a little bit more knowledge
about Android application as well not
directly but indirectly that knowledge
is helpful so I would say get start with
web development ok react native with
Redux on Windows please hey Jason react
is completely JavaScript application you
write all of the code in a text editor
and see that code on Chrome or maybe
Firefox or some of you might be using
Internet Explorer I don't recommend that
but it's your choice so it's not about
Windows Linux or Mac it's a completely
independent technology and already I do
have a course for it so you can check
that out ok so I'll take a little bit
water break in the meantime you can hit
that like button this like button
actually always shows me that you are
loving the sunny lives and we can
probably spend a lot more time here so
to hit that like button ok thank you so
much for hitting that like button I do
really appreciate that
ok could leave asked sir how many
language are required for game
development
ok now game development our variety of
types and I have no idea what kind of
game development you are looking at for
if you are looking up for just duty
stylish game then you can go for HTML
CSS and JavaScript that can produce
really good game using a lot of variety
of game engines and if you're looking
for full-fledged 3d game than a c-sharp
or would be really good language in that
case and using C sharp and unity you can
really do design awesome games but again
it depends what kind of game you want to
look up there a variety of game engines
on which you want to work or you might
want to choose of that but c-sharp would
be an amazing choice in that case okay
have you ever done a network marketing
no I haven't done network marketing I
have worked in one of this SEO company
where I did managed a lot of Facebook
ads for that company and also a few web
page optimization that I did there but
again no network marketing so do you
think Big Data and Hadoop is the future
I think yeah it has got really good
scope I don't work in that domain but
yeah it's a good domain okay how much
time you get sleep oh hey Dani I really
cut short out of my sleep time I know
it's not healthy much but again I do
really cut a lot of time from my sleep
but again one time that I don't cut out
is two hours of my exercise I don't cut
out that I do spend almost 45 minutes 30
to 45 minutes in gym than 15 minutes and
cardio and almost 45 to 1 hour in
swimming so yeah I don't get out at that
time it's really hard to manage some
time all these time zones and everything
but yeah I try my best
sleep time is around six hours to seven
hours or maybe sometime less depending
on what kind of workload but again if I
am free or maybe roaming around I may
try to sleep for 12 hours or something
but that's a rare case mostly I do sleep
between 6 are or fish like that ok so
start from C or C plus depends you can
get started from both many would be good
choice
all language are independent of each
other it's not like you have to learn C
to get started with C++ or you have to
learn C++ for Java it's not like that
you can get started in any language
without any prerequisite okay how to
increase profile value in CS for foreign
universities I have been invited by a
couple of foreign universities I did ask
these questions and everything they
always tell me that it's not about what
the profile is we look for the candidate
who is wide into variety of domains if
you are having a few media articles and
everything that is a plus one but again
having a lot of projects we need to help
you to get there again foreign
universities do take a lot of thing for
sports domain as well again this is what
they told me have tried app development
in Cocke length not a full fledged app
development as a project but I did work
in the Kotlin for designing a couple of
features for a company and that's when I
was first introduced with the Kotlin and
just after a few months like six or
seven months the Kotlin was officially
introduced so yeah I did work there what
is the scope of UI development thinking
to study that reply please hey Gayatri
UI is the most essential thing nowadays
it used to be time when apps like even
Flipkart was designed just like that
without thinking much about the UI but
now every big company is hiring UI and
UX developers but again if you are
trying to get started in UI UX make sure
you do learn a lot of designing elements
as well like Adobe Illustrator Adobe
Photoshop in envision a sketch these are
really essential
do spend some time in a plasmic as well
I know these terms are not easy to
remember
and most of you will forget that but you
can write down as a notes last week is
one of the tool that you might want to
learn quite a lot sketch is another one
Photoshop envision and illustrator after
that you can get to learn about the UI
basic concept
whatever you will be designing or
thinking to design in the UI you have to
produce the prototype for them and that
prototype is only being designed in
these kinds of graphics software ok just
practice and test your coding skills to
get better yep nice username there ok
which book to refer for Android
development in India books I have no
idea I haven't seen any kind of good
book for Android other careers but I do
recommend packet publication as well
they do have some really good book
collection so if you can find it there
go ahead check them out ok sir I'm a
biology student so I can learn
programming anybody and everybody can
learn programming it's not that you are
from bio domain or commerce domain or
anything like that anybody can learn it
it's completely independent of that ok
so react native basic knowledge required
in order to get started with react
native I highly recommend to first brush
up your skill with JavaScript and not
just plain vanilla JavaScript go and get
started with es6 after that although
it's not much hardly required but if you
do have knowledge of react GS it serves
as an additional thing in the react
native but it's not compulsory
javascript is compulsory but react.js is
not so much compulsory but if you know
react react yes it's really so much easy
to jump into react native okay
I completed BTech in eight years
congratulation finally you have done it
I have learned HTML bootstrap C language
and learning Python now but with the
span of time I'm forgetting the stuff it
happens in the initial days that you
forget a few things so it's not bad to
look onto the internet here and
therefore the syntax and then just
getting started flourish ly there but
yeah you have trained up your mind to
understand a lot of technology going on
in
it's compulsory to so train up your
brain like that no js' angularjs or
Jason it's no comparison not a good
comparison by bringing bringing in Jason
there
Jason is always going to be there in
Android in iOS and react in node in
angular whatever you're doing Jason is
always going to be there you cannot
avoid it so not a good comparison okay
ionic or Java depends depends if you are
looking for a complete native
application then Java would be good
ionic can produce native application but
you know what I would say if you're if
you're if you love JavaScript then go
for the ionic if you love Android
natively then go for Java okay couple of
spammers they're a CMS or programming as
the website first-first go with the hard
core programming going directly writing
the code in HTML CSS in JavaScript then
only jump into CMS CMS's to help you not
to be completely dependent on on that so
okay so it's almost 30 minutes live here
we have been doing really great with
these funding live sessions I hope
everybody is enjoying these sunny lives
I always try my best to take out a
little bit time to spend with you Sunday
lives I love them I hope you to love
them let's carry on okay how can I get
job in Java without experience if the
job is not there and you are not getting
job experience make sure you get project
experience a lot of people ask me hey
suggest me some projects there is so
much thing around you make an
application for billing system make an
application like uber make an
application like a Facebook or anything
do anything just make sure these are a
little bit complex project that uses
database login system and all of that so
go ahead get started there it's always
good I'm learning Java Android and PHP
at the same time so does it good for me
depends on what kind of experience do
you have
if you're just a beginner I would say
stick with one at the time I would
recommend Java Android for them now but
again if you're an experienced
programmer there is no such thing as you
cannot do it you can do that okay
biomass is not barrier you can code well
yep that's that's true actually Joule
it's completely true CCC hey Shiva
what can I say AAA technology is to make
web site like Facebook Facebook nowadays
is use it using react actively so you
have a code minimum basic HTML see at
the back end Facebook is pretty complex
some of their application are still
using MySQL some are some have been
shifting to a MongoDB so it's a complex
architecture now at the back end with
the Facebook using a ton of technologies
there it's a gigantic project okay so
are there any alternative for making
apple apps if you don't have macbook you
can go with the Mac in cloud.com it's a
website which offer you Mac tools and
projects and everything in the cloud so
you can use it in your browser you do
require a fast internet connection to
work there but if you're looking up to
say that hey I will install that in
virtual machine and everything I do read
the Apple License Agreement first of all
it says Apple software's are only
allowed and legalized to use in Apple
hardware if you want to go and get some
trouble then go ahead Who am I to stop
you but again you do read the licensing
terms and agreement by yourself before
believing me or any other person who is
going to comment on your comment so do
read it to yourself and I can mark the
line where it says Apple operating
system and all those products designed
by Apple are only meant to be run on
Apple hardware I can
underline that line for you but again do
read it yourself before believing
anybody okay okay computer science plus
film industry how it is possible that is
the most amazing comment or question I
have ever seen I have absolutely no idea
how the computer science and film
industry can be combined and if they're
talking about the film industry in India
that is something but on a serious note
let's come back here if you are talking
about getting into animation industry
and everything then surely there are a
lot of good animation things like Final
Cut Pro and a lot of big things like
Adobe Premiere Pro these are used and a
lot of computer science students are
being hired by companies like Disney and
Marvel to do all kind of fancy stuff in
their programming so yes it's completely
possible okay first step to take to
start programming in Swift with no prior
coding experience hey Austin Swift is
amazingly simple language you don't have
to be worried too much about it I have
seen a lot of programming language like
Python and everybody says Python is so
simple and everything but I believe
there is no such term simplest
programming language as Swift so you can
check out learn code online dot and I do
have a strict programming course if you
are from outside duping me at my
Facebook page I do have a Facebook page
you can check that out bring me there I
can link you up with my other courses
where I taught how we can make up 10 iOS
application and script is included there
Nichols a is hello sir what's going on
hey Nikhil how are you it's it's going
really good
really well I hope you are doing fine as
well hi there sir you're awesome please
talk about data structure data structure
reminds me because that we have started
a blog at learn code online you can
visit that learned code online dot in
slash log and our twit has written a
really amazing blog on data structure
it's really short precise very amazing
blog so go ahead check it out and
trying to me and other people are trying
to write and put more information in the
blog it's really amazing blog do check
out for that for the data structure okay
oh is it required to learn Android for
Kotlin uh no Cortland can be used as a
standalone language but most well people
like to learn Cortland after they are
good little bit good in Java and Android
okay how and how long you have sleep ah
the longest I would say maybe twelve
hour just like that but most of the days
I sleep just five or six hours okay
coach your advanced Java depends on what
you want to do no that's okay you ever
applied for Google and FB for a job no I
have never applied that I was offered a
job at Amazon in the States for one of
the project that I did in ns3
but I didn't took that job I was not
interested in going there for Amazon no
I haven't applied haven't right there
but I have been offered pretty good jobs
in a lot of good companies with good
salaries and I'm happy in doing the
independent contractor thing with all
those companies so yeah I'm happy here
probably in the future I can think about
it okay okay what is fear that okay so
questions are just logging up it is sir
where did that to end up my question I'm
curious about screen technology I hope
this can change our current tech world
screen tech you might want to say about
the LED and OLED panels and surely it is
changing vlogging as the courier yeah
it's a good career but it's really do
require a lot of hard work and a lot of
patience patience means a couple of
years at least it's a good carrier and
once you build up in the audience you
can do an amazing thing with the
blogging but again don't just go after
money and making ads and everything
first the foremost thing is to serve
users if a blog is having amazing
content that readers do like to read
then again the rest of the money and
everything comes side-by-side okay it's
an amazing carrier job okay what is
flexbox flexbox
is about to come on this channel as a
free video series so do it for a little
bit while we will be starting the
flexbox
I think from Monday night or wherever I
will be landing there depends on when I
reach to the location he will be
starting on Monday or Tuesday maybe what
he has flexbox is the next thing that we
are doing up
Ravi says hey they shine 15 year old
Android and Windows developer I want to
join Microsoft what tips do you have and
please should I learn further what
should I learn further please it's
really amazing that at age of 15 you are
having a Android apps and Windows apps
make sure you do push those apps into
the App Store and Windows app store but
as an actor the Pearl I don't think so
Windows is really doing well so I would
say focus a little bit more in Android
in the future I would say try to learn
as many tech as possible a lot of people
does this mistake that hey I want to go
in Windows or Microsoft I would be
learning just dotnet and all those
windows technology no it's it's not like
that Windows is not just working on that
Windows is working in lot of things so
go ahead and learn as many tech as
possible have it in IIT no I am NOT I
have done not been my graduation
anything from IIT but I have been
invited in iit bombay iit guwahati
NIT ela birth and a lot of other IITs I
do for that I have taken guest lectures
there a lot of them I have worked as a
couple of intern projects at iit bombay
and I have been invited to talk as a
guest lecturer for there I have been
there quite a lot and it's amazing to go
there I do love the campus of iit bombay
and specially they call their bus as
some term and all these things so I do
that there it's amazing okay
English is your native language you can
say that almost English and Hindi both
are my almost my native language I don't
have any trouble in them I'm trying to
make sure that I do learn more languages
as well but again Hindi is basically my
most native language but I'm good in a
little bit good at English there okay
okay so let's flush that up okay how to
learn and practice web application
penetration testing I would recommend
that web application penetration testing
is something that you can practice on
hacker earth or there are a couple of
other websites where you can test these
application but the best testing that
you can do is by designing any
application testing others application
is something that you can do for sure
it's easy but designing an application
which is resistive for all those attacks
is something that is extraordinary so
learn about web application designing
and developing skills once you have done
that learn about penetration testing
skills and then combine them together
once these are combined you will become
an extraordinary talented person every
organization would like to hire you
because you know the basics of
development you have designed and
developed some things and you know as
well as penetration testing skills these
are the kind of people which are
required by everybody okay so let's ask
more questions okay how much hours
required for learning selenium not much
not much just basic functions and loops
that's pretty much it sir Python 3.62
exc there is a library which can does
that it's pretty easy I forgot the name
there is an interesting question by
syrup is Elsie oversecured I would say
it's fairly secure but nothing is
foolproof there if people will try to
just to hinder with that they will be
damaging the website but again we do
have some filters there to trace back
into things and yes they may cause a
little bit trouble at your home so yes a
lot of preventive measures have been
taken care so that we can track down the
person who is trying to damage the
website and can file a lawsuit against
him but yes nothing is foolproof secure
there but he has preventive measures are
being applied there okay
so how to add AI in mobile apps ai is
something that you cannot directly apply
you have to prepare a framework a
library for that luckily Apple has done
this for us we will be making surely
videos on that okay that is an
interesting question Xbox or PS
is I love PlayStation I just hate Xbox
probably I don't know why but I don't
like to play games on xbox I am a
PlayStation guy I love to play
playstation I'm looking forward to
upgrade my playstation I do have
PlayStation 3 I'm looking forward very
soon to sell that out and we'll be
buying any one so yeah and a Playstation
okay so and remember my facility on LC
oh okay that is nice suggestions I'll
surely look that out and we'll try to
add that right now what I'm doing at LC
o is I'm adding a FAQ section so that
are simple questions that are being
asked at LC Oh answered directly there
for related to course purchase and
course access duration and everything so
yes I'm planning to add that up so FAQ
section might come up maybe tonight okay
is it possible to create server client
application with electron okay that's
interesting
I haven't checked it out is it possible
to create client server
using electron but electron is amazing
if you're looking just for a basic line
server application like chat finger and
everything that is already being done by
the slack slack uses electron I think so
what am I wrong I have no idea but yes I
think it can be done okay what is
difference between home developer and
company developer
comfy developer goes to company every
single day back home developer just
setbacks at any Beach and can design
that node plus react or angular or what
to prefer for web development I would go
for react I'm a fan of react there are a
lot of reasons behind that specially the
react native and flexbox is there as
well so I I would prefer react how can I
learn JavaScript and how long it will
take please Harrison go ahead check out
learn code online dot and I have an
amazing course on JavaScript you can
probably learn that on a be in a week
and get started there so why we need C
or C++ support in some application okay
some application are pretty exhaustive
they are so big so humongous specially
the applications like Microsoft Word
office these are these are okay fixed up
okay
these are super big humongous that makes
a lot of calls to the lower level ground
there are weather resistors and
everything this is being done in C and
C++
okay so console dot log thanks for reply
okay cancel the clock you are welcome
seitan James George you know what is the
problem there you always try to look for
an extraordinary solution to do the
simple job let's just see if you want to
learn a Python go with the Python if you
want to learn C go with the C if you
want to learn make Android apps go ahead
and learn the Java don't look out for
too much of the alternate solutions
they're not good just go with the what
most of the people are doing because
programming you are doing an
extraordinary thing in your life that's
ok but in the program
you always have to stick with what is
being best to design it I will try to
look up alternative ways they are not
going to perform really well surely you
can try that out but go ahead don't look
too much extraordinary there okay there
we go so I want to learn Android and
make it a carrier to any tip learn as
much as you can and make sure to create
a lot of projects with that this is
super important sir Python or Ruby hmm I
would choose Python not a big fan of
Ruby or Ruby on Rails they are good
platforms by the way they have done I
have seen some of the prototypes in Ruby
on Rails one of the prototype was being
designed at iit bombay guys they are now
working for one of the well the
investors from the stanford they have
designed their first prototype in Ruby
on Rails I didn't like to even the
prototype this was too much clumsy but
again Ruby on Rails is a good platform I
don't like it much personal choice ok
beep XA is a small a VC whore big caps
ABC small one big one looks like it's
yelling at me I would prefer small one
though no good reason but that's ok job
opportunities in public sector this is
not a channel to discuss for that we are
here to talk about programming and stuff
not about the PS use public sectors and
their preparation this is this is not
you are on the wrong channel buddy can
you can you tell the tenth percentage
what do you do with my ten percentage
fairly good not so bad not amazingly
awesome I was not the sharpest kid whose
course 99% not like that but I was not
bad either
ok sir
I'm about to complete your front-end
development bootcamp course what's next
hey you think that I would HIGHLY highly
recommend you to go ahead check out
react GS course which is again a
learn code online or if you're learning
a TV that is also available there as
well this whole package of front-end
development course and react GS will
make you a complete full stack developer
and you will be getting a lot of job
opportunities and everything if you push
your projects on github and apply to
companies and all of that so I would say
react GEOSS can be next thing okay okay
so questions are coming up and I'm not
able to remember me I made you a food
web site and send you I made a better
version and send you but you haven't
replied I'm so sorry that my email is
flooded up and my inbox is flooded up my
facebook comments are flooded up I'm not
able to cope them up I'm really sorry
for that I surely look up for your link
up I'll check that out but again it's
really getting hard for me to keep up
with the emails and everything I'm
trying my best I'm trying my best okay
I'm launching my app on Play Store but
the ads where did that went but the ad
looks bad and makes a feel bad InDesign
but I want also want to benefit some and
the alternative I just hate ads and this
is the reason why I don't put any ad on
learn code online I want just a plain a
pure learning experience there and that
is why I don't use YouTube or any other
such a dish thing on my learn code
online
I want your learning experience there
yeah you lose a lot of income if you
don't place the ads there but sometimes
sometimes you just want to do it I don't
like ads much little bit apps are okay
it supports you but I just don't use
them much okay okay so let's pick up a
few questions it's just going like ding
ding ding ding like they had hand not
able to catch them up it's 3:20 a.m. in
San Francisco and I'm here hey watch
thank you so much I try my best to
launch a few live sessions
with the time of States because I know a
lot of my state students do miss them
and just complete me later on by
messaging me that hey we missed your
live session again why don't you why you
always launched live sessions when we
were sleep there is a difference in the
timezone but again when I will be
traveling to a further part further in
the east like in China or Japan it is
going to be little bit problem for me to
manage these lies but I'll try my best
I'll try my best ok does most computer
science university only teaches
programming and never really teaches
everything how come it all works inside
no Alan it's not like that all computer
science universities only teaches about
programming what I have learned is it's
a different domain if you want to work
more about the heart weight and
everything you should be taking up
electronics I did learned a lot about
registers chipset 8-bit 32-bit and all
of that during my electronics some of
the universities do a mix curriculum
there as well so it's not like that
everybody is doing just one thing it's a
different thing
ok so let's pick up I started to teach
my fifth standard son Python can you
please guide me what should be the next
after Python I would highly recommend if
you have a young kid
teach him web development first because
he's going to enjoy web development
far more because he'll be able to design
small scale games and small scale
website that actually he can see and for
the kids it's far more important to see
the product that they are designing just
on the right side so I would say teach
him with the web development he is going
to really enjoy that as well as he's
going to get started in the future once
he is comfortable with the this web
development he can move into app
development I highly recommend if you
can afford gift him a MacBook or Mac
Mini or something like that I have seen
at WWDC many young kids are getting up
and launching their app on the App Store
Apple are are sending them invites to
join double to the DC so your kid can be
next so ok if you can
or Mac then it's the job okay are us or
android or windows in the preference
order I would prefer iOS first if there
is no chance that I would prefer Android
if there is only chance to work on
Windows I will not work so so okay there
is an interesting question
do you like thin check puja songs come
on who can like that thing you know
there are two types of things on
internet one are amazingly good which
grows up really like slowly slowly and
slowly and there are some crappy things
which grows just like from here to here
just like that and that was not a music
that was just that was not music my dear
friend
check out there was a viral video by
Sony come where he sang the song by the
insect
then check pooja and that was music that
was pleasing to my ears again personal
choice personal preference
okay let's death knock Germany hello
from India I am planning to visit
Germany as well probably this month on
Lisa
ok freelancing tipsy yep we will be
starting freelancing very soon
freelancing tips video series what is
the future of html5 games will it be a
waste of time if I learn it no it's not
going to be waste of time it is going to
be there retro games are always popular
so please tell me my name you should be
knowing your name Gudger does I
hope I pronounce that correct ok I have
been learning Android for about 6 month
where should I head now make more
complex app which uses all the database
firebase earth zero authentication all
of that so go ahead and do that ok so I
have joined in your Python 3 scripting
professional course or I need to do by
completing this course would I become
Python developer and I need more you
surely need more because that course is
just clearing up the basics of
everything about the Python you need to
explore more libraries and learn to
implement them that what makes you a
developer ok react.js for angularjs what
should I learn first react.js and I
think you will not need to learn
angularjs after that ok please make a
series on ACM and code Jam related
competition code Jam I will try but that
is not very specific because code jams
are really hard if I'll be making a
series for that I have to solve a lots
of solution that is too much time
consuming and offering them for such a
price rate is not going to be beneficial
for me if I'll be spending a lot of time
inverting that I will probably run out
of the money and then I have to work for
a company daily job so it's really tough
for me to do these kinds of things okay
well hey I replace the developer jobs
nope they are going to increase the
developers job ok so I create a video on
time management learning theory versus
practical Shirley Shirley one thing I'm
really amazing is managing time after
that I am good in Kodi if you're not
good in the managing time something that
you cannot do much and you give away
when you got 50k subscribers I don't
like giveaways we can host a competition
based on which whoever is the best can
get something in the cave abase so
hosting competitions is my way of doing
the things rather than just freely
distributing the things I believe that
people who are worthy should get the
things for free not everybody so yeah we
can plan we are actually planning up
some competitions but yeah give a base
just like is not something I am planning
right now I cannot trust on the future
what it's going to be like again this is
right now ok so this is me I want to
start ethical hacking plays ok you want
to get started with ethical hacking I do
have an
amazing and doc moose rated boot camp at
learned code online it's complete
article hacking and penetration testing
boot camp go ahead check that out check
the content feel free to have a look at
the entire curriculum what is being
taught what is not being taught
everything is transparent there ok
please make an end of advanced Android
course on Android firebase yes that is
planned up that is planned up in fact
there is a plan going on in which I will
be teaching directly starting from
making an app no basics at all because
basics are already being covered so I
will try to make an Android course which
just teaches you to make three or four
apps which are far more complex and does
require a lot of time so yes that is
planned out ok programming books for
giveaways uh yeah you can think of that
we can think of that books giveaway is
actually nicely
Oh hacking course at LSU is the best
course for big nerd thank you so much
yep it's really amazing course it's
really hardly done hard work has been
done there so thanks so much ah
we'll love to use your app ah probably
there are some other message is going on
there people are just chatting to each
other just like that
any suggestion to improve coding in
addition to use taking these courses
make sure you make a lot of apps or make
a lot of projects that is one way and
only way to get good in brother so today
we have spent a really amazingly good
amount of time in these live sessions
almost one hour so give it a thumbs up
for spending one R in a live session out
of this really busy should you buy a lot
of things are just spending up there
just right there
and still I'm doing these live sessions
here so give it a thumbs up okay
it is how should we improve programming
logics I did made a video for that and
yog to go ahead check that out five ways
of improving programming logic
is the video on this channel predefined
CSS templates for website development
that's a good choice no nothing bad in
that okay so can we delete some users
and make that a hundred user only for
free yeah you can check that out you can
do that in programming as well no need
to you use a firebase for that you can
just put a condition there that only
first hundred users are allowed to
utilize these things for free but if
that is in app purchase you cannot do
that you cannot do that for in-app
purchase you can put some coupons things
and everything like that but you can do
that in programming nothing big
okay so let's put up more questions
is there a team behind LC oh yeah a team
is there behind LC oh but most of the
job is being done by me at LC oh but L
see you is being managed by a team which
is not just closely related to that they
are providing other services to other
guys as well it's a complicated thing
it's a complicated thing behind LC oh
okay some roses are being sent and sir M
B or M is for start-up minded people
startup minded people I don't know okay
so my child is 10 years doing good in
blender by seeing YouTube video
tutorials he is good in Python is there
will be long term future in blender or
such as to any alternative if it is good
in blender I would recommend to go ahead
and get him professionally trained in
blender give him a some course from
udemy or something but don't just rely
totally on YouTube videos YouTube videos
amazing I do like to watch them just
here you go in there but they are not
structured like that so I would say go
ahead get him professionally trained
it's not really required to send him
somewhere just buy some online course on
Blender or something
get him professionally trained okay so a
lot of session okay so we have just hit
the mark of one complete our okay there
we go okay so a lot of personal
questions dancing or singing you may get
a video of B log of Egypt belly dancing
on this channel very soon there was a
fun I've done a lot of crazy stuff in
the life and we can talk about that okay
so give this video a thumbs up if you
have enjoyed this complete one hour of
this life session I will try to make
sure that we will we do these kinds of
live sessions on every Sunday I hope if
you're new here we do these kinds of
Sunday life every Sunday and I talk to
you timing of these Sunday lives are
being announced at my Facebook page
facebook.com slash face Chaudhary page
you can also visit my website racially
calm or just write it on the Google with
a Chaudhary you will find me at the very
top so that's it okay it has been really
really long I have to get back to work a
lot of things is spending a lot of
packing need to be done and everything
with this I would say bye bye I really
enjoyed talking to you guys always
always please tell me your daily routine
I will try to make that but for now I
would say bye bye to everybody and I
really thanks to everybody because you
have come up all here and bye bye
everybody I hope you have enjoyed if you
have enjoyed don't forget to give this a
thumbs up and I'll catch you up in
another Sunday live and of course make
sure you also watch the flexbox series
