with others Sunday live so this is
Sunday live in case you are not aware
every Sunday we go live and we discuss
things we talk randomly we talk
sometimes meaningful intake stuff
sometimes we talk randomly stuff and
these are just Sunday lives still I
haven't figured out how to fix up the
time for Sunday live it's usually random
it's usually around afternoon in the
Sunday but I try I'm trying my best to
make sure that I fix up some time but
due to my travel and everything I'm not
able to fix the time okay so let's say
hello to everybody hey Shyam hey Suraj
hey Sahil hey Kaali
hey femi hey Donna payant kid hey what a
surprise hey Ganesh how are you how's it
going okay mean stack future okay so we
have straight forwardly we have got
starting with the questions and
everything it's going way faster this
time we will wait for the people and we
will fake we will wait up for some of
the likes to go up high for a few
seconds so in case you have joined up a
gray t-shirt again yes it's gray it's
always gray it's not again it's always
gray so we're gonna wait up for a few
second and we are gonna wait up for the
likes if you have joined up make sure
you do hit the like it gives me an idea
that yes you are here okay so let's try
to pick up questions
apart from technical you can also ask
fun questions and general day-to-day
live questions if you are interested in
knowing that also no problem at all okay
so let's pick up your questions I found
some of the interesting ones okay best
smartphone according to you right now
I'm using one plus five I found that
amazing it's a good phone I would
recommend that no doubt about it
previously I was using one plus three T
and before that I was using iPhone and a
lot of generation of iPhone I have kept
my iPhone from 3s 3GS or something like
that I think 3 yes and from 3s I have
used all the models of iPhone like
iPhone 4 or 4s 5 5 s 6 6 s didn't use
the 7 and I'm using 1 + 3 1 + 5 now it's
good phone I like it so that's what I'm
using right now please make a video on
data structure and its type yes there is
a plan going on to make some videos on
data structure and searching algorithms
and sorting algorithms and all of that
yes that is and that the route not very
soon but yes it's being plan and we are
looking forward for that
can you please which technology I should
go for and now it highly depends on what
you really want to do maybe you're
interested in web of obviously the
JavaScript is going to be good to go
right now if you want to go into iOS
there's no much not much choice there so
if it is going to be there for Android
obviously you can go for Java or Catalan
and if you want to go from your web
strategies into the app domain there are
a lot of options now like xamarin is
there a react native is there ionic is
there so definitely good question there
from power consumer is firebase can have
all the functionality of an SQL database
yes exactly it can be replicated as an
SQL database but your work approach or
your work profile is going to be a
little bit different of course a lot
different because my SQL and MySQL based
database are completely different and
the functionality in the firebase is
moreover like objects if you have heard
about the objects in JavaScript or
something
it likes to store the data in that
manner if you have worked on something
like MongoDB or something it's almost
exactly similar to that but the way how
that how the firebase actually stores
the data is different but yes it can be
exactly replicated for SQL kind of felt
and native there so a very good question
their power consumer appreciate that
best resource for learning for python to
learn each and everything I would
recommend a visit learn code on
Darden okay a very good question from
our meta Mitra what type of PC required
for pen testing that's a good question I
get this quite a lot if you're looking
forward to get started in pen testing as
a big nerd I would recommend to go with
the high gigs of RAM and at least I 5
processor that's gonna be a little bit
decent because the tools that you run in
pen testing consumes a lot of memory
consumes a lot of threads so definitely
you would like to go for at least I 5
and 8 gigs of RAM should be minimum and
obviously as a beginner you might be
getting started with Kali Linux and
pirate sec and all these operating
system you don't want to install them
directly on your system and you want to
go with the virtualization so definitely
needs a good gigs of RAM
apart from that there is no such thing
as you cannot do pen testing on Windows
you cannot do pen testing on Mac or
Linux it's everywhere you should know
what are your tools and what are your
techniques that you're gonna follow up
so it can be done everywhere I have done
these kinds of pen testing and
everything for quite a long time on
Windows platform no problem at all then
I moved to Mac no problem at all ok
hame engage how are you I want to do a
app can you help me with it police hey
Rohan I am right now a little bit busy
I cannot help in individuals and helping
them in crafting their dream through the
app yes I can surely help by providing
my courses or a little bit advice here
and there but if you are expecting that
I can help you in writing the code or
fixing up your code it's not possible
right now
sorry about that is the lco app on react
native let me know how we are enjoying
the app the whole process whole idea is
you should have no problem in the app it
doesn't really mean it's the concept
that's that's the meaningful it's what
you really want to do it can be done in
Java so if it can be done in react
native iOS
I am a cans a marine it doesn't really
matter what the app is being built up
the whole idea is it's working really
absolutely fine or even on ipv6 some of
the users
are using ipv6 and app is working
absolutely fine with that very soon we
are coming up with the iOS app it has
been rejected five by five times by
Apple but it's a part of designing your
apps and everything it's gonna be there
no problem at all
automation testing for learning for
better carrier yes automation testing is
amazing I would highly recommend to go
with selenium and appium but don't go
with the Python path yes I'm a big fan
of Python but for appium and selenium I
would recommend Java there he has you
are hearing this from me it's not like
that it's not a great language for
appium and selenium it's amazing it
performs really really well and I think
no other language can match that and
specially the testing environment so I
would recommend you to start with Java
and then selenium and then app in grey
yes I just wear this t-shirt which is
the best a GUI testing tool what kind of
testing you are looking up for maybe
it's a regular testing like IBM selenium
thing or maybe pen testings let me know
that as well mr. Pradhan okay any plan
to come to Chennai ah no right now not I
have just booked up a flight I cannot
tell you that until tomorrow but yes no
plan for Chennai
yes travel is plan okay hello with age
please make video in Hindi so that India
can move forward this is all written in
Hindi I am trying to convert that so
that other people can understand or
Indian developer can make apps now if
you are already typing this using
English alphabets and using your phone
in English language I think you should
not have much problems with
understanding my videos as well as
writing codes because at the end of the
day you are gonna write your code in
English you're gonna find your problems
on Stack Overflow in English I don't say
you have to be master on that neither am
i I'm just trying to use a basic English
here but again
English is the solution don't just get
away from it it would be something like
in this age you are running away from
touchscreen because you say no it's not
effective I want to use a keyboard it's
something like this so don't avoid it
try to learn it and obviously all the
time you're going to be coding in
English so don't be shy from it okay are
you married no I'm not married I'm
single and enjoying it I'm really happy
for live okay thank you so much at least
tell about firebase firebase I have
already made a video on my channel about
what is firebase and how it works and
all of my videos like Android iOS web
react.js I use firebase quite a lot I
tell and describe a lot in detail about
in all those courses it's not something
that we can take up in a life because
firebase is a very comprehensive service
it provides you authentication from
Facebook from email from Twitter from
Gmail it provides you all set solution
also it provides database storage
functionality AdMob functionality and
analytics is always there it's Google a
lot of things are there in the firebase
so I would highly recommend to check out
the video on my youtube channel as well
as take a look at some of my courses I
always discuss firebase there is no
exception with that lots of love from
Nepal thank you so much this is the
reason why I actually do send a life to
ask your questions problems and
everything so do hit the like button if
you are already here okay how do hack
whatsapp okay how do we address that if
you want to hack whatsapp there is no
such as conventional way I would put it
like that way what you can do you can
install some kind of Trojans or
parenting software in somebody's Android
phone no such thing for iOS but yes
there are a lot of software's which you
can install these are all parenting
software can be installed without
rooting the Android as well there are a
lot of them probably I'll make a video
of how to hack whatsapp and entire
mobile phone within a few few seconds
it's no big deal just you have to
install the parenting software that's it
no big deal but
please tell me about firebase hey good -
please make sure you watch the video
I've already discussed about firebase
Rahul Khan says hi how is life hey Rahul
I remember you from the last nit talk I
haven't given much talk after that
I remember that I have been invited to a
couple of colleges but it's it's time so
yes life is going good I hope your life
is also going good you are learning
quite a lot I hope you are doing pretty
good in life really appreciate that
difference between react and react
native react is a web based platform and
react native is used to create mobile
apps especially in Android and iOS I
think that's it Oh Jatin kg says angular
or react jeaious I get this question a
lot let me put it in this way that with
the react you can directly jump in to
react by learning front-end and
JavaScript and of course a little bit
about the es6 version of javascript and
that's it it's a very small library I
would say not the framework it's a very
small library that you can work out with
there's not much to learn so that you
can focus more on creating what you
really want to do it just have States
props and a couple of basic terms that
you have to understand and that's it on
the other hand angular is an entire
framework of course it has more
advantage there but angular for angular
you don't you cannot actually get
started simply by JavaScript you have to
also learn typescript so there is one
more language that you have to learn to
get started with the angular web script
is not tough anybody can learn it it's
kind of a superset of JavaScript not a
bomb not a big deal there but I would
say yes you have to learn a new language
and new everything about everything rest
of things like components and everything
is also there and react so it's kind of
a similar thing okay I hope it makes
sense to help you to choose up angular
or react yes I usually go with a react
because I don't want to stray again my
head into that typescript and all these
things so yes I most of the time prefer
react yes okay Android or cloud
computing or big data or any other new
tech all of them are great there is no
such big deal in
that so you can choose feel free to
choose any of them CSS grids vs. flexbox
vs. bootstrap first of all bootstrap 4
uses flexbox so no big deal there so
bootstrap and flex box are now almost
similar CSS grid I don't use them I
don't use them I don't like the way how
CSS grids actually works I most of the
time prefer bootstrap and of course flex
box is a part of that ok is it necessary
to learn C before starting Android
development no not at all I have already
created so many videos that C can be
avoided if you don't want to learn that
if you want to get started in Android no
need to waste your time and see your C++
directly get started learned with Java
and directly go there
start with Java and start learning
Android then after that creating after a
couple of apps in Android I would
recommend to start with Kotlin because
it's an industry demand right now
everybody expect you to have a knowledge
of Kotlin along with Java so that's the
way how industry is shaping on right now
legend oh jesus says iPhone 8 is good or
not I in case you haven't watched the
video that was created by Lou on unbox
therapy checked it out it's a perfect
description of there is no comment about
the iphone 8 on one side you say yes
it's amazing on one side you say no it's
it's not there is nothing NIEM about it
so yes I would recommend to watch out
the video of Lou at unbox therapy hits a
perfect description of how good I phone
8 is ok
best programming language hey buddy
there is no such thing as best
programming language or worst
programming language it's all about what
you want to create and is the language
serving your purpose that's it nothing
more nothing less
there is a question from Mohawk I am a
react Redux developer of which back in
text should I learn for quick shift to
back-end word for quick shift first of
all I would say use firebase that would
be your quick thing
and after that I would say go ahead and
get started with MongoDB
MongoDB should be really really easy for
you so go ahead and get started with
that so which is the best country to buy
cheapest electronics I would say the BI
is pretty cheap for electronics if you
know where to shop obviously apart from
that cameras and everything's are pretty
cheap in Japan and Hong Kong as well but
there's not much difference you're gonna
pay your custom duty and exports quite a
lot so don't do that
well Amazon ever come with its new fire
phone oh no such news I will ask to my
couple of friends they are working in
Amazon I do have still strong links in
Amazon I will find that out probably
that can be a good news nice question
there never thought about it but yes
I'll surely take a look on that ok
Windows or Mac for a programmer a nice
question there from Nisha can't ok you
can bash me for this you can surely
surely bash me for this but I'm gonna
say Mac yes
surely I'll see a lot of hateful
comments for that eh you are a Mac
fanboy and all of that
no let hear me out hear me out on this
whenever you're working on Windows you
spend a lot of time in making it
workable there are a lot of updates that
randomly appears a a lot of things that
needs to be fixed up sometime it's
really slow and all these things no
matter how you buy it like 16 gigs and
everything you spend a lot of time in
making it workable on the Mac once I
have said it I open it up and that's it
I'm starting working on it it's a really
efficient machine so I would go for Mac
no matter how you bash me on to that on
everything I want to be more productive
instead of just updating my windows or
finding things for it and all of that
Mac out of the box it just works it just
works so that's why I prefer Mac which
is the best UI for mobile app
development there is no such thing as UI
that you can buy or thing you
have to create that so user interface is
something that you create on your own
it's not something like that so so let's
go for there sorry about the disturbance
bro
are you from Hyderabad no I am from
Jaipur
the beautiful city of Jaipur in
Rajasthan amazing why don't you just
come out sometime it's amazing city okay
discuss about Microsoft Azure ray I did
worked on Microsoft Azure a are tried to
work on it during my Master's didn't
liked it even a smallest with it this
much this much
I didn't liked it at all kind of a worst
thing that Microsoft has done with the
Oscar I know a lot of people are gonna
bash me for this they're gonna say no
it's amazing it's not it's not let's
just be honest Microsoft has done a
first job in Microsoft Azure a OpenStack
is amazing VMware virtualization is
amazing and even the open virtualization
is amazing if you want to read more
about it I would mention a book very
soon I put that on my website all these
books there is a book I forgot the name
of the author he's an Indian author
working in an Australian University he
has an amazing cloud in Australia and
our Australia is working on that so that
is a good book to read up for that okay
let's all answer more questions do hit
the like there it's it's kind of a
compulsion you have to do it no
exception there I have started coding
eight days before and made Boober clone
ok amazing and e-commerce website is
this a good work I would say it's
amazing you are kind of a prodigy there
8 days and you have made an over clone
an e-commerce website amazing great
speed keep on going on with that how to
start with iOS programming hey Shubham I
do have a course at learned code online
dot infor is programming it's one of the
top-rated courses all over the Internet
go ahead check that out it's updated for
latest iOS 11th so go ahead check that
out let's speak up more question
hey Rahul be asked no questions
regarding the so-called love advice in a
llama Gordon that go ahead get started
with the late night shows that radio
jockeys you know watch them it's and
it's not a platform to ask these kinds
of questions can we use WordPress as
back-end for Android app no it's not
gonna be a good app it's gonna be a
crappy app it's gonna be just a webview
app so don't do that it's it's not a
good solution for that your opinion
about iPhone acts yes it's a good phone
I would say because I would put my
opinion that it's a good phone it's
really amazing the price is high of
course it is because it's a glassful a
lot of new tech is being there so yes
it's a good phone I would say lack say
like that but since you have seen a lot
of rumors everything was already out
that's why people are not able to
actually appreciate that I would put it
like that it's a good phone
will I be buying it no I don't want to
spend that amount of money in buying an
iPhone X or iPhone 10 whatever you call
that I'm gonna call it iPhone X so I am
confused for government sector or
corporate please suggest me if you are
interested in even a little bit in
government sector and not programming
and everything I would say this this
entire video will look not so
interesting to you so this is not about
promoting the other jobs and everything
this video this entire channel revolves
all around the programming okay let's
pick up more question okay let's put up
like that okay where are the other
questions going up okay which is the
important okay where it goes
come on which is the best framework for
PHP I would say CodeIgniter is great I
haven't worked on all of them but yes
CodeIgniter is good I would I would
and that coding nitrile is amazing what
about asp.net and C sharp okay let's
take this question I have no honour or
kind of a no intention to work on
asp.net in near future I don't want to
do that because it's not an amazing tech
I don't like it I don't like it that
much so I would not be working on
asp.net for soon for C shop I would say
yes it's amazing and it's amazing
because if you are interested in
projects like game development and
everything unity uses c-sharp and a lot
of other things use a c-sharp so I would
say C sharp is amazing but you know not
the dotnet okay oh okay let's
I know HTML and CSS can you suggest some
project to start with you won't be
surviving much with HTML and CSS at
least learn JavaScript jQuery bootstrap
at least complete your front-end part
with just it's like in the HTML CSS you
are bringing a knife in a gunfight don't
do that it's not advisable any time soon
so okay that's an interesting question
Daanish says why don't you provide your
course for less money
I don't think so the amount of discounts
that I am giving on the course you can
find in any offline market I would
highly recommend to go ahead check out
to your nearest Institute which are
teaching these tags like react iOS 11
Android oh no just go ahead feel free to
move around to your offline areas and
check out the face of those courses I
would highly recommend you to check out
that because I'm pretty sure you will be
coming back okay is Mac Mini a good
option for iOS development yes it's
amazing I have done my startup days of
iOS development in Mac Mini it's amazing
it can work really good okay hey I am in
first semester you know that first
semester is hard and bulky can I be able
to handle Java in advance Java after
Android in first year no you don't need
to learn
advanced Java part of things for Android
development you just need basics of java
and that's it go ahead look out at
learned code online there are amazing
courses they are on to go and lot of
things are there so go ahead check that
out and I'm pretty sure you'll be able
to handle that okay is PHP have scope in
future yes of course definitely no doubt
about that PHP is gonna stay there it's
an amazing language it has solution for
pretty much everything and for projects
that I usually do PHP it's kind of
essential thing for every web developer
you should know it code ignitor
larvell is the best PHP framework I
haven't worked much on larval in fact I
haven't worked any time on to larval
coding that or yes of course
definitely I have worked on it it's
amazing which will learn for back-end
PHP are noches
start with PHP and then move on to node
you can directly move on to note as well
but I think everybody should know PHP as
well
okay how to prepare for gate no idea a
react.js plus rest api Java back-end any
idea how will be the performance it's
gonna be good
I have absolutely no doubt that it's
gonna perform less because to react as
kind of a component it's kind of a
library that adjusts everywhere every
single place it's it doesn't matter it's
a job or anything I would say start with
that react gs+ Java back-end no problem
at all shouldn't be a problem
knife in again fight hi hi yes it's it's
almost like that okay practical
knowledge college knowledge haha there
is a practical knowledge for thumbs up
college now is thumb stock and just
something like that okay more questions
please machine learning is it a good
choice yes of course if you're
interested in a lot of data mining and
handling it tons of datas and all of
that it's a good choice I believe Gotham
say is why iOS 10 is of thirteen
thousand the discount is over on iOS 10
yes there is a discount on iOS 11 which
is the latest course so
can enjoy that discount but the discount
is over on is 10 course it's just like
that
discounts get over I hope you understand
that okay shabam says finally joined hey
welcome Shubham finally welcome to the
geek world can I use developer Neha
asked this can i iose developer get
skills like our Hadoop and all these
stake means to do course related only to
Android developer if you're already an
iOS developer I would first recommend to
get started with Android because as a
whole set of mobile developer you you
get more chances of getting jobs and
projects done and finishing of all these
things so if you are already a mobile
developer it won't be taking much time
to learn Android I would recommend first
get Android so that you can become a
complete mobile developer and then after
you can start with the technologies like
our and scrum and all these so I would
recommend that
why don't you provide a free online
course like the new boston youtube
channel my courses are very more project
oriented are very more advanced on tech
these are not just the basic syntax they
are very advanced yes I do provide free
courses on some tech like there is a
wordpress series going on and a couple
of things like Amit and all these things
so I I don't just cover up the basic
syntax like the new Boston it's an
amazing channel it's an amazing channel
I won't say that I wouldn't be saying
against on to that it's amazing channel
it's a good starting point but sometimes
you need more learning things about
latest X how the things are evolving the
project works slow and everything like
that so this is how we are gonna go with
that and it takes a lot of efforts in
recording the videos shooting the videos
you can already see the quality of the
videos that we have producing here it
takes cost the mic has a costing of
course the camera has a costing the
setup that I have a costing and the time
that I'm spending is also costing so I
have to somehow recover that so that I
can keep doing that so that's why a
small price is being paid I have
purchased iOS core
at this price on this website and this
price at my website yes there are
sometimes price differences I won't say
that feel free to buy whatever you like
I have no problem with that it's
ultimately my course it's ultimately the
money is coming to me so no problem at
all but yes there are sometimes updates
being rolled out some updates are rolled
out only on my website just like in the
react.js course the react native was
later on introduced in that and that
update only went onto learned code
online website so you won't be getting
updates in that so but again I feel free
to buy anywhere okay what is the basic
requirement to land a startup job as a
developer programming at least PHP
versus nodejs
yes we can make it full video on that
okay so it's going on like that when I
get certificate when I complete your
course and is that for lifetime
activation
yes certificate is for lifetime
activation and you will be getting
certificate for all the paid courses
only not for the free courses can you
tell me the process of complication in
your courses the process is pretty easy
in some courses you just have to
complete the courses in some courses you
have to take up like a good quick exam
multiple-choice exam and then you can
release your certificate complete react
native course please he is very soon
right now I am busy with the Java stuff
so after that surely for react native
why freelancing and not corporate I do
both I do both I do both incorporate I
do in freelancing as well so I do both I
enjoy them both okay what are you think
about EDX and Android course set up free
courses they are not free if you check
out the good courses at Udacity and
everything they are like seven thousand
five hundred or something per month its
installment basis I think my courses are
very cheaper than that and almost
exactly advance and
little more coming to India anytime soon
yes I am still in India I don't have any
travel plan right now so have you tried
vs code editor yes I have tried vs code
didn't liked it much
I think sublime text is gonna be my
choice right now it's amazing
their edits and updates that sublime
text has got I would say it's amazing
it's something that I was looking up for
an atom but sublime text has given me
amazingly fast I I would recommend you
to try out the new sublime text with
Emmet it's amazing okay what is Android
app reverse engineering related to
security issues and everything we are
gonna discuss that some day later okay
so I think we're gonna end up this
Sunday live just here because I have a
lot of work to do and a lot of things to
go we are gonna end up this Sunday live
