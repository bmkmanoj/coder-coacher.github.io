don't quit college quit college
don't quit college quit it now don't
quit it now this is a very common
question being dropped down in my email
and we need some things to figure it out
let's do that
so 15 emails in just last seven days and
all of them asking about should I quit
my college or should I continue with
that is it really necessary to have a
degree can I just learn everything on my
own can get a job and all these things
and people are just willing to drop out
of the college now the subject that
really points in here is really the
education system in the college going on
really crappy but that's not the point
of this video we can talk about that in
a later video right now the important
point is should you be dropping out of
this college and brilliant of people ask
me we need your final words on the point
but whether we should drop out of the
college or not now I'm going to give you
a specific very very specific answer in
here but I may sound a little bit crazy
in the starting but stay there because I
always talk through with these weird
examples that are not that much related
in the starting but they are related in
the end so listen to me very closely in
here and what we're trying to do in here
is very important now you're asking me
you're asking a youtube guy for the
final words to take such an important
decision of dropping out of the college
or not dropping out of it let me tell
you how you're going to do that this is
a simple coin you can call this else
Swiss franc I use it for quite a lot of
purpose but you can use this kind of
coin to just flip if there's an head
that you can drop out if there is a tail
tail then you can simply choose to just
continue with your degree now you might
be thinking that hey this is completely
crazy this is bizarre whoever takes this
kind of decision by flipping just a coin
now on to a simple scenario if I put up
B your things that you're asking you're
trying to ask me in the email is
almost exactly like this this is I think
more reliable than asking any random guy
on the YouTube now of course I do have a
lot of experience in programming getting
switching into a lot of jobs did my
engineering master's and all other stuff
but really do you really want me to be a
complete reason to drop out of the
college I don't think so I'm a good
person of answering this now let me tell
you why you are asking me now it might
be a little bit harsh but you are
looking up for some person who you can
blame up when you're dropping up the
college and you're not getting a success
there oh there might this might be one
of the reasons now let's be honest in
here because what I want to do is take
the decision from your heart your cold
heart is it really good for you to drop
out of the college or not now you should
be completely responsible for this kind
of big decision you you should be there
not anybody else not a random guy from
the youtubes not a random guy on the
street not a teacher not a student even
not should not should be your family
members it should be soul and soul
decision of your own whether you should
be dropping out or not
now trust me just thinking one side that
hey this is completely too much hard I'm
going to quit I'm going to drop out is
easy it's always easy but you can choose
to do both your you choose some time you
just choose that I'm going to be facing
all the difficulties in the college as
well as will be learning the programming
you can be the other guy who says I'm
going to be dropping it showing high
discipline in my life and I'm going to
be learning programming on my own so it
can be any of you but all I'm saying is
don't take my words in here don't take
any French word there because this is
the kind of a big decision you have to
make quitting college is not easy you
see a lot of famous persons like heavy
influencers do good work they're
dropping out of the college and building
up a Facebook but it shouldn't be like
that because you see those success
stories what you don't see is a lot of
stories which
even get anywhere because they have
brought up the college and are getting
nowhere
but this doesn't means I'm saying don't
drop out okay you are welcome to drop
out you are welcome to not to drop out
but this should be solely your decision
not influenced by me not instance where
your family members not influenced by
your friends this is completely your
thing on top of that I would like to
also say that okay really this part is
done so he can go zoom back in here now
one more thing that I would like to say
in here is that if you're trying to get
this kind of decision one thing one
simple thing you should always keep in
mind there should be no regret after
that once you have decided I'm going to
be dropping out and learning things on
my own okay do that but don't trigger it
anytime soon because this is the time
you won't be getting back time is
something which which nobody gets back
so make sure you understand that you
don't regret it
there might be situations in your life
after this also where you will be trying
that should I quit this job start my own
business or maybe should I switch my job
from this company to that bad company
these these are very very personal
decisions you should be making this
decision not not from an advice from a
random guy on the youtubes I know I may
do this some of the subscribers by
saying this but I don't I don't care for
that because all I want all I care about
this channel is the truth and what I
really think about it I may be thinking
wrong I may be because I'm the god in
here I may be wrong completely but what
I think is this is your personal
decision think a lot about it think a
lot what you will be missing think a lot
about what you'll be gaining by dropping
out of college and trust me you might
want to think about it one more month if
you're still think that I can be
disciplined in my life can learn all the
things on my own and can just do fine
then drop out early and think about it
it's really a decision that needs a lot
of thought a lot of talk in here I may
be making up a few videos more on this
subject because this isn't sensitive
issue right now a lot of people want to
drop out of the college because they
think that college education is not
getting them anywhere
not at all fruitful but this is a very
sensitive topic that we need to talk
about quite a lot in here but right now
all I'm saying is don't make a coin toss
decision it's your personal decision
take a lot of research in it and you
should be only solely responsible for
taking this decision okay I hope you
