really want to say thank you all of you
from my core of my heart you have been
drilling an amazing audience and you
have shown a lot of trust in me
I know while watching your favorite
YouTube videos one day you just stumble
upon me while searching for your
favorite programming topics or anything
you just stumble upon me and you stopped
right there you started to watch my
videos and you showed a lot of trust in
me eventually with the time you hit that
subscribe button and say yes this is the
guy who can really makes a difference we
can teach me something this is a big big
thing for me you showed a trust in me
Trust is the most important part of any
business any YouTube channel or in fact
anything in life and this is something
that you have given to me trust showing
so much of the trust and believing on a
random guy who you have found on the
YouTube making videos in a single room
with just this camera and believing on
him
is a big deal yet you have taken that
leap of faith and you have trusted on me
in this entire year the stats
has been insanely growing like anything
in this world every single month I'm
getting 500,000 views means 500,000
people are listening to what I am saying
100,000 subscribers countless minute
watched countless email that arrives in
my inbox countless of students who are
able to finally make through their dream
some are now proudly a web developer
some of them are now proudly an Android
developer or iOS developer making a big
difference in their life I was able to
present the tech in such a meaningful
way that nobody else was doing I was
able to present programming with such an
enthusiasm that everybody is interested
in learning programming and this
couldn't have been possible without you
without the visitors nobody can give a
performance without the audience and yes
I was lucky enough that you have chosen
me that yes this man can deliver
this man can teach us programming in
such a spiritual manner that we can
rethink about what programming actually
is and can get excited about it this
enthusiasm this feeling about
programming I was not able to give on
Facebook on Twitter on Kira because
these are just texts yes I can do images
but these are not the platform where I
can show this kind of motivation this
kind of my expressions my feeling
towards programming and I'm really
thankful for YouTube that I was able to
do it at first reaching the 100k was not
that easy even making a single video was
thought not that easy I was afraid of
cameras I didn't knew how to handle the
cameras the amazing quality of audio and
video that you see right now was not at
all possible when I started my YouTube
everything was going wrong completely
wrong I was afraid of camera I was
afraid of speaking in front of camera
yes I have given a hundreds and hundreds
of seminars before that but speaking
just alone in a room in front of a
camera was even tougher for me but just
believe in one thought that yes version
one is bad it's ugly it's not gonna work
out and keeping in a faith that yes I
will be able to do it in the future I
will get success in there just keep
going and this single thought has made
me to be standing at a position where I
can say proudly that we are now a family
of hundred K programmers people who
don't want to watch entertainment at
least on this channel just want to learn
something want to make their life better
want to serve something want to get a
better position in their life want to
earn great amount of money with their
programming skills all with the hard
work no shortcut at all and we are now
this kind of quality family here with
100k here yes I know we will be going
really far in the future but right now
this is a moment of pride for me some of
you are with me in this journey when I
was only at 5k or 3k on this subscriber
list growing on and I'm really proud
that a lot of you have emailed me or
inbox me that hey we have been with you
from 3k or 5k and now we are a full
fledged programmer working in this
company or working on our own project
this is something that is really an
amazing feeling for me I cannot really
show you how how really great I feel
that yes I was able to change a life of
people they are now earning something
better what they deserve they have
worked really hard I have worked hard
and together we are changing the life of
people life of you a lot of people think
that reaching 200k is tough but yes
everybody can do that and some people
really think that in order to reach 100k
we either need one great amazing DSLR
camera or maybe a lot of cameras for
different angle shot a lot of iPads
iPhone to record from them maybe one
great piece of glass we call it as lense
or maybe a lot of lenses maybe a great
quality mic maybe a lot of great quality
mics but end of the day everything
whether that's a programming that
Android thing that iOS thing or maybe
recording a lot of YouTube videos it
breaks down to three simple things
number one content quality whether you
are writing a code or maybe you're
recording a YouTube videos the one thing
that you should be aware of is Kuantan
quality it should serve people if you
are entertaining people it should really
entertain people are not here to watch
just anything that you are uploading
people are here to watch that as
something great maybe it is about
entertainment they want to see great
amazing quality of entertainment if they
want to see the tech they really want to
see the amazing tech maybe they want to
get inspired they really want to get
inspired so don't just upload anything
any random tech news that you came upon
just research about it and upload the
best quality of the content that you can
have if you don't have just don't upload
second thing consistency this is the
toughest of anything and everything that
you can ever face in life whether that's
the heading to the gym learning
programming or making YouTube videos
consistency is the key element I know
it's not easy to be consistent to record
videos every day or maybe every week or
to write code every single day but if
you really want to get success in life
consistency is the most biggest player
in life you'll ever face it's not easy I
really can understand because I haven't
been that much consistent
YouTube still I take a lot of amount of
my life to just dedicate for the YouTube
and rest of the other stuff still
consistency is the most important key
even I have haven't mastered it yet
but I'm trying my best so that I can
improve it as we go together but again
consistency is the most important killer
element third and the most important
thing that you always in always and
always have to keep in mind especially
if you are living in India don't think
about what people are gonna say people
have their own views and yes they have
their right to have their own views
people are gonna say programming is
having no future because he is coming
people will say driving has no future
because uber has came upon people will
say see has no future people will say
Java has no future people will say
python has no future but you don't have
to listen to them you have to judge it
by yourself that what is really good for
you is it going to have future or not
don't listen to them what they say
people are gonna say things about your
very first code will say this is boring
this is bad and you should stop doing
that don't listen to them just do really
what you are passionate about when I
started my YouTube my very first video
got a lot of hate comments saying that
you should stop really doing this
YouTube thing you don't have any camera
knowledge you don't have anything so you
should stop really doing that if I would
have listened to them dissertation that
you are seeing you are loving every
single moment wouldn't have been here
and I wouldn't have got this amazing
love of a hundred thousand people so
don't listen to the people just do
whatever really want to do there is no
age there is no education barrier of
really what you want to do I have seen
people from construction worker that are
doing amazing in programming I have seen
people who have absolutely zero camera
knowledge never have gone to the film
school and are now considered as one of
the greatest filmmakers in the entire
world there is no age barrier at any
given time at any given age in life you
can learn really the things that you
really want to learn
I have even trained personally to the
students who were like 53 in the age and
now they have their iOS app
in the store and I have also trained
people who were just like 1670 and
finally they are having their Android
app in the store this is just a bare
minimum example I can give you age is
not a barrier education is not a barrier
the barrier is just you so make sure you
don't listen to anybody and just keep on
going at first I thought while making
this 100k video I'll show off some of my
party photos of some of my party videos
and everything like that then I thought
that no I should actually include some
of the photos and videos from my travels
and makes in a amazing story about that
and something like that but then I
realized that I should do one best thing
that I would love to do talking to you
people directly and this is one thing
that gives me immense pleasure this is
like a therapy to me I really feel that
just in front of me all of you are
sitting and I can talk directly to you
this is the most valuable thing that I
can do so instead of doing all of that I
thought that let's make a one-on-one
video between just you and me and
talking directly that how and what it
takes to reach 100k in life nothing is
easy nothing is being served that easily
to you but it's really that kind of
people who get success are the ones who
are not ready to stop I have seen people
who have stopped learning Android just
because they were not able to install
Android studio I have seen people who
are not able to learn front-end
development or maybe any kind of web
development because they are not able to
resolve a simple CSS kind of issues
these people are never kind of as
successful but yes it takes that moment
that step that I will overcome off this
fear I'll overcome up this error this is
what makes all of us great and
successful I know this has been a long
video but really I had so much to say in
my heart for this 108 trust that you
have shown in me but with this I would
say that's it for this video and yes
I'll keep going with your trust that you
have shown in me I'll prepare more
awesome quality videos more awesome
content and more valuable content that
will help you to get more success in
life this is something that I take oath
here right now and yeah
in the future you will see same kind of
consistency you will be connected to me
just like you have been and this is all
going to go really really far and yes
this is just a start right now we are on
a right track right now and we are gonna
go really really far from this so that's
it for this video and you know what I'm
about to say I'll surely catch you up
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
