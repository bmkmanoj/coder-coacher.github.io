super excited today just usually with
all the videos and super excited but do
they have a different reason to be more
excited I just finished my video
training so a lot of you guys don't know
about it but from the last 15 or to be
precise 18 days I was taking a training
from a very big youtuber and he is giant
in terms of subscribers and everything
and he was taking one of my course for
iOS development and he was trying to
make an appt for himself and we had a
little bit chit chat and find out hate
that's a big name that's a big guy on
the YouTube and he agreed to give me a
personalized training ask us finished
all the sessions that he wanted to take
me and now I'm completely ready to make
some more changes in my setup I've
learned about lightning to the audio
equipment the editing and everything so
definitely you'll be seeing much more
videos on the YouTube which are far most
fun and within this video you might have
already noticed the amount of editing's
that I'm doing or the amount of change
that I'm making in this video so a lot
of things are coming up and I'm
completely ready to go on the YouTube
now on to another side note I just love
the YouTube I always hated that why I
even why I actually didn't started it
earlier it would have been much more
better and personally I I think that if
you rag the social media like Twitter
Facebook and everything on one two and
three place I would ran by YouTube on
the place number one it's so much
connected it's so much kind of a point
that it makes between the viewers and
the creators who is uploading the
content and just like that and secondly
I'll run for the Facebook food is not on
my list I just check month the Twitter
and post the videos there but apart from
that I am never active on the YouTube is
in fact I haven't checked my youtube
account from last four months or three
months I no idea but I haven't checked
that so definitely i'll be editing a lot
of videos i will be making a lot of fun
cool stuff because I've learned a lot
and when you learn from this operated
youtubers and that to personalize your
excitement level is stopped on to
that but with that I'll come back with
another much more fruitful video this
was just a quick update what I'm doing
and what you can expect in the later on
videos of course we are going to be
focusing lot more on the thought velox
and these are not just basically video
loads what I'm doing entire day these
are just thought locks or things comes
on my mind all I have to discuss some
emails video so and thank you so much
for the love on the last video if you
haven't gear checked check out my last
video about CODIS not quit and its
really awesome so check it out and I'll
catch you up into the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
