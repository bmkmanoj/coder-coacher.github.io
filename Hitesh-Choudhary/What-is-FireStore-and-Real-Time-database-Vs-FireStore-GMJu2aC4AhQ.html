another video in this video I want to
talk about firestorm now if you have
been following the Google blogs recently
there was a recent announcement by the
firebase team about the firestore now I
have been in touch with a Google team
with this project the firestore for
quite a while now and now since they
have officially released the beta
version I can actually officially talk
about this project now trust me I have
been using this project for a while now
and it's amazing in this video I'll be
talking about what is firestorm and in
case you are being aware with the
firebase obviously the next question is
what is the difference between file
store and firebase and obviously the
third question comes up should I be
using the firebase or the file store all
of this coming up in this video
okay so before we start talking about
the firestore I would like to say that I
was really excited about this project
and I have been using this not in a very
big scale project or something but I
have created some of the to do things
kind of apps in fire store and I
absolutely loved it the way how this
project has scaled up in front of my
eyes is amazing and the team is
remarkably hard-working they are fixing
of all these issues and everything so I
can honestly say that this project has
got great potential and I was kind of a
dying to talk in front of camera with
you all of YouTube guys for this project
but I couldn't actually but now since
its officially released I can actually
talk about all of this and I'm so
excited about this so first let's talk
about what is fire store so fire stores
is the Google's mu database it's a no
SQL database and it's amazing it's fast
it's more intuitive and the best part is
you can now make queries with the
database now in case you have been aware
with the firebase firebase was amazing
real-time database but there were some
limitations with that database it was
amazing real-time but you can either
sort or can filter in that database but
all these kind of a drawbacks which were
there in the firebase real-time database
now has been overcome into the fire
store now in the fire store you can
chain up your queries or tanks and all
kinds of queries that you can do in the
no SQL database also this new database
is much more faster it can perform all
the queries and as well it is more
scalable as compared to the real time
database now there are lots of advanced
features in the fire store and it is one
of my favorite the reason being it's my
favorite is because of just one reason
that is ability to make queries and
aren't just queries to fetch a lot of
data as to online or from the offline
state this is amazing thing and one of
the very advanced thing now honestly if
you have ever worked on the firebase it
is amazing first of all but the way how
it stores all of your data and the way
how you fetches all of the data is
actually a little bit tricky because it
just stores everything as a big JSON
object and that's it you have to just
dig around
you have to use it somewhat like an API
and it is not much you can do and the
problem comes up when the database
actually populates quite a lot and there
is a lot of data and some of that
situation you obviously want somebody
who can actually query to your data and
fetch up only those results which you
are interested in but there was no such
thing as making up these good queries in
the real time database
so all that drawbacks is now gone and in
the file store you will be able to make
queries but this is not all about it
firebase and file stores have a complete
set of lists on which you can compare
all of them if you will compare the
first or firebase real time database as
well as files their database as point of
view of data model both are really
simple both are storing the things as a
big JSON file but the things actually
get complex in the real time database
when things are getting complex or
hierarchical in that situation the file
store is having an advantage because you
have ability to query the things and
things become simpler in there for a
small scale project both are completely
ok one major thing that is going to
impress you a lot is let's compare it
again with the real time database in the
real time database there was there some
what kind of an offline support for
Android as well as iOS but in the fire
store you get a complete support of
offline access and offline management
data capabilities for Android iOS as
well as for web that means you can
design your progressive web apps quite
easily using the fire store one more
thing that I liked so much about the
fire stories in the firebase real time
database you have to perform all of your
write operation in just single query or
just kind of a single thread is kind of
a situation but in the fire store you
can actually make them as a batch
process so that you can collect all of
your data which you need to write in the
database and can just process them as a
batch operation this itself is a long
lifesaver also in the firebase real time
database whenever you are doing any
transaction you need to write a callback
function if you remember that but in the
file store you don't need to write a
callback it will automatically be
repeated until the transaction is
complete one major big
here now scalability was a little bit
issue not much I would say that but if
you are a big organization obviously one
thing that have starved you of using the
firebase in the past was it's a ability
to scale the data like obviously the
hundred thousand concurrent connections
and a huge speed to write the data is
really good in the firebase database but
when your data actually grows you mungus
Lee grown just like anything there your
database is not that much scalable you
have to shred your data across multiple
databases so that you can do a
scalability thing but in the firestore
they are promising that this is not
going to be situation no matter how big
your database is going to be it will be
completely scalable in the file store
now trust me that's a big promise I
would be really looking forward for that
beta if it is able to handle that if
that is the case this is going to be an
ultimate solution for a lot of big scale
industries now comes up the ultimate
question should you be using the first
store or the firebase real time database
now as of now October 2017 remember the
date because you'll be watching this
video in the future as well
October 2017 as of now I would recommend
to go with the firebase real time
database because the firestore is still
in early beta stage and I'm not a big
fan of using the beta things in a
production it might break a little bit
here and there and there might be some
time in fixing that up and making that
up and running again so I would
recommend to go ahead and stick to the
firebase real time database as of now
again October 2017 but I can see some
kind of a big future for this far store
database and obviously I will be keep
posting you updating about such kind of
database as it evolves in the future and
obviously we'll be seeing a couple of
videos of up and running with the far
store making a simple chat apps using
file store and all kind of a basic stuff
on this channel now I really don't want
to touch on this subject but yes pricing
is an issue for real-time database as
well as file store as well for the
business user who are having not much of
the clients or connections obviously can
use the free tier of both the versions
but there is a significant pricing point
therefore the real-time database as well
as on the file store in the real-time
database you are being charged for the
bandwidth as well as how many how much
data you are going to store in that so
there is no such thing as write and read
operations that you are performing but
since the file store is a new SQL
database they are charging based on your
write and read operations that you are
performing on the data bases of course
most of the other competitors of the
firestore are also doing same kind of
pricing things so there is not much to
differ and again I would not like to go
into the pricing issues because it's
kind of a budget thing for different
companies they can afford it or not so
that's a completely different scenario
and I would not like to touch much on
that now just onto a side note I have
seen that the team is really hard
working on the firebase file store side
I've been working with them there has
been a lot of discussion about this
product and all of the community is
really supportive so I would say that at
least go ahead and try this out you will
surely love this product and this is
just a personal opinion let me know what
are your opinion about the firestore a
recent release and also I would be
mentioning the official blog in the
description section below and as well as
on the screen as well so make sure you
read out and check out the blog and at
least check out the documentation it's
always a good idea to be updated what's
recently has launched on the Internet
and the technology world and I'll be
keeping more such videos to get you
updated about the recent releases of
such technologies if you have enjoyed
