with another video and in today's video
we're going to talk about Android
development versus iOS development now I
know hearing with this a lot of people
just don't want to wish or watch this
video and jump want to jump directly
into the comment section to fight about
iOS is better than Android or Android is
better than iOS no this is not a video
for that I know this is a little bit
controversial thing but I know you are a
fan of either one of them but in this
video we will rather focus on which one
is easier to learn what are the hurdles
for the other ones what are the pros and
cons of Android and iOS and what you
should be looking up whenever you are
learning Android development or iOS
development are things related to that
like hardware specification software
requirement the fees to upload your app
into the store and a lot of such thing
so let's discuss all about them
but first let's roll that intro
now I have categorized this video into a
couple of specific section where we talk
about a different topic in each section
so let's get started and talk about the
Android and iOS development learning
phase now the very first thing is the
hardware requirement now depending on in
which country you are the hardware
requirement are little bit obvious to
have or not so obvious to have because
in countries like India the Windows is
kind of a dominating operating system
rather than in the United States where
Mac is rather a little bit more
dominating operating system so for the
people in the United States it's really
common to learn iOS development rather
than in countries like in India we're
learning the Android development is much
more common because the hardware is far
more accessible now I do agree that Mac
hardware is little bit expensive
compared to the windows hardware but
again when you add up the cost of buying
a good Windows hardware with a good
amount of RAM and good your cost of your
Windows 10 and some microsoft suit it
almost adds up if you go like that but
again no problem with that so the very
first hardware hurdle is for the Mac or
iOS development you need to have a Mac
it might be an iMac or maybe Mac Mini or
MacBook Pro macbook air anything but you
need definitely need and hardware that
is Apple oriented but for the Android
development you can get started with any
kind of hardware whether it's a Mac
Windows Linux or whatever operating
system you are using so I would give a
thumbs up to the Android in this section
because it's far more easier to get that
now let's come on to the next section
which is specific hardware upgradation
now luckily in case or the Android
development of if you have bought your
hardware within a couple of years we are
really ready and good to go for the
Android development because I highly
recommend that whenever you are getting
started with Android development go for
at least eight gigs of ram and maybe a
little bit latest processor in your
computer or laptop and chances are high
if you have purchased your laptop within
a recent couple of years we are really
good to go on the other hand if you are
already on the iOS they really do
produce good machines and if you have
purchased your Mac's and recent three or
four years or maybe at least four five
years if it is getting the latest update
from the Apple Store about the OS then
you are very good to go so that is all
sorted out now the next thing comes up
is the licensing and I do have a lot of
issues in point in the licensing issue
here maybe you might not get agree with
my point of views but I have to state
this so the licensing issues with the
iOS and Android is completely different
for the iOS it's $99 a year
yes that's kind of a subscription that
you have to pay to upload your app in
the App Store on the other hand the
Android is far more cheap that's almost
$30 and that's a lifetime access to
upload the any apps that you want to
have in the Google Play Store but what I
want to say here is this is actually bad
Apple is charging $99 that is a little
bit overpriced but we will talk about
that in a second but the Google what the
Google is doing by taking just $30 and
uploading n number of app is actually a
little bit bad that I have filled
somewhere why because let us say Apple
is taking just $30 he should charge that
$30 over every year because this reduces
the amount of crappy app that is on the
App Store but Google is all about
numbers now because obviously it has to
compete with the Apple App Store and
that is having all those joint number of
apps so what Google is trying to do it
he is just saying hey pay me this amount
of fees
kind of formality and just keep
uploading this results in ending up a
lot of clones of apps a lot of crappy
apps because it's not very pricey and a
lot of people are just pushing out those
crappy apps these can be reduced by
charging overly fees but again as a
business perspective it's rather far
more easier to pay $50 $30 as compared
to $99 every year now with this $99 the
user are only updating their licensing
if their app is doing pretty good and
this makes that the app market is far
more filtered in the App Store Apple App
Store now also when you submit your app
it takes a little bit more time in the
Apple App Store now recently in the WWDC
they have said that we are reducing that
time but again they are far more strict
in the app development they look out for
all the memory leaks and all those
things graphics they're pixel by pixel
points and everything so chances are
high that your app will get selected
quite pretty easily in the Google Play
Store as compared to the Apple App Store
but that is actually a good thing in the
Apple App Store because your app would
be far more refined and far more device
as compared to the Google Play Store
which is just directly accepting the app
so for me I would say it's the thumbs up
for the Apple because they are far more
strict in accepting the app and in
renovating the license on a monthly
basis but I know a lot of people will
just say that Android should get a
thumbs up because it's very less fees
and it's far more easy easy means more
crappy apps in the Google Play Store now
next up comes up is the IDE or
integrated development environment
now when you write code for iOS you use
Xcode and when you write code for
Android you use Android studio now
somehow I have felt that the Xcode is
far more dominating with the Android
studio yes things have changed quite a
lot in the Android studio version 3 and
I'm really happy that now you don't have
to use third-party software's like
genymotion
to speed up your performance of the
emulator in the end right now the
default emulator is far more better than
the previous version one of the Android
studio but hey everybody when they get
upgrades they get better and on the
other hand Xcode is far more mature
software because it it has seen actually
quite a lot of phases of development so
I would say that working on the Xcode is
far more easier and less buggy as
compared to the Android studio but again
I would not give so much of the credit
to the Apple because Xcode is on almost
on the version 9 so it has been more
revised more refined as compared to the
Android studio it's far more new but
still it's doing good now one thing that
I like about the Android studio is the
layout options arranging the things and
layout is far more easier in the Android
as compared to Xcode they still are
struggling with those linear layouts and
of these compound layouts but apart from
this the left Bucky and all these things
I would say Apple is actually dominating
here but only with the version 3 of the
Android it is doing so good and they
have fixed almost the bugs of laggy
emulators and everything so I would say
in this case the Google gets the thumbs
up here because in just version 3 he is
doing so good and so great as compared
to the Xcode but again there is no match
for Xcode because it's just awesome
so yeah both expecially both gets the
thumbs up here because both are awesome
but somehow again Xcode is little bit
far mature and enriched should you have
to do a little bit tweaking much more
but I'm really happy about the
genymotion thing that you don't have to
install now genymotion if
just work on the emulator it works
really fine now again let's come on to
the clumsy code now I'm a big fan of
writing clean codes and if I compare
writing the codes in Java versus writing
code in Swift I would say writing code
in Java is far more verbose everything
is just displayed in front of you there
are so many semicolon so many curly
braces
some people feel this is good but I
prefer writer rather lightly writing the
code in Python style no semicolons
indentation matters the lot and no curly
braces and all these things so I prefer
swift style of writing code in that case
so I just a personal preference you
cannot just say one gets a thumbs up one
gets a thumbs down because it does the
person's preference so I won't giving a
voting for this kind of thing but for
personally for me I prefer less clumsy
code or less verbose code in this case
so I would prefer Swift but again a job
is also a good language in writing the
code but the verbose nests of the Java
is something that I'm not a big fan now
next come up is the learning about
now obviously are looking up to learn
some of the boot camps and iOS and some
of the boot camps in the Android so I
would say the iOS boot camps are far
more expensive as compared to the
Android boot camps now is boot camp I
have taken those boot camps offline as
well usually cost like $1,000 to one
student and in the iOS boot camp I have
seen usually 20 students or 15 students
so thousand dollars is a pretty big
amount it usually goes maybe half than
that like $1,200 or $1,400 for an
offline boot camp and I'm talking about
the professional boot camp that actually
delivers three or five or maybe send
apps in those twenty days or 30 days of
the practical scenario it's not just
like a training institute where you just
go and just learn things in a two month
and you don't even get the app at the
end of that training it's like a
rigorous boot camp the quality ones they
actually cost in the iOS like 1,200 to
$1,400 ish and if in if I talked about
that in India the prices are almost same
they cost around 40,000 to 45,000 -
there is development professional ones
while on the other hand if you talk
about for the Android development they
are little bit cheap but not so much II
because if you're looking for a quality
boot camp that actually talks about
firebase layouts and deliver 3 to 5 apps
they usually cause like 20,000 to 25,000
ish prices may vary depends on the
quality of the training but again I am
talking about the special quality boot
camps not just any training
so yes comparing to the thousand are
dollars to just $400 or $500 is far more
difference here so for a big mess it is
easier to go into the Android because
it's little bit cheaper for the quality
training
one more topic is user-based now
obviously if you're learning Android or
ayah it's just not like you are learning
madly anything you want to have some
goals in mind look like whether I want
to get a job or I have an app app idea
in my mind that I want to present to the
user base so it always needs to be clear
of that what is your target audience
because if your app is far more like
oriented towards the United States
audience obviously you might want to get
with iOS development and not with the
Android Android users are far less in
the United States on the other hand if
you compare that to India you might want
to get started with Android development
because Android base is quite heavy in
India and other continents nearby to
India but iOS is getting popularity now
but still the user base of iOS is far
more less so depending on where your
user base is you might want to launch
that app now one more thing that you
have to add up here is when you want to
get started with iOS apps here on
Android app make sure you do understand
that the purchasing user base the user
who actually purchase your app is much
more in the iOS and compared to the
Android so if you're looking up to make
money that people buy some features of
your app or even buy your apps you might
want to go into the iOS development
because I have seen this and this is
actually a true graph look up at any
website you'll find that users actually
buy more on the iOS as compared to the
Android Android users are motivating for
the free apps so this is a big decision
you have to make while learning and if
you're learning just for the job
perspective that I want to work for a
company then again you have to look up
what company you want to go up if your
company is based in the United States
and you want to go there obviously iOS
would be the choice but if you are
looking for the company in India that
want to work here and want to work for
such company who is targeted in India
then obviously Android would be your
choice it's a big decision so take out
some time and try to decide which one
you want to go
okay so this was a very thorough
discussion about what you need to have
what you don't need to have and again
these are just my personal thought what
I think is happening around the industry
and what is what should be a very user
should be aware of these situations so
these are just a personal thought and in
case you think that I've missed some
particular topic in which the comparison
should have been made definitely we can
roll out the version 2 of this
particular video but I think this video
would be really super helpful for
everybody to understand the difference
before jumping into the iOS and Android
development and definitely we do have
courses on both the iOS and Android
check out the link in the description
below and I can definitely help you out
with affordable and quality trainings in
both of them and again definitely very
soon we are starting some offline boot
camps again this is the time when again
I start with offline boot camp and
definitely you will be getting all the
information in the mail and very soon
we'll be hosting those boot camps all
around the globe so wherever you are
residing any part of the world there are
high chances that we will be hosting a
boot camp
maybe nearby in your country so with
this I would say drop down your comments
in the comment section below if I have
missed out any particular topic do let
me know and I'll surely read those
comments and we'll answer them with this
I would say hey sunday is very near by
and catch you up in the sunday lights
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
