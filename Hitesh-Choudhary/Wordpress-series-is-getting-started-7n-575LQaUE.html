with another video and I have an
exciting update for you on this channel
right from here we are starting a series
on wordpress.com now this is not going
to be a small series like with the 10 or
15 videos this is going to be a very
more comprehensive series on WordPress
in this entire comprehensive series I'll
be walking you through with what is
WordPress how you can utilize the
WordPress and even I'll be also talking
about how you can utilize the WordPress
scale and your web development scale in
freelancing and how you can get projects
with the freelancing websites WordPress
looks really simple because you are
already using websites like Facebook and
Twitter and you're already managing your
content like your post and your images
but don't be mistaken here WordPress is
very more comprehensive than it looks
like at first Bignell thinks that
WordPress is so easy and I'm gonna do it
just like that but it's not that simple
but don't worry in this entire series
I'll walk you through with each and
every step necessary to start a
WordPress website not a blog entire
website and I'll walk you through with
the ins and outs of how you can deal up
with a wordpress website we'll be moving
into a very more comprehensive situation
of the WordPress starting from the local
host environment where we are going to
install the WordPress on our local
system further as the course progress
we'll learn about what are the blogs
post how to manage your content
important plugins what are plugins and
how you can set up an entire WordPress
website once we are done with that we
are going to move further and we are
going to learn how you can install and
run a WordPress on to a domain I'll also
give you some of the suggestions based
on what are the good hosting platforms
and how to buy domains and pretty much
everything that you need for a WordPress
website I would also like to mention
here that what kind of skills you should
already have to get started with this
course now I will be posting three to
four videos every single week so that
you can follow me along with the making
of this entire course but there are some
prerequisite or essential skills that
you should have while getting started
with the WordPress now WordPress is for
anyone and everyone now since you are
already aware how to manage your data
post and images on a web sites like
WordPress and Twitter you can already
get started with the WordPress basic
knowledge is okay
but it's not going to take you very far
WordPress is a content management system
and end of the day I expect that you
should have some basic knowledge of web
development now although you will be
able to do really fine and just ok with
the basic level of skills without any
web development skill but you there are
some points and there will be some
situations where you need to change some
fonts where you need to change some CSS
and in case you don't know how to change
the background color or the text color
or how to pick up even the CSS it's
going to be a tough situation for you
now being this is a programming channel
I don't expect you to just host a
website and the default theme and dad
said no eventually the time will come up
then when we'll be learning how we can
edit those templates and can modify
these existing templates into the
situation where it needs and it fits
best for us so I would recommend you to
get started first of all with a complete
front-end developer course available at
learned code online but it's not
compulsory you can just follow me along
here and can see where you can go along
with me with that number of skills but
again I would highly recommend to
directly not get started with the
WordPress first get started with a
complete front-end developer course now
just with a complete front-end developer
course you will be able to run for
almost let's just say 70 to 75 percent
of the course but eventually the time
will come where we'll be learning more
modern and more advanced stuff things
like how we can design our own widgets
now just onto a sidebar let me remind
you that we are learning all these
skills to make sure that we can serve
somebody and we can earn some money by
offering our skill as a services
now obviously the client is not going to
pay you just to install WordPress or set
up a website even if he is paying it's
not a high pay it's just around $100 to
$200 and dad said eventually the client
will come to you and will ask for the
customization of WordPress and maybe
wants to design a special plugin for you
now in most of the cases the plugins are
already being designed being an
open-source community most of the
plugins are already there but the high
payment comes up when the situation
comes up and client is not able to find
any such plug-in and you have to design
that plug-in on your own designing for
that plug-in comes up with PHP so yes
you should have a PHP knowledge as
well now luckily if you want to move in
that advanced part of the WordPress I
would recommend you to get started with
the PHP and luckily we have got a PHP
codes that learned code online dot in as
well now just onto a side note if you
don't want to take these skills like
complete front-end developer and PHP
you'll be still able to follow me along
in this course this is an exciting
entire series that you are going to
enjoy quite a lot so I would say just
get started with along with me in this
series and later on you can decide on
yourself that whether you really want
these skills or not I would highly
recommend to follow me along in this
entire series I would be uploading three
to four videos every week so that you
can follow me along now whatever you are
learning whether that's an Android PHP
maybe Python maybe machine learning
whatever you are learning just keep
going on with that you just have to
follow me along in this channel and I'll
be uploading those videos and just by
spending 30 minutes a week you'll be
able to learn another skills just
side-by-side WordPress is an amazing
content management system and from the
next video we are going to get started
about what is WordPress why you should
be using it why you should not be using
it and all the such details and
technical installation and all such
setups regarding the WordPress now the
important part if you want to get all
the updates and notification whenever I
am uploading the videos make sure you do
hit that subscribe button and the Bell I
can nearby that will give you a
notification as soon as I upload any
videos so with this without any further
delay let's get started and wait for the
new video coming up on WordPress series
I'm really excited to start this series
video and let's get going
just one more thing don't forget to
share this video along with your friends

and I just love doing it I love to teach
on YouTube and this is the first series
that you are seeing me on the go that we
are preparing together so make sure you
