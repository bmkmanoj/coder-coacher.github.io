Android training now let's get started
with the basics and we are all at the
same page understood here windows/mac
guy no problem at all now you'll
probably get started with a plain slate
there my in mine one is saying a little
bit some things here but don't worry
this is one of the old project that is
showing up there and yours will be
completely new so I'm not going to touch
it I'm not going to be touching this
I'll just create a new folder on my
desktop and I will be simply calling
this as Android exercise and oops I'm
just typing everything here that was not
meant there and I was just going there
and hopefully it will allow me to type
so Android training you'll be finding
everything there will very soon upload
this onto the github so that you can
find them out all of the projects okay
so now let's just keep it there and
let's start a new project now before I
would like to make sure that you
understand this is going to be a little
bit long movie because we have to
explore Android studio we'll create our
first hello world as well as we will
create our Android virtual device there
so let's just call this project as
simply a test make sure that the first
letter is capital otherwise it's going
to yell at you and say the application
name for most application begins with an
uppercase I know that and we'll start
with the test there now the next one is
the company domain it is usually there
to make sure that your package name is
unique and it doesn't conflict with
other packages name all kind of the same
project that you are doing like for
example there are hundreds of to-do
lists there on the Play Store there so
make sure that you name it uniquely in
case you don't have any company domain
up right now it's not going to bother us
much so we can just leave it that an
example dot-com but in case you have
your website then it's really great it's
awesome just put it there in the reverse
order there now we don't want any
project to include C++ right now it's
completely okay now it's asking me to
put everything onto a location and you
can click on the three dots there and
these will allow you to simply just
place your project anywhere you want
I want my project to be on the desktop
in the desktop I'll go for Android
training and this is where I want to put
the file in there so click on OK and
there we go looks nice everything looks
cool to me I'll click on the next and
now here comes the big decision point
now this decision will decide that how
many devices you are allowing to use
your app now right now it's saying
Android Ice Cream Sandwich which is
running almost ninety 7.4 percent of the
devices so this is the backward
compatibility vs saying that hey any
device which is running even the Ice
Cream Sandwich
will be allowed to just download my app
now obviously you can go for the latest
one the marshmallow and the nougat which
is recently out there and there but you
can see your app will run on less than
1% of the devices which is we don't want
that we don't want to do that so you can
go with a little bit like Ice Cream
Sandwich it doesn't really matter as of
now because most of the thing that we'll
be doing in the starting of the project
we'll be working on even on the Ice
Cream Sandwich or maybe the jellybean or
whatever you like to have in this case
so yes you can choose the Nugget there
but right now we are completely ready
and happy with the defaults there ok
so rest of things are really good ok let
me choose the lollipop there if it is
there you can go with that but again
reduces the number of apps so let me
just make everything back there and
let's choose Ice Cream Sandwich there
makes ninety seven point four we are
happy with that as of now later on for
sure we are going to change that and
let's click on the next now comes the
most screen which we'll be seeing quite
a lot now Android gives you a lot of
options as a start up screen definitely
you can add more and can change them on
the later on time but right now it says
hey you can choose basic activity empty
activity and activity just basically is
the screen that you see in other
programming environment you call them as
a scene it's exactly the same if you are
coming up from the
u.s. or anything else is exactly the
same right now we are going to go with
the empty activity later on for sure we
will explode like full screen activities
google map activities what are they and
how we can utilize them for sure that's
going to come up later on right now
empty activity is quite good for us
let's click on the next and there we go
now here comes the activity name and the
layout name now we don't need to touch
them as of now later on when we learn
about the Java and how we can change the
class name and everything related to
that we will surely do that right now
default is kind of a thing that we want
here and click on the finish now
obviously it's going to take a couple of
seconds depends on what kind of system
you are now it's creating a greater
project info right now just keep in mind
that yes there is a thing known as
Gradle and it is used to make some
different changes while compiling your
app later on shortly we will explode
that but right now we don't need to
touch that at all so it's opening up it
shows a startup tip at the very end it's
annoying for me so I'm going to just
uncheck that that says show tips on the
startup and I'm going to close because
it annoys me if you want tips every time
you open it up and for sure just keep it
there I will close that now this is the
first project that you'll have a yours
might be simply closed like that just
like that so there you see two folders
there the Gradle script which we won't
be touching right now as I just
mentioned and then we have an app folder
in the app folder we have a manifest XML
file for our Android app here you need
to double click that to load that file
and I'll just close that right now we
don't need it then we have got the Java
the meet part of our app and we won't be
touching the test the to test folders
there's this one and this one our main
part is going to be inside this folder
where our main activity file is placed
and this is our main activity file by
the way ok and then we have got
resources folder where we can put up our
drawable our audio if our app requires
an audio or some of the images that are
after
while another thing that is the soul is
going to go there so right now we're
going to work most of the time here and
this is the environment where we'll be
working quite a lot so this is what we
have this is the area where we have the
things there and by the way if I just go
into the layout and click on the
activity main.xml I can just load it up
there as well and you can see a lot of
things are there obviously this is a
very small tiny guy and if i zoom in
there you can see there is a hello world
barely visible there Ria's there are
things and there we have a visit library
componentry
and some of the properties being there
so if I just try to click on this hello
world you can see properties are being
loaded here this is completely changed
as of now you can also click on the vol
property and there we go a load ton of
properties are there I know this sounds
intimidating but don't worry about that
right now just follow up the two things
the first one is the plus icon there it
allows you to zoom a little bit there so
that you can see the things quite easily
there and you can just go ahead and just
go and try to fix them up there we go
quite easily movable things there and
you can just put this hand and you can
just pan it zoom it wherever you want it
looks good let's close that as of now
hey come on get out there okay there we
go
and the important part is we want to run
this hello world now but we haven't
created any AVD Android virtual device
but still I'm going to hit the run so
there we go
it says initializing but it hasn't found
any devices yet why because we haven't
created any so let's create a new
virtual device and there we go now it
will show you a ton of devices there
right now I'm going to go with the
Android s because it's a smaller one
smaller devices and I have I don't have
much of the screen real estate there so
I'll just stick with a smaller one there
of course you can choose any of them
which is bigger which one he likes and
you click on the next now I'll just run
this first one there with an X 80
six you can also go with x86 64 which is
a 64-bit architecture right now our apps
are going to be a basic one so that's
why we don't need 64-bit architecture
your is going to be saying a download
for every of these because we haven't
downloaded them yet you can just click
on the download and I agree and license
agreement and everything and make sure
that it it's gone away now once you have
downloaded that then you can click on
the next and there we go
our device name is going to be Android s
and I'll leave everything as the default
and there so things are exactly fine for
me and I'll click on the finish and now
it's going to take some time there we go
and I'll click on OK there and now here
is the bottom part is actually a kind of
a console area or terminal area where we
will be seeing all of our errors as well
as all of our messages which is working
ok so I'll just bring this guy dear oops
where is my Android device here we go
there is our Android device now my
machine is little bit fast and I have
allotted a lot of RAM to these devices
or phones that is why it's going to run
really quick not that much quick but
decently quick but in your case it's not
going to be that much quick so you have
to wait a little bit time there ok so
there we go our Android is lost really
quickly this time and I'll just large
there ok and there we go we see our tiny
hello world there no big deal no big
deal I know we have done at tons of
things there but it's completely ok that
you have run your first hello world app
and that's it that's it what we are
going to do here because I know I have
worked really smoothly in this video and
it was a little bit quick I do agree and
you're going to take a little bit while
and we'll catch up again in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
