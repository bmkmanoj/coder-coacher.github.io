the flex box training now in this video
I'll show you a couple of big issues in
the Flex box and it's due to the
container size and I can understand it
here that it's easier to show you the
things rather than just explaining them
on the go so what we're going to do is
let's just copy and paste this guy's
starting and this time we are into our
fourth part of this again this is a
container level element here so I'm
going to fire up my item which is
somewhere here and there we go let's
open up a add project folder and this is
going to be not 0 - this is going to be
0 full ok and our basic CSS is here and
should be up and running and see how
easy it is to just get this guy let me
bring this in recording area so there we
go ok now what we're going to do is
first of all let's open up our index and
by the way a few people notice that this
colors and how this is all happening
this is all happening because of the
default CSS which we don't touch much
and let's open our flex dot CSS okay let
me show you a very classic problem here
which is phased whenever you're going to
use the Flex box and let's just say
command shift D we are going to have to
and this problem usually appears when
you have a lot of elements inside your
container and I think not much even in
the six we can define this problem okay
so there we go looks pretty easy now
let's go into Flex CSS and we're going
to select a container there we go and
we're going to say hey you know what
we're going to follow a display off flex
okay it looks good now before I go and
do anything here let me give you a
border property so that you can see and
visualize what is actually happening so
again our favorite border property here
which is going to be two pixel solid
black you might be wondering that is
black your favorite color no not at all
but it's good in this case okay no
problem at all big
cause our flexbox items are actually
smaller in size or in numbers as our
container goes so far so it goes here
but the problem actually arises when I
write something here so let me have this
a lorem text and we're going to have
four words here so that's way bigger
than four and no this is not this is not
a good example command Z and let me try
in here and I'm going to write 1 1 1
this is a big number okay so just for
the case we are having four and five
okay that should work okay this is good
now we can see we have few elements here
and our container with this still a lot
longer than what our elements are and
now imagine if we shrink our container
width and we say that hey you know what
your width is going to be let's just say
600 pixels only what is going to happen
is unacceptable because now the
container is actually just 600 pixels
wide but our elements are just flowing
outside it and in that case when you're
designing something for mobile this is
this is weird because your mobile I'll
adjust of this size and elements are
going outside of it and this is a
classic problem which everybody face
when they start with the Flex box even I
did faced it and it was really really
bad
so how we can fix that and luckily for
us the fix of this guy is really simple
and for that we have a flex wrap
property and there we go flex wrap and
it has basically just three options no
wrap wrap and wrap reverse no wrap is
the default guy which does nothing in
our case but what you'll be using is
wrap most of the time because it wraps
up everything inside the container box
okay that is good and it's also a
problem so what is so special about it
by the way there is a wrapper reverse as
well wrap reverse it just talks
everything from this point so it's a
little bit weird that it starts from the
bottom left hand
side here and then just a line sit and
just like that so I don't like it I like
the rap depends what you like what you
want to do and I know it's a little bit
confusing to have a - here I'll just get
rid of that okay make sense now okay now
the problem starts here when you try to
use a lot of flex properties in
combination and that's a classic thing
that makes people go confusing here now
for example we have a like we have a lot
of properties here for example we have a
justified content and justify content if
I just do a center here now you might be
wondering that hey and this is something
that is happening because now we have
applied flexwrap which brings up all the
elements in one line if the element is
not able to shrink inside the container
it will bring it on to the next line but
a lot of people get confusion that hey
why is it not going just below the one I
want it to be below the one but it's
going in the center and that is because
you have made justify content center the
property is applied at the top guy as
well but since they are just fold here
that is why this is not being seen here
and it becomes a little bit more
confusing when you apply the properties
like which is let me just write that Lex
what are the properties you have like
start around okay space around yep this
is more confusing you might be wondering
why this is traveling here so what I
want to say here is when you mix up the
Flex box properties you have to always
sure that what each property is
affecting you - you just like the
classic CSS part here sometime it's
really confusing in the CSS that hey I
wanted to do it but sometimes it just
doesn't override the things or some
other properties conflict with what I
really want to do it's doing what is
written here which is sometime it's
really hard to judge them okay so this
is a short movie about just flexwrap
it has just three things flag rap no rap
and rap reverse lap reverse is really
bad but hey Who am I - just there so
this is what we are going to have in
this video very simple video very
classic video about the classic problem
of flex rap and
that's it for this video I'll surely
catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
