with another live video and first of all
let me know in the comment section
whether you can hear me or not as soon
as you get up there because I'm testing
a new microphone and let me know in the
comments section whether you can hear me
or not I'm looking forward for that or
shall we go back to the crappy phone
audio
oh hi Govind greetings from Kerala
greetings from Rajasthan yepper thank
you so much okay so can you hear me yes
you are audible okay thank you so much I
hope the audio is clearer than the last
time
so hey hey Roman hey don't mean how are
you are you still in Bangalore hi Sachin
hi Steve British Karthik I met a on hey
won how are you sorry for getting
confused in your name and your father's
name sorry about that high tech high
Mohawk high top a sign it is how are you
okay so let's try to pick up a few
questions yes in Bangalore I I am coming
to Bangalore just got stuck with these
Apple stuff you know launching over app
and stuff like that so finally we are
live I tried this live yesterday as well
but you know due to some issues in the
live streaming I couldn't got live
yesterday so finally glad that we didn't
missed out the sunday life and it's
awesome okay so let's get started and
talk about here okay so first of all the
updates what are going on at learned
code online and add this channel and
what we are going to be doing in the
future videos okay so do you use iMac
yes I do he use iMac okay first of all
updates I think within this week
actually it was planned to be rolled out
within the last week the Apple app app
for iPhone and iPad right now we are
having an app for Android and all these
tablets which are running Android
our plan is to actually run out the
Apple app as well but due to some issues
regarding the in-app purchases with the
Apple it has been delayed but you know
programming the synonym of the
programming is problems we do face it
all the time but obviously we are gonna
make it there with some error and there
are some adjustments and all these
things so we are gonna be doing that
very soon and the second of data is I'm
planning out some mini CD C's on let's
just say we are going to get started
with web development making some PHP
back-end and complete front-end kind of
small scale projects then projects in
Android and iOS as well projects like
designing an uber clone a whatsapp clone
and all these things will be coming up
so that's what we're gonna be doing up
very soon so these are the few quick
updates that I I wanted to share let's
pick up some questions let's pick up
this question from Shubham Kendall well
sir why re not and Cora Cora is also a
great social platform but it's really
hard for me to maintain all these social
platform along with the Android app iOS
I have website other clients projects
have to deliver the videos and a lot of
stuff so that's why I'm not on Korra and
probably I will not be getting bear very
soon I'm even not on Twitter just the
Facebook just to keep a connection with
you in case the Facebook actually
launched out something where I can post
my updates and can chat with you guys I
probably won't be seeing Facebook much
so that is why it's really hard for me
to maintain all these things
aha okay are you on medium no I do write
my own blogs at learn code online dot
and slash blog I'm not a medium because
it's just a way of writing your things
that you know whether you write in a
medium or your own blog that's totally
the same so no I'm not a medium as well
okay let's pick up more questions okay
I'm really interested in artificial
intelligence what are the basics needed
for getting started in AI
if you really want to get started with
the AI I can recommend you actually
couple of works and very soon I will be
making a videos on all the books out
there that I recommend I have read a lot
of books and including the data
structure and logarithm books a couple
of them that I have read so I'll make a
separate section where you can just find
out all the recommended books that I do
recommend I have personally read and I
do appreciate them so I will be making
sure that the section is there very soon
and also I would recommend you to get
started with either Python or R because
Python has a quite huge dominance over
this what is say the AI and the machine
learning so I would say that yes go
ahead and get started with that okay
will you come to endure in future maybe
who knows
hessen has some college or some company
invite me over there definitely I can
come up there hi from Kerala how can I
create a play publisher without
international credit card I think there
are ways through Paytm so that you can
transfer some amount in your google play
store debits I'm not pretty sure about
it but yes do you you do need a credit
card to fill up that fees which is I
think $25 or $30 not sure about it I
just paid that I still I'm not sure what
is the fees it just a $5 difference not
a big deal there so yes you do need
credit card a higher in them there how
are you okay
I know Android should I move to iOS yes
whoo yes once
definitely you should move on because
it's not like within just one domain
you're gonna do very well in the life if
you are into mobile development sector
and already have an eye android
knowledge definitely I would recommend
you to move into iOS because imagine
yourself one person is having a
knowledge of Android and iOS it's so
easy for him to get a job or it's so
easy for him to launch a product of his
own if he is pretty good in that so just
like what if he did here okay the next
question is from Jagdish sir watch which
should I learn for Android development
Java or Cortland I would say get started
with Java
build like three or four apps once you
are comfortable with that learn Kotlin
as well so start with Java and
definitely move into Catalan as well
okay what should I aim to learn in next
two years if I want to become Android
developer I think just directly get
started with Java once you are having
the basics of java like how loops
functions classes objects that's it move
into Android development because Android
development is far more beyond than the
Java development it's it's really hugely
different here both of these guys
because things that you learn in Android
development are not a part of Java it's
part of an Android like using cameras
using running how audios and videos and
designing the apps and all these units
like SPS and pixels and all these things
you learned quite a lot in in that
Android development so I would say get
started with a code job of the basic one
you know you don't need to go much into
the depth of things like out boxing and
in boxing's or maybe link list you don't
need to go in that much of the depth
just do the basics and start with
Android you will learn a lot on the go
okay why you wear gray t-shirts only ah
it has been great here for me with these
great gray t-shirts and very soon I am
planning to make a video on how ok come
on so many messages very soon I am
planning to make a video come on leave
me alone there oh my goodness so many
messages I don't know what is happening
there ok so very soon I am planning to
make a video on how was my here this
year was magical magical for me totally
only thing that I miss in this here is
my Spain trip I had to cancel it out for
you know learn code online stuff so it
has been a great here with the gray
t-shirts and I would say I'll make a
video on that ok
machine learning projects there are no
such easy projects with the machine
learning ok so please do a video on
teamcity
ok I'll try that Django or flask why I
don't use any of them so I cannot tell
you much detail about any of them
but I have heard good sorry about that I
need a little bit water
okay so Django or flask I would say a
Bevo I have heard good words about
Django I have heard no words about the
flask
neither good neither bad so I would say
start with a Django if we are looking
forward to the Python development and I
usually prefer things like either with
PHP your node or react or maybe angular
but haven't gone into the Django stuff
yet okay I have done basic Android and
kochava I am BTech third year that's
very good very good start you have
already got in the third year that you
have already done Android as well as
Java that's good
which skills should I develop in which
industry to get a job in current
scenario of IT industry please tell I
would highly recommend if you have got
your Android skills start moving into
iOS as well because when you'll be
moving into iOS or either move into
react native so that you can become a
complete package of a mobile app
developer not just an Android developer
you already know that it you have a
great chance of getting job when you are
a complete package as an Android as a
mobile app developer also I would say
that try to make some complex apps I
will try to include various such cities
where we will be designing a
full-fledged social app or maybe a
full-fledged whatsapp clone or something
like that so these are the true markers
of your skill that you can do something
with the Android or something like that
come on 19 messages all from spam
Airtel's and all these geo and all these
come on I shouldn't be using this phone
anymore
okay okay let's pick up more questions
how can I develop a web and mobile apps
such as big website like flip card
Amazon and n and Facebook which is
synced so nicely they are synced nicely
because of the database not with a
front-end in the Android web
the iOS this is all because of the
database I would say if you want to just
write one code for all of that either
choose the angular and ionic or maybe
react would be a great choice for you to
get started again you can use firebase
database there to get started with that
so let's go there okay
Arjun says sir up cook of a Hindi Bolton
hey dick huh
ok I I really I really do speak Hindi
quite well but I I think Hindi English
Tamil Punjabi all these languages are
amines are a way to just convey your
thoughts to other people I I don't
really care what the language is as long
as you understand me and that's it now
also on top of that I would like to put
a cherry that that every language has
its own accent and fanatics that you
should really focus on it's being taught
in first year of engineering as well but
make sure you focus on that because
every language whether it's the Spanish
it's English in Hindi has its own tone
to get started and to keep going so make
sure you don't mix Hindi tone with
English or English stone with Hindi or
Spanish tone with English every language
is standout in itself so job Hindi
Bolton to hindi geetu in Moscow boule or
when you are speaking in English make
sure you are speaking in the tone of
English and regardless of no matter what
the people are saying to you some people
are gonna jump on to you and I guess a a
hey you're using fake accent and all of
that no it's it's a way of how the
language was designed is the way how the
phonetics was designed and you should
follow that I would never recommend you
to follow the English accent in Hindi or
English accent in Spanish ok so don't
just worry about the people they are
gonna say just let them keep on saying
like that so let's start with other
questions ok I am in service based
company one point five years in testing
but I'm good in Java interested in app
dev please suggest I would say just
switch on to the company and get started
there are a lot of startups going on
which can help you come on these
messages are going crazy I don't know
somehow I got into just know how
Internet work or there are some other
reasons okay I would say just switch on
to any company and there are a lot of
startups that can help you and if you
can prove to them that yes you are good
in your skills there is no shortage of
the job just start looking for them can
I be can I build good games with coal
Java on Android not amazingly good games
just decent and okay one's not amazingly
good ones because most of the games that
are amazing and awesome use some kind of
game engines like unity or there are
dozens of others unity is one of the
popular ones so decent games are okay
but for a game development if you are
looking for an amazing game that can
impress anybody it's gonna use some kind
of framework you either use GameSalad or
maybe there is a construct too
and there is of course unity is there
everybody knows about it so that's the
way you are looking up okay I'm at one
plus and just started learning
programming basic syntax in algorithm
any tips I would say don't get
frustrated your programs are not going
to run and that's okay it's kind of a
programming phase everybody faces it
even I and all of other programmers who
you see are doing great everybody has
faced the situation where their programs
don't run and don't get frustrated
that's gonna be my tip to you okay is
programming err 128gb is right for
programming yes of course it's totally
right it's coding and C good or upgrade
needed yes definitely you do need
upgrade our shots worth I would say
strongly you recommend you need that how
longer Java will be number one there's
no such thing as number one language and
number two language number three these
are just personal preferences of some
companies or by me or by you these are
just personal preferences the product is
something which comes up as number one
number two or number three just like
that you have to go something like that
okay where can I learn Python I hope you
haven't heard about learn code online
dot in
visit it learn code online dot and you
should be visiting that okay
please bring data structure course as of
now I cannot promise you that because
there are a lot of other courses being
planned up specially the Java is in huge
demand a lot of people have mailed me
already and that course is almost like
30 percent or 40 percent done so that's
why what we're gonna be doing what is
the future of front-end framework would
you recommend
after react I think I would say get
started with the bootstrap at least HTML
CSS JavaScript es6 of course javascript
es6 bootstrap and react I think that's
it for now you just need that set which
is the best web hosting site I cannot
recommend any one of them I have used a
lot of them Heroku is their amazon web
server is their hostgator Bluehost these
are all good ones I don't prefer GoDaddy
because it's expensive as well as when
you want to leave them they make a lot
of problems so that's why ok best book
for DBMS CS I will very soon make a
separate section for all the books that
I recommend including the DBMS book that
I have read during my engineering and my
Master's all of these that I'm gonna be
saying tell us about the Android apps
you gave word I I still manage a lot of
Android apps for other people if you
want to check the work you can just
visit the learned code online app that's
the recent one and is on under my name I
can only mention the apps which are
under my name for other people's the
apps that are managing and holding up I
don't think so it would be a good idea
to mention those apps client may not
like it ok Ginny motion or AVD for react
native I would say a vidi is ok but
perhaps since I do have this humongous
RAM here 64 gigs that is why I'm not
facing much of the problems but I think
a BD has improved quite a lot and I
would recommend AV D for react native ok
ok repetitive questions let's try to
answer
where do you work right now I'm working
at home just there managing some clients
to learn code online mostly I have left
out a couple of clients so that I can
focus more on learned code online my own
project you are lagging yes there are
some lagging going on because I'm not on
a high-speed Internet connection hey I
can see the likes buttons are still down
so why don't you just go ahead give this
video as simple like go ahead do that it
won't cost you anything and it will give
me a lot of lot of good feelings so go
ahead give the liked to this video in
case you are enjoying these live
sessions okay tell us about
certification of igneous rock an it
helped us where it is valid
I I have to look up into that what kind
of certificate you are looking up
do you go to YouTube FanFest ah no I
didn't got there probably this year I'll
try to go and probably I'll see what I
can do with that but right now I don't
have enough time to go to these kinds of
fairs they are amazing I know I really
want to attend them but do some time
constraints I'm not able to attend them
and neither I'm able to do any kind of
things like that so very soon I'll do
that in future please make a video on
okay ok gray t-shirts only probably I'll
make a video very soon
hi pol kitchen if you are having some
issues you can drop me an email or can
refer our can read out the policies of
the websites and all these things so
thank you so much for attending the life
first of all and if you are having any
shoes make sure you read the policies
first of all and then drop me a email
definitely we can help you if it is
according to the policies okay okay what
to do after your Android app course I
would recommend the iOS course to get
started with iOS development but again I
would highly recommend to explore more
things on the Android try to design more
apps and put them into Android app store
when you will come to Delhi no such
plans of Delhi as of now
okay so let's just pick up more
questions is it
intro pay supports play publisher
account fee I don't think so but I have
no idea about entropy I didn't look into
it okay no js' tutorial please already
there at learned code online dot n check
out on the app as well Android app or
iOS app is about to come in the meantime
check out on the website node.js
tutorials are already there please make
a video on front-end development hiset
they're a front-end development video
not even just a video entire course is
already there which is one of the most
fantastic course I have ever produced so
make sure go ahead look out there and
look for there ok so let's pick up more
questions come on send me more questions
please make video on Android development
already there I have already created an
entire course on Android development how
to make background on your video I
didn't got there
thank you sir thank you so much for
joining up which is the best laptop to
buy between 60,000 to 70,000 not include
Apple I have recently done a video on
best laptop under 50,000 I think you can
have a pretty good idea of watching that
video on which one is gonna be good for
you also I have written a blog at
learned code online about the laptop
I will probably write a blog about the
best possible laptop without worrying
much about the money or under 80k or
something I will write a blog on that ok
so please talk about C sharp C sharp is
amazing and it can be used for two
places mainly for xamarin and for game
development probably in the future we'll
talk about that difference between your
curves and udemy and on our URL Co there
is no such a huge difference as of now
in some courses the difference are there
and difference will be coming up very
soon like for example in react GS course
the course on the learn code online is
also including the react
native videos while on the enemy it's
just you'd other react that's it no
updates I really don't feel anything
about it you can just feel free to buy
anywhere it's end of the day my core so
I don't have any issues go ahead and
just work on that okay hi what did I
miss hey Sahaj you didn't miss out
anything it's just regular usual stuff
I'm trying to answer questions and gave
a few updates about what is about to
come up in the next week and what I'm
doing right now
all of that projects are competitive
programming I would say projects
projects not a big fan of computer
programming and all such things so I
would say go ahead go with the projects
need a full video is about c-sharp no
such coming up plan for the C shop video
series let's be honest yeah let's not
just keep you waiting with that right
now the next plan is to come up with a
video series on Java and not just any
video series on Java that includes huge
projects and some university examples
like palindrome number spreading out
star patterns and all these things so
we're going to be doing things like that
okay so hi abhi now how are you okay
let's pick up okay some people are just
trying to be I think you don't know
about this but using of the abusive
language I just report spam immediately
without thinking much about it and it's
also written in the policies that if you
use abusive language we may block up
your account so make sure you keep an
idea of that best mobile below 10,000 I
have absolutely no idea about which
mobile is gonna be good I think you
should direct I recommend you to check
out the channel of geeky Ranjith he is
doing a pretty good job in explaining
the mobile phones and everything so I
would recommend to check out his channel
probably already know him he is a he's a
very famous guy so go ahead check out
his channel and he can give you best
advice on mobile phones and buying and
purchasing all of that I think you
should go there after watching this live
of course
I want a laptop which one I choose hi
ash oak I have already created a video
on best laptop under 50 K so go ahead
look into the archive of my channel and
I think you can go ahead and do that
okay let's pick up more questions okay
someone where do you live right now I am
in Jaipur hey - could you please
something to get into code Jam ACM like
competitions probably I can make a video
on that and I can include people
directly from Google and Facebook so
that you can get more idea about that
I'm in touch with Abe he's leading the
firebase team at the Google so I'll ask
him to come up on the videos maybe
someday and talk about these
competitions so Abe can really help you
okay how is 1+5 amazing phone I'm
enjoying it so far the audio and the
video quality is amazing there are no
issues right now
I haven't faced and seen any even one of
them single one of them okay
so let's pick up more questions how's
the feature for selenium Python I would
say if you are getting started in the
selenium go with the Java path python
path is not so amazing in the selenium
so I would recommend you Cynthia to go
ahead get started with the Java and with
the selenium and further I would
recommend it to go in the appium as well
which is an upgraded version not
upgraded it's an app version for
selenium not for usage it's for testing
all those apps so I would highly
recommend to start with a Java selenium
okay so okay okay can I block some
persons directly okay okay put user in
timeout
that's good
prasad says hello I guess I miss the
reply you gave to my comment I forgot
that what you do you ask you can ask it
again no problem see program projects no
assets not big projects are there in the
sea in my course at least ok sir with
lots of our hye-myung hadn't noticed you
Denmark says hi I am in TCS I'm doing
selenium testing what is the future of
this in companies like Amazon and Google
I would say yes selenium is having a
good feature in the big corporate
companies I did a worked out of one of
my projects and one of my trainings in
PayPal and they are also using selenium
so I would say it's having a good
feature I would also recommend you to
Denmark to switch into a PM as well
I think we are already in the selenium
so easily you can pick up into the a PM
so I would say go ahead start with that
do you use Trello I know I don't use it
okay okay let's look out for more
questions okay make videos on c-sharp
IBM Watson I know we cannot talk about
it right now
IBM Watson Python or Java totally on you
both are amazing language and both have
their own implementations so choose any
of them okay please explain difference
between your channel and technical guru
Qi Han please recommend which one should
I watch just watch both of them and the
difference is he talks more about like
the regular tech which is like how the
mobile phones are working or maybe how
which phone is good for you good for not
good for you about that I cannot tell
you more detail about what he is talking
about because I sometimes watch his
videos not regularly I'm not a regular
viewer of him but yes sometimes I do
watch his videos whenever I have to buy
a new phone or something I take his
opinion as well and account and the
difference between my channel is it's a
total programming based channel not for
the people who are looking just
for mobile advice and something he
doesn't talk about like PHP what is good
for Android app and how you can design
Android apps totally different channel
it's a programming based channel and his
channel is more over a general tech
channel you can watch both channel but I
have no such grudge or anything feel
free to just if you want to choose just
any one of us go ahead choose whatever
you like really don't I'm really not
bothered about it and totally this
channel is all about programming SQL
best IDE open-source want to learn SQL
there is an SQL thing which are
installed recently there I'll mention
that probably in the comment section in
the video later on okay sir can help in
some API to parse in Android can I mail
you I have already mentioned how to
parse the API is in Android in my course
I won't be able to take up individual
requests because there are so many codes
that are always being thrown up at my
email I won't be able to help with the
personal projects and all that okay so
how many programming language you know
never counted them out whenever I need
them I just take out the syntax and
start working on that no such big deal
with that get started with big data as
surely you can get started with big data
as of now I don't have any plan to get
started with big data can I skip Java
and jump to Cortland for Android
development yes you can do that there is
no such problem and in fact I have seen
a lot of new programmers getting started
directly with the Kotlin and we're
building good apps so yes you can do
that okay let's pick up more questions
fake for Hadoop or Java big for Hadoop
big is for Hadoop ok hello world hahaha
that's oh you are having a profile
picture of Cartoon Network amazing
that's amazing Mohan okay SQL injection
hahaha SQL injection if you can find out
my series on somewhere on the internet
on SQL injection master course you can
check that out
where can I learn Kotlin you can learn
Catalan at learn code online dot in I
think that's would be a great choice
go ahead visit the website learn code
online dot in and check out the courses
there okay okay let's pick up more
questions after the questions I have to
write a mail to have an individual who
is bothering us quite a lot so I do have
his email so that I can track him down
and can put him his some of the email
for using the abusive languages and also
I do have a screenshot of usage of these
abusive language so that I can mail him
obviously language is not being
tolerated at this channel and specially
on the learn code online web site and
note Rawlings are also being kind of
accepted there because everybody is a
new programmer and we respect all of the
people regardless or from odd background
what country they are we respect all of
them and we take strict actions against
the people who are trolling other
programmers as well as who are trolling
and using the abusive language towards
the platform as well as towards the
other programmers regardless how basic
your query is you should and you deserve
full respect in solving that regardless
if it is just a query about your hello
world is not running you deserve full
respect and we give no liberty to any
people who are trolling you and who are
using abusive language and we take
strict actions against them may be
blocking their account and all of these
things and may be blocking them for six
month or something okay so make sure you
you remain kind to other people
regardless of how basic their query is
what problem they are facing so I would
give this not trying to be a scary one
here but respect other people that's
what the programming community demands
and at least the learned code online
website demands okay so let me know what
are your thoughts about this point and
let me know in the comment section about
the discussion of this okay so how many
apps you have developed in every course
I developed like ten apps for iOS and
Android
I don't publish them but still they are
available at github for the clients I've
so far handled more than
clients okay so fair saying I love your
policy respecting your bigness yes of
course thank you so much for showing
appreciation about the policy but yes
again it is very very required because
internet is such a place where people
can easily be disrespectful towards
other programmers and towards the
platform they use a lot of abusive
language and all these things I don't
tolerate them immediately when I see
them I just mark as a spam and also if
they are using that on my platform I
immediately just kind of have banned
them from the platform I put up a notice
even notice on them that these kinds of
things will not be tolerated
not at all I cannot bear that one of my
student is trying to put up a questions
trying to learn a programming and other
people are just trolling him or making
some bad moves by using abusive language
definitely I cannot tolerate that okay
so let's pick up more questions let's
keep the environment a little bit more
healthy here okay how many apps you have
developed okay just have answered that
okay
please reply sir will you please do a
video on build a one-click registration
form powered by Google federated login
using Google api's console surely I can
do that and I will do that after the
competition because as soon as I am done
with the iOS app or the competition that
we talked a long time ago about learned
code online the web.com petition we are
gonna do that so this is a good news for
everybody make sure you do hit a like
button for the upcoming competition as
soon as we hit up the iOS app then the
next video is probably next or some
videos is going to be there about doing
saying the rules and regulation and all
these things for the competition which
is are coming up okay thank you for
answering my questions you're welcome
I'm here to answer all of your queries
dark web and deep web there's not such
big issue with the dark web deep web if
you are using tor browser you can visit
them but be sure that you don't
anything suspicious and all of that okay
so in market ios and android developer
have limited scope then back-end
developer know is it's not like that
both have their equal opportunities
back-end is awesome iOS android all of
them are awesome so I won't say that
opportunity that are limited for any one
of them all of them are having amazing
opportunities okay I do need to get a
haircut which type of app you have made
I have made mostly the apps which sell
something because most of the clients
that I've worked over already having
some kind of shopping cart and they
wanted to just make an app so that
people and user can buy something from
their carts and everything most of these
kinds of app I have made for individual
organization that are running in a small
County or maybe small state or just like
that so mostly these kinds of app I have
made not the apps like a chatting apps
or like social media that are going up
doing really good that especially for
the businesses that I have made and that
I've done in the past
okay thank you so much for appreciation
and good words
Ranjith Roy I really do appreciate okay
let's pick up more questions okay where
are the questions okay what do you think
about the Google Android development
certification program I would say it's a
good program and it's make sure you
learn on your yourself first of all
before jumping into that certification
program because it does require a lot of
prerequisite and I would recommend you
to check out other Android courses
before jumping into that okay can I
practice programming on my Android phone
I would say I don't recommend it
learning programming do require an
investment investment of at least a
computer or a laptop wherever you can
get that I would say learning everything
on a phone is not something that I would
recommend you won't be going so far very
far with that so I don't recommend that
okay okay so let's pick up more question
what after C course on L COC it's just
the basic getting started now you don't
programming the entire paradigm of
programming has opened up for you you
can now go into the Android course you
can now go into iOS course you can now
go into front-end development and you
can now get started with nodejs react
yes it has all got started for you C was
just the basic hurdle that you have
already crossed so definitely you can go
okay I published app in App Store and I
learned from your learned code online
thank you so much sandy these kinds of
comments I just love because people have
learned something from my course and
they were able to publish that on the
App Store or on their website this gives
me immense pleasure you cannot see how
much good I feel about it when people
learn something from my course and just
do something with it whether it's just a
basic thing it just prints a background
change or a hello world I don't care all
i care is you have come up with a
product which a lot of engineering
colleges have actually failed to deliver
and i was able to deliver that to you
absolutely fantastic I'm feeling
congratulations on the and whole learned
code online community is wishing well
for you looking for that you can drop me
a mail about the link of your app I will
certainly do a download for that and
I'll try to make a even video for that
okay so let's pick up more questions
okay let's pick up more questions I love
learn code online a thank you so much
for that again which language
space-based for data structure data
structure is something the way how you
arrange your data its language
independent it's not about C it's not
about Java
it's not about Python it's a way of how
you understand the data should be
arranged and should be sorted out should
be pulled up back all these things are
important okay so make sure you do that
okay
best laptop under 20,000 I'm on a low
budget
hey mr. Roy you can check out my videos
on laptop under 50 K and 25 k I think
there is a laptop for you or you can
directly read out a blog on learn code
online dot n slash blog in case you
don't want to watch the video there is a
direct blog and there is the one
recommendation which is around in the
budget of 24 K not under 20 K let me
just mention that honestly here but it's
around twenty four ish K it's a good
laptop you won't be able to do Android
development and such things on that but
it's good for web development okay let's
pick up more questions okay MBC v or
dotnet code 2.0 not a big fan of
Microsoft tech thanks for the updates in
LC over thank you so much remote updates
are coming up
okay so let's pick up your so informated
I try my best to put out more
information shout out my name hi Natasha
Kumar okay where are my course right now
there are no AI courses as such
abundance on the Internet they will
surely come up very soon
will it do please a video on SVG
animation SVG animation don't just
cannot be finished up in just one video
it will require me to at least a cook up
like 15 videos or so to explain
everything about SVG it's amazing but it
is little bit time-consuming prediction
for one plus six I don't have any
prediction for that I don't know what
they really want to put up maybe what
they are going to do for one plus six is
move into bezel-less and increase the
price quite a lot at least that's what
I'm expecting okay let's pick up more
questions and do we have react native
projects yes in the react.js course I
have recently included react native
videos and there is one or two projects
there as well
more projects will come up after the
Java course after the Java course we are
going to focus back on react native so
definitely it's going to come up okay
always waiting for Sunday live actually
I'm planning to move these Sunday lives
onto a fixed time so that I can be
always a regular on that but right now
so many things are going on and there is
no such fixed time to get started on a
fixed time and things like that so
definitely I'm planning very soon to fix
a time for Sunday live so that more
people can join up okay sir Google
Analytics is down yes I'm aware of that
it's down and yes it's down I was also
looking just for that and it's down at
last I got my answer thanks a lot thank
you so much
okay okay sir
I must visit my home once in my future I
shared a lot about here with my mom
thank you so much I would I definitely
like to catch you up in your city if I'm
around okay why you choose freelancing
I would like to address that in a
separate video like what I chose and I
have switched up many jobs including I
rejected the offer from Amazon I was
offered a job as a researcher position
in the United States at Amazon for
working on ns3 projects on their Kindle
devices I rejected that offer and start
with my own learned code online and I
think I'm happy with that
obviously oh but I would like to address
these issues probably in a separate
videos about what I've switched on what
I have learned so far and what was kind
of a my pay scale for each job and
everything so definitely I'll get
started with that okay so let's get
started with that
okay a lot of questions are coming up
and sometimes you cannot it just keeps
on going fast like that it's really not
so easy to find out questions is it
necessary to learn HTML or CSS for web
development okay
listen buddy Nitesh know or they're for
web development HTML or CSS HTML and CSS
you have to learn both without this I
won't recommend you to get started in
any kind of web development HTML and CSS
don't skip that I know WordPress is
there Drupal is there Joomla is there
but nope without HTML and CSS you should
not progress go ahead get started with
that okay how can I become like you oh
you're already better than me I would
say so whoever you are just maintain
that personality you are better than me
so please do videos in on sketch I don't
do much videos in the sketch app because
I know a lot of people are not on to Mac
and I love sketch I make a lot of design
entire learned code online our app that
you're seeing is being designed on the
sketch so getting you a good idea of
that okay so let's get started more
question said I'm unable to get go to
college because of family problems where
can I get good education for programming
and can I get laid in some companies
without degree yes of course you can it
will be a little bit tough for you let's
be honest here let's not make any hopes
for unnecessary things it's going to be
a little bit tough for you but as soon
as you are learning and spending like
one year or two year totally dedicated
and programming and good skills I think
you can easily easily land up in job
there is no such big hurdles and for
those people who cannot afford college
and big high money education so I have
actually created this learn code online
because you can imagine the course price
is like 500 rupees 600 rupees and 800
rupees are far more affordable for
almost anybody in India and even abroad
as well so I would say get started don't
be disheartened if you are not able to
get into college not everybody is lucky
enough to get into college it's okay
let's accept that fact and start
learning programming
get started with the basics and then
learn Android development and as well as
web development the more skills the more
knowledge you will be learning it would
be easier for you to get into jobs the
people in the jobs are looking up so
that looking up for the people who are
having actual skills and knowledge so
get started and learning no need to be
disheartened there if you're not able to
get into college okay it's okay it's
okay
okay let's pick up more questions
looking nice I need to really get a
haircut there you can see it's it's all
messy I need to fix up my hairs need to
get a haircut okay can be used PHP for
Android apps development not that I'm
aware of
and if you are going to be using that
I'm not sure is it going to perform
really well or not Cordova or PhoneGap
no I don't recommend any of that just
use ionic either or maybe xamarin or my
favorite react negative okay so let's
wake up okay we have already spent 46
minutes that's amazing I didn't check
that out okay okay love from Mumbai
thanks for your inspirational videos
thank you so much mr. Khan I really I'm
really glad that I was able to help you
out okay
technical guru ji benefit over this I
have no comments on that if you really
want to watch those videos I'll go ahead
they are amazing videos he is doing
really hard work go ahead watch that do
YouTube is free you can watch both
videos why are you comparing all me with
him and him with me there is no such
comparison they are completely different
Channel okay okay 4k or 120fps monitor I
would say 4k 4k would be amazing it you
can watch a lot of good videos and
specially mkbhd videos they are so
amazing to watch and 4k I do have a 5 K
screen I do love to watch his videos in
full resolution full high 4k it's
amazing not a lot of people can do that
but I have a luxury to do so and I had
to do that
okay let's pick up how can i buy your
course by app ATM you can transfer your
fund from Paytm to Apple or what they
call in Android Android wallet I'm not
sure what they call it an Android I have
never checked it out but you can
transfer your amount in that and then
you can purchase it via Android okay do
a video on electron very soon very soon
we're gonna do a video on electron okay
now I'm trying to make actually more
videos not just on defining the tag but
instead include a computer screen so
that I can install that can show you
more things on that so moreover I can
work on that can we work on a startup
surely you can if you like that no
problem
everybody's doing started nowadays you
should also try that out okay so I think
I have answered a lot of questions and
now I'm feeling hungry because I haven't
eaten anything from the morning got busy
and a lot of stuff a lot of video
uploads and stuff and I haven't ate
anything so I think I should take
something I need to grab some food okay
so this was an amazing session and very
soon we are gonna fix up fixed time for
these learn Sunday live sessions so
that's why we are gonna do it very soon
the questions are still coming up and
they're just keep going like that so

feeling really hungry I need to go and
get some food so that's it for this
