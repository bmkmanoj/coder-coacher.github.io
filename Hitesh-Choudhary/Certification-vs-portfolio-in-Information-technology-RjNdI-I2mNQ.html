with another video and in today's video
I want to touch upon a sensitive subject
about the programming careers our very
first jobs in the programming so which
one is more important certification or
portfolio they're going to discuss this
in this video so let's get started in
here in this channel we talk about
programming coding web apps mobile apps
and pretty much everything related to
technology so in case you are new here
consider subscribing now I get this
question quite a lot and especially with
the people who are just about to get
passed out from their college or maybe
the campus placement or things like that
you you got the point so which one is
more important doing the certification
or building up a portfolio now again it
depends and I do have a choice in here
it's not like both of them are good or
equally important or equal there I
personally prefer the portfolio guys
there well I'll tell you the reason why
it's more important and you will
understand and you will perhaps you will
agree with me in the end of the video so
let's get started with that now I would
say not all the certification but yes
most of the certifications are not the
true certification exams they are
something within which you have to pay a
heavy amount of money skills are not
that much required and you can just grab
the certification now I'm not going to
name any of those certificates but I
still know a lot of certificates for
which you can just pay out and can just
grab the certification and amount of
knowledge that should be delivered or
should be with a potential student is
not at all adequate there on the other
hand if I talked about the portfolio
that is actually kind of a living proof
there which phase and shout-outs quite a
lot that hey this guy is something there
and I'll talk about two things which are
very popular nowadays is the pen testers
or
known as vertical hackers and also the
web developers or app developers now
let's just say for a moment let us try
to assume that you are a HR guy are from
a company now who are you going to
prefer to take into your company a guy
who is having let's just say 30 yes I'm
saying 3-0 30 Android certification or
just 5 app in the Android store which
one you got the choice obviously you're
going to pick up the guy who is having 5
apps in the Android store so obviously
the choice is pretty simple for you now
for the pen tester guys who is going who
are you going to adopt into your company
as a junior penetration tester the guy
who is having certification or the guy
who has written some code in the Python
that is a little bit popular and have
got let's just say five or six bug
bounties they're obviously your choice
would be to hire that guy who's having a
couple of bounties and have created a
couple of scripts which are adequately
popular they're not the guy who is
having good branded certification and
has invested like 40,000 or 50,000 in
that certification I'm not saying the
certifications are bad but obviously if
you have the money and you can afford to
give those exams and can qualify for
those certification obviously it's a
good idea it's a good resume builder but
I would say it's not completely required
especially that same things goes on for
the web development for app development
or maybe for pen testing or any domain
in which you are going so I'm not saying
that don't go for the certification for
sure you can go for the knowledge but I
would say building a portfolio is much
more important and much more useful
because let's say some company has
arrived into your college and you are
showing them all the resume is there but
on the other hand this person is saying
hey I have got five apps on the App
Store or Android store and here are the
links and check them out and this is my
portfolio that's it I have no
certification but I have got results out
there similarly if you are hiring a web
developer and we say hey I have a
certification in WordPress I have a
certification in CSS I have a
certification in JavaScript while the
other person is saying I have an
experience of building too
websites and here are the links of all
the websites check out yourself and then
judge me obviously that is going to be
more important so all I'm saying is that
try to go into the project-based
learning which you can go with any book
any online course or offline course and
just try to create a lot of results also
when you create those results make sure
you save those results somewhere and in
one of the previous video I talked about
the github or the bit bucket although
they are used generally for the version
controlling of the app and the web or
whatever you are building up but
obviously you can use them as simply
your portfolio websites as well so you
can push up your code onto those
websites and it it would be quite good
there but I would be saying that in my
point of view if I have to judge a
person I would surely be judging a
person based on what kind of project he
has done in the past instead of saying
that hey he has got certificates and
that's it so my advice to all of the big
nuts who are getting started in
programming or maybe app development or
maybe in pen testing whatever domain you
have students it's good that you have
chosen now and it's best of luck in that
case but again don't go for those
expensive certificates yet try to build
a portfolio first of all then obviously
if you can afford go for the certificate
or usually as seen that when you join up
in the company and if you want to do
certificate companies actually do give
you a lot of money to perform or to go
through with that certificate and even
for the trainings as well so there are
policies in the company for that so my
advice would be go for the portfolio for
the very first and the later on if you
wish you can go out for the
certification as well so with this I
would say if you have liked the content
on this video go ahead give it a thumbs
up in case you think that somebody can
get a benefit from this video go ahead
and share it on the social websites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
