with another video now in this video we
are gonna talk about the latest beam app
specially in India now this is a
specifically video for the Indian users
an Indian subscriber and recently the
beam app was launched by our prime
minister and a lot of people have just
seen a lot of people renting about that
out that that app is not at all secure
so how is it going on how much truth is
in that much of the renting that the app
is not secure or the website of the app
is not secure and we are going to figure
it out all in this video let's get
started here so first of all in case you
are not aware our Prime Minister has
recently rolled out a new application
and that app is known as bheem
now especially this app is a total pure
competition for the Paytm now it is just
kind of an online mobile wallet and you
can simply get and transfer money by
that app and I know I don't know much
idea what the future plans of the app is
but I believe that it's it's having a
high competition with the Paytm right
now the app is only designed specially
for just transferring the money from one
account to another account but maybe
later on they might be switching on
depositing of the bills and everything
but that's again a different kind of
topic right now I am just want I just
want to talk about what are the security
loopholes on the website how much truth
is there how much how the people should
react how the government should react
and everybody just my opinions on to
that so first of all the knowing that
you are aware that app is there and a
lot of iOS user might be searching for
the be map now the be map is only being
rolled out for the Android and that
should obviously be done that should be
the obvious choice because the amount of
the people who are using the Android is
very bigger than that then the iOS one
iOS are definitely they are the selected
crowd they are good for payment apps
which requires $10 or $1 or something
like that but if you want to hit the
massive crowd obviously that was a good
decision of rolling out the app for the
Android user first of all now after that
I saw a lot of people that it was
predicted already I was saying that this
app is
ruling out now the security researchers
and the bug bounty hunter will go after
that immediately and will search out for
the bugs how much they try hard
eventually there will be news that
somebody is trying to get break into the
app and app is not at all secure so that
was about to come nothing nothing
surprised me at all but the thing that
I'm talking about how much truth is
there in the security app and how much
it is not let's just start with that now
first of all I have seen quite a rant
going on for the website which is not so
secure people are telling that hey just
somebody has uploaded a WordPress
website for the government domains and
they have just not owned they have not
only deleted a lot of stuff and all that
kind of going stuff going on there like
for example they have said the readme
dot HTML file was not deleted from the
WordPress and a lot of bugs like that
now let me be clear on to that topic now
if you are saying that the beam APSCo
dot in or B Maps dot in was not so
secure let me get it very clear these
are not government official domains and
they are not at all a part of government
domains now the one app the beam AB dot
co dot in and another one is v map dot
in the one of them is registered by the
leaf he is from Delhi and another one
was registered by Herschel from
Ahmedabad so both of the guys have
played a masterstroke of the SEO they
have just rolled out a wordpress on the
domain a dot code out in and the dot in
and they have just simply uploaded that
on the web page now the benefit that
they have got they have got a hundreds
and hundreds and millions of users
within a one day and they have just
rolled out some ads they are running
pretty good now on the other hand the
security researchers the new ones I
would say are trying to inject on to the
website and are trying to hack and
trying to deport the vulnerabilities to
that website again a simple waste of
your valuable time because those
websites are just made for the SEO
within a few weeks or months or year
that website will be gone they have just
earned the traffic's and that's it that
that was only their websites weren't
being registered for so that's the one
failure you will be seeing quite a lot
if you see that the website is not so
secure yes that's that's going
there again most of the government and
in fact all of the government websites
are registered on govt dot in and all of
that if you found a vulnerability there
in case let's talk about it there you
may report that now why I'm talking
about you may report there now you might
have been familiar with the recent stuff
that a lot of people are going on with
the bug bounties now let me first try to
clear up what the whole concept is
because a lot of people have just gone
over through the concept and are just
worrying about the reporting the bugs
and getting money let me just very clear
here so the whole concept is let's just
say X Y Zed has designed a website and
has invited some hackers through the
platforms like hacker one or the bug
calm and they are saying that hey we are
inviting people because we care about
our users and we want our application to
be much more secure we are inviting
attackers to attack on our website or a
specific domain and report us the bugs
and on return in behalf on behalf of
that we may give them about okay we may
give them about so that's what all is
going on with the B map a few users try
to deport the bugs in their app and
again I'm not pretty sure that if there
was vulnerability or not but they have
said that there were few vulnerabilities
we try to report to the government and
government is threatening us with an F
IR or trying to put us a cyber crime on
us yes they can surely because they have
not invited you to test their apps you
are deliberately going and testing into
their app if you are just taking things
into your hand without an invitation so
that may happen that's completely okay
now a lot of people are going to rant
over me and we're going to say that hey
we will put some time bugs on Facebook
sometimes on evil and they are not
registered on the bugcrowd or hacker
ones till they accept our bounties and
pay us some bounties accept our bugs and
things like that but again those are big
organization and sometime sometime the
organization wants you to avoid for what
you have found because that might be the
procedure over there that might not be
the procedure on another domain and in
fact I have seen many other websites
especially I remember the HP one
initially they were not having any bug
payments and all those steps so if
somebody used to report the bug and
there
used to threaten back that hey who
allowed you to test on our website it
used to be a case at one time but now
it's not the case so the whole point is
if you have found a wonder bility and
somebody is not giving you any award or
is even threatening you to report and fi
are for sure they can they are
completely valid and have good reasons
to do so I'm not saying this is a
solution I am providing any solution
like you should not report yes
definitely you should report but again
there are some consequences because
security researchers are getting invited
without getting an invitation so that
might be a cause but again I think that
somehow government should understand
that what security researcher try they
are trying to do is report as sensible a
disclosure there they are not making a
public hype of that although they can
somehow with the help of media and
everything of course they have to face
consequences on behalf of that as well
but again they are trying to make a
responsible disclosure and government
should understand that you should take
care take them very seriously and try to
patch those security bugs of course they
are going to patch them too because
somebody has reported the bug and they
don't want to give any words ok don't
give them but at least patch them now I
can also understand that there is a
shortage of the security researcher
because people are either only in the
security domain or only into the
development there is no mix hybrids of
somebody who is quite good in security
and good in the development phase as
well so that development and security
can be an integral part of a development
process this is very tough and some of
you might not get agree with me but
believe me you can count on the hand the
peoples who are into both the domains
they are very selective people just
enjoy their work in the information
security domain and they just like to
stick their and putting their hands into
the development is little bit different
and it's their choice I'm all I'm saying
so this was the whole idea and my views
about what's going on ranting about the
bugs in the website and in the app
itself and as I read on their blog and
everything I found out that very soon
they are also going to release the iOS
app
as well and I know a lot of people are
gonna come up and talk about the
Securities again but my request to the
government is simply to just take those
advice seriously now you should
definitely register these kinds of app
into hacker 1 or something so that it
can make we can make the app much more
secure but again I'm no one to advise
the government out there but again I
believe I should put out that hot let me
know what are your thoughts about how
the government process things are
working with the apps do you like the
apps or not what are the things that you
want to see more in the apps maybe maybe
let's just say somebody is watching my
videos in the house of the government
people so somebody might look out at
your comment and can say hey II need
that guy and we really want that feature
so with this I'll catch you up in the
next video and in case you haven't yet
