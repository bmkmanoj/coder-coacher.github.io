code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey there everyone hit
a share back again with another video in
this video we are talking about some of
the questions that I don't like to
answer probably you might have reached
me with these questions on my facebook
or email and might haven't got any
answer at all and there is a rock solid
ground reason why I don't like to answer
these questions so in this video I will
be taking up these questions and will
tell you why I don't answer them
of course don't expect me to answer for
these questions obviously have not gonna
answer that but I'll tell you the reason
why I always skip these questions so the
number one question if I had to pick up
would be this what should I do after my
twelfth BTech BCA or BSC whatever that
is now I always always keep these
questions I have never given any
specific answer to this question and let
me tell you why I am NOT giving answer
to this question now regardless of
whatever I say I believe that degree
whatever the degree you are choosing it
isn't a costly degree it is gonna give
you a lot of bank loan and debt about
that so I don't want any this decision
is very important for you I don't want
any youtuber to just give you this
decision and you just take it no it
should not be like that degrees whatever
you are choosing first of all you should
study about it read about it about the
curriculums what you're going to be
studying at what university you'll be
studying what you'll be able to do after
doing that degree so it should be wholly
your decision and another reason why I
don't give answer to this question is I
believe that whatever the degree you are
be choosing you have different fantasies
about that degree as compared to what
happens actually in a degree you might
be thinking after taking this degree
I'll be able to program write code I'll
have amazing friends who will be
absolutely crazy about programming
I'll find amazing teachers there who are
going to teach me all the time but
reality sadly is very more different
than what you are thinking what happens
in the college and what you're thinking
is completely apart and for the rest for
your 3 or 4 years of your life it
depends on what kind of degree you're
choosing you'll be absolutely hating me
if I'll be suggesting you any degree so
that's why I just like to give this
decision absolutely to you so that you
can determine what degree is best for
you another question that I get is
choosing for the branch now I do believe
that a lot of people of this channel are
enthusiastic about programming and are
just completing their school or about to
be completed or just have completed
their school and they want to choose
perfect branch absolutely perfect branch
in their engineering whether it's
computer science information security or
computer science with some
specialization or whatever that is again
I don't like to answer this question as
well and there are some reasons as well
because I believe if you're watching
this channel obviously you are taken to
sziasztok you love programming
networking hacking and all these stuff
now what you'll be studying in your
Labor's and the implementation of that
in that slaver's is completely different
with your fantasies again so again I'm
not at all a good person to answer this
question as well I myself has done my
engineering in electronics and
communication fruitful absolutely for me
but not at all good if you're looking
for a computer perspective it will give
you a ground solid math and absolutely
fun about now I was lucky that in my
university I had to learn a lot of
programming language and I didn't
worried about if that language is in my
slaver's or not I was crazy about it I
learned it absolutely and that's all
what I did but again choose and look for
the slavers look for what are the
content you will be studying and all of
that so again choosing the branch
I know it's crucial for you but it
should be end of the day it should be
your decision not from any random
youtuber who is just saying choose
computer science it should not be like
that you should research on that it
should be your decision another question
that I get is should I go for higher
studies or job now now this is a very
complicated question this involves a lot
of variables depending on what are your
family situation how much monetary
benefit
you are getting from your family how
much you can afford and what is your end
goal about learning things now again I
am nobody to answer this question in one
line that hey go for higher studies
or hey go for a job now both of these
things are meant to make sure that you
learn something you will be learning
things why a higher studies manner as
well that's a different approach and
you'll be learning why job approach as
well it's not like nobody learns at the
job in fact people do learn quite a lot
at job as well now higher studies are
jobs a lot of variables are involved in
this and this cannot be answered in a
question like this video or maybe a
chart on Facebook this is not this
doesn't happen like that there are a lot
of variables that needs to be computed
and then only one can get answer for
that even if you write a very long email
explaining me everything I don't think
I'm a rock-solid person to answer this
question as whether we should be going
for higher studies or job it's totally
your wish and how much you can afford
and what is your situation of going into
whatever you want to go so again I
always skip this question that should I
go for higher studies or job now this
one question although I do have answer
for that but always you might have seen
that if you have asked me on this
Facebook I have seen your question and I
have unseen it kind of I haven't replied
and that is what should I do
mtech or MBA M Tech is a Tech degree and
MBA is good for business perspective
improving the business and stuff now you
know me guys I am a tech person I am
absolutely crazy about programming new
tech hiking networking Linux whatever
that is so I always have some kind of
kind of a tendency of leaning towards
the M Tech but again it's totally your
decision and degrease is something that
again I wouldn't be suggesting anything
and you should be the one who should
look forward where you want to go being
a tech enthusiastic it's really common
for me to lean towards M Tech but am i
right there probably not or probably yes
so it should be totally your decision
not from any random youtuber who is just
making video sitting in front of a
camera and saying hey go for that degree
no it shouldn't happen like that
if programming languages would be a live
person it would be insulting to them if
people answer ask this question
and this question is scope of X
programming language where X can be
replaced by C C++ Java Python Perl Ruby
dotnet c-sharp Python whatever the
language you can name it here now this
is absolutely a wrong question there is
no scope of any programming language and
there is absolutely crazy scope of every
programming language it doesn't really
matter what kind of language you are
learning and you're looking forward for
scope because programming language do
keep on changing about their scopes and
stuff and obviously if you'll ask a
person who can just write a simple loop
in PHP he's going to say there's no job
market in PHP it's not like that it's
outdated language now nodejs is rocking
on the other hand a person who can do
absolutely anything in PHP is gonna say
PHP is still rockin you know I have got
three job offers in my email still for
PHP and have got like five or ten
projects still pending on PHP it doesn't
matter that what kind of scope we are
talking about here does scope matter yes
a little bit but not that much the most
thing that matter is how much expertise
you are having with that language of
course expertise doesn't come with
buying a perk or buying a course it
comes or with the time books and these
courses are a good way of pushing the
limits or just mastering the themes
things in a short time but on top of
that you still have to spend a lot of
great amount of time with these
programming languages so again asking
scope is completely totally a bad idea
all programming languages do have scope
whether that's vb.net or COBOL there is
always a demand of certain people maybe
that industry is using that language now
also I would like to say that yes scope
is there a little bit like that like
some industries are heavy oriented in
India some languages are much more used
in New Zealand or maybe in United States
so yes there's a little bit of
difference of like that but again
programming on a whole is a concept and
one person who is expert in PHP takes
him know time to switch on to Java or
maybe Java Script so again please stop
asking this question about scope of
programming language this is absolutely
a wrong question and there is not at all
any answer for that honestly I can talk
a little bit more about on this
but I would like to just say here that
yes there are few languages which are
trendy one year and there are few
languages which are not so trendy one
year and of course I would meant I would
recommend all of you that it's like a
game of Batman the more languages you
are having in your belt it's always good
and again on top of that there should be
a couple of languages on which you have
extreme expertise so always take a
couple of languages in your belt but
don't worry too much about the scope
just keep on moving keep on building the
stuff and that surely is gonna help you
and here comes the final question which
is can you suggest me the best the best
of the bestest laptop for programming
now I cannot do that honestly I cannot
now I have compiled a list of best
laptops under 50k for programming and I
have given specific reason why I am
selecting these laptops or not the blog
is there at learned code online dot in
so search for that about 50k laptops
learned code online you'll get that blog
but again honestly I cannot recommend
you enough about any laptop all the
laptops which are having like decent
amount of RAM good graphic card and
decent storage is absolutely fine for
programming but again it depends on what
kind of things you want to build having
a Dell laptop an amazing bessel Dell
laptop maybe Alienware cannot build an
iPhone app and on top of that if you are
looking for these high-end computation
all of that you have to spend time on
that a lot of people ask me also this
that hey can I learn programming on my
mobile yeah you can but obviously if you
will have good tools that will make you
a better programmer faster you will be
less frustrated and you will be actually
building the stuff what kind of a
programmer is a programmer if he is not
having a good decent laptop it's
expensive I do get that I totally agree
with you there but this is a programming
thing this is the investment you are not
learning it to do absolutely for free
you are not going to be running an NGO
for that you'll be obviously making
money after learning programming and
doing all these things so learn to
invest because obviously you'll be
earning it back so try to invest
something here and I know a lot of
people cannot afford all of that and
still are programming entity
I totally agree with you but you can
work harder and maybe earn a money with
the side job and anything that's a
totally different subject but yes coming
back onto the topic
I cannot suggest you a best programming
laptop because my experience of Dell
whatever I have is completely going to
be different of what kind of Dell laptop
you are going to be buying same goes
with the other brands as well as whose
HP all of them are trying to give you
best laptop and it all depends the more
amount you will be giving to them the
more hardware you will be getting and
that is going to be eventually better
for programming and programming can be
done on all laptops regarding their
operating system there is no such kind
of a basic boundaries here you can work
on Windows Mac Linux pretty much
anything there is no such big deal but
yes if you want to build specific
projects for that then comes specific
limitation and that is just one Apple is
Apple if you want to build apps for
Apple you need to have hardware from the
Mac or the Apple lineup there but apart
from that all laptops whether Dell HP
ISU's all of them are pretty much same
and it all matters about the internals
of that and since I'm not getting
sponsored by any one of them I cannot
give you the names that hey boy this
product or something like that no I'm
not gonna do that obviously just choose
whatever is your budget and I also know
that whatever the laptop you're looking
forward is totally out of your budget it
happens with all of us selves just get
whatever you can get and the best so
that's it for this video I hope this
video has helped you to understand that
why there are some times when I don't
answer your question on Facebook or
maybe on the email as well so in case
you have enjoyed this video give it a
thumbs up in case you are new here we
are taken to zeal stick here we are
programming crazy guys we love to talk
about programming maybe networking maybe
Linux maybe a little bit about hacking
and stuff so if you're new here do hit
the subscribe and I'll surely catch you
up in the next video
take me away
