cryptography COEs hope you are enjoying
the course and now let's move ahead and
try to explore more things before we
jump into the more deeper things on the
cryptography first we should understand
what we are dealing with how we can deal
with and what are the base foundations
of cryptography so let's get started in
the cryptography I would like to focus
on the three major topics here the
confidentiality integrity and
availability data security is a very
critical topic at first it seemed to be
very simple as we just have to protect
but protection of physical thing is very
easy thing as compared to information
and that too in digital world the key
objective in cryptography includes the
following thing confidentiality
integrity and of ability these three
words may look simple but any experience
script analyst can tell you that these
are the most complicated words of
digital world let's take a few minute
and talk about these in detail
confidentiality as the name suggests
data or information should be kept
confidential information should be made
available only to a few and important
resources if information get disclosed
to unauthorized individual then he can
cause serious actions against you
the first thing that might hit to your
brain is top-secret military information
but there are other serious information
to a loss of confidentiality is the
unauthorized disclosure of information
let's take a very simple example for
which most of you might not be so much
aware the ferp act that is Family
Education rights and Privacy this Act
says that great information should only
be available to the students their
parents and the employees that require
the information to do their job but we
can see how easily the information is
disclosed around the web by many schools
and universities sometimes you don't
like to publish your personal mobile
number on the web for privacy breaking
this level of confidentiality is not
that
of trouble but imagine the high-risk
scenario factors just one more example
can be leakage of your PayPal account
email and password over the Internet
so I hope you got the point how
confidentiality is important
another is integrity integrity of data
shows that information is changed only
in a specific manner and also by
authorized person only a loss in
integrity is the authorized modification
or unauthorized modification or
destruction of information the top
example of all to the show the value of
integrity is by using hospital
information example the doctor should be
able to trust the information stored in
the database if any person is updating
the data then the person responsible for
it should be traceable for example if a
person is having diabetes and this
information is deleted without the
knowledge of doctor now imagine a
scenario where doctor operates a person
without having the information that
patient is diabetic this can lead the
entire hospital in trouble any hacker
can also get into your bank account and
can change your balance digits of course
everyone would love to change from
hundred dollar to a ten thousand dollar
but the reverse is the most likely to
happen of ability the continence service
is available to all legitimate users of
services very important a loss in of
ability is the disruption of access to
use the information imagine what the use
of information is if it's not at all
available most likely example is the
time of your result whenever the result
is declared the result side is feeling
heavy traffic and most likely to get
shut down for all users
imagine a critical update for antivirus
software which was necessary to protect
your system and is not available for you
for 20 days now I'm not talking about
the antivirus which you have taken free
I'm taking I'm talking about the
antivirus for which you have paid let's
say 2000 dollars and
you got a severe loss with the viruses
that might be worth valuable of one lakh
dollars so these three words are the
basic backbone of Internet although a
couple of related words are also like
here like a tent city and accountability
but I think that I consider these three
big guns which are needed to be covered
and rest will cover up automatically
during the course okay so one more thing
what are the challenges in cyber
security now cyber security is not that
simple as it first look like it's
in-depth topic and fascinating to the
goals are state forward self-explanatory
but mechanism used to fulfill the
requirement is very complex while
developing any protocol or let's just be
simple while developing any application
one should take care of all security
aspect at the time of development of
even at planning stage after
implementation is always expensive in
terms of money as well as consequences
hackers job is always to exploit the
unexpected weakness and most of the time
the weakness is too obvious the creation
distribution and protection of that
information is always too complex with
security implementation and this is the
reason why most of the programmers left
this messy security things around
computer and network security is
essential battle of wits between
proprietor who tries to find holes in
the system and designer of the system or
you can call admin of the system the
administration has to focus on all
variables that can cause intrusion but
intruder can has to just focus on a
single point to get into the system and
this makes things more challenging well
for that which traitor of course not for
the hackers security is still an
afterthought to be incorporated into the
system after the design is complete
rather than being an integral part of
the design process security requires
regular even constant monitoring
and this is very difficult in today's
short term and overloaded environment
we'll see more about all these teeth
things and we'll discuss a lot more
details about the cryptography in later
videos and make sure that you share all
these videos with your friends and keep
enjoying the series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
