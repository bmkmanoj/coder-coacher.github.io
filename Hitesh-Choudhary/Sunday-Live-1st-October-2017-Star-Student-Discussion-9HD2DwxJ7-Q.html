they share back again with another sandy
life I am five minutes early this time I
posted the time on my Facebook page and
I know most of you are already joined up
you are giving thumbs up that's good
thank you so much
hey shaprut a regime Haida Misha Animesh
good read attack mates severe alguna are
discussed something today which is very
important so stay tuned and this is
related to building up your portfolio
your profile that is going to help you
in getting your very first job or to
make a switch from your job this is
going to be really a fruitful discussion
that we are gonna make and everything is
gonna remain free the plan is really
good so I would recommend you to give it
a thumbs up stay tuned stay joined up
stay here so that we can have discussion
and can have some fruitful and
discussion not a discussion like Erna
you know him it's not going to be a
discussion like that I will try to
listen to all of you so that you can
suggest me some good things and I will
share what my plans are all these things
so definitely it's going to be really
fruitful the whole idea the whole
concept behind this channel is to
promote programming regardless of what
kind of programming it is the whole
agenda is to promote programming it can
be JavaScript it can be Java it can be
iOS it can be web development it can be
Salesforce or anything like that so we
are going to discuss that and yes
everything we are going to discuss right
now let's just focus on the concept of
star student that I'm about to start at
learned code online so definitely stay
tuned I'm not gonna start the things a
little early because I know I have given
the time of two o'clock and a little bit
early so in the meantime I'm gonna be
saying hey to all of you hey bots mark
Mayer's how are you hate akira who hey
Rohit saying
I came late no you didn't came late hi
how are you in where where did that go
it just went so quickly now are your m
da ba da ba I enjoyed em the bad girl WA
because if it is gay boy it has to be
nan da ba that that is why mainly the
reason I was there enjoyed thoroughly
there amazing amazing Gerber then had a
lot of quick travels to to Mumbai then
to go out and back here a lot of things
like that so yes upcoming travels are
also planned up so right now let's just
give this video a thumbs up and start
our discussion and let me tell you what
are the upcoming plans for learn code
online and the star student concept and
what is this star student concept okay
so hear me out first of all and then I
would really recommend are to give your
valuable feedback to me on this concept
so I'm about to start a new page on
learn code online that is going to be
named as star student now I have seen in
the past that a lot of students are
doing really great at learned code
online they have reached to the App
Store they have reached to the Google
Play they have created amazing and
awesome websites and I somehow want to
help them more so that they can secure
their very first job or want to save
switch their job I want to help them and
what I will be doing I will be taking
their mails and everything and I will be
putting up into the star student our
section this will be a new page on learn
code online and on the star student a
section what you need to do is you need
to just send me an email with the email
subject as star student application and
inside that you have to just write what
you have done if you can write up a
small story about yourself that would be
amazing I would try to make a video on
you so that other people can get
motivation from you in case not all you
have to do is submit first of all the
link of where your projects are it can
be github it can be a personal website
or anything else if you are into app
development
sure you submit your app which is in the
app store of Play Store or maybe on the
github if you are on to the Google Play
just make sure you submit your app to me
what I will be doing there will be a
separate page a star student section and
in that I will post your picture as well
as below on that I will be posting your
links to your github account or to your
App Store this will help you to improve
your downloads on the app as well as to
visit your profile and eventually the
potential employer which we are going to
tie up in the future will be directly
contacting you based on that star
student profile again the star student
profile is not paid it will never be
paid it is always going to be a free
concept so that I can promote a
programming and your work here ok so
this is the important update that you
have and if you are looking up forward
something to post on that make sure you
post me an email at hit H at the rate
learned code online dot n or at hit H at
the rate with eachother comm the usual
one so make sure if you have created
something and you want to be get
featured at a star student write that
email and post me up that I will
definitely look up onto that and will
try to post your photo and again photos
are really important I want to make sure
that your photos you are known there I
just want to be there ok so I hope
everybody has understood what I am
trying to say here in case you were not
too much busy in writing the comments
that's are also appreciated don't send
me the jar file or anything you don't
need to send that you have to manage
your hosting or anything onto your
yourself if you are facing troubles in
that go ahead watch my videos on github
or anything so that you can have that it
can be anything starting from your C
project to your C++ Java web development
the only condition is somehow I have
helped you in that or maybe through my
website you are studying from there or
maybe through my youtube videos or just
the interaction on the email anything is
okay if I have somehow helped you and
you want to get to get featured on learn
code
line definitely go ahead and please drop
me an email okay so this is all free
hosting web link who won't be working
because they are usually spams so make
sure you invest a little bit money in
buying a domain and a hosting me you can
try a big rock
GoDaddy Hostgator Bluehost there are a
lot of good ones so go ahead a host your
website or a project anything just there
in case you don't have anything just
upload everything on github that is also
great so I hope you have understood the
concept and now we will be taking
question based on the star student
things and all of that okay so let's
make this live productive and if you
have any more suggestions what we can do
at star code start student I just go
ahead and do that okay let's take a
question
surah kanischev says what is star
students start student is somebody who
has performed exceptionally well in
learning something and that means he has
created something even just a single
page website an app maybe a Python
script or anything like that he the star
student because he have done something
okay how programmers should take care of
their eyes I don't take care much of
that I think eating green and carrots
and spinach is eat healthy eat healthy
everybody knows that what is healthy for
you so go ahead are taking a little bit
care is always good drink plenty of
water and something like that okay
office work or home based work in IT
sector which is good both have their
pros and cons like working from home is
amazing you can be little lazy can
anytime drink your iced tea or something
like that but in the office it's more
productive little bit more so both have
their own quirks and drawback okay
can you repeat your email my email is
already mentioned at my website hit a
chaudhary comm in case you want to get
exact its hit h at the rate hit HR 3
comm or you can also send me e-mail at
hit H at
code online dot in okay can we code from
mobile no I don't recommend that coding
from mobile it's not very productive
it's not very good so I don't recommend
that Raj Beach say is how hi Raj P how
are you such an good concept thank you
so much I really appreciate if you can
even post the concept is good or you
want some improvement in that later on
we are planning to have some kind of tie
ups with some recruiting organizations
so that they can technically call you
and get in touch with you all the thing
is absolutely free here so just we are
going to do that okay I want to create
an Android app but to publish an app in
play store I need to pay 15,000 okay
that's big and I can't afford tell me
what I have to do no you low case you
don't need to pay for Play Store you
don't need 15,000 it's just $30 which I
do remember if I convert that if I
convert $30 let's just say for around a
sixty five it's just like two thousand
rupees or below that so Lokesh wherever
you have got the information that you
have to pay fifteen thousand to get your
app in play store it's it's not correct
this is not fifteen thousand for Google
Play it's like 2004 Apple pay if you
want to release your app in App Store
the Apple one it's $99 I have recently
paid for that renew old my annual
subscription it's its annual thing on
the Google it's not and well it's just a
one-time payment so from wherever you
have got the information or fifteen
thousand it is somehow Miss interpreted
or is misinformed okay location I hope I
was clear there I want that great
t-shirt can you send me one
hahaha these are just regular gray
t-shirts I would look forward to if you
wish I can host a giveaway for these
boring gray t-shirts surely I can send
you one thanks for the great question on
Entourage
okay learned HTML CSS JavaScript PHP
what next I would recommend react.js if
you
learned that much already go ahead trial
react.js you will enjoy that quite a lot
edited description yes there is I will
add that in the description I will also
post a blog on that so that you can get
full information and there will be
surely a separate video on that
explaining all the concept once I finish
up this blog I will post more detailed
information about the star student
concept definitely ok I don't take
questions about mca versus MPEG or be
tagged vs. BCA it's a personal choice so
definitely i don't do that what are the
requirements of star student the
requirement is you should have finished
at least one project it can be a single
page website whatever the best you can
do and you can send it to me that would
be ok i would review on based on that
and i would also give you feedbacks on a
why you have made it to the star should
and why you haven't made it on to the
star student the ultimate goal is you
should have a project that should be
decent enough its kind of for your
portfolio that i will be hosting on
behalf of you absolutely for free of
again always in our favor love from your
crazy student thank you soo berm thank
you so much how do I join starter and
there is nothing to join in the star
student if you have made any project or
if you have made any app to send that to
me on my email along with your photo
that is required I will be posting up a
blog on that this is just now a regular
discussion if somehow with that
productive discussion we can make it a
little bit better that's I'm looking
forward make some videos on SEO friendly
URL and PHP definitely definitely I'll
make some SEO videos because our website
is booming awesomely on SEO we are
hitting a India ranking in a 9000 from 4
lakh to 9 9 thousand we have moved into
that so definitely we are going that sir
my app is live please check it this app
is only for developers yes definitely a
wrapper hub you can send me the link
along with your actual photo I would be
really happy to host that on my website
as a star student
okay please tell us about c-sharp we
will be keeping our discussion right now
on to some how to start to rain and some
regular question not discussion on that
okay Billy please explain how Android
Market works I want to know how to
monetize an app there are a lot of ways
to monetize your app the easiest way
would be AdMob and there is an option in
firebase which helps you to get your
advertisement up and running in Android
app pretty quickly so I would say go
ahead
get started on Android the firebase
whatsapp you on mobile three to five and
last but you haven't seen it I don't
keep that phone number I don't have that
mobile a lot of students are making a
calls or whatsapp on that number it's
not with me it's with the companies guys
so that is not my personal number I
don't have a personal number right now
so whatever the words that work all you
are trying to make are going to somebody
else not to me
yes of course it's reaching to learn
code online but not personally to me to
reach me personally it's either either
it's a Facebook or email or its YouTube
so how definitely you are you can reach
me through that how do I keep motivated
to work keep checking your bank balance
if it's a is a million dollar you don't
need to work if it doesn't say is a
million dollar I guess you got the idea
okay in case you need more motivation
check out your garage if it says a
couple of bikes like Harley Davidson and
Hayabusa they're probably you shouldn't
be working just enjoy your ride if it
isn't there why are you stopping there
today's quality is awesome yes I am
trying to make sure that the quality
improves a lot the audio improves a lot
but make sure you do post that setting
buttons and whoop check it to the
highest level okay a high hit age this
is Jay I am good at programming but not
much advanced level and I want to be in
industries I know HTML CSS J's MySQL pH
what I learned in order to get a job in
order to get a job whatever the skills
that you have is amazing already so
start making projects in that and host
those projects in on some website or
github or something like that can we
send our portfolio start student yes
definitely you can send your entire
portfolio but the problem here guru is I
just want a couple of links from you
that said I don't want your entire a big
page resume a I want you to send me a
just your photo and a couple links
that's it
I will be redirecting direct crowd and
direct traffic to you so that you can
get so whenever you are hosting your
websites or apps or anything you can
just send it to me this will surely help
you remember me see you soon in email
surely Shiva miles surely see you in
email I always check all of the email in
fact there will be soon videos on how in
the future we are going to manage our
emails and everything because the
traffic on the email is increasing every
single day so now support emails will be
handled separately the question regular
stuff will be handed separately this is
all under plan if you are already
student at learned code online you might
have seen the support tab and the
ticketing generation and all of that it
is right now in beta but yes the videos
will be there soon out and this concept
will grow up soon and quickly okay I
want to create apps in Play Store can
you tell me the language needed to learn
to do it we should need Java a hi Arvind
Mosley you just need to check out my
complete Android developer built an
app's course and that's it you don't
need anything else
that's at just one course okay
formal education is must know if it is
not very compulsory but I would say if
you can afford a formal education go for
it but in case there are some monetary
issues or you don't want to go that it's
not compulsory because when you post
push your app into Play Store or Android
Google Play it doesn't ask you that have
you done a BTech or have you done a PCA
it just says your app works and it says
yes that's it that's it please
make video on data structure algorithm
yes it is being created a vishwa I have
heard you I know you have posted this in
the past as well but yes videos on
algorithms like a bubble sort merge sort
heaps or these are gonna come up right
now these are getting converted and soon
will be pushed out on learn code online
so definitely we are working on that we
are hearing every single one of you
working daily five are with college and
living single also that's great okay how
stars student program helped me start
student program is there to support
people to push their portfolio to
potential employees not right now but
right now it's a good thing a good
achievement that you can write in your
resume in that hey I have been featured
in a star student at learned code online
which is a growing platform and
obviously potential employ can directly
see what is there what is not so
definitely it's going to help you quite
a lot in pushing your portfolio as well
as to write some things in your resume a
okay okay so let's just go meta tally
sorry about that hello sir hello
complete front-end web dev bootcamp what
should I do now Android or react.js I
would say react GS react GS would be
beneficial for you with that line how do
you manage your day-to-day living uh
it's complicated
I have a lot of resources a lot of
clients YouTube stuff learned code
online of course video trainings boot
camps project works a couple of
University royalty that I can say that I
have built a programs for them a lot a
lot is they're coming up from different
resources so the living is not at all
the problem yes of course buying a new
harley-davidson is a little bit one
because I'm planning I already have one
but I'm looking forward for another okay
regardless of that is it necessary to
learn all language no you don't need
yeah that's of course is YouTube earning
good enough
yes it's decent it can afford it cannot
definitely afford the whole thing that I
am doing here right now with these
expensive lenses camera setup definitely
not good enough for that but if you want
to just make a decent living it's okay
it's okay you won't be getting perks
like traveling having Beach holidays and
all of that it's not good for that but
it's decent enough okay I am good sir
okay thank you okay let's pick up more
questions how I send my Java project to
you don't send me any project just send
me the link where your project is hosted
I will check out that directly so please
don't send me any project if it will
send that I have to discard that email
no problem there okay today is tell me
about selenium learning and career
selenium is amazing and I would
recommend to go with the selenium vid
Java not with Python selenium performs
really well with Java it's an amazing
platform also with the selenium makes
sure that you learn appium as well if
you want to grow exceptionally well in
the testing field so definitely
automation testing is quite quite a
booming there so that's that's my views
on that what do you think about PHP +
react Cheers
I would say if you're using react.js
there is no need of PHP if your work is
already being done in PHP there is no
need of react yes but if you are using
react yes just as a component I think
that's fine that's good enough okay when
do you sleep actually that's a tough
question you don't need to sleep much if
you can actually replicate or what
should I say you can actually replace
your sleeping with some of the exercise
I don't sleep much it's already being
seeing from my eyes and all of that so
it's it's ok it's ok we are here to work
what about coding competition yes it's
it's very nearby and in fact giveaways
are also nearby I'm planning to host
some of the giveaways these are not
going to be regular giveaways these are
going to be giveaways of knowledge some
books
gonna be sent to your home an address
and all of that so yes giveaways are
also gonna come up coding competition
are also gonna come up okay we are
developing one new project for both
mobile and web so I'm choosing react
that's a good choice
thumbs up for that the reason behind so
I can use reuse the code for mobile is
it correct how much code can I reuse I
would say you can reuse almost almost
70% of the code from web in to mobile at
least the logic part is not going to
change the places where you are putting
up your variables or d/dx collection or
state management whatever you are doing
that is going to remain exactly same in
the mobile as well I would also
recommend to use some kind of neutral
database like firebase so that you don't
have to code much there so I would
recommend that that's a good choice
Anantha raj a very good choice for
react.js I would definitely like to
check out what you are building up if
you can share with that with me on
Facebook or mail I would be really happy
to check out that project for sure okay
so let's move on any plan to come beacon
here and there is no such plan for
beacon 8 because right now I have got a
lot of invites from universities as well
and these invites some of them are I'm
taking them up some of them are not so
good so I'm not taking them up but yes
there is a plan for Mumbai I would be
talking on event there then I have an
invitation from a vit in Chennai I I am
I may be going up there based on what
the conversation will get up in the near
future due to some holidays and
everything things are not going quickly
but yes Chennai is there in the plan
Bangalore is there in the plan so Mumbai
Chennai and Bangalore these are the
three upcoming trips that I will be
making up of course in the between there
is a Germany trip as well
so lot of lot of trips are coming up I
don't know when I will be working up so
definitely so let's just pick up more
questions thanks man thank you learning
Java offline or online I would always
recommend learn
I'm a big fan of learning online do you
skip comment yes I skip a lot of them
because that thicker actually goes so
quickly then that it sometimes just get
missed okay sir I have made an app
finally it is on the Play Store it is
not a very Pro app but it's good for
bigness whatever the app you have
created just send it to me along with
your photo I would be really happy to
feature you of it ivg thoughts on the
learned code online star section it will
give you more downloads on the app as
well as it will inspire more people that
I can make apps so you can be
inspiration so definitely send me that
okay when you are coming to Mumbai my
flight will be there to Mumbai on 7th
7th of October already tickets are being
done so I will be in Mumbai on 7th I
will be staying in area near / by the
Hiranandani Society or something like
that I am not sure about that
but yes I will be surely in the area
near Hawaii so if you can somehow afford
to travel there or something I would be
really happy to see you
okay let's pick up more questions
specific reason for learning c-sharp
what are the advantage and disadvantages
okay that's a good question
now c-sharp first of all all languages
are amazing every language has its own
specific purpose and why you should be
learning that if you are looking forward
to go into the domain which is heavily
oriented about dotnet or web development
using dotnet C shop would be a good
choice at that platform if you are
looking forward to design some games
using unity unity uses c-sharp heavily
so if you are looking forward some kind
of game design for mobile or for web
c-sharp can be a really really good
choice there are a couple of other
implementations of c-sharp as well I
don't use much c-sharp but yes it's an
amazing language the only thing that I
don't like about the c-sharp is
eventually when you work on the C shop
eventually in the future you are moving
towards the Microsoft kind of
environment like dotnet closely related
to Microsoft
and all these things so that is the main
reason why I don't use much c-sharp and
especially I don't have much clients on
the C sharp or demand of the C shop so
these are my thoughts on C sharp mark
nice okay how will I send app to you is
it an it's an iOS app surely you can
send me an app you can just send me a
link I have an iOS device as well couple
of them are lying around here definitely
I can reach a few of them I hope you can
see that this is again an iPad I do have
a couple of iPhones lying around here so
send me the link I'll surely download
that I did a project in machine learning
can I join star student high-damage
shortly you can use a star student there
as well whatever the gift have
repository or anything that you have
done
just send me surely you can join star
student open heartedly welcome okay
s s video ask an important question can
we learn Java without basics of C and
C++ 100% hundred-percent and always yes
yes yes you can learn Java directly
there is no such need of C or C++ for
that yes of course sometimes it helps
because the object-oriented programming
concepts are greatly discussed in C++
but there is no such compulsion as like
that okay just directly get started with
Java and in fact there is some big news
coming up for Java probably today or
maybe tomorrow in your email if you're
already registered and verified have
verified your email at learned code
online in case you have logged in from
Gmail or Facebook it's already verified
but you got that okay you have two
different courses about ethical hacking
and bounty-hunter pentester please tell
me the difference between them the
complete penetration testing and ethical
hacking bootcamp is for beginners and
people who have absolutely no idea about
that
the bug bounty hunter course is kind of
an intermediate course and we are very
soon gonna be launching an advanced
level course on that that will be
telling you things like burp suit and a
detail usage of Kali in 2017 WIA peas
and a lot of stuff are coming up a lot
of things are under pipeline and we are
just trying to finish them up as quickly
as we can so definitely more are gonna
come up
so basically boot camp is for the big
nurse the intermediate is bug bounty and
advanced level is gonna come up okay
where can I learn Android development
efficiently I would say learn code
online dot in okay are you on Instagram
yes Prasad I am an instructor up not
heavily active I do get active on
Instagram usually when I remember that I
do have an Instagram it's hit H zero one
four one you will be finding a lot of
pics from Egypt Jordan Parrish
Switzerland and I don't know what
countries that traveled so okay
are you a self-taught programmer I don't
call myself a self-taught programmer
because I have learned from a lot of lot
of great people from their talks
universities so not totally a
self-taught programmer but quite a lot
because I have taken a lot of online
boot camps offline boot camps video
courses from a lot of people so I have
learned from many I would call that okay
and please come in chit Cara University
for a session surely in LA if University
is going to invite me formally for that
I would love to come that just to give
you a reminder I don't charge anything
for going into the universities most of
the time yes I do take travel and stay
charges that needs to be managed by
University because it doesn't make sense
if I take out my busy time and just
spend money on traveling and just go
there to university for a talk but yes I
love to meet students and that is the
reason why I don't charge anything for
that but yes travel need to be a food
afforded by the universities okay let's
pick up more question
okay it's going really really quick
hahaha technical guru ji and bibi went
to australia that's great
I haven't went to Australia probably
I'll start I can plan something for
Australia as well I do have a couple of
friends okay let's pick up more question
okay you still haven't told me good
resource for reverse engineering : is
too old technology changes a lot
vanilla buffer overflow doesn't work on
modern apps yes of course
because information security community
is is different than programming I would
not call anything apart from that it's
different and the programming community
actually likes to share and help quite a
lot compared to pen testing community so
definitely I would say there are not
much resources to learn and all these
things you can try out and post a
subscription I think $39 per month on
Vivek Lama children's website go ahead
try that out and take a session they are
amazing okay your email hit H at the
rate hit a shot comm recently have
created hit H at learned code online
topped in as well Rahul please come to
our triple IT Jabalpur surely if if your
