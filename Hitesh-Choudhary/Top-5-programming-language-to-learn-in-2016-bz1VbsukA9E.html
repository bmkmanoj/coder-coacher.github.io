my youtube channel where we are going to
have the technical talks so we are going
to talk about a lot of stuff and of
course I would expect you to post some
questions so that I can answer them now
to in today's question we are going to
be answering a very important question
what are the top pipe programming
language on which I should be focusing
now these top five programming language
of course are going to change over the
ear of time I am talking in 2016 so this
is going to be a different scenario and
if you ask me this in later in the let's
say 2020 it's definitely going to be
different and it was really different in
2010 so let's talk about the present
scenario so what are the top five
programming language that you should be
focusing right now so it is very simple
nowadays you should definitely be
getting started with the JavaScript now
this was not something that you might
have seen as a coming because JavaScript
was not at all considered as a good
programming language to start up out
there but nowadays it's really really
important that you get started with the
JavaScript and the reason are pretty
simple that you can merge upon variety
of new technologies like like nodejs
react.js
flux GS and a tons of things are out
there so you should definitely be
getting started with JavaScript ok
that's done with the number one what
should be the second language that you
should up now I would say being a big
fan of Python I would say that you can
choose Python now choice is up to you
you might want to choose the Python or
the Ruby but I would say just opt one
and one of them can serve you as pretty
good so I would say that go for the
Python you can develop some web apps or
maybe some desktop application or pretty
much anything in the Python so that is
definitely going to be the number two
language in my list now what come up
comes up the next is going to be really
little bit tricky now I would say up
between the two language the Java or the
Swift now if you are really enthusiastic
about iPhone apps macbook application or
mac application or something like that
then it should definitely be opting out
in the Swift language otherwise you can
choose up with the Java as well if you
pretty much interested in the Android
application or desktop application just
for the windows or maybe for the Mac as
well then definitely Java should be
you're paid to go up with that but I
would say again choose between the Swift
and Java and decide your pattern right
now that where you want to end up you
want to end up with the Mac application
developer or want to end up as an
Android application developer definitely
it's not at all a good idea to just
directly jump on and learn them
side-by-side there's first of all master
any one of them and then you can move
ahead now that comes up as our number
three what should be on the number four
the number four is pretty good it should
be the PHP now some of you might say
when we have no js' or something like
that why should we focus on the PHP now
I would say the word is the Internet
world is actually quite large and a
large scale or large proportion is being
by the wordpress now WordPress runs
entirely on the PHP and if you want to
be into the web development or maybe
want to be some other technologies like
WordPress or something PHP is a must go
language okay so these are all about
what about the number five number five I
would say go with the SQL now some of
you might say this is not even the
programming language and yes I may agree
with that but that's a different story
and talk for another day right now I
would say that go for the SQL it's
really powerful it's simple it gives you
a great idea about handling the database
definitely you will be handling the
database whether going with the nodejs
or maybe some MongoDB or maybe other
kinds of database but handling the
databases is really the important task
that you want to have so definitely
let's just quickly summarize what we
can't in this movie so talk by
programming language that you should be
focusing the first one I would say that
always go with the JavaScript in the
present scenario it can lead you with a
variety of ways no js' luck chairs and a
lot of things like that number two is
going to be the Python the number three
is going to be a choice a smart choice
by you between the
and the Chava number four is going to be
the PHP and number five is going to be
the SQL now definitely I would say that
add up based on the basis of what you
like to do or where you want to go some
people would say I don't need to learn
Java or a suit or any of those I would
be moving on to the jQuery or maybe
ionic frameworks or something like that
like bone gaps and all of that but
that's up to totally you now this was my
point of view I would definitely like to
know what's your point of view on this
video okay so with this now let's end up
again I would say that subscribe like
and comment below down the videos please
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
post your questions line down below so
that I can know that what video I want
to make next or what video you want me
to make or answer such questions your
questions really make this a really
really enthusiastic video and quite fun
as well okay see you out there in the
next movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
