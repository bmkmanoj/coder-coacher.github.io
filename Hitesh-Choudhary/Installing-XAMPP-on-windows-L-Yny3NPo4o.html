WordPress series in this video we're
gonna talk about the lamp stack now
before I get started and going let me
tell you that in this WordPress series
first of all you should be aware of that
WordPress is being designed in PHP and
MySQL now in order to run the PHP and
MySQL you need a lamp stack so you might
be wondering what is this lamp stack the
lamp stack simply stands for Linux
Apache MySQL and PHP and in order to run
MySQL and PHP you need Apache which
usually run on the Linux now here's a
quick sidebar in case you want to run
your WordPress website onto a real
server just by buying a hosting and
domain make sure you are looking for a
Linux hosting not the Windows hosting or
any other hosting you're looking for a
Linux hosting yes I am aware that some
of the these domain providers and web
providers do give you special hosting
for WordPress that is fine too but you
don't need that you can just work fine
with the Linux now Linux doesn't means
you have to work on are these terminals
and command lines it has a full
graphical interface and there's no such
thing to be worried about okay coming
back onto the topic we do require a lamp
stack now these stacks are available for
all the platform Linux of course for
Linux Windows and Mac in this video we
are going to install zamp on Windows but
I'm also gonna be giving you all the
options that are available for all in
the next video we will be installing all
these things for Mac but right now here
is the windows target for us okay so of
course there are various options and
just like always in every other course I
give you all the options which are
available and I choose one of them and I
also mentioned why I'm choosing one of
them so first of all is the vamp and
notice I am always using a Google search
so that even if the link changes out a
little bit you can just find that so
this is the first guy which is a vamp
server now this is especially for
Windows it's a Windows Apache MySQL PHP
server especially being designed for
Windows it's pretty simple pretty easy
just next next right click ok I agree
install and it just gives you a in the
bottom right corner special notification
type of thing and from there you can
just install the WWE and whatever we are
going to do is also possible in the vamp
server
now my favorite one is the samp and the
reason is it's almost similar in the
interface in Windows as well as in Linux
it's kind of a very reputed one but
again I'm a big fan of zamp I always
like to use them and kind of a personal
preference but there is no such amazing
thing that you cannot do in them that
you can do in zamp it's all means the
same so yes it's available for Linux
Windows and Mac as well and the final
one is map now if I go into the map
there are two versions of the map the
map and the map Pro you don't need a map
Pro for this at least of this series you
can completely work on map again very
easy to use I already have it on my
system but still I'm gonna be installing
zamp to be honest I love the map
interface it's so simple so easy that
you can work on it but again we will
talk about the Mac guys later on map is
not available for Windows as of now even
there are some things working on with
the windows things but it's not working
that well so I won't recommend that on
Windows as well now there is one more
option known as bit Namie now this is
very popular and in case you want to
work on a new kind of a you are kind of
an advanced user you might want to check
this out because it gives you a lot of
freedom with this thing now bitNami can
be installed pre-installed with a
wordpress kind of thing you can have a
wordpress and already being set up I
don't recommend this also for this
special course because we will be
exploring the WordPress quite in detail
yes if you are an advanced user of that
level of PHP you can always go with this
guy it's amazing and I would say there
are a lot of options that you can work
in especially the cloud option that you
can run the entire bitNami into a cloud
in case you are using like Amazon Web
Services or Oracle cloud platform or
something like that then it's amazing
and it can be run totally on to the
browser as well so yes kind of a very
good but not our choice in this entire
series we're gonna be using Zam yes just
always my duty to tell you how about the
other options as well okay
let's minimize this guy and move back to
our Windows this is our Windows doesn't
look really amazing but this is what we
have so I have already installed
I have already downloaded the stamp not
installed but always vamp is also an
option let's minimize this and it's a
vamp server here I'm gonna double click
on that and installation is pretty
simple I'm gonna just click on yes there
and basically you always have to walk
through with yes yes I agree yes and
usual kind of stuff and you can see the
samp is also being configured for
bitNami and all these things so it says
let's just click on ok next and it says
what all the things that you want to
install now it also installs like us web
mail PHP myadmin and all these things we
do require all of that now for this
course you don't require Tomcat and
Mercury mail server or FileZilla FTP
server but still these are good options
I'm going to left them as it is and I'm
gonna install that into C colon slash
zamp make sure you note down this
directory because it's gonna be handy
for some time ok I don't want to learn
more about the bitNami I already know
about it but in case you want to do go
ahead and do that it's pretty easy
now installation will unpack the files
and we'll do regular stuff so I'm going
to fast forward the video here
okay so finally the installation is done
and it's asking me do you want to start
the control panel now is of course I do
want to start that and there we go it
says which you really want to have and
I'm gonna go with the English and save
not a good way of actually asking for
that with that flag there I don't
recommend that but still what we can do
okay so things looks really good and
what I want to do is start a couple of
services like Apache MySQL these are the
ones that I would like to start right
now
so let's just go ahead and start this
and start this guy as well and yes
always allow the internet access there
okay and make sure you are having an
exception firewalls as well and there we
go it has started okay and now it says
it's running looks pretty good and we
are and I always recommend to is to halt
the server and install the web browsers
or something like Chrome if you're on
the windows you might be already having
that and let's just start with the
config and looks pretty good
okay standard things and let's just also
explode into exploder okay so this is
all the fold all the folder that you are
gonna require notice it's inside the c
drives amp and the one important folder
that you should be looking up is the
htdocs now inside the htdocs you will
find a lot of folders and this is where
we are gonna keep all of our file inside
the htdocs it's super important okay
let's just try and launch it and make
sure that it works I'm not pretty sure
it's gonna run really well on this
browser but let's just see and we're
gonna call oops
localhost there okay so in case you hit
the localhost and you see something like
this that means everything is working
fine let's also verify going into the
PHP myadmin and there we go our PHP
myadmin is also working fine but they
had a couple of settings that you have
to do in the Mac it's not this is simple
really simple but in the Mac you have to
do one more configuration we will talk
about that in the next video don't worry
about that
so looks everything looks pretty good
pretty fine to me make sure that you
keep an eye on this htdocs folder
whenever you're going to create a new
folder inside in here it is going to be
reflected there just for an example I'm
going to right click click on the name
and I'm gonna create a folder that says
lco and I'm gonna go inside this and I'm
gonna create a new file here okay and
new text document it's gonna be called
as index dot HTML and there we go still
it's a text document and the reason is
there are some options which are hidden
so I'm gonna delete that and I'm gonna
simply say delete I want to create an
HTML file so let me open up a text
editor and in case I do remember I do
have sublime here there we go and make
sure you have an editor at least a
sublime text and we're gonna write
something oops
HTML come on I don't have an Emmitt here
but again we can just have an h1 tag no
big deal and let's just write a test
here h1 come on there we go and we're
gonna save this inside our C Drive this
PC and we want to go into C Drive okay a
lot of folders and drives are there make
sure you are able to find your C Drive
okay in the zamp we're gonna go into
htdocs and inside the LC oh and we're
going to name this as index dot HTML
click on save and there we go we are
having a file now in order to access
this file all you have to do is go onto
your localhost and instead of PHP
myadmin
oops not like that you have to just
write whatever your folder name is in
this case it's LC oh so this is a basic
run of how you run the programs and
files how to find them and all these
things this is a basic thing so make
sure you have a Chrome browser I would
highly recommend that I will be using
the chrome throughout this course and
I'll be using Apache MySQL this is amp
stack throughout this course and also
make sure you have a couple of browsers
I do recommend sublime tech
an atom to be installed on your system
all the time so that's it and I think we
have done a pretty good job in
installing all the things for all the
windows and in case you are facing any
problem do notify me in the discussion
section or in the comment section I
would be looking forward for that so
that's it for this video and I'll surely
catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
