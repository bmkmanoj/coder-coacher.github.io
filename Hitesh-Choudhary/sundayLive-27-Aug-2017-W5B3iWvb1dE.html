Sunday life and in case you are new to
the channel we do Sunday live every
Sunday the timings are not yet fixed but
still we do it every Sunday to just
answer your question discuss things and
what not so let's get started and start
today's a Sunday life and I know this
was I usually try to make all of these
Sunday lives during afternoon almost 12
o'clock but today it was a busy day and
I had a meeting then had a plan to go
out for a lunch then swimming at the
evening and finally am back so there we
go and we're gonna wait for a few
moments just like we always do and I
just say hello hi to everybody like
hello million hello my young hello flex
hello yes hello Anil hello little sharm
Shubham our own Ravi yes a lot of people
a lot of people are joining up but I
know a lot of people forget to hit that
like button because that is why we are
doing all of these live and this is your
love who is making this channel so much
popular and I'm trying my best to help
you to assist you to take up whatever
the technology you'd like to choose just
go in that get started okay so hit that
like button do you forget that I think I
think a lot of you forgot that and as
you can see now we are getting better
and better every single day
like in the live stream as well the
quality of the videos are getting better
every single day
it's more colorful anymore okay so let's
get started and take up start taking the
questions I know a lot of you still
didn't hit that like button
come on let's go let's go hit that like
button and let's pick up for your
questions okay so I'm gonna pick up
could you say a few words about the
future of artificial intelligence now
great question
MCB Tech yes artificial intelligence is
growing up quite a lot and I see really
really great future in that but right
now it's just getting started it's some
kind of technology which is being
accessible only by the big giants and I
see the technology being successful when
it's available in each and every hand
but again I do understand that it's
fairly in the new era of the artificial
intelligence but surely surely it's
going to evolve a lot what we are seeing
right now is not even the version 1 it's
going to evolve quite a lot but this
doesn't mean it's gonna take its gonna
be a hurdle in the job of the
programmers no it's not gonna be it's
almost like something when I remember it
when I was too young and the computer
just came into the market of in market
they were trying to take over into the
Indian government sector everybody went
out that hey I'm gonna go into the
strike and computers are gonna take all
of her job people were scared it's okay
at that point of time and now everybody
can see that how efficient the computers
are and how much job they has given to
us so there is no need to be afraid with
artificial intelligence II consider it
as your friend and certainly there is
not going to be any Terminator movie
going on so it's not gonna happen
anytime soon but yes there is a great
future and in case you want to get
started with the artificial intelligence
we have already discussed in the
previous videos the tensorflow and psych
it are some of the libraries which you
should take a look on that but before
also going into that libraries take a
look at the Python your Python should be
absolutely good without that we cannot
actually move into the AI right now
python is the only language which is
holding a very strong hold on the AI and
very soon more languages like java
javascript swift all of these are gonna
jump in just recently Swift has also
jumped in into the AI and machine
learning so definitely more languages
will come ok I've said a lot of words
about this so let's get started here
let's take a one more interesting
question by Babu Kumar it says I have
installed Android studio in my laptop
intel vt-x is not supported in my laptop
is there any
native to run virtual device can I use
my Android physical phone to my
application is it very very good
question now in fact I recommend all of
the people who are having kind of a
small RAM in numbers of course I would
highly recommend you to just run all
these apps on your hardware device the
phone one because what you do sometimes
maybe you're facing a problem although
your intel vt-x problem can be solved I
think I think by going into the bias
mode and enabling that virtual mode
there just have a look on how to enable
VTX from bias you have to restart your
computer I hit that Escape key or f1 key
and just like that but again coming back
on to the point certainly I would
recommend all of you to just use your
phone as a virtual device it's faster
it's more efficient because I did had 32
gigs of the RAM so everything is gonna
be running smooth in my machine but it's
not the case for everybody so I highly
recommend to go ahead and use your phone
that that's a very good option actually
so thank you so much for having an
interesting question bubble I really
appreciate that okay what is your age
let's get that probably we will talk
about my personal life maybe someday
what is asp.net good question there Ravi
it's gonna help a lot of beginners when
we make website when we design website
there are basically two parts of the
website the front-end part what you see
because let's just assume the Facebook
what you see on the front-end part like
you click on the button the like button
the heart emojis and all of that
these are front-end part and all of your
data how you log in and everything is
being stored at the server now to
communicate with the server there are
lot of languages there can be asp.net
there can be PHP there can be JavaScript
and tons of others like Ruby and Python
and asp.net happened to be one of them I
hope I was clear in what is asp.net how
to become a this is equation by Krishna
again I laugh I received a lot of
comments last time that I
not naming us I'm trying my best
sometimes I do forget and make sure you
do hit that like button I'm trying to
answer the questions more thoroughly
today I'm trying my best okay
and I do really need your love and
support keep coming because that's kind
of a healthy juice for me to get going
okay so our next question is from
krishna mohan d how to become a game
developer i'm a fresher where to start
thank you okay to get started with the
game development I would recommend you
to get started with c-sharp c-sharp
recently has proven a great great
language in the game development after
you have mastered the C shop go ahead
and get started with unity now again a
unity is a game engine it's kind of a
language each thing not exactly language
but language each thing where you learn
about the game physics how the gravity
is going to behave how the collision of
the game behave how what is going to
happen when the bullet collides with
your player how much damage you are
going to get all these things can be
done in the game engines and unity is
one of them again there are a lot of
other engines but I certainly do
recommend unity recently for the indie
game developers it has it has kind of
just blown the market lot of jobs are
kind of the new in the market and very
easy to learn as well so get started
with the c-sharp and then try to learn
unity it can be learned on Windows Mac
any any laptop there it is not just like
that it's free as well of course if your
game is doing like really awesome you
have to pay a little bit fees but if
your game is gonna be doing just good
like that for sure you are gonna have
money for that it's free for the
beginners okay next question is from
Karthik Shetty girl when can we expect
the web design competition web design
competition is going to happen probably
in the September mid or September end
the reason why I shifted it a little
it was planned to happen up in like
September first week but I have a lot of
new updates coming up from four learned
code of online like new website new back
and kind of a more fast and efficient
things as well as completely revamped
Android and iOS app and that is why
things got delayed a bit it is going to
happen let's just say in the end of
September and there is no end time going
to be there because there is going to be
a project that I'll post about a blog
everything that here is the data here is
the everything you just have to there is
a there is going to be an already
website on the web and you have to
redesign it okay so you can you even
have your full liberty for Google things
use jQuery whatever you want to do you
will have full right to do so and you
will be just redesigning that entire
website and the person who is going to
do this redesigning thing will get the
cash whatever the cash is going to be it
is going to be really good it will be
good enough to get you support for at
least like five or six courses or seven
or ten courses that you can buy anywhere
but it's going to be cash and the best
part is you are also going to get your
name at the bottom footer of the website
what you'll be designing so that you can
present that as your portfolio and can
show some people that hey this is the
work that I have done okay
so expect that hit to happen in like
September end I hope I was clear there
okay so tell something about ethical
hacker life ah I will make a separate
video on ethical hacking how to hack
Android in like 10 seconds or like that
all of these things will come up but
it's amazing life it's something that is
exciting every single day but I feel
that as a developer it's much more
challenging because you have to stop all
those hacking things enough but I do
recommend everybody should have basic
knowledge of all these attacks if you
are getting started in development field
and everything so that you can
understand when somebody is saying hey
what is SQL injection what is CSRF what
is cookie session hijacking and all
these things you
so I think just like I say that every
programmer should have an understanding
of HTML every programmer should also
have basics little bit basics of ethical
hacking ethical and so on things okay
okay next question is Arun Elana well
Ani sorry about that
not good at pronouncing the names okay
future of cyber security without degree
and certification okay I think this is
one of the field which has proven that I
don't need your certification I don't
need your degree if you have great
knowledge in cyber security most of the
people who are providing the jobs
required two kind of things first of all
you have proven yourself like
extraordinary by hitting the bug
bounties writing some amazing blogs
which are just describing all those
concepts so very clearly to just see
what's going on in here
so that's the point number one which
companies usually look up for bug
bounties lot of appreciation letters and
all these things and second part is how
much you have designed in the
information security and this is the
point where a lot of people lag for
example let me clear this up for example
you are a hacker who has won a tons of
bug bounties maybe through CSRF and
everything and still after that just a
three four or five years you don't have
even a single tool on your name maybe
it's just an SQL injection - that's it
it doesn't do much of the things but it
proves that you have programming skills
as well and you can write a couple of
scripts as well on your end if you have
those two things I think your degree and
certification are gonna just stand just
like there but again if you have that
this doesn't means I'm promoting to just
leave your certification and degree no
I'm not doing that you should continue
with your degrees as well but if you
don't have that's not a compulsion okay
next question is from Mohammed Omar how
Facebook app work and the Saint so
nicely on the web app Android and iOS
app in case you are not aware of that I
highly recommend you to check out my
previous video which was on react
native Facebook is shifting all towards
the react and moreover kind of in the
MySQL database in mongos and all these
things but yes most of the thing I would
say the credit goes to the react and
react native that is why they're all of
the apps are getting synced just like
perfectly and seamlessly but again there
is a lot of things going on at the
Facebook probably I will I have a couple
of friends at Facebook working every
single day there I will try to bring
them up on my channel and would like to
have a little bit chitchat of how the
Facebook work environment is and how do
they word in fact I am in a direct touch
with the firebase team as well working
on lot of new things a lot of NDA is
being signed up there so yes definitely
in the future I will try to bring them
up on my channel as well okay how do you
learn to code I most of the time I have
reached to the stage where most of the
time I read the documentation and that's
all about it okay a lot of questions
let's take one of them more okay in the
meantime you can hit that like button
and I can just fill up a little bit for
me so don't forget to hit that like
button it's the like button that keeps
me going up it's your love otherwise
picking up so much time for the YouTube
is really tough thing but you are the
guys you are a motivator for me
okay let's take more questions
Mahindra Kumar says servility
worth learning Python absolutely
absolutely there is not going to be any
time in the future in the upcoming Mir
future when I'll be saying no don't
learn Python it's not gonna happen any
single day at any given point of time
you want to learn Python just go for it
it's one of the most beautiful language
I have ever seen but by the way I'm a
big fan of JavaScript and sweet but
still there is no debate about the
beauty of the Python and how much
powerful this language is but again as I
said every language is dependent for
each of its own tasks for example if I
would like to design like Android apps
or iOS app using Python I would be a
food I won't be doing that but yes it's
a language which open ups you a lot of
concepts challenging every single day
lot of tons of libraries to read around
it's very exciting things so don't worry
just get started with the Python and
that's it don't think about it okay
Shiva metal body says you are best thank
you so much I do really appreciate that
sir please start Java language tutorial
there is something going on with Java
and that is big and very soon it's gonna
come up I cannot discuss more than this
but yes there is something cooking up
there okay suggest some Android app to
create create a snapchat create a uber
clone you've got the two ideas and I
would like to see them as well
Oh a car kini I'm sorry about the name I
hope you forgive me there Agni ho3 says
when it comes to machine learning is it
all together related to artificial
intelligence no it's it's kind of a very
narrow boundary between the two but yes
they are closely related but not
completely equal they are different they
are different machine learning I
personally think it's more over close to
data mining and it's more about just
feeding the data and training the model
and then growing it in AI is a little
bit different than that so yes they are
very close kind of a branch of each
other but yes they are different as well
Milind says please tell us where to
learn complete JavaScript for react and
react native I don't think so you need
anything extraordinary because my RIA if
you know the basics of JavaScript that's
okay otherwise I do have a course at
learn code online dot in for the
JavaScript and in my react yes course
the basics of like extra javascript es6
is already being covered so you can try
out and check that ok once the Java is
not capable of AI this is a debatable
question and I know a lot of people are
doing just jump on me if I'll just say
no it's not capable it's not like that
actually honestly it's not like that
it's because there is no such big
library that has came out to support AI
or even machine learning for Java but
it's not gonna just like remain like
that obviously third-party libraries
come up very soon and it's gonna come up
very soon like for example Swift used to
doesn't have a support for AI or machine
learning and the third-party library
like vision came up and now it supports
so soon there will be some libraries
which are gonna come up and you will get
to know about them from my channel I'm
pretty sure about that and I'm trying
I'm working with a lot of people to get
some exclusive news about like what is
happening at Facebook what's new
recently roll up gonna be come up I'm
also in the touch with a Google
Department firebase to just check out
what's going to come up recently so that
I can be the first guy to tell you what
is going to happen and how the things
are working so these are going to come
up cause the coach says how are you -
I'm good I'm doing good how are you um
Kay creation so your front-end developer
course is enough to become web developer
yes it's completely enough to get
started in fronting not in the backend
for the backend I
recommend react.js or PHP course but
with a front-end also you can just get a
lot of their work and something like
that and the Krishnan Gupta is spamming
here that's not good Krishna don't spam
here it's not good thing okay hi sir
when did you start programming okay I
don't remember that exactly like it's
been eight years or nine years or so
something like that that I have been
coding I don't remember exactly but yeah
that must I am sir I have sent you mail
captioned react native versus mobile
native please reply oh yes I have
actually already a video on my youtube
channel which says native app versus
hybrid app but for reactive and mobile
native I can certainly do a video very
soon but they are almost same because
react native produces mobile native app
and that's it which is the best
programming language for future to learn
now there is no such one language that
is gonna be just hey learned this and
that's it that's you are done for the
life no it's not like that
in the programming field you just keep
on learning keep on learning grow
quickly you can get started with depends
on what you really want to do if you
want to go into the android field get
started with java or cut length for the
iOS swift is going to be your choice for
web development there are tons of
options like javascript php.net nodejs
django Ruby on Rails and probably I miss
the money so there's no such one thing
depends on what is your goal you want to
become a better developer Android iOS
maybe machine learning data scientist
what do you want to do it it is heavily
dependent on that Mister okay it's a
Royal programmer what is your source of
learning
mostly documentation and hanging around
on some good blogs and just a can look
at the actual tech news which is
happening in the country or in the world
just like that that's
resource with most of the time I have
actually signed a few NDA's I cannot
discuss more about it because it's a
nondisclosure agreement I cannot
disclose it to anybody but yes I have
signed a couple of non-disclosure
agreements with big gums like Google and
a couple of others as well I cannot
discuss that sorry about that but they
are most of the time my resources they
give me early access of learning that
tech and doing some projects on that and
that's my resource to learn the new
things
ok so let's pick up more question Harini
Seaver arm says this video is awesome
can you upload data analytics video how
to start with that yes surely we can
work on data analytics just basics of
how things goes on because I don't work
personally in the data analytics
department but yes surely I can give you
some basics the idea that you can get
started on your own I will try to do
that ah what is react license
controversy yes that is going on but
nothing to be big and worried about
react is gonna stay are there there is
no much controversy sometimes these
companies try to take a little bit hold
of what they have created I don't think
that is the wrong thing but there is
nothing to be worried there
hey tej how was the experience so far on
the Lenovo 310 laptop any heating issues
no no heating issues and that is being
used very thoroughly a lot of virtual
machines are running on it specially the
Kali and there are some testing going on
with palette sack as well no issues so
far if there will be any you will be
hitting me ranting about it on my
Facebook page so far and so forth it's
going great I started learning machine
learning what are the things where
should I focus much I would say creating
applications because in machine learning
creating data models and applying that
model is something which you should be
looking up like for example recently the
model which can detect like objects it
has like a thousand categories being
there so
can design and come up with that
something I know this is this is a very
much big thing to ask but if you can do
something like that that all the people
can use because everybody just talked
about learning learning I want to learn
I want to learn but nobody is there
still who says that I want to learn as
well as help other as well as soon as
you are going to be learning the tech
you will be gone I'm not talking about
all of you but most of it you will be
just learning the technology you'll be
starting working on some jobs and doing
the work and that's it and that is the
reason there are so much kind of a less
resource in learning the things for the
bigness because as soon as the people
learn they just leave so if you can
contribute back to something to the
community that would be the awesome
thing for machine learning gasps okay
how big apps like Amazon or Facebook
word work and think so nicely on web app
Android and iOS app because they have
the same database most of the time and
everything is being fetched through API
from their database and just like that
Robbie says hi Nissan Farah says the
intro on 68 special was good
make that default intro I can think
about it because I have to chop it from
the video I don't have the raw files I
deleted that I shouldn't have but I have
actually deleted that I have to chop it
back from I do have a backup of the
exported file but not the original raw
file so wait do you know every time I
will be saying pointing out there and
saying 60k probably I can do that
something like that very soon okay I
made a video how to enable VTX on my
channel please check out there shortly
you can check out that it's a good video
I think so I haven't seen that today is
okay today is one of the happiest day in
my life for catching my favorite teacher
on life I used to watch the playback of
the live videos every Sunday after
church but I'm live with you today so
happy hi thank you so much flex I really
appreciate that a lot of people are able
to join up today I am thinking to fix up
a time for that but you know it's really
hard for me to just fix a time and all
come back at that time meetings work
home friends lot of codes so it's kind
of a tough thing for me let's see more
questions react juice or angular and why
it if you'll ask me just in a single
word I would say react GS and for the
just one short answer for the why you
don't have to learn the typescript for
that because for the angular there is a
new language typescript this is kind of
a subset of JavaScript but our superset
of JavaScript not subset but yes there
is a new language to learn up for the
angular and how many language we are
gonna just keep on banging there so
that's why I picked up the react okay
let's pick up more questions hello
Rasika Condrey cond re I sorry about
that but I'm trying my best to say hello
to everybody I believe you are from
Mumbai I I'm just assuming from your
name pardon me if I'm wrong okay what is
the scope of PHP PHP is never going out
of the market even for the small
projects it's always there it can be
used for a big project as well but I
most of the time use PHP for small ones
and recently I've moved my entire
learned code online website some part of
it are totally into the PHP because it's
far more easier to maintain when can we
expect a web design competition surely
you should check rewards this video I
have talked about it already
hello sir good evening can you suggest
me I'm confused that whether should I
learn Python or Java what is your end
goal whether you want to go into the
Android kind of a thing go with the Java
if you want to go kind of a data thing
some scripting or InfoSec information
security go with the Python so you never
answer my question creative Jay how to
get a great job without certificate do
extraordinary great project build up
something more powerful than a snapchat
or whatsapp you'll have a great job
come on this is this is not a thing that
you will have a great job on the day one
no it's a struggle everybody has to do
it I'm just trying to be realistic with
you because it's not like a magic thing
programming is not like a magic thing
that you're going to do it on the very
first day so yeah it's something like
that is it possible to make an app which
have a snapchat like camera feature with
react native in fact Santosh we can do a
small project on my youtube channel
making a snapchat using react native
what do you think about it and yes to
answer your question you can use camera
gps all those features and react native
no big deal ok let's pick up more
question what is the scope of WordPress
it's a good scope but again if you don't
know what is happening under the hood
like what is happening at HTML CSS
JavaScript bootstrap and PHP there is no
good feature so first of all make sure
you look up under the hood what is
happening and then you switch onto the
WordPress
I recommend your course to four people
and they liked it very much thank me to
that thank you so much heavy shake want
to develop Android app with IntelliJ
IDEA is it possible yes it's possible a
lot of people do that but I don't I use
the Android one I like it it's really
fast no sir I'm from Pune I visit Pune
as well Rasika I have a very close
friend at Pune so I I was at him quite a
lot and next time I'll be inputting I'll
post an update so that at least we can
all of the people who are living in the
Puna you can join me up there or there's
a recent plan for Bangalore as well I
will be Bangalore very soon I'll post
updates so that at least you guys can
say hello to me ok sir you are doing
great job job keep it up thank you so
much Vijay in the car marker thank you
what is the new version of learned code
online is going to release when is the
new version of learned code online is
going to release reset I think probably
this
in week or the first week of September
we are trying to push it really really
fast but I'm not getting much time I
have a like hired a couple of other
people as well to assist me in that all
they are all my students actually from
my courses they are trying to help
working really hard I'm paying them as
well they are paid interns for this
project as well
and yes expected on second week of
September most of the updates are going
to be on app side not on the website
side very soon so expect updates in the
app okay and in case you are not yet
aware go ahead download the learned code
online app on Android as well right now
this app is a test run this is not the
complete and full version again test run
only that means I just pushed it without
thinking much about it the next update
that we're gonna get in this app is
going to fix all the bugs right now
there is a major work of login issue
with the Google that is going to be
fixed up and other things like Facebook
and all the things are gonna be fixed up
so it's gonna be there hi Paige Samir
okay hi village from where do we get the
information on the new technologies and
trends on app and software development
mostly directly from the resource like
Google Facebook I do have links good
links that's kind of a good thing I have
built up by working with that and I do
have some great resources in France as
well so I get that from here okay let's
pick up more questions sir how to make a
chat bot and this is a controversial
thing I should not be admitting it but
yes a few months ago my Facebook page
was having a bot and I shouldn't have
done that but yes recently my facebook
page was having a bot and all the
replies which say is hi it was
automatically replied to them hello and
all those hello were being replied back
to hi and all those things they said how
are you and that says I'm good and how
are you
all these replies were being
done by a bot it's kind of a chat bot
that I build up I realize it's not a
good thing to do this so I just kept it
back so probably a future I will make a
video how to make this kind of
automation bot you can probably use AI
or Bashir letting him bat as well I
didn't did that but yes I did that I had
with that and probably in the future
I'll teach you guys as well how you can
make all these BOTS and everything for
Facebook so that it can automatically
answer your questions to anybody who
just message you I do these kinds of
things sometime okay
Babak say is nice name there Babak
really nice impressed
hi love from Bangalore hello good
evening sir what about data analytics
and AI courier it's good opportunity you
should get started don't think too much
about it
have you ever visit be canary yes I have
visited beacon a with my Harley Davidson
as well as couple of other visitor as
well I have visited the beacon aid
Engineering College in fact I did had
two times guest lectures there it was a
long time ago but yes I have visited
Baconator okay so let's pick up
questions can you remove deadline from
course
no because ethically it would be wrong
now I always say is that there is no
such thing as infinite there is no such
thing as unlimited there is no such
thing as lifetime access because all the
times in their privacy policies and all
these things they just write something
like that like it's accessible for only
five years and something like that I
just like to be transparent to you guys
that in all the courses are accessible
for three years if you want to extend
your line after that as well just keep
your recipient be with yourself and just
ping me on the mail and I can extend
your deadline there
but yes just saying that hey this course
is life time for you
and later on let's just say something
bad happened to me or maybe my website
and you just say hey I was having in
lifetime access now give me access back
and this can be really troublesome so I
don't like to do that I just say that
three years and obviously on to the
other hand if let's just say there isn't
a course on iOS or Android it's going to
get outdated very soon probably in two
years or something and I have to release
a new updated course for that what
you're going to do with that outdated
course and if you are not able to learn
the technology in three years I doubt
that you will be able to learn that in
the near future as well when you join up
any Institute or something you get a
deadline that this you are joining this
Institute for let's just say 15,000 for
just for one month or two month it's far
more better than that whenever you feel
that these courses are expensive or
having less deadlines just try to
compare them with the offline Institute
I would recommend that okay
let's answer more questions sir what is
your favorite language no favorite not
even a single one because my favorite
language is what the client needs
if client says work in Java I am
absolutely a fan of Java at that moment
my client says I'm gonna pay you and
work in iOS and Swift I am a big fan of
Swift at that time if my client says hey
work on angular I will be working in
that so for me it's just a client okay
okay I need to just kind of a block a
few guys as well who are you see the
abusive language so surely we'll be
doing that for sure don't worry I'm
coming out sir I'm learning it's a
question from ABBA Shaikh so I'm
learning PHP right now and want to learn
more but I want to know that which one
will provide better future by the Python
or Java because someone suggested me to
learn how to do everybody is going to
suggest you things and somebody is going
to say learned Edo so I learn
to learn data analytics learn Python
everybody's going to sail just like that
you are into PHP right now that's great
try to just master it first of all
because I think I believe that you are
more interested in web development so I
would say just go with the PHP first of
all don't think about how to Java Python
hey focus on PHP first of all once you
have mastered that then only go with
something else okay and again depends on
what you really want to do you can just
go with that
okay so let's pick up more questions or
when is Android app challenge coming up
very soon first of all let me update my
own app then probably we can throw up a
few challenges okay
let's wake up for questions a couple of
more only because I'm feeling a little
bit hungry haven't eat anything in a
long time so I'm feeling a little bit
hungry I'll be staying a little bit more
time with you and you can ask more
valuable questions so that this live
session can help people
the major funder here is to help you
people to start learning programming
okay can we have Kotlin Android tutorial
like which you have iOS course already
Kotlin Android course is there there is
not big gigantic course on that just two
apps but it is they're already at
learned code online dot in oh okay
this is Sivarama back again with another
send a live another question please make
or some game development okay so very
soon we will try to make at least one
game using unity I cannot promise it in
the very near future because for the
game you have to bring up assets music
scenes backgrounds a lot of characters
lot of things are there in the game I
did word on one project in unity it was
nightmare
to work on they're not because unity was
tough because the design part was so
heavy so that is why okay Oh let's pick
up a couple of more questions okay it's
just keep rolling it it's it's like
literally becoming very hard to read and
you have the questions now it's just
keep on rolling like that I have to just
go a little bit am i late a little bit
to show you a little bit late not much
because I'm feeling hungry I'm trying to
get out now
single yes of course why are you asking
okay hello husband such in good evening
Sachin how are you doing I do check out
a lot of your comments on my facebook
page I do keep an eye okay that sounds
Python projects are very soon so can you
visit our College ad but though there
are part of the University for seminar
surely I can visit if your college can
invite me and can pay me for my travel
and my hotel surely I can visit I don't
charge anything for seminar for the
college but of course if I'll be paying
from my pocket to travel and stay that I
think is not I'm good for my business
and my future resources but surely I
have actually being invited by a few
colleges I'm trying to make sure to pick
up like fixed schedules so that I can
visit those colleges can interact with
the people live in their college that
would be much more awesome but yes do
invite me at my email hit H at the rate
hit HR 3.com leave that in right there
okay enable slow mode I will try that
let's see let's pick up more questions
please make a video about competitive
programming a very soon love from Punjab
let me tell you one thing go breathe I
have visited Punjab a couple of times I
absolutely loved it especially there was
a restaurant there in the Punjab
Amritsar known as
brothers I forgot the name it was
something like brothers restaurant or
brothers something amazing food I can
literally just visit the Punjab just for
that one restaurant I loved how the
people treat everybody in the Punjab
it's amazing it's amazing if you all
those guys who have never visited Punjab
it's you should visit it especially the
food in the golden temple it's it's
fantastic and especially the Brother
restaurant if somebody can name that
restaurant Africa that what was that
brother brother something it was amazing
so I would like to visit Punjab very
soon just for that food okay a very
interesting question rubbish Shekar says
Jack of all and master of none does it
apply encoding - I don't think so it may
be maybe not but if somebody it's like
something if somebody knows what the
programming about Cody actually is he
can code in high-res android surfing
everything so I think he should be a
jack of coding and that's it that's it
it should not be worried about there but
whatever whatever that is just learn the
concepts and you'll be jack off
everything okay
I don't think so it does apply in
programming sir have you ever visited
Assam yes I did gave a lecture in IIT
Guwahati and EH Purdue University as
well so yes I have visited Assam little
bit scary experience for me because I
the van just in front of me who is going
a little bit faster and we start for a
drink or something that when faced some
incidents it was a little bit scary
there but again Assam is beautiful i I I
stayed in the tej for university it was
awesome so yes I have visited as far as
well okay so let's pick up more
questions sir what are your views on
blue whale game all I can say about it
it's really sad that this people are not
talking about this game and they are
just trying to hide it from their
children it's not something that you can
hide it from children's and small young
ones in fact you should be the first one
who should
be discussing what the blue whale game
is but the children's are curious kind
of thing and if you'll not ask them or
tell them what the blue whale game is
and how dangerous it can be they're
gonna just explore it on their own so I
would recommend everybody to talk about
it
okay so pick up your young ones and just
have a random conversation and ask them
hey I sit here I want to tell you about
a very dangerous game that you should
not be playing it's it's called the game
but it can be life and death situation
and just explain their whole concept
what is going on how they give you their
task and just blackmail you and all of
that so that I can say but really at
first I was worried that we should be
worried about the children's in the
country but recently with the recent
incidents in punjab and haryana how make
me realized that it's not the children
we should be worried about we should be
worried mode about the Edit ones who are
just following randomly any guard man
there it's it's kind of a sad thing that
makes me sad so I would be saying all
that instead of the children we should
be more worried about uneducated edits
that's all I can say okay
meet up in Vadodara Gujarat probably not
very soon love from Tamil Nadu ah yes I
have visited Tamil Nadu as well I
traveled a lot probably I can talk about
it later as well but he has done a lot
to meet up with hamachi
yes I was there at hey Marshall
University as well I forgot the name of
a Marshall University but I forgot the
name absolutely forgot but I gave a
lecture guest lecture there as well have
traveled a lot in which country do you
live I love from Greater Noida am from
India I live in Jaipur most of the time
but I stay in I love to stay in Paris in
Switzerland as well most of the time I
tried to spend my time there as well
because I love the beauty there and
Europe is one of the place where I can
just sit quietly and work for days
that's why I travel there okay
a lot of questions are just coming up
and just keep going on keep going on
like that it's really hard and probably
if I'll just type anything here it would
be almost impossible to read it okay but
this I would be saying finally that hey
keep coding keep programming and make
sure you appear other people about the
massacre that is going up with a blue
whale as well as some of the guard man's
going on there so yes make sure you keep
aware all these people's right now
feeling a little bit hungry so I have to
get back to go have some food and then
again some big things are going on so
get back here so thank you so much
everybody for joining up make sure you
hit that like button I do really
appreciate for coming up joining up I
try my best to have a discussion with
all of you try to clear up all of your
queries but whatever the field you are
choosing whatever the programming
language you are choosing whatever the
course wherever you are taking either on
learn code online on any other platform
just keep coding just keep coding no
matter wherever you are whatever you're
doing just keep coding with this thank
you so much bye bye I'll surely catch
you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
