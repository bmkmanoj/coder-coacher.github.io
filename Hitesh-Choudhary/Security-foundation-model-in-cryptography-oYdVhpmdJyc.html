you are enjoying the course and you will
enjoy even more when I will get into the
deeps so first of all let's just scratch
the surface and try to get deep into it
in today's topic we have got standard
security system there is a standard
security model that you can follow while
studying the cryptography or any kind of
protocol design or anything and we have
just obvious situations in these
standard or ideal security system so
let's take a look on it so this is the
general security system that we have and
you can see it's having a simple diagram
here now let us try to understand this
diagram so now that we understand a
couple of terms not much of the terms
which will get clear with the course we
can take a look at general or standard
security model of information if we take
a look at the diagram we can easily
understand that our plaintext is shown
as message second we need mechanism to
scramble our text message and this can
be done with the help of encryption
algorithm along with an encryption
algorithm we need some secret which both
the receiving and sending party should
have we can call this secret information
as key once we have cipher text next
step is to get a reliable source or
channel which can transfer the message
although our message is in ciphertext
but still I would focus on using a
reliable transfer channel of course why
should I make it easier for attacker
even to get my ciphertext the task is
not just to make information unreadable
but also to make it readable again using
the same ciphertext and secret
information the process of the time uses
same encryption algorithm but in reverse
order so I hope the scenario is a bit
clearer let me just revise it one more
time we have got a message we don't want
an attacker to get that message so we
are going to scramble our text and the
scramble text is known as
I for text and we need encryption
algorithm that is going to scramble over
text then we need a secure text or
secret information that is known as
queue that is known as key and once we
have that key on both the side and one
side we'll have encryption algorithm the
second side will have the decryption
algorithm and the secure channel to
transfer our message and now it has
occurred to us that we have messed
around with lots of terms now like
encryption algorithm and secure channels
and cipher texts what are these actually
so let's take a look on these in the
next movie and don't forget to share the
CDs along with your friends and drop me
a mail at at Asia today Sheshadri calm
