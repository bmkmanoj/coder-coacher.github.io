with another video and in this video I
want to tell you a story now this story
is something which I always talk about
in all of my offline events whether I'm
taking a bootcamp or I'm presenting as
talk or simply being guests at any
University I usually talk with this
story in my offline event but I think it
is a right time to just share this story
in this incident with all of you as well
in this story you're gonna learn two
things very important two things that
every programmer should understand so
let's get started this is a story of a
student and a master we are going to
call this student s panda and master as
Shifu now this is not your regular panda
which you are a big fan I'm a big fan
this story is a story of painter panda
yes in this scenario of her story the
Panda is a painter not just any painter
he's a good painter on a side note some
of you might be thinking hey what this
panda and this painting has to do
something with programmer and here is
your lesson number one always be patient
this is the number one step that every
programmer has to get it
nothing just serves like that with a
click of something it has to be come up
with lot of patience so there we go
you have already learned one thing which
is having patience coming back onto her
story panda in our case is an awesome
painter but he's not a master master is
a Shifu here so now Panda is a really
good painter and he just draws really
awesome painting so one day the Panda
was thinking you know what I am a decent
painter but I'm not reaching to a great
level I should do something to improve
my painting so eventually panda decided
that I should take public opinion so
that I can improve my painting when de
went out onto a wall which was there in
the public and he drew an awesome
remarkable masterpiece of the painting
that probably nobody could have drawn
and he wrote a simple note below that
painting if you think that there is
something wrong with this
please pick up the pen and pencil and
just give me a note that what you think
that what is missing in this painting or
how this painting could be improved
panda being panda he went for a great
awesome lunch and when he came back he
saw that his notebook was entirely
filled people have written a lot of
critique in his work the line work is
not awesome your shading is missing your
color selection is not good and all the
possible comment that could have been
made for that painting came in that
notebook and I got really sad that you
know what I was thinking that I am a
decent painter and I'm not he was really
sad Master Shifu came and saw the Panda
sitting with a sad face and he saw and
he asked panda you know why are you sad
panda haven't you eaten something he
said Master Shifu I have been trying to
be a great painter but looks like I'm
not being designed or I'm not being made
to be a painter Master Shifu said why
are you thinking in such a manner
panda said I just drew this painting in
a public sector and I just wrote a note
that if you think that there is
something missing in this main ting you
can point that out and I got this whole
notebook filled up with all the
critiques and comments about my line
work my shadows my color selection and
pretty much everything Shifu saw the
notebook and said why don't you show me
what is that painting
Shifu went to saw the painting and the
painting was amazing he said okay there
is surely a room for improvement in this
painting but why would we do one thing
let me try to improve you overnight
panda got amazed that how is that even
possible
he said go and get a good sleep and come
back tomorrow and I'll show you how you
can improve overnight next day when
panda came Master Shifu told Panda today
we're going to go into more busier
Street where you can do a painting and
just don't write any note below that
painting I'm gonna write that note
panda said okay I'm gonna give my best
because we are now painting in a much
busier Street so I should give my best
Panda again drew a masterpiece and the
painting was amazing
and then panda called master shifu that
hey i have completed my painting can you
please write the note that if there is
something missing in the note in the
painting you can just tell me about that
this time master shifu wrote a
completely different note in that
painting Master Shifu wrote there is
nothing perfect in this world obviously
there is a room for improvement in this
painting too so here is the brush here's
the paint please improve the painting
according to you and then Master Shifu
told Panda we're gonna sit here just in
front of the painting there is a
restaurant we are gonna have a lunch
there we're gonna wait till the evening
and we are gonna see that how much how
many of these people can actually
improve this painting and you know what
they found out nobody not even a single
person touched the paint or the brush
panda got confused and panda asked
Master Shifu that hey I know this
painting is not perfect it is even much
little bit lower in quality as what I
drew in the last my of my painting job
but why nobody actually critiqued this
painting and could take that painting so
much and here my dear friend lies the
absolute truth about the world everybody
in this world is an amazing critique
whether it's about moviemaking whether
it's about YouTube whether it's
programming or anything everybody is a
critique but when the things come up to
actually do something it's really really
tough and people just stop doing that
and that same thing happened in the
master shifu's version of this story
when you ask somebody that hey do a
critique
everybody's gonna point out mistake
regardless of how great you have done or
how badly you have done but when things
come up of actually doing the things
there are only a handful of people who
can actually provide you inside details
about what you are missing or what can
be improved exactly same thing happens
when you start learning programming as
well when you start learning programming
the moment you have decided that I'm
gonna be a programmer you have already
left half of the world behind you
because there is shortage of programmers
still and when you show something which
is very like basic stuff like printing a
hello world or just making an app on top
of a button it says
the world this is all exciting for you
this is all exciting for me this is all
exciting for people who knows what the
programming means and how code actually
is implemented but for the general
people who are just out there when you
when you just go to them and just
present your app that it just says hello
world
they don't have exact same excitement as
you do have as I am having these people
are just critique of your work without
having inside knowledge of what actually
takes to build an app they are just
gonna say your website is crappy it
doesn't look good
there is no symmetry on all these things
but what they don't know is how much it
takes to design that basic website
everybody is a big nerd at the starting
stage over the time everybody improves
I'm not saying you should not be
critique about your work but I think you
are the best person to decide how much
room is there for the improvement
obviously take advice from the people
who actually knows the stuff about what
you are building
but taking advice from any random people
who have absolutely no idea what the
programming is is not so good idea I can
understand your feeling when you are
able to successfully write a loop a
function a class it feels amazing
even though that program doesn't do much
it just finds out an even number or odd
number but that is a tough task to
perform you have done that I would say
congratulation to you but don't be just
demotivated when you just present this
work to somebody who doesn't understand
what a programming is it takes a lot of
hard work and lot of effort to build
something I know what we are building
for the very first time whether it's a
website a simple app it's not that easy
and it's going to look really really bad
but you know what this is your first
creation this is gonna improve over time
when you're gonna spend like five months
six month over in the year five years
it's gonna look more awesome but
whatever you have created right now Bri
proud on that I hope you have enjoyed
this video please do share this video

understand what it takes to be a
programmer and the path that you are
