common for me okay what do you do I'm
new here we just go live talk about
programming this is a programming
channel we mostly talk about programming
stuff techy stuff
nerdy stuff just like that okay is it
good
in reference MD and while coding yes of
course it's it's a great resource
compared to w3 schools I would say mdn
is a better resource more elaborated
things and stuff so yes mdn is better
what's the topic today sir hey we make
no topic at all I'm just I'm just doing
a random life Django or flask Oh
personal favorite is Django it's
actually very easy and fast to build a
prototype in Django that's why video
title se is Sunday live for programmers
okay it does it's a Sunday life I forgot
to change even the name of this title
can I do that right now okay it's a
Saturday live Saturday life for
programmers I can just change it for
live for programmers if I just change it
and do an upgrade does it change the

programmers no GSR CodeIgniter
I would say no js' okay
say my name hey sumit saying how's it
going on with you people did you invest
in cryptocurrency
yes I invested in cryptocurrency a long
time ago not right now when the kryptos
the bitcoins were just like five or ten
is dollar i purchase at that time it was
a long time and also sold it I don't
hold cryptocurrencies I I sold it where
you go yes I've made a little bit money
in that like little bit more but yes yes
changed name changed okay thank you
thanks for the update it has changed
random life for programmer it's a better
one actually okay
Android or react now it depends on your
business logic like there are variety of
ways of coding the things there is
Kotlin there is Java there's react there
is jamming it depends on what business
logic is gonna be going so yeah it's
just like that you can make you can
choose any one of them no change why not
change video on AWS yes there are some
things are going on because I'm talking
to Amazon guys and we are about to get
some credits
yes redress trove I remember you I added
and forgot your name as well as your
thumbnail I remember you you comment on
every video I I see that okay so we are
talking two upcoming courses on ello
seeds not LOC it's LC yo learn code
online you know so yes I'm talking to
Emma's on guys to get me some credits on
Amazon Web Services so that I can make
some videos react.js jobs in India
plenty of them plenty of them in
Bengaluru Bangalore is a nice place you
should definitely check that out yes it
has changed the name Thank You Mickey
Rohit thank you so much for the update
take my name survey shhhhh hey Easter
wish how's it going on what kind of
language are used for developing serious
iStent
Swift okay so gate or MBA I don't answer
these kinds of questions gate MBA BC or
B Tech I usually avoid them always avoid
them best language for desktop GUI I
would say you can use TK inter for
Python people call it inter but it's
basically TK inter or you can use Java
that's great you can even use electron
jeaious
what is HR human resource department how
can you don't how actually on what rock
you are living up you don't know HR
department ok love LC oh thank you so
much I love you too guys can you make
rest services video yes there is a lot
of content coming up a lot of good news
about to come up we are actually into
the process of doing something really
amazing and amazingly big for learn code
online but this is like 80% being done
20% is still remaining
we have to work out on this 20% and then
I will launch out this big big update
I'm not making any hype I didn't even
talk about it but yeah it's it's gonna
happen JavaScript job in Microsoft not
sure I haven't checked out recently what
kind of job they are offering in all
these TK inter good yes of course DK
inter is good for Python if you're a
Python developer always TK entered is
amazing
it's a good library okay so there are a
lot of questions coming up on trying to
answer what do you do in real life what
I do in real life I code i code every
single day and I make videos YouTube
videos as well sometime I haven't really
constant on the YouTube I'm enjoying it
actually but most of the time I just
code for degree yes I did my engineering
then my masters dropped out almost
almost dropped out from my dog crate now
yeah call it call it a dropout from
doctorate if you can tell us it's just
gone can you explain how vector images
yes I am actually planning to make a
video for like common questions that are
being asked at all at an
Android job interview or something like
that so yes do notify me in the comment
section if you want to such kind of
video to come up
yes progressive web app video is gonna
be I'll do that a lot of requests are
coming up so when the request actually
start coming up quite a lot is callate
that video and just leave the current
video so that will come up
surely okay and which microphone do you
use for making videos right now I'm
using a blue microphone this is my
favorite one I do have a rode a couple
of rode mics actually so I always to use
a shotgun mic that's actually better
should I go for i us 10 or 11 I guess 11
come on
Lavelle see a future of web development
yes there is plenty of future don't
worry about it angular or react I
usually prefer react because it's
simpler it's smaller library and it's
pretty easy to implement on the angular
you have to learn first JavaScript then
there is a typescript and then there is
a it's a lot of things that you have to
go with that but yes it's great as well
but I prefer react okay can you make a
free course on full web development yes
of course if somebody can sponsor me
because I'll be spending my time and who
would be paying my thank you best
language and way for dynamic website
there is an issue about saying best of
web development language right now I'm a
big fan of JavaScript because it's
handling everything so great react
angular there's no GS everything is just
JavaScript so it's really great so you
should definitely try that out but apart
from that Jango is an amazing framework
if you are looking to build up a quick
prototype so you can look for that
okay so let's is my calendar showing
right there yes your calendar is showing
right there accidentally just didn't
change the name it's it's not Saturday
guys it's not Saturday this is just a
random life this year for great t-shirt
too yes I think so
I'm enjoying this gray color it's making
me much more
amazing so it is sir my Mike some noise
there is some noise in the mic is it so
are you are you hearing some kind of
humming or something do notify me in the
comment if this is the problem we
absolutely can change the mic from the
future videos quality is at the top
priority is this mic okay or we should
change I do have a couple of other mice
lying around so surely we can change
that
so do notify me if this mic is okay
somebody says nope yep
happy advance Sakura yes we are planning
to buy some kites and everything
probably tomorrow no humming yes no
problem yes yes noise nope nope nope no
humming yes this might this is nice Mike
okay I'll take your words and I'll say
no problem at all
but if you say that if this mic is good
we have a couple of other mics lying
around so we can do that so yes I am
planning to buy some of the kites
I love Kite Festival it's a it's a kind
of a thing in Jaipur I would be flying a
lot of them okay beep sound how is that
possible okay yes humming I am aware
there is a little bit humming in this
mic which is like kind of a constant hum
all the people who might be watching
from the earphones might be facing this
so I'll change the mic don't worry we
will do that we will fix this this is a
noise sir yeah is it a constant humming
okay so yes from the future videos
you'll see a different mic that will be
a rode mic which is it doesn't make this
kind of humming sir suggest me how to do
back-end in react native you can use
firebase that's the easiest way to get
started with react but you can use some
of the online services for Postgres SQL
or maybe MongoDB that would be pretty
good to get started
back-end course lco again I cannot
reveal the future plans but yeah it's
it's in one of the to-do list okay
hosting for nodejs Heroku would be good
yoga would be amazing for it
sir your mic so big yeah that's a that's
a big mic but it's good it's amazing in
quality okay make few V logs actually
I'm not that much skilled right now to
make a V log III don't think so I can
handle the camera that good because
color correction and all these things I
don't know if I can make it back end
course on LC oh yeah we will try to do
that probably very student I'm a big fan
of you thank you so much L Tov love you
too sir how to promote games you can
probably run an Android our Facebook ad
for that if you wish and then if it is
good it can go viral well Happy New Year
Happy New Year Stellan luck sure same to
you javascript is easy or not C easy is
a relative term okay if you have
experience in programming in the past
it's easy if not it can be little bit
tricky not much so yeah love from guy a
guy from Bihar that's I have a couple of
friends they're like that you guys have
amazingly cheese I love you sir love LT
oh hey and us thank you so much
what is nested loop a loop inside a loop
that's it
what is no SQL no SQL is not only SQL
there are a couple of great books on no
SQL and new SQL databases so ok there is
there is there we go I found some of the
guy who is using abusive language so let
me try to abuse report abuse there we go
ok there we go finally ok there we go
again if somebody is trying to make
abusive comments I have to report them
and have to block them ok ok I'm a big
fan thank you so much yes
heavy done competitive programming
probably once or twice I didn't like the
concept that much so yeah ok relational
database versus no SQL database that is
actually a very good topic I can write
it down
relational versus no SQL I can make a
video on that and can that would be
awesome
I also reported that guy thank you so
much always do report the abusive people
who abuse to you or anybody else you can
say bad things like I don't like your
video that's completely okay you can
simply say hey your content is not
interesting I get that but using abusive
language there it's it's not something
that we I appreciate so totally your
choice but blocking is also my choice
okay so what is okay CSS grid
I recommend instead of CSS grid use
flexbox that is far more better about
volley I have covered volley quite a lot
in my course okay
so SQL - no SQL migration please haha
that's a--that's a really really big
topic probably my I won't be getting is
udemy beneficial yes of course wherever
you can learn whatever you can very
where you find the resources to learn
that it's always good okay I always say
that you know my courses are there to
help you but these are not the only
resources they're probably hundreds of
other such websites from which you can
where you can learn on all these things
so the important point is just keep on
learning that's the most important focus
it's not about my courses only take my
course take other people courses as well
so it's like the more resource you have
to learn that's the important part here
okay so fronting okay nice room
wallpaper thank you so much and okay so
this is our lag yeah there is a little
bit lag yeah I think it's gone now okay
so which language is best for Android
side so after 10 days of holidays which
language should I learn after C after C
you can start with Java that would be
good okay okay a lot of questions
your words are inspiring thank you so
much hey I don't like your rude behavior
I'm so sorry that you
we experienced such a rude behavior I'm
really sorry for that wholeheartedly I
say I am sorry if you have felt like
that way I'll try my best not to be I
try my best already that I shouldn't be
rude but somehow if you felt that I am
wholeheartedly sorry for that okay let's
pick up more questions hi Nitin from was
suffer musa for poor you p was often a
guru p hi hi Nitin how are you how is
the weather in the U P it must be really
cold there's a lot of lag yeah somehow
sometimes these Airtel guys don't give
me full bandwidth okay so this was a
quick random life probably I should get
back to more stuff and I have to do a
lot of stuff there is a lot of paperwork
and stuff going on so that is it bye bye
