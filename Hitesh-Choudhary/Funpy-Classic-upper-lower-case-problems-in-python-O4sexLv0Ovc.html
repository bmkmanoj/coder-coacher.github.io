series about a Python code building
section now this series is not about the
loops and function in case you're
watching it first time I have other
videos as well in case you're watching
it in a course then it's cool so it's
all series about solving the problems
and brushing up your pride in skills so
let me just quickly show you what the
problem is and this is very classic
problem and you're gonna learn quite a
lot in this in case you're following
along with me make sure that you submit
the assignment as well in the comment
sections the Q&amp;amp;A section so here is a
classical example of counting lower case
and upper case letter you might have
seen these kinds of example in the
password blocks as well sometimes on
most of the secure websites they ask you
that hey you need to keep your password
fairly unguessable and fairly resistant
from the brute-force attack like you
have to choose uppercase a lowercase
letter some numbers and some special
characters these are by the way a good
practice of using passwords so everybody
should does that I should use that okay
so here is a real cool take an input
from the user and in that string you
need to count the number of uppercase
letters and the lowercase letter now in
the previous good old days when we used
to write the code in C and C++ it used
to be a very typical task because you
have to convert everything into the
ASCII values and then we have to compare
the ASCII values from uppercase for all
a to Z's and for the lowercase all ASCII
values from lower a to lower Z's which
is the method that I've never liked and
and I never actually liked it but
luckily code in Python is much more
simpler and much more awesome so we're
gonna do that and further steps I'm
gonna talk about what further assignment
you have to submit if you're following
along with me that's very good thing so
let's talk about it so let's first write
a simple pseudocode the first problem is
take input from user I need to correct
my Spelling's there we go
nice ok then we need to actually hold
available so there can be two variables
there who can monitor the count for
uppercase and lowercase as
next problem is monitoring upper and
whoops upper and lowercase letters it
can be done by dictionary by different
two variables
dozens of methods it can it can be
approached by various things now
the next problem is very simple loop
through loop through the string so
that's gonna be really simple and once
you have looped through the string then
you have to make comparisons so the
first thing would be like compare with
uppercase and the second one would be
compare
oops compare with what I'm doing compare
with lowercase ok so that's the whole
pseudocode that we need to do I have
break down this problem into various
small steps and then they're gonna
follow so problem number one take input
from the user so let's call this as user
input and that's really simple we have
just taken the input from the user by
the way you can just read it there quick
word there read a string from standard
input and my standard input is keyboard
you guess that okay let's move ahead
problem one solved now monitor upper and
lower case letters count actually okay
that's much more precise so you can use
two different variables here as well but
I'm gonna be using a simple dictionary
named as count okay and defining a
dictionary is really simple because I
want to make sure that this series use a
lot of variables and a lot of stuffs
from here and there so that you can
brush up your skills and that's gonna be
simply let's just call this as upper
that's gonna be just upper and this is
the key the value is gonna be zero
because we are going to be starting at a
zero if in case you are defining a
variable make sure that you initialize
it with zero and the second is gonna be
the lower and it's gonna be also defined
as zero okay
pretty cool problem number two being
taken down now look through the string
now before we move on looping through
the string let me show you looping
through the string in Python is really
simple so let me
opened up a terminal in case you are not
aware what's happening here go ahead
watch the entire playlist so I'm opening
up a Python let me just show you how you
can loop through the string very quickly
here so all you need to do is use a for
loop for I in where I is my defined
variable and I can simply say something
like hello there and then I need to
press a tab there and I can simply print
the I and looping through a string is
really simple and hit enter again and
you can see that hello there is being
iterated over the string it's it's
pretty cool now let me just zoom back
here so this is how we are going to be
tackling down the next problem
and there we go so what I need to do is
let's just say for I in and we have
stored the variable in user input there
we go
so we are looping through the input
being given by the user okay we are
inside the loop now now I'm gonna put a
if condition here now if user input
because now we are what we are doing we
are actually looping through each of the
letters of user input string so what I'm
saying i'm gonna be using dot is upper
method there which is already built up
already cooked up for me i don't have to
compare the a skies values and
everything just like in the sea but
again feel free to convert them into a
sky and then make a comparison that
would also work but this is I think a
better approach okay and now inside the
if if block let's just use the count
dictionary and what I'm gonna be saying
inside the count dictionary there is my
key that's being known as upper and what
we need to do we just need to say plus
equal one so we are just implementing it
by one obviously if you would have using
variable there it could have been much
more simpler but I want to take the
tougher approach I want to give you the
easy approach okay there we go
one if loop is being if block is being
done now let's just say L if L if there
we go and although I could have just
seen else as well but I just don't want
to do there I want
go to be much more expandable for the
assignment so that's why I'm using L
half there so L if the user input the
dot and you guessed it right there is a
lower method as well is lower I don't
know why it's not suggesting but yes
it's there I have already gone through
the documentation if that's the case
then what we want to do is use our
dictionary count and oops I made a
mistake there actually I actually have
to use it equal there I actually saw
that yeah just a nice catch there so use
the count dictionary again and this time
I have another key there that is lower
and what I want to do is again plus
equal one if you found a lowercase
letter pretty good pretty cool now for
the else part and I don't want to do
anything in this case right now so I'm
gonna be writing just a past keyword
which will just let it go don't do
anything just complete my syntax there
but I will give you an assignment of
expanding the things here okay that is
pretty cool I don't want to do anything
there now I'll get out of the loop
simply by indenting the things I'm gonna
be saying use a print method there and I
just want to say that upper case letters
or letter count is let's just say and
let's just use a comma syntax there and
I can simply use a count there and call
the key that's it pretty easy you can
see programming is simply easy if
somebody is teaching you with the step
by step process okay pretty good and I'm
gonna say command shift D to duplicate
that that's a lot of time-saver and I'm
gonna be calling another key lower and
I'll just replace it with lowercase
letter count I am pretty sure that it's
gonna work now for the first time but
some time code doesn't work first time
that's completely okay so there we go
our program is there and let's just call
Python 3 and then we're gonna call it as
upper I have named this file as
uppercase u so make sure you can you
catch that
and there we go it's waiting to supply
some input and I'm gonna say hey how is
it going there so a random case is there
let's hit enter and it says upper count
letter is 0 lover cows a lowercase it's
zero okay so we did some mistake there
let me just see what is the mistake
there I'm pretty sure that is okay
uppercase and lowercase and that that
looks good and did I did mistake okay
sometimes you have to debug all of the
stuff it's pretty usual for that so let
me just catch it up oops I card the
mistake and let me just write it here
because what I'm doing is I'm just using
if user input that's really bad I should
have done that now here since we are
inside the loop we should use this
variable oh my bad my bad but this is
very very important part because you
need to learn how you can debug your
string programming if if somebody is
thinking that programming is all about a
smooth right never a bumpy ride he
should really understand it's a lot of
bumps there and you need to fix how to
fix your problems a lot of people are
going to review this that hey the
instructor was not ready he the the
things were not actually according to
the plan but believe me this is the
important part you need to learn how to
debug otherwise you are not going to
survive in the industry so what I did
quickly I just analyzed it I found I
figured out that I was checking it for
the user input that is bad I should have
been checking inside the loop so that I
can update my dictionary so that is how
it's going let's just try the script
again so let's just call this as Python
3 and upper lower dot py waiting for my
input and let's just say hey how is it
going
oops I need to learn how to write going
and there we go ok this time it's
working let's just count it quickly 1 2
3 4 5 6 okay so 6 upper case and
obviously the rest of them are a lower
case but it hasn't detected for the
spaces or the
okay that's cool now what is your
assignment further also count the number
of spaces and other characters in the
string so you need to write another
if/else block there and you can just
change it to elsif and you have to check
what are the number of spaces there and
this can be done simply by an equal
equal check and I hope you will be able
to do and just one more approach there
how you're gonna check for other
characters now in this I want you to
take this exact approach count all the
number of letters there in the string so
you have to count how many letters are
being supplied just minus the uppercase
the lowercase and the spaces and the
rest of the things are numbers and
special characters so that's how you're
gonna approach that I hope you enjoyed
this video if you liked it make sure you
rate us as well it's really always held
but again you'll be seeing rest of the
videos like this as well we are gonna
learn how we can debug the stuff as well
so let's go in and I'll catch you up in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
