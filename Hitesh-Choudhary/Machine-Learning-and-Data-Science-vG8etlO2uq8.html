Amazon has got tons of data about us
even the small companies have a lot of
information about us like our sign of
details how many times we are logging in
into the website
what is our purchase decision what
products we are looking of for or what
product we are interested in when was
the last time we purchased a product
this is all crucial information and
companies are already aware that
processing this data are processing this
information we can get amazing results
in our sales companies can even offer
you amazing features remember the three
tiles that you get in your Gmail for
quick replies how does the uber knows
that your driver will be arriving in
that amount of minute how does the
Google map knows that you'll be reaching
to your destination in that amount of
time this is all data science and
machine learning highest trending topic
as of now highest job opportunities are
in data science and machine learning and
of course highest paid jobs are also
getting opened up in machine learning
and data science all because companies
know that by hiring a data scientist and
machine learning we can improve our
productivity as well as our sales a lot
of people think that machine learning
and data science can only be learned by
PhD or can be done by PhDs
no it's not like that anybody can learn
data science and machine learning
welcome to machine learning and data
science boot camp well the best resource
available online so that you can
understand as well as can implement all
the things that can be done using
machine learning and data science my
name is Satish and I have been
programming for over 10 years with over
170 thousand plus subscriber on YouTube
I have been serving to more than hundred
thousand global students I have created
some of the amazing and life-changing
boot camps on web Android and iOS you
know what's the best part about my
morning when I receive almost every
single day and email that says because
of you I was able to change my life I
got my first internship I got my first
job this is the best part that starts my
morning I am back with another exciting
boot camp on machine learning and data
science the number one goal of this
course is to make sure that everybody
can understand machine learning
and my speciality is to teach the topic
in a fun and engaging manner so that
user can understand the things as well
as can implement whatever he has learned
in this course I have taken special care
so that even the complex topic can
become simply easy for every student so
the first big question is what you'll be
learning in this course in this course
we will first start with installing
everything I'll walk you through what is
the installation process and after that
we're gonna deep dive into Python I'll
jog your memory with the Python by
introducing you with the topics of data
types if and else and LU once that is
done I'll walk you through with a Python
challenge course well I'll show you some
of the challenges in Python like
printing a pattern having multiplication
table or doing web scraping in using
Python this all will jog your memory
with the Python and will make sure that
you are completely friendly with Python
after that we will move on to numpy
numpy is the most amazing topic and
every data science and machine learning
student should master it so we'll spend
a really good amount of time with numpy
along with example during the entire
course no code was copy and pasted I'll
be writing code in every single point
along with you
after numpy we will move on to one of
the most powerful library of machine
learning and data science which is
pandas we will be spending good amount
of time with pandas whether you want to
analyze any kind of data set bring it up
from CSV file excel file or maybe from
any database pandas can haul most handle
everything
I will also walk you through that how
you can read the documentation so
whenever you need to do something extra
you can quickly dive into the
documentation and can find exactly what
you'll be needing up one of the most
important part about machine learning
and data science is analyzing these data
these data sets can be little bit tricky
to understand in the number format so
next up we will break through into
matplotlib and we will learn how we can
plot these data into graphs and plots of
variety of different techniques and
types once we are done with the
matplotlib further we are going to dive
deep into Seabourn Seabourn is really a
powerful library again being used for
plotting variety of graphs but
comparatively it is much more easier to
learn as well as much more
powerful during all of these libraries
and process of learning them we will be
analyzing tons of data like iris dataset
your nine-month one called data sets
your housing prediction model and all of
these things is already covered up but
that's not it we have a lot more things
to cover up after that we will move on
into the data cleaner process whenever a
data is being bring up into machine
learning or data science or anything
else it needs to go through with a
cleaning process we have to handle the
ambiguities in the data so we will learn
how we can handle the data cleaner
process once we are done with that we
will move into the code machine learning
part I will walk you through with the
things like what is supervised and
unsupervised learning don't worry if
this sounds too much jargon to you you
will understand each and everything
inside the course once we are done with
these things then we'll move on to the
core machine learning part and we'll
look into the various algorithms that
are famous in machine learning we will
be talking about variety of algorithms
like linear regressions decision trees
SVM K nearest neighbor naive Bayes and a
lot more not only we will be learning
about the working as well as the
implementation part of these algorithm
instead I have gone head into one more
step and I have taken up my pen and my
tablet and I have explained even the
mathematical part of these algorithms I
have taken help of variety of graphs and
other things to make sure that you
properly understand that algorithm and
then you write code for it and shows the
implementation of that algorithm even in
one of the video I have went ahead and
taken up an example from a high school
math to make sure that you understand
properly what is Bayes theorem not only
that at variety of steps I have even
went into the libraries like
scikit-learn and have tried to show you
that how you can read the documentation
of these famous libraries like
scikit-learn and all these other things
so that whenever you want to customize
anything or want to do something
separately with that you are completely
able to do so the next big question is
what are the prerequisites to learn
machine learning and honestly not much
but still - first of all machine
learning is not a big nerd course the
first and foremost thing that you need
to learn data science and machine
learning is a lot of dedication
the first predict you said that you
should have before starting this course
is a little bit basics of Python now you
don't need to master Python but things
like how to declare a variable if-else
functions and loop should be covered up
with you now don't worry if you are not
quite friendly with the Python as of now
because I have thrown up a refresher so
that it can jog up your memory the
second requirement for this course is
coming up from the math part the
mathematics can be little bit scary for
many of you but believe me it's not much
if you have taken up math as your
subject in your high school and you are
aware about the things like what is a
matrix and how we can add to matrix
that's it and even if you are not aware
for the matrix this course is probably
not for you and yes just in case you are
worried about let me just say that
certificates are included in the course
along with all of the exercise files in
the notebook format and in the HTML
format and just one more thing
in case you are worried about your
internet connectivity or internet issues
you can download learn code online app
and can use our offline access feature
so that you can download all the videos
and can watch them whenever you like if
you face any problem you can always post
in the discussion section or can reach
me out on my Facebook page too on top of
that all this information amazing
exercise files and plethora of data is
coming up at an amazing discount machine
learning without a doubt is the next big
thing in IT industry it is the next big
revolution I highly recommend you to
check out some of the free previews of
the video to get an idea how actually
the course looks like and even join my
youtube channel to figure more out
machine learning is the next big thing
as the next revolution in the IT
industry every company nowadays is
having a data science and machine
learning division lot of job
opportunities and it is changing
everything around us I recommend you to
check the link in the description below
or at the bottom and at least take a
look at the course enjoy some of the
free previews and decide yourself
whether you want to jump on into this
next big revolution of machine learning
or not choice is totally yours and I'm
pretty sure I'll surely catch you up
inside the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
