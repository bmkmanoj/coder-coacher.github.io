the flexbox training now we are moving
towards the flexbox area where it's far
more a little bit complex and far more
easier to work on with now before I move
further let me walk you through that
flex box is not to have precise pixel
point of the things it's more about
ratios is and it's more about aligning
there things that however they you want
to ordering the things however you want
to it if you want to pixel precise
things probably flex box is not the
thing yes it can be achievable with that
but if you're looking for a pixel ish
thing like it should be always 230 pixel
and go ahead mention that clearly don't
rely on the Flex box for doing exactly
so and you will notice that here in this
particular video where we are going to
work more over the ratios or the things
and some things will get a little bit
more priority some things get less
priority and all of that so let's talk
about that and that is basically your
property flex grow and you will love it
for sure so let's bring up our thing and
let's just copy and paste that and we're
going to call this l06 because we are
into the 0-6 let me fire up my atom and
there we go let's open up a project
folder and we're going to call this as 0
6 and there we go so we have our index
we have our flex okay basically good and
what I want to do here is I want to add
a couple of things so I'm going to add
four of these guys so let's have them
one and I don't know why it always pops
up there four okay come on let me escape
there three and this is going to be two
okay so no big deal we just have four
elements here or full divisions in our
case and let's fire up our live server
as well so there we go
and you have seen this live server let
me bring this up into recording area and
there we go so this is visible now and
nothing big nothing extraordinary and
now the property that we are going to
learn is actually flexi grow so let me
make up the Flex container here first of
all and that is going to be container
and we just want a one property here
display is going to be
legs and we see the impact there we go
our row is the default line there and it
just drinks up there okay
now before I go ahead and do that I want
to specify or to understand this
property we need this container
knowledge quite a bit so we are going to
put a border here and specific width on
the container so that it's a little bit
more understandable so it is going to be
specifically thousand pixels here just
to make sure that this is smaller
doesn't make a difference and I'm going
to put a border as well otherwise it's
little bit hard to understand what is
happening so it's going to be simply one
pixel and the solid and black so there
we go
okay so now we can see that there are
points and there are points in times
where you want everything to go just
like to the end sometime but for the
understanding purpose it's actually
easier to just get it a little bit like
that and in fact I will not be worried
if I'll just make it to pixel it's much
more visible now okay so now what the
flexbox property does this legs grow is
let me show you it's actually easier to
show rather than explain it so we're
going to have a container and I'm going
to select all the divisions inside the
container now the default property is a
flex grill is zero and you'll notice it
doesn't make any difference because it's
a default one and there we go now what
is going to happen now I'm saying that
all the divisions inside the Flex
container should get a flex screw off
one now what is this one here
now one here we are talking about the
ratios here not the pixel perfect thing
it's all about ratios so what it's
saying is now the entire thousand pixels
whatever the width of your parent
container is is going to be divided in
such a manner that it always going to be
inside this so notice the two pixel
border is also going to count here and
it says hey divide everything equally
and I'll get one of that ratio so
thousand is going to be divided into the
four equal part again border is also
going to be counted and everybody will
be just will be growing to the one part
of it that means equal parts here so
there we go
and we get it really right here that
everybody is getting equal space and
that is sometimes you want it and that
is okay so that is good and even
actually in most of the cases so imagine
I you have just got more properties more
divisions and you just add this guy here
and you just say hey I need one more
element and I'm going to get five there
save that and you don't have to touch
your CSS everything is going to just
grow like that because it's all about
ratios it's not about the pixel perfect
thing but it's about ratios everything
is getting some ratio divided now the
things get a little bit confusing
because right now you say when I say
just ratio you you must be saying hey
that's okay I got it I understood that
but things get a little bit complicated
when the mole ratios comes up in the
picture so for example when I say I want
to select a particular division and let
my Adam help me for that and that is
going to be let's go for the nm selector
there and I want to select the second
element there okay
there we go now what happens when you
say F flex grow off everybody is getting
one but I'm going to say that hey the
second child should get a flex screw off
- now what is going to happen that
however the division is going to be
there it's going to go exactly like that
but previously everybody was getting one
part of it but this guy is going to get
two part of it okay so there we go this
guy is twice as bigger as this but again
your margin your properties your borders
padding everything does also count up
but you must be getting equal idea that
hey if you just try to imagine placing
this here this is almost twice of that a
lot of people does a mistake that's
saying that hey previously it was
getting 1 &amp;amp; 2 it's asking for more so it
should be getting 3 no it's not like
that it doesn't work like that it's more
about the ratio thing that you have
studied in your early school days it
just works like that okay and the
important part is the higher the frick
flex group property value is the higher
priority it's going to get so first of
all everybody is going to get a count
then this guy will be first get it
doesn't make a much difference here but
yeah this is this is how the Flex box
work and there we go
and you will notice a couple of
interesting things when you get some
properties with here so we are going to
say all the guys are going to have a
hundred pixels width here in that
particular case in this particular case
it doesn't really matter because things
anyway is going to stay like that but
interesting part is I have mentioned
this should get a hundred pixels but
you'll notice if I inspect the element
here and notice in the computed that
this guy is getting 124 here and it's
bit a little bit more like that if I
just hover my mouse and just like that
you notice that it this guy is getting
166 and not hundred this guy is getting
up almost double to 166 so yeah this
this actually works like this
it's moreover not dependent on what the
width you had aligning because if you
are using flexbox anyways you are not
worried about specific hundred pixels
behead you are more worried about how
much ratios each one of them are getting
so this is this is the basic thing here
now I want to show you a couple of more
things here with the Flex CRO because
this is an interesting subject okay so
I'm going to say that all the containers
are going to have a flex box of 0 which
is default and I'm going to say you're
going to get 3 times here so notice the
difference here that okay let me close
this guy that what is happening now this
guy is getting a topmost priority here
and the rest of the guys if it is say
Daz flex 0 that means the Flex box is
not worried about getting them any ratio
it's going to just say that you need to
be fixed in the container you need to
get some spaces but first this guy will
get all the space as much as it needs
and you guys will just fit in there so
yeah you can also right-click and
inspect this case because out of the
thousand are thousand pixels here this
guys getting 641 which is pretty big and
the calculating specific can be done but
I would say stay away from it because
it's too much of the math and you
probably are using flexbox because you
don't have to be worried about it but in
case you want to you want me to talk
about
all the specific calculation part of
them sure I can do that just notice
notify me in the comment section and
I'll probably do a specific video and
calculation of math and ratio because it
becomes complicated especially when it
becomes zero or one like that so yeah a
little bit tricky part you can get it to
something like crazy numbers like seven
maybe for some reason you want to do
that so now this is going to get the
seventh part of that and rest of the
guys are going to get one part of the
remaining thing okay so again do
remember this is Lex grow and it is
super helpful on the small scale devices
because even if you'll just keep it in
the small scale of obviously we have
fixed height here fixed width therefore
this guy that's why it's not shrinking
up but this is this is helpful if I just
get rid of that
let me command X that save that and
notice it's it's going to just stay
there and notice the ratio is being
maintained there if you if you just
apply this property towards the whole of
the thing then it becomes really really
easy and amazing things because no
matter what your screen size it is it's
always going to make sure that the ratio
is in tag there and again this is all
this is what all the Flex box is and I
hope you have enjoyed this video because
this flexbox grow shrink all these
properties are the most awesome
properties inside the Flex box so that's
it for this video and I'll surely catch
you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
