code online dot n so yes I was a little
bit busy yesterday that's why I didn't
posted any video it was a quick travel
to the amazing Delhi and I was a little
busy with some documentation stuff there
but the whole point is I'm back here and
we're gonna continue with our JavaScript
series again so it was a good trouble
let's just focus back again here so the
whole agenda for this particular video
is to understand one more data type of
JavaScript which is fairly new as
compared to the previous JavaScript it
was not at all present in our regular
JavaScript or vanilla JavaScript which
usually everybody is familiar with it's
recently being added it's amazing and
you will be you will be loving it a lot
also I will be talking about one more
type of loop which is for off loop we
have talked about for loop we have
talked about for each loop but now we
are gonna be talking about for off loop
okay so these are the two things that
we'll be talking now let me also
introduce one more fact here a lot of
people might be we will be talking about
maps data types so a lot of people will
be kind of a correlating it with objects
or plain just object now let me give you
a fact these things yes do look almost
exactly similar to the objects I will be
referring you some documentation so that
you can find out some differences
between them I'll be pointing out some
of them the whole point of using the
maps is if you are working on any kind
of no SQL database or literally just
like MongoDB or firebase specially the
firebase you will be loving this data
type a lot because a lot of time you
want to just pack some information and
want to fetch that to the database this
particular thing is super helpful in
those cases and a lot of things that I
want to really talk about it so let's
start our journey here and we'll be
talking about this Maps concept as well
as the for off loop so let's get started
here so we have our files open up here
so let me just close them down okay and
what we'll be doing is we will be having
it in our 0 1 advance there we go
and we want a new file and we are gonna
call this as maps and for off dot J's
that's a pretty long name but I think we
can do with that
so there we go this is the first time so
let's pick up a simple example here I
know this is like made-up example but
you'll be seeing this kind of almost
civil Irish thing it there and I'll
point out some of the some of the points
that you will be doing differently in
the database there so let's just say we
have a simple example with a John my
favorite name John Doe Jane Doe you
might have realized that so we have a
simple John and John is not just a
variable it's an object okay so let's
just say it has few properties name and
in the name it says I am John and John
has the property of age probably like
pretty young guy 24 maybe young
inexperienced and we're gonna say is
active so is he active on maybe some
platform or not so we're gonna just get
it true okay so this is your first
information about John so this is one
object that we have sometimes
information is like a lot of object sets
that we need to either push it to the
database or we get from the database or
maybe any API calls pretty common
scenarios nothing big deal here so let's
just say we have Mary and again it is an
object so we're gonna have few data so
that we can work through it and can
understand how things are happening this
is super useful in firebase and Mongo by
the way so I am Mary and the comma let's
just say age
we're gonna go for pretty young let's
just say 23 and we are gonna say is
active said that true probably true
there we go and now let's just move on
and have one more just bear with me just
last one so we're gonna say Sam Sam is
again an object I'm gonna scroll it a
little bit here and first property is
name and it's gonna say I am Sam no big
deal there I am Sam age and we're gonna
say pretty not so young like 29 but it's
almost young is active and we're gonna
say probably false just to four have
something okay so these are the three
things that we have and probably you
might want to push them as soon as you
get that from maybe any user interface
or anywhere you might want to push that
onto now pushing this kind of in
can be little bit tricky with specially
the no SQL database maybe Mongo or
firebase so what we can do we can use
this advanced data type that javascript
has introduced it and can use some of
its features so that we can fetch the
things eventually with the database so
let me show you how this is being done
now in the recent Java Script we will be
learning that later on that we do have
now concepts of classes and stuff like
that so we will be taking advantage of
it right now let's just not go into the
classes in concept of that let's just
use it okay so we're gonna say let's
just say we have users and this users is
an object that we're gonna create from
map and there we go and that's how we do
it if you want more information I'll be
linking you with some documentation
later on right now this is how you
create it now simply let's just say we
have a log and we just use a type off
and I want to check out for users so
what type of data type we are actually
getting in here an interesting question
so let me just open up the terminal
I'm very gonna go CD into 0 1 advanced
and let's just run this file which is
maps and for jeaious pretty long name so
there we go we are getting an object so
map is internally like for just right
now it's an object but it's actually a
map and map is somehow related to the
object which it's little bit different
I'll walk you through how it is being
different so what you can do is let me
just remove this line here so what you
can do in this users you can use the
property of map and can push some data
into it so what we do is we simply say
hey users this is almost an empty object
and we use the property of dot set okay
once you use the set you can pass on key
value pair so that the key value is
something like you retrieve the things
based on that so similarly in the index
in the in the arrays V if you need any
values to get back from it we pass on
index like 0 1 2 but in the key value
pair nothing is like sorted out it
doesn't need to be sorted out because
you can just access any value by
referencing to its key and exactly what
we are going to be doing here so we do
have this John variable and I want to
store that so my key is
yawn and the value that you want to
fetch it you just need to separate it
with comma and you just have to say John
the notice here that this John which is
inside the string and which is outside
the string are two different things okay
the first John that we have is key I
have made it up I can name it John I can
name it Johnny or can be a unique ID
whatever I like to have it can be
anything but this John is actually
coming up we are pretending this is
coming up from maybe some user
interaction or maybe some forms or
anything so this is I'm referencing to
this variable okay again this is my
made-up I have made it up this is
something which is coming up from user
or maybe variable okay so this set
actually fetches this into this users
okay and I'll walk you through first of
all let's have a couple of duplicates of
it and we're gonna say this is John and
I'm gonna just select that
oops I'm gonna just put my cursors there
and next we have John and then we have
Mary and I'm gonna put my cursor there
and then we have Sam okay again the same
concept goes up here so now what this
users is one particular bigger object
which holds a lot of other objects as
well so we just need to push on one
operation to this database and that's it
it's done now just to remind you that
when you take any online database from
any instance from Amazon or anything
they charge you based on how many
operations you are performing not on how
many bandwidth or something like some
people do charge on that but usually
it's based on operations so that reduced
operation you have it's gonna be good
for you from the money-wise okay so
there we go we have good examples here
okay now what we can do is first of all
we're gonna have a simple log to see
what users is and the most importantly
what it returns us back when we want to
use it so let me just open up the
terminal clean it and run that so notice
you are getting a map of object this
time previously it was just an object
but notice at this time when I'm running
this users this is automatically of type
map so as soon as you use the set
command then it converts this object
into the map so there we go
and just to give you one like teaser of
the things map always returns you an
iterate able so what is an iterator
Ville that's a good question and intra
table is something on which you can
iterate or basically you can use your
loops over it so you are allowed to loop
through it that's basically it probably
will have a separate video on what is
iterators and generators and all of that
but as of now it ratable something on
which you can iterate over or you can
loop through over okay and map actually
returns you all these things and now
let's come back onto the question that
how is it different from an object one
very very big difference between the
objects in map is you can find out how
many objects or how many entities are
inside this map you cannot do that with
the object you have to use loop or some
kind of trickeries to do so but here
what do we have is just a size and this
is a property not a function okay this
is a property we just have to use it
like that
okay now this makes it super powerful so
that I can know in advance that how many
users I'm gonna add or how many things
I'm adding into database so I can just
fire that up clean the screen and run
that and notice there are three entities
into it this is one of the most powerful
thing which makes Maps separate from the
objects okay
shortly I'll give you three more reasons
in fact I'll be looping you through with
the documentation so that you can read
through them okay so this is one of the
biggest advantage of using the Maps now
I just have to pass on this users to my
probably firebase instance and it can
just set all the things pretty easily so
I know some of you might not be catching
it right now here but when he will be
learning firebase or MongoDB or will be
building an application actually you
will be thanking me there okay let's
just carry on and we want to pass on
some things here so what you can do in
case you want to access something
particular you can use a method known as
get in the gate you can pass on the key
and the best part is previously my array
used to look up for everything and have
to go for a particular index or
something like that exactly like that in
the array I was using square brackets
and passing like three like I want
exactly the three index whatever there
is in the gate use pair of parentheses
and there
can pass on key the key is gonna be this
one okay John Mary Sam so let's just say
I'm interested in Sam I can just have it
save that and open up my terminal run
that and there we go so I have got this
three is actually from the upper
console.log but this is from like am Sam
29 so all the information I can fetch it
like pretty easily okay that is pretty
cool now what else we can do probably
you want to get like you know there are
three entities inside it you want to get
all the keys or maybe all the values and
yes it is completely possible you can do
is you can simply say users and just put
a dot there are so many options there
and just like we have we got a keys as
well there so you can notice it says
iterate able iterator so it gives you
any tradable over which you can look
through but right now we don't need to
do it we will do it shortly but right
now we don't need to do it okay so I'm
gonna comment this out so that it
doesn't really confuses us anything so
I'm gonna comment that out for a moment
and we'll have just one console for the
keys so let me just fire that up quickly
clean the screen and run that again so
notice we have an a map iterator John
Marian Sam on which I can iterate and
can get each one of them okay and
similar to this we have got keys we have
got values as well that also I can run
again it gives me an iterator over which
I can iterate a lot of you might be
getting confused how can I trade over it
don't worry don't worry you have
patience I'm gonna walk you through with
that as well so this is pretty good
stuff now let me walk you through that
how you can loop through it or you can
say iterate over it so that is actually
pretty easy let's go for the new thing
that we are learning here first of all
for off then I'll walk you through how
you can do it with for each as well so
choose whatever you like no big deal so
let's just say we are gonna go for this
for off syntax so you have to first
declare what is the iterator and also
one more thing you will be seeing most
of these iterate able are being iterated
using for off because that is far more
easier but totally choice is yours
so what we can say is we can say
forecast probably I'm interested in keys
so I'm saying I'm gonna say key in user
dot keys just like that I hope you get
the syntax now users dot keys and there
we go so now since this returns me and
iterate Abel this key is gonna go
through with each value of it okay I
hope I'm making sense here and I'm gonna
simply say that print my keys are just
key in this case so there we go so I'm
gonna just comment this out for a moment
and we just have now one print out
statement there so there we go if I just
run that notice now I'm getting exactly
each one of them so you cannot directly
use it just with the methods of like
this when I say dot values or dot keys
you cannot use them directly in an
actual program you have to just say that
this is gonna be tradable so use a loop
and just do some stuff with all those
keys similar to that similarly we can
have values as well and we can change it
like value and make sense when I change
it to value as well but there are a
couple of issues that obviously you will
be facing now this is an individual
object so you might want to print out
some things in from it so value dot
probably we just want to get probably
name so we have to save that and I hope
you got the point how we can iterate
through it and can get from each object
very very useful in case of interacting
with the database okay so this is like
the basic stuff and probably you want to
get like keys and values as well
so yes sure we can do that so let's just
use the for off for getting that as well
and some important information you
should get in for that so what you need
to do previously we were using like one
values in case of this particular
iterator and in the case of like this
for off loop some things do change and
that is you just use something like this
key value this is an array yes you got
it this is an array and also previously
now the question is what should I say
users dot key or values no you don't say
any of these you use something which is
known as entries there
come on give me some suggestion users
dot entries and there we go so it gives
you kind of a key value pair and you can
just iterate through it so pretty pretty
easy stuff nothing a big deal and we can
just log it and we can simply say
something like this key and then we can
add on it key is gonna be and I'm gonna
give you a quick assignment as well and
we can save value there we go
I can comment this line as well so that
we can have just one save that and let's
just run this guy and there we go so we
have got John as an object and Mary as
an object object same and obviously I
have to use something like value dot
probably dot name to make it much more
sense to pass on like exactly you know
the basic stuff we have done so much in
the JavaScript this should be super easy
here's a quick assignment for all of you
convert the above line in literals or
string literals if you like to say that
so pretty quick assignment I hope
everybody will be able to do it ok now
just for the sake of completion we're
gonna do exactly the same thing using
for each loop as well because a lot of
people prefer that so that's why and
this is the second lust of that I wanted
to talk about so we're gonna say users
and since it returns you in a table you
can directly use for each on to it and
as we know for each requires you to pass
on a callback function use your regular
function or since you have knowledge
about these uh what do you call them
pair of functions I was about to say fad
or a function but somebody reminded me
don't call them okay so these are arrow
functions so these arrow functions are
gonna take something like value and key
and then you can use arrow function and
can just do whatever you like
probably just log them and we can
actually just copy this line copy and we
can just paste them here there we go and
I think it's good
okay so this is this and this one is
this I think it is good and we have like
this one extra we don't need you and we
either don't need this one so I think
this is it and if I haven't made a mess
between these pair of parentheses I
think everything should be fine okay so
let's just run that and we can actually
comment that as well so that we don't
have anything save that and let's just
run that and there we go John Mary and
everything is being printed some of you
might be worried about hey why this is
value and key this is how things works
in the for each and get other stuff and
what happens if I replace this key and
this as value this can be interesting
thing okay so guess for a moment what is
going to happen there we go so yes some
things you know needs to be like that
and for more you can read the
documentation I'm not making these
things up these are exactly written in
the documentation okay so some things
have like their own ways of doing it
that's why I usually prefer the four
roof loop because it makes for me much
more sense for key value not value key
something like that okay one last thing
that I wanted to talk about this Maps
data type and a lot of people use it in
that way is when you have an array so
let's just say we have an air air of air
means I have an array of array which is
gonna be something like this this is an
array and I want array of arrays can be
totally possible don't get confused and
it has something like this one and it is
gonna have another one notice this is my
first array this is my secondary
remember arrays of arrays and this is
gonna be like 2 comma 2 and 4 just fun
let's have the third one which is gonna
be third or let's just have three and we
are gonna have three okay so now we have
an array of arrays and you will see some
of the situations there it's really hard
to come up an example with that but
surely in the database they are pretty
easy what you can do is
you can use war and you can simply say
new map and this can be an object from
new map there we go and what you can do
is you can pass on directly this area an
area of area and it's gonna make make
these key value pairs automatically from
these array of arrays this is like one
of the most beautiful things so here's
the simple assignment I'm gonna just
first of all print this new map save
that and I'm gonna run that again and
notice we have map 1 1 2 2 3 3 just like
that so somehow it also returns you an
iterate able so look through over it and
print out individually just like this
one like 1 equals 1 2 equals 2 ok so
there we go so these are some of the
basic stuff I want to talk about I know
there is one still confusing stuff that
what the hell we are doing when we are
saying this new and map can be a little
bit tricky but notice this is something
related which is to be classes and
objects we haven't talked about it
surely we're gonna do that in future
videos so that's it pretty much for this
video and I want to open this up
documentation in front of you so that
you can also have it
various my documentation come on I
haven't opened it up even so let me just
walk you through and all you have to do
is simply say map jas and over all time
favorite mdn hats off to mozilla guys
for making such a good documentation and
there we go we have our map
documentation notice it says it tradable
and this is whole description and all
the things specially police please read
these four points or five points which
makes object different from maps very
important once when I have already
talked about which is size you can
predict the size or get the size not
predict and all these other things
alright retable we have actually talked
most about them but I highly recommend
to read at least these five points okay
so Han ready this video is pretty long
but this map subject requires a full
thorough discussion about it so I hope
you have enjoyed this video in case you
