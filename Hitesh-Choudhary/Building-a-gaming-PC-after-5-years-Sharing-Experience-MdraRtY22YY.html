with another video this video is not
about any tech stuff for programming
stuff or anything like that in this
video I would like to share my
experience about building up this PC
this is so-called a gaming PC I'm not
very sure about it but yeah it has been
long while that I haven't build up a PC
it's being almost like five years I have
absolutely no idea how people are doing
it right now so this is all about
experiencing of building of a PC after
five years PC that I build up was almost
like five years or maybe more than that
when I was in college a lot of people
don't know that but yes I did work at a
PC shop a computer shop almost like five
six or maybe six or seven years ago what
was the plan that I got my computer I
wanted to upgrade my RAM and I was like
dirt cheap broken totally couldn't
afford to buy even in RAM so I went to
the shop and said hey I want this RAM
but I have no money to pay to you so I
am ready to work for you and the first
guy said no second say no but on to like
five or six attempt I got a guy who said
hey that's good you want to work for me
for the RAM I said yes he said you have
to work for 10 days I said ok and then
from that moment onwards I was working
for that guy for like 10 or 12 days and
he asked me to install those software's
and sometimes I was even consulting to
the clients and was selling the original
windows I told them the pros and cons of
having an original Windows it gave him a
little bit sale of Windows he liked it
and I did a consultancy for buying the
laptops for different people then it
gave him the cell he was really
impressed he gave me the RAM and gave me
a job offer right took the RAM not the
job offer so yes it has been long from
that time and I had no money to even do
anything and building up my own complete
PC is experience so let me show you what
I build up here and it's done so let me
just show you this is the thing I can
even just focus that on a little bit so
this
the thing that we are having right now
this looks pretty good and I love the
way how the glass is being implemented
I've never seen that actually in person
I've seen that on YouTube videos but
never in person so this is the whole rig
I'll walk you through a little bit more
process of it so now let's talk about
the experience of building this PC now
honestly the things that it used to be
while ago is completely different and if
you haven't built any PC so far in your
life it's really thing that you should
be worried about now yes I am NOT gonna
be walking you through with compiling
all these process and just setting it up
there are hundreds of other videos on
YouTube which are doing already a better
job than me in telling you how to
assemble a PC and all these things now
here is my point now you can watch
probably hundreds of thousands of videos
on assembling the PC you will never be
able to do it
unless you do it by your hand it really
is the thing now assembling a PC is
actually pretty easy a lot of people are
afraid of it but it's not that much
stuff it's always like playing a Lego
whenever you buy a new Lego piece to
just assemble it it's all about just
fitting up the pieces and it's always
gonna be a different game the PC that I
assembled years ago is not at all
helpful now you have to just look it
from here
there are documentation in here you can
just look at them but it's not like that
a big deal now what I did let me tell
you first of all about the components
that I have I'll try to bring a link at
the description as well so that in case
you are interested you can just buy here
again one more interesting thing we can
always in always argue about whether the
selection of my component was good or I
could have gone better for a little bit
more money that's completely arguable
and depends on what kind of budget you
are having so let's just keep that
always in mind so let's just start with
this guy this is a motherboard here I
hope you can just I can just tap it here
that's why I love the touchscreens I can
just tap it and you can just see this
this is the thing that I got started
with this is the whole motherboard thing
okay and this is z2 7-0 motherboard
I liked it very much the reason one of
the reason I liked it very much during
the assembly time is can you see these
guys these guys are coming up with these
markers these red markers here so that
you can assemble your screw pretty
easily I liked it and the reason why I
picked this up because it was readily
available for me this is one of the
reason why I pick it up so I started
with the motherboard is n270 and this is
like the base assembly piece whenever
you are building up a computer just get
a motherboard now the very first thing
that you need to do to have is like
putting up the processor now arguably a
lot of people might not just agree with
me I chose this guy here so let me just
give you a quick look at here so this is
the piece of processor that I went for
this is a core i7 processor okay and
this is i7 7 7 0 0 K yes there are
better available but this was readily
available on the shop I just wanted to
do it quickly you don't want to waste
much time yes I could have gone for the
better one but I think this is like
already an overkill of what has will be
doing with this PC so this is the 7 gen
processor so I will keep the link in the
description as well for the hard disk
this is not the piece that you assemble
next because after the motherboard you
put up this guy here and then what you
need to do is put a processor fan there
this is not this is this is the fan that
I am using it so again yes of course
arguably this is not the world's best
fan that you can get but let me just get
here so this is the fan that I am using
here you can also always argue now let
me tell you what is the working of this
fan this fan allows you to have a
cooling system yes these kinds of
processors like i7 do get heated up
quite a lot so the next thing that you
should assemble is the fan and it's
pretty easy you get kind of an injection
thing in it let me see if I just throw
that down yes I throwed it it's just an
injection thing in which you get like
cooling paste you have to just put the
paste on the top of processor and they
just put a fan
looks like a heat sinking unit which can
bring all the heats down to the
processor and your computer can work
smoothly so this is the next thing that
you should do and then I what I did is
put up all this assembly the the
processor the fan and the motherboard
into this gigantic unit this is like the
case that I went there are lots of other
beautiful cases available I liked it
I'll show you that in a minute
so this is what I got now the thing that
gave me always a problem is connecting
all these connectors so this is a
problematic situation so the next thing
that you should be connecting up is this
guy now they used to look really
different when I used to do that
assembly kind of a thing and this is
like SMPS it's like a power unit like
you don't supply power directly to your
processor or to motherboard it has to be
go it has to be gone through with this
kind of thing I think Coolermaster did a
justice I'm not being paid by any one of
them I generally like them I research
for them and I just bought them now one
interesting thing that I noticed here
that previously all these SMPS units the
power units used to have inbuilt cable
the cable was coming directly from them
and you just have to connect them now
they are giving these cables separately
the good thing is that I don't know if
there is it like in the mold power unit
bigger one like 751 you are getting this
or not but again anyways the good thing
about giving us the cables in a separate
unit is I can have like multiple graphic
cards and all these things and you can
just put them as many cables are like
it's not about cable will be just always
be there makes it a little bit like
cleaner inside the unit so I like the
way if I just have a look onto it I
still have like lots of tables here
remaining these are still the cables
which are still remaining so I can add
up a lot of things in here definitely
will be doing it probably later on
because you know everybody when they
works on with the pcs they like to
upgrade them eventually okay for the RAM
I you
this guy I know some of you might not be
agreeing with me that hey this is not
the best friend
but yeah it's a g.skill Ram I liked it
and this is like 16 gigs and this is
just in one unit this is the one I liked
it little bit surprised that now you can
have even 16 gigs in just one chip
previously it used to be like eight plus
eight but now they're giving just one
and I really liked it so this is the RAM
that I am using in case you want more
things I'll put a link in the
description and finally the big guy here
the beast that I'm using is this guy
it's GDX at 10:50 TI now yes there is a
1060 in the market there is even better
one in the market which is damn
expensive I was really surprised at how
expensive these guys are coming up and
the guy told me that hey a lot of people
are buying it for like mining the
bitcoins and that's why these are going
like pretty high in the rate but yes I
got a fair deal on that so this is the
rate that I am using for the hard disk
I'm using a Seagate I kind of trust the
Seagate guys I'm using it just a 2 TB
I'm not using any SSDs but I have kept a
slot for SSD I will probably will be
doing it probably like in the next month
or maybe after that whenever I get time
so this is the rig that I have built up
it was pretty easy
the only thing problematic was first of
all just pinning up the screws which was
like a little bit difficult for this
kind of motherboard I was not able to
like find all the places where I have to
screw it up and the second thing is the
cables it's really hard to find because
you know we are grown up guys we have
like big hands and putting up these
cables is not so easy the places are so
tiny and so small it's it's not easy in
there if you are a kid doing all these
things it would be easier for you in the
small hands to go in these small places
and plug it in only thing that you have
to take care is do not apply extreme
force because you may break some of the
pins so be gentle and just put all the
things where they need to go
documentation surely help but again as I
say probably you watch like 100
200 videos of assembling these pcs you
will never be able to do it unless you
are actually doing it so don't hesitate
go on to your nearby shop ask these guys
to teach you how to assemble the PCs
just with the videos you will never be
able to do it it's not tough it's pretty
easy so this was my experience of
building up a PC after five or six years
I really enjoyed that it feels like
again like a kid but hey I'm building up
my own thing it always gives me a
pleasure when I am building up my own
thing how good they are or how bad that
is doesn't really matter this PC is
gonna be helpful for me in mostly for
Sunday games that's it I wanted to give
some more time this year to myself
because I just don't want to be keep
working and working so on Sundays I will
be playing just like lazy games with
friends and stuff like that so do put
down your valuable comments in the
comment section below for the
recommendation of which games should I
try now the last memory of the games
that I played is really old it's it was
like total overdose and Prince of Persia
I would be surely playing them again but
let me know what are the current games
again I'm not a counter-strike fan yeah
I know a lot of people just hate me for
that my school and my friends at college
you usually just say hey why don't you
try that it's so amazing it I don't like
that that's that's just me
so do notify me what are the things or
the games that you would like to suggest
me to just have it probably we can go on
the stand 11 you can see how badly I
play video game have evil plan that very
soon so that's all about for this video
I hope you have enjoyed and have learned
something from my experience I highly
recommend you to go to your nearby shop
and just ask that guy to teach you how
to assemble a PC it's really easy and I
think everybody who says that I'm
somehow interested in computer should
actually learn that it so that's it for
this video do note if I in the comment
section your favorite game and that you
recommend to me and I will surely catch
you up in the next video and yes I
realize that I forgot one more thing in
this PC which is integrated wireless
card I could have placed that inside it
but now I have to order it separately
now when I was running this PC I
realized that we
have any buyers from doubter anymore in
this studio so everything is working
wirelessly and this iMac actually is the
reason for that I'm ex comes with a
Wi-Fi and I thought just you know this
is how do I stop work I forgot that
desktop works with an Ethernet cable so
I will be ordering that up and we'll be
integrating it again links will be in
the description in case you want to have
it or you can just find it by your own
that's pretty much it for this video
