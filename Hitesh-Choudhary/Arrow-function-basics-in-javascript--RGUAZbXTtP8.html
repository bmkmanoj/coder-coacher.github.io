with another video and today people
today we are talking about the most
amazing arrow functions now well the
reason why arrow functions are so
popular is because everybody loves them
they are so short makes a lot of sense
and this is something which first time
when you see that you don't like it but
eventually when you work on the stuff
you just say thank you so much we do
have arrow functions it's it makes code
so much clearer but again remember me
when the first time people actually see
that it becomes like not so friendly I
don't like it it's stuff like that
everybody HAP ins to everyone okay so
let's just go ahead and do some stuff so
first of all I would like to have a new
exercise file so I'm gonna just create a
new folder and still it creates inside
it so it's gonna be 0 1 add the van's
and this is not so advanced if I can
write that correct it's not so advanced
it's like the basic stuff but you know
so let's just get started with that and
obviously I would like to move that
outside come on move that and there we
go now I can close this intermediate I
can go into advanced and can start
creating a new file so this is gonna be
simply a row dot J s so there we go
we're gonna get started with arrow and
there we go ok now in order to
understand these arrow functions first
and foremost we need to write a function
in the way how we have been writing this
in the throughout this series basic
function 101 back because it's so much
easier to just kind of forget I don't
know what to say
the context from this basic function
into the next one so let's get started
and write our very first function and I
hope many of you are aware of that how
we did that
yes of course there are many ways of
writing the function but let's just say
I want a simple function that says just
hello so I'm going to create equals
function and then pair of parentheses
and then we just use something known as
return come on return and something like
this and we used to say hey there and
then probably use
this guy and let's just say we are also
taking a name as parameter there we go
and we just say name and then probably
this guy's something like this and stuff
like that okay so no no big deal we have
done this so many time this should be as
simple as it could be as you're standing
at this point on this series so we're
gonna log that and we are gonna log that
say say hello and we're gonna pass it
like Sammy and we have to pass it in the
codes something like this Sammy
there we go so let's just expect what
this is gonna do so we're gonna simply
open up our terminal and we're gonna
move into 0 1 advance go there and we're
gonna run this file so we're gonna say
row J yes there we go hey there Sammy no
big deal at all we have done this
probably so many times so how we can
convert this function into an arrow
function also we're going to talk about
a little bit of the advanced stuff so
what I'm gonna do just to keep this as a
reference I'm gonna copy this and I'm
gonna comment this for you and we're
gonna just move some lines ahead and
there we go so in order to convert a
regular function into an arrow function
first of all it's super simple what you
do is you remove this word function here
that's the step number one okay and
instead of the parameter and everything
remains same and what you use is an
equal sign and this guy okay so this is
your basic arrow function okay so you
might be saying hey this looks almost
same and we just remove the function
world and use this arrow doesn't really
make sense to me and yes initially it
doesn't make much sense to me but
eventually when I worked into that it
became so easy and stuff now most of the
advanced stuff that we are going to
learn in the JavaScript is something
which is syntactic sugar and in fact
most of them is in the end syntactic
sugar I will explain these things a
little bit better step by step process
as you know I always like to go
thoroughly everything so save that and
we're gonna run this again to make sure
that yes everything is working fine and
properly okay there we go so this is
something which you'll be seeing quite a
lot so there we go
now this is one type of arrow functions
like again as I told you these are all
syntactic sugar
you'll be seeing every variety of the
code the next step is when we are using
something as advanced JavaScript we
don't like to use these double quotes
much often because it is so much pain to
use these plus signs and everything so
remove that use your favorite backticks
and we're gonna simply say hey there and
then use dollar sign and pair of curly
braces and something like that and we
can just directly pass on name here is
it gonna work fine yes absolutely we can
at any point run this and can verify yes
it works
okay so what are these backticks these
are known as literals string literals a
lot of people call them with different
name I just call them backticks syntax
and that's it so this is the step number
one we have converted from this function
to this point now also you will notice
something different here that when
you're using arrow functions and you
just have like one line to return you
don't have a big block of code which is
doing multiple things for you you will
be seeing stuff like that that we remove
these curly braces just like that okay
and we also remove this return keyword
and also everything goes to the same
line so there we go
now notice previously you're using like
three lines for just this thing and now
we can just go ahead and do that in just
one single line is it gonna work yes
absolutely it's gonna work
clear the screen run that same result no
problem at all and this is the big goal
of these arrow function to reduce down
the complexity as much as possible the
code is at initial level you might be
saying hits hey it's so much harder to
read to define a block of code and yes I
do agree with you initially it's a
little bit harder even to read but
eventually when you'll be working in
things like no GS or react native or
react or angular you will be you will be
looking forward that hey this is
actually much better and it's a cleaner
code and this is all we have now also I
have seen that people whenever wave they
want to use these arrow functions or
something they always like to use arrow
functions but with the pair of curly
braces totally fine totally personal
nobody's gonna say hey you're doing bad
no it's totally okay
even in some points I even prefer to use
these curly braces because this defines
my block of code cleanly and if somebody
else is gonna read my code which happens
a lot then it's much more easier to
figure them out that what it is doing
actually so this is our basic stuff now
we are completely ready to do with the
error functions bear with me there's a
lot to discuss in the error functions
but we will be moving on to this a
little bit slowly okay so there we go
and we're gonna just keep it right there
okay now moving on to the next part now
where you'll be using these arrow
functions and whenever there is a
callback we have seen so many like find
and all these fine index and all of that
they require some kind of callback we
were passing writing function keyword
and all of that in those places you will
be like almost every time you're gonna
be seeing an arrow function being passed
on this is kind of a standard now
everywhere and you'll be seeing that
quite a lot so let's just do some of the
fun stuff and I'm gonna give you some
assignments as well so watch this
closely so we're gonna create our Trello
so we're gonna call this as two do's and
we are gonna have an array of objects
okay one and two and three now just like
previously we have done our to-do is
gonna have two things title if I can
write that correct and title is gonna be
my favorite by bread there we go
and it's gonna have is done I can write
that correct and this is gonna be like
true so this is our first one let's just
go ahead and move to the second one and
we're gonna have title this is gonna be
go to Jim please and is done this is
gonna be like true I went to Jim I
promise I I was there and one more which
is gonna be title oops there we go enter
title and this is gonna be something
like record YouTube videos that is
actually I'm doing so all two dudes are
done and we're gonna have is done that
is gonna be
a force of one stuff we're gonna say
true/false on that okay so now that our
to do is defined we obviously know how
we can dig up into this because it's an
array so all the functions like fine
fine index and whatever we have learned
so far is already there now what we want
to do is we want to pick up only the two
dues which are done which are true okay
so how we can do that now here comes
these the single example of this
callback functions and usage of this
error functions comes handy so we're
going to write a simple function which
can go through with this - dues and can
pick up only the two dues which are done
true okay so let's just see how we can
do that so we're gonna have const i'm
gonna call this as things done just to
make sure we are giving easy name on
here okay so how we're gonna do that is
really simple we're gonna call this two
dues and there are many options in here
one of them is this filter and as I put
a pair of parentheses notice it says it
requires a callback FN it simply stands
it requires a callback function and you
can just pass on your condition that you
really want to do and only when the
condition is gonna met it's gonna return
only those elements in this entire array
so remember listen to this closely this
filter just like for each loops through
every single object and returns the only
one which are meeting up the condition
okay so we have to pass on a callback
function okay so previously what we were
doing we were writing this function pair
of parentheses then these things and
stuff like that we were writing it there
is no exception on that we will be still
doing it
but just in the arrow function so let me
hit command C couple of times and a pair
of parentheses and then we'll be using
an arrow function and we are gonna be
using pair of parentheses just for a
moment now previously this for each was
was able to access that to do just like
that filter is also able to access each
individual to do in the two dues okay
pretty clear and now we are gonna return
something from it so what we're gonna
say is we are gonna return
and what you have to return is dependent
how you want to shape up this condition
in this case I want to simply check to
do it has a function is done and I want
to check if it is equals to true there
we go
basic stuff nothing big we are doing
here okay okay so now that our function
is ready it's not basically a function
it's just a variable which is holding
the result of this function filter so
what are we gonna do is log this thing's
done just like that and we're gonna open
up our terminal and we are gonna simply
say there we go so whether if Sami is
coming up from there but notice only the
to do is which are being done is only
being returned so that's nice thing but
we haven't actually truly used the arrow
function what we have learned here so
what we can do is yes you know that we
are going to remove this curly braces
okay and we are also going to remove
this return thing here till here and
there we go and notice this is our
filter and in just one line we are able
to do it now so this is impressive and
we're gonna save that and clean the
board and run that again and notice
still we are getting the same result
and notice previously we were taking so
many line it was little bit complex but
this is now much more cleaner and easier
at first you might be saying this is not
easier for me but trust me when we work
on the node.js or something like that it
becomes so much easier with these
functions okay now it's time for your
assignment okay so this is all good now
what I want you to do is create a to-do
list with six elements three should be
true three should be false all randomly
assigned okay also you have to create a
simple things not done function or a
simple variable things not done it
should use a filter and somehow figure
out that how you can do the things where
all the to do switch are not done should
only be printed out and not only that
you should not print the whole object
here you should only print the title of
it very important I repeat my assignment
create a simple to do with six elements
or six objects inside it three through
three false and create a simple thing so
not done
and that should only return the title of
the to do which are not done okay and
post on it in the comment section or the
discussion section and that's it for the
error function as of now and I'm going
to surely catch you up in a next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
