with another video and in this video I
want to give you some very valuable
resource now when we go into data
science and machine learning but before
we even start that let me make it clear
that this video is not for everyone this
video specifically for those persons who
are interested either in data science
machine learning deep learning neural
network artificial intelligence whatever
you call that the roots actually always
get start from data science and machine
learning and understanding these data
sets so this video is specifically
specifically for those people who keeps
their interest in data science and
machine learning either are doing their
masters or PhD or some research work for
their company so as I mentioned in one
of my previous videos where I talked
about top five challenges if you haven't
watched that video go ahead on my
channel and watch that so the biggest
one challenge is how to get data set yes
of course Cagle do helps in getting a
lot of data set but sometimes when you
are working on to a research level for
masters or PhD or maybe working for a
big giant company having that kind of
data set is really crucial and you don't
have an access for that so in this video
I want to talk about one such resource
which have petabytes and petabytes of
data that you can use absolutely all for
free common creative license you can use
that have in in your research or maybe
publish a paper on to that and that's
all free so from where you can get
petabytes of these data now first and
foremost it's not for everyone so that
means if your computers is having like 8
gigs of RAM or 32 gigs of ram this data
set is gonna be really hard to process
so you maybe want to invest a little bit
in the Amazon resources or maybe deploy
a kind of a docker or something to have
it so without any further ado let me
bring up this amazing research which is
known as common crawl so common crawl is
a gigantic data set available of course
for totally for free you can see there
is a creative common license common
crawl and what did too is they basically
go on to it's basically a collection of
almost every website present on the web
and this gives us plethora of resources
out politics about news about trends
tech news job market or
I don't have even words to just say how
much possibilities are there it's
completely an endless resource that you
can have their support a variety of
languages including Hindi Tamil English
French German or whatever you say it it
has got a great resource now the one of
the biggest challenge which I discussed
in my top-five programming challenges in
machine learning is getting the data set
now the data data set which we get
started in learning in the earlier days
is just like few hundreds of lines or
probably thousands of line but when you
want to train your data set for a
revolutionary thing then it requires
some millions of lines of data set and
this is just one such example and this
is the website pretty easy they have raw
data metadata and takes data and
everything available so the big picture
is here and if you click on what you can
do there are amazing example projects
that has been done in the past or one of
the one which is really impressive if
you want to have a read is using Python
and common crawl to find products on
Amazon by David said err it's it's
amazing I highly recommend to read this
one let me just open that up as well
highly impressive work completely blown
away how this is being used and this is
being set up so this is all what has
been done yes immense amount of code is
there but not too much hard to
understand it's nicely written nicely
commented really appreciate the work
that is being done here and he's an
Australian guy absolutely absolutely
amazing work here again there are
plethora of other things that you can do
with this this is just one of the many
examples but again processing this kind
of petabytes of data is not at all
possible with any ordinary computer now
if you look on to this data set here I
was somewhere here to find out a couple
of data sets and these data sets are
really really like gigantic so if you go
into this data and get started
notice the data set which is available
is obviously they are using Amazon
services to have this kind of data set
just look at this one which is summer
2003 and just have a look at the size
here
102 t be so storing that kind of data in
memory is not at all possible so maybe
you want to use some
things like tensorflow and create a
pipeline to divide this data to based on
like once this data is being fetched
then this data in this data tensorflow
can easily do that
but still it's still it's gigantic it's
a two billion webpage of data and that's
just one link that I've shown you so
again a speechless resource here and
they are not so famous so I thought with
my platform I can give them a little bit
more exposure they're famous in a
certain research group but not everybody
who is getting started in machine
learning knows about it so I thought why
not to share just one resource and
probably in the upcoming videos I'll be
sharing more such resources which can
help you I highly highly recommend to
check out at least their resources what
they can offer it can be really helpful
for your research work ok so that's it
that's all I wanted to talk about this
have a look at the website I'll keep the
link in the description below about the
common crawl dot org amazing resource I
love that guy in fact we are planning to
use that or show some demonstration on
the Amazon services but it's little bit
expensive to have that but definitely we
can see what we can do so that's it for
this video in case you have enjoyed this
video give it a thumbs up and share it
with your friends so that your friend
can do amazing research work as well and
get to know about this amazing channel
where we talk about programming and the
tech stuff so that's it for this video
hit that subscribe button and I'm gonna
surely catch you up in an XY
like what do you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
