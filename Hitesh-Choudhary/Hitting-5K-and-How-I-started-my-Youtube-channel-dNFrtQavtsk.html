I'm back with another video now this
video is not anything technical teaching
you anything or talking about what I
think about the world or anything like
that in this video I just would like to
say thank you so much for letting me hit
the 5000 subscribers I know people are
having hundred thousands and everything
but everything is motivating for me and
five thousand subscribers is a big deal
for me
so I would like to say thank you so much
for the five thousand subscribers as
well as I would like to share my story
of how I got started in the YouTube so I
won't be adding any of the teasers or
anything in my channel in this
particular video but I would like to say
that yes my journey with the youtubes
was little bumpy and let me just share
how I got started so I created my
youtube channel almost three or four
years back it was not a channel where I
was uploading anything it was just an
account where I was viewing the people's
uploaded things or the people's video it
was pretty good for me YouTube is very
entertaining I was learning a lot of
things from the YouTube and also on top
of that I was hitting a lot of subscribe
to the people who regularly do uploader
or their channel are really good and I
love to watch what they say so within
almost a year I was having almost no
videos on my channel after that I got
interviewed on a media channel for some
of the other stuff pen testing and
everything and I thought hey why not to
share this video with public and I I got
that video and uploaded that on my
channel and it was pretty good videos
got a couple of hundred hits and that
was a big deal for me and obviously I
got a couple of subscribers I guess five
or eight subscribers which was not very
much motivating to get started in the
YouTube so I never actually even thought
that YouTube could be my choice and I
would be getting into this field which
is really great and to be honest I
underestimated the power of the YouTube
I thought YouTube is just a free
platform and people would not be much
more interactive on the on the free
platform they would be just watching the
videos and will be going out and it's
it's not good and obviously it was in
he move and I was completely totally
wrong about the YouTube what I what I
thought about it so after a couple years
I thought that hey why not to give it a
chance to the YouTube and at that time I
was already creating a lot of videos and
most of those videos were for the paid
people who are my subscribers on
different platforms a lot of websites
are there on which I serve and upload my
videos and entire course curriculums in
the boot camps where people can pay and
can get subscription of all of my
content but I thought let's upload a few
of the contents on the YouTube and it
got a pretty good response and nobody is
just perfect in their early days about
video making and all these process so
neither was i I uploaded a few stuff got
a few hit of the subscribers but this
was not at all motivating I wasn't
earning much on the YouTube so I thought
and I just dropped this idea and after
if after when I got a lot into the video
development for a lot of website and I
was doing a lot of paid stuff for that I
thought let's give it a one more try and
this was not even hard to get some of
the subscribers I was learning ns3 for
one of my project and I thought it's
very tough to learn ns3 which is a geeky
topic and there were a lot of people
might be already aware of that so in the
NS 3 I I was facing a lot of problem in
installation and setting up the
environment everything so I thought let
me just record all of these videos for
my future reference and I uploaded the
hen on the YouTube and to my surprise
for the next 4 months
I didn't even opened my account yes that
that's what I did and after the 4 month
when I came back I realized that every
video was having 50,000 views and 60,000
views so from a couple of hundred views
to the 60,000 views that was a big move
for me and that was pretty crazy pretty
insane for me that how am I getting so
much of the views and people are
subscribing to my channel and writing me
emails why don't you upload more content
your content is great thank you so much
for saying that I thought it's it's
really a good idea and good time to get
started and be active on the youtube so
I thought let's give it one more try and
I tried it with my other channel
that didn't even got much of the success
got a hundred subscriber but that was
not at all even motivating so I stopped
that again obviously I have to earn a
little bit I have to pay my bills so I
again got back into the paint video
stuff and to my surprise again a lot of
people suggested me they were really
good suggestions and they were pretty
big youtubers in their country they said
why are you making a new channel why
don't you just continue with your
previous channel it is already having
some subscribers people are waiting that
your content should get on air and they
are waiting you to put some things and
watch them so I said okay that is a good
advice and I got started in the YouTube
again you might have been watching this
from the last couple of months I'm
getting too much active on the YouTube
so I got a lot of subscribers and to be
honest in the one or two years of my
channel I got almost thousand
subscribers and within the last two
month I got almost 2,000 subscribers so
this is this is a big time leaps gap in
a one or couple years I'm getting
thousand and within just two months I'm
getting two thousand subscribers which
is a big deal for me so I thought that
I'm gonna be active on the YouTube again
I would be putting much more content
much more fresh content on the YouTube
and I realized that people are getting
interacting people are interacting with
me they love my content so why not to
put more content and with this I would
like to say that yes I would be
uploading a lot more content on the
YouTube this is really overwhelming
response for me and one more thing that
I would be adding on my channel now is a
lot of new playlists I realized that my
recent playlist hello world got a lot of
attention of the people so I would be
adding more content and I would be
adding more playlists like for example
the web dev playlist the iOS 10 playlist
and there would be one mode which is
going to be the YouTube playlist and
although I know a lot of stuff about
video making the lightening how you can
do DIY stuff for your own videos so I
would be adding a new playlist for that
and I would be also talking about how
you can earn money from the YouTube it
is a big deal and I would like to say
honestly that you don't make much money
with the YouTube but it's not like you
are just earning some pennies with the
YouTube YouTube income is
pretty good and it's not something from
which you can buy a Harley within within
the initial days but it's not even that
bad that you cannot pay even the bills
of the internet or can buy an iPhone
within my two month of the revenue I I
think I can buy a pretty decent phone
not the iPhone 7 but yes I can buy
almost iPhone six or five as something
like that so I would be sharing how you
can get started with the YouTube can
make it a paid platform pretty good
earning is YouTube is not that much high
but it's not that much low it's pretty
decent
you can survive with that and a lot of
stuff is going to be coming up so with
this I would like to say that do hit to
subscribe to my channel and do hit the
like on the video as well if you think
somebody can get benefit from my channel
do recommend the channel for them and I
would be adding a lot of content so with
this again thank you so much for letting
me hit the 5,000 subscribers I will obey
what I say and I would be adding a lot
of more content which would be really
super cool so with this let's go ahead
and I know this is a little bit
overwhelming but let's go ahead and i'll
see you in the next movie where some
technical stuff will go on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
