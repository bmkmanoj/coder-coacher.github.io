little tired from last night journey and
then I had to work as well
so the day started a little bit late but
I'm done with all of my work now and I
have to reschedule a few things the day
before yesterday and there was something
messy because the table guys showed up
early and he said I'm gonna be coming up
in half an hour
so I had to reschedule everything I told
my relative I'm not gonna be coming
today I'll be coming day after tomorrow
today and that's all so I have just
finished off my work I'm gonna have a
quick snack the healthy snack and then
I'm gonna be hitting to my relatives and
I'll tell you one more thing about the
work-related stuff and that's important
for every single person who is doing a
freelancing or anything like that
so after snacks I'll get you up on the
streets okay so I am headed up to take
my car and then I'll be going to the
relatives but really I wanted to say one
thing that I was working with this
mumbai-based client and he it was just a
web-based project and we just completed
the project and now the client is trying
to outsmart us he has locked us out of
the website and he's saying we don't
like your work and has asked for the
refund and the website is still there
we have asked him to set on the website
or take down the website because it's
our work sometimes people do that and
what I don't like about it is I have to
waste a lot of energy because the client
is trying to outsmart for sure he has to
face the consequences but you know
what's the best part about it is he will
understand that it's not easy to take
our hard work and just go away with that
okay if you don't like our website or
anything our work you just make sure you
delete that no problem at all
just take your refund but if you take a
refund make sure you don't take our work
as well it happens to a lot of real
answers so tell me in the comment
section below if it happens to you as
well and I'll catch you up once I get my
tooth get to my car okay so done with
the family stuff now I'm headed back to
home and there is a project being there
I just want to decorate
wall and that's gonna be my next project
that I'll be doing done with the work
stuff for now but headed back to home
Indian roads a little bit crazy and
there are three types of people you
should every time watch out the first
ones are the roadside walkers because
they don't follow anything they can jump
onto your car anytime the second time of
people who don't follow the signal there
are road signs road signals
most people don't like to follow them so
you have to be extra careful for them
and third but not the least the guys who
are always on the phone no matter what
happens
they're on the phones so they are the
very dangerous one they don't care about
anyone they don't even wear the
seatbelts they don't like to fall the
roots but honking is also a problem
because I don't know why it's not like
that I'm gonna be staying on the streets
all the day it's my hobby no but still
people behind you are gonna honk and
they I think they assume that you're
gonna be staying on the street if they
don't honk
so they honk so that you can move you
know anyways everybody will be moving so
I'm headed back to home I'm almost there
and this is the world that I want to
redecorate let me show you what the
current situation is what and what I am
planning to do so let me just show you
so this is the wall and this is the
situation completely blank wall and
okay so this is the situation of our
ball that's my green screen and there's
a pole that I've installed but the
problem is this photo of me and my
brother and I have to keep this frame
away a little bit and I'll be just
moving this frame to somewhere else and
then what I'm planning to do is take a
lot of photos and just make a collage
there and it's gonna be really fun and
awesome project so let me just do that
shall we begin
this is not a drill
repeat this is not a drill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
