course this course is going to be
entirely very useful and very
interesting for all of you but hey don't
just start to bang the you bang your
head into the wall so that saying that
hey the issue are starting from the very
scratch very low level and all of us
know that stuff but hey I have to keep
in pace with those students who are
starting their carrier into the
information security and the deleted
guys so before moving into the
cryptography what does the cryptography
what is the definition of the
cryptography let's learn what are the
security issues that we face and I'm not
talking about the digital life it's the
cryptography is a science which is out
there from the very old history of even
before the world war and all those so
the cryptography and all such things
were invented because we are facing a
couple of security issues now what are
these security issues I have categorized
them into the five categories let's
discuss about them so that you can
understand that the cryptography is
really neat to be invented a wheel that
neat that should need to be invented out
there so let's talk about them the case
is one and I was not having enough time
to prepare those automated in animation
and the presentation so I'll be keeping
the things very simple and to the very
basics so let's talk about the case one
and what we are having so first of all
the case one let me choose my pen I
would be choosing the right fan out here
okay so we have got our three friends
there Alice the Bob and the Eve Alice
and Bob are really the most famous guys
all over the internet whether you choose
any topic any subject these are the
famous guys and these can be considered
as the two ordinary persons who are just
communicating between each other then we
have God Eve Eve is a malicious user or
you can say the hacker or rather the Eve
is being used for the East dropping but
nobody's about that just considered Eve
as you can consider it as
some sort of hacker as well so that
would work as well now let's move on to
the case one the Alice is trying to pass
some data let's say it's a data
information D and it's being passed on
to the Bob now in the idle typical
condition this information is just
passed on but what the eve has done what
the first security problem is that the
copy of the D is also being transmitted
to the Yves now E is also having the
same copy the D now this information can
divert valuable can not be worth
valuable it can be credit card
information it can be your user account
information it can be some payroll
information and likewise but Eve in this
case is not at all worried about what
this is this is just information that
Eve is having this is the first security
problem that we are facing now let's
move on to the second problem what we
have got in the second problem now in
the second case again let's say we have
got a D data which needs to be
transmitted to the Bob now in this case
what's happening that the same
information is first of all somehow got
transmitted to the Eve and this was the
information D now Eve is being a
malicious hacker have changed this
information from D to let's say E and
has transmitted back a to the Bob while
the same route or the same protocol
let's say let's just keep the things
simple the same route
e now what has happened the Bob is now
assuming that the information has come
from a reliable source that is Alice but
ultimately it's not the reliable
information
it's the changed information so what we
are facing here is you can say the
change of info so that is our problem
out here information can be changed and
the Bob is not having any idea that
information is being changed second
problem very major one now let's come
back to the third case now what's
happening in this case alice is sending
some data to Bob and Bob here is
expecting some data from the Alice but
what has happened
Eve has impersonated as to be Alice and
this time let's say this was again the
data D which is being transmitted to the
Bob and this data which is D is being
transmitted from the eve but Bob is
thinking that this data is has been
coming from the Alice now again this is
the impersonation situation so I'll call
it the impersonation situation out here
and anyone can transmit data to the Bob
and Bob is again thinking hey this is
from the Alice now this can be really
dangerous situation so this is our case
number three the security issue which we
are facing now let's move back to the
fourth issue what we are having now
let's this case is a bit interesting
I've tried to make some real-life
example into it now Ellis and Eve are
the workers of let's say XYZ company
they access their daily information from
this server now what happened Alice
found out that Eve is a malicious hacker
and should not access the server Alice
have ordered the administration to
please block the access of Eve to the
server
now admin has given permission or some
commands to block the information of the
account information of the Eve but what
Eve has done Eve has thrown some extra
traffic into the block of admin let's
say these are the traffic's and when
admin actually makes some commands these
commands are going at a very very slow
rate so Eve is making a final attempt to
the server to copy all the information
which he or she requires from the server
and once he or she the Eve has got all
the information into his local hard
drive or local copy then finally the
command is being issued to the servers
that says please block the account of
Eve but hey there is no actually usage
of such command and blocking of the
information because Eve has already got
all the data with him or her you can say
anything so this is really a problem the
information
should be available and it should be
available on time so server has got the
information of blocking the account at a
later point of time and this is really
not the situation we want so let's move
on to the final case what we have got
the final case this is also interesting
one now Alice and Bob works for some
share holding company Alice has thrown a
mail from the mail server to the Bob
saying that from the company XYZ
purchase the share worth rupees five
thousand dollars now Alice has done the
same but what happened the XYZ company
market goes down and all of the $5,000
shares went just off it's not of use
anymore they accompany crashed
eventually now Alice has suddenly denied
that hey I haven't send you an email you
shouldn't be purchasing that $5,000
shares so now please return me my shares
since I haven't sent any kind of mail so
the information shared by Alice and Bob
should be all valid there should be some
proof that say is hey information came
to me and I have this proof that
information is coming to me so these are
the couple of cases and incidents which
need to be protected out there in the
digital life and in the real life also
so cryptography is the science that
gives us the solution of all such
problems and quite others as well so
this is all about what are the security
issues we are facing out there on the
general criteria this is all from where
your attacks like man-in-the-middle
attack then the cracking of the WEP and
all such things actually came and arise
from but hey if you are expecting all
these in the practical aspects just go
out and watch other courses by me like
SQL injection pin testing with backtrack
I have done all the practical aspect out
there but in this course I will be doing
all the theoretical stuff which need to
be out there with you so this is all
about the things in all the cases which
I came up with again I would be
requesting all of you to please share
all these videos with the community with
the people with the blog or make out
your channel own channel at YouTube with
my courses out there of course this one
only so that's all for this video and
see out in the next video with some more
and interesting topic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
