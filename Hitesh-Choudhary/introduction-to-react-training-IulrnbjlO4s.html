complete react.js web developer course
with es6 we'll turn projects now I know
some of you might want to just give this
course introduction video but don't do
that because there are a couple of ways
by which you can enhance your learning
experience and few tips by which you can
proceed with this course now I won't be
wasting your time let's just directly
get into the meat part first of all what
is react Cheers now we will discuss
thoroughly about react.js and everything
but to be very quick it's a framework
being developed by Facebook and it is
just being designed so that websites and
web apps can be high-performing and
later on you might want to jump into the
react native and anything like that in
which you can design apps for iOS and
Android using just JavaScript so the
journey starts from here from the react
okay so let me quickly walk you through
what this course covers and how you can
take this code now in case you are
coming up from simple HTML CSS and
JavaScript background and you don't have
any idea about es6 then simply you might
want to go into the section 7 directly
because this section is completely
optional and if you have no idea about
es6 then first go through with section 7
section 8 and then directly into section
1 okay I hope you get that now in case
you have little bit idea about the es6
like fat arrow function and map for
looping through arrays and everything
then directly you can jump from the
section 1 now in the section 1 I will be
doing about the introduction to the
course a little bit about what kind of
mindset you require few hello world zap
and therefore now from this point onward
I'll just appear at the very first of
the section that is what we'll be doing
in this section and that will explain
what this section is about what kind of
project you will be doing and all such
stuff ok so you don't need to worry
about any kind of overview that is being
taken care of now after that you might
be seeing a lot of projects being done
and let me quickly walk you through with
a couple of projects now of course time
doesn't permit us to just display all
the projects in just one video and
definitely if you want to keep and just
take a look at you can obviously go into
these section but let me quickly walk
you through that what kind of detail we
are going to about to go in here
so this is one of the project that we
will be doing there are many others as
well and this is a complete login system
in which we are dealing up with the R 0
login system and epi is as well ok so it
says click on the login to view github
viewer ok and as soon as I click on the
login we get a let me click on not your
account it gives you a complete login
system login with Facebook Google
Twitter and from the email as well there
is a sign of exactly same form as there
and it works really nice we can quickly
create a user there and you can just log
in as there as well I already have a
user and you have full functionality of
sign up as well so it's a test at the
rate tester calm and the password is
just test use it there and as soon as I
log in there and in a second it's going
to log me in and now you can see an API
working there and you can create for any
of the github account just hit the enter
and it will show you how many
depositories are there followers
following and pretty much everything so
it's in a kind of a big app in itself
and this is just one of the app that
we'll be dealing up of course there are
many other projects that you can go
through and have a look like a complete
project with the firebase are 0 reddit
IP is routers the template and a lot of
tons of things are in here ok now also
let me walk you through with a Q&amp;amp;A
section now in case you find any problem
you can post your questions there but
before posting an equation make sure you
search for the question as well because
there are high chances student might
have already asked the question about
that topic
ok so this is a quick introduction of
the course about what the course is
actually what is going to teach and how
you can proceed with the code and
without wasting any further more time
let's directly move on to the next movie
and talk about what kind of mindset you
need to learn react yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
