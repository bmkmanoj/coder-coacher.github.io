but on the video and this is Sunday life
and in case you are new to this channel
make sure you do hit the subscribe and
we do Sunday live every single Sunday at
least from last couple of months and
I'll try I'll make sure that I'll do
these kinds of Sunday life after this
Sunday live as well
we are very working hard to make sure
these lives are possible in the future
as well so hey everybody hey pratik hey
Abbi shake a safe Dharma
hi Abbey shake how are you hi there MA
how's it going nice profile picture
there Dharma I loved it
okay hi Karthik yes the Prasad the
Google sign-in is not working in the app
yet yesterday we had some problems in
the facebook login as well but that is
resolved now the Google login is still
there and I promise it's gonna be
resolved very soon so that's coming up
and we are gonna wait for a couple of
seconds so that people can join up can
hit that like button and I can share
some of the upcoming updates and a lot
of questions that I can answer
so definitely and you might be thinking
this video is much more awesome in
quality yes it is it's on my new phone
one plus five I didn't bought the one
plus five after watching a lot of
reviews by the people but uh actually
I'm surprised by the quality of all
those reviewers and whatever they are
saying on the YouTube and everything I
find this phone absolutely fantastic
so we don't have any particular topics
for the Sunday lives I just try to
answer the questions that people ask
usually for the usual five minutes or
ten minutes we just wait for the people
to show up and it's not very lengthy
time to wait up it's really quick
always you can see the number of people
who are watching it's growing quickly
the number of lights that people are
hitting are going really really fast
it's really tripping just like that and
we're gonna talk about that okay so
let's try to pick up few questions and
in case a lot of you don't know I am
about to move to Bangalore for a few
days because I do have some exclusive
access of the Google products that I'll
be working on testing on I cannot
discuss about that but yes these are
some amazing Google products that you
will be seeing very soon in the future
probably I'll be the first one to make
videos about them because I am I'm
already using them I do have an
exclusive access for that these are not
any product like like phone or anything
like that no it's not like that
it's a code based things just like the
Google products that you are using like
api's and all those so I do have an
access of that okay that wasn't a quick
update also I would like to give you
some updates about the learned code
online dot in we got a new website
that's awesome I have introduced
learning tracks on that to make sure
that you can easily find up your courses
if you're interested in Android what are
the courses that you can take up so
these are the learning tracks that I
have introduced and also I have
introduced a fake use a frequently asked
question section on the website as well
as below every course so that I can put
up there also the new app in case you
haven't yet updated or have downloaded
the learned code online dot an app it's
fantastic and I'm pretty sure you're
going to love that there are a couple of
bugs in it right now like the login
issues are working we are working on
that every single day I am working on it
yesterday it was having an issue in
Facebook and Google login the Facebook
was resolved immediately but now it's
having a Google issue it's gonna resolve
very soon but you're gonna love this the
latest latest thing here which are going
on also the iOS app is also coming up
and since we are almost done with the
apps that means the competitions are
also going to come up because the plan
that I had was first to update the
website then to update the Android app
then to launch the iOS happened then to
have the competition so very soon you
can see the competitions and we are
preparing the competition for web
development first of all and then it's
going to be Android and a lot of things
are going to come out okay so that was
the quick update and let's see let's
pick up
some good questions I actually saw a
very good question so I'm gonna scroll a
little bit up to find that if I can I I
cannot find that but let me answer the
question the first question was the
worth of certifications between je the
rhce the red hat one versus the
ec-council now honestly being on to
youtube and on to a lie platform i
cannot say that this platform is good
this is worst and you should not be
doing this you should be doing this
because because my channel is being
watched by a lot of people and if I will
just say bad words about a company it
can harm their PR quite a lot I don't
want to do that but if you'll ask
personally I if you have to choose any
one of that I would definitely go for
the Red Hat certification because Linux
knowledge gives you a quite quite a lot
of things and of course the
certification pattern is quite amazing
and awesome of course make sure you
don't cheat your instructor don't cheat
because this is a kind of condition in
India right now where a lot of
institution cheats they give you the
questions already in advance the
practice you all of that if you are
doing that then it's it's not worth the
certification but if you are doing that
certification completely honestly I
would say this is one of the finest
certification I have ever given yes I
did a lot of the Red Hat certification I
enjoyed a lot of Linux during that
period of time in fact for two months I
worked as a system administrator for a
red hat organization it was quite fun so
yes I would say if I had to pick up any
one of them I would definitely go for
the Red Hat okay so let's pick up more
questions which are good your channel
will reach 100k this month I don't think
so it's going to reach 100k that quickly
but yes I'm pretty thrilled by the
support which you have given to this
channel like amazing amazing it's all
fantastic and this makes me working more
and more awesome things are going to
come up on the channel because as soon
as I roll up the Android and iOS app I'm
almost free to record more videos for
YouTube but the topmost priority is to
give more features to the students so in
the app I can actually
in the discussion section a lot I can
answer your questions a lot so that is
where the app is coming up when the
Advanced Course in Cortland will come up
before the advance let me give you some
insight I don't want to give you that
but let's just say before the Kotlin
course an amazing bootcamp on Java is
coming up yes finally it's Java it's not
gonna be just Java basic code or
advanced it's gonna be very very
thorough than that and I have included a
lot of university things in it so it's
gonna come up cannot give you more
insight than that but yes Java is coming
up next
eh when are you coming to Bangalore I
think I'll be coming to Jeb angular
around 20 or 25 ish of the September
because I guess I believe the launching
event of that product is on 27 I think
at Google Chicago may be but I'm not
pretty sure but yes it's gonna come up
tips for front-end developer finished
learning HTML and CSS what should I do
next I live in the United States I would
say if you are already good in HTML and
CSS the next step should be JavaScript
yes there is a bootstrap on the way as
well but you should start with the
JavaScript then next obviously you can
check out my courses that learn code
online dot in or you can take those
courses in the app as well now but yes
wherever you are learning it doesn't
really matter all I say is start with
the JavaScript it's a very essential
skill with the JavaScript you'll be
quickly and easily master bootstrap and
obviously if you don't want to jump into
the JavaScript right now you can also
start with a bootstrap as well I do have
a free course on bootstrap we will be
making equal projects in that I highly
recommend to check out that so these are
the two tips that I can give to you okay
so Rahul says I am iOS developer and I
want to move on note and angularjs which
basic step I have to take for learn this
I think it's gonna be pretty easy for
you because you already know Swift I
believe so you are an iOS developer I
think so you're already aware with the
concepts like firebase move
with the APS and everything I think you
should start with JavaScript also learn
es6 version of javascript it's gonna be
pretty easy for you for moving into node
and everything is at that angular it's
gonna be pretty easy okay say website
name I think you're asking for my
website name it's learn code online dot
in okay how to connect web app to cloud
infrastructure
I usually it's done by the api's it's
pretty easy with that way but sometimes
you have to download some packages and
all of that I think you are asking for
firebase cloud infrastructure if that is
the case they have a pretty nice
documentation for the Android it just a
click click things in the studio they
are giving full support for the iOS it's
pod pod install something pod install
firebase and all of that for JavaScript
it's pretty damn easy Android
competition well after the web
competition the Android competition will
come up it's gonna be basically I will
be providing you some ApS the
custom-designed API is and some links
and you have to design the best possible
app with that and I'll be posting that
app through my channel and everything
it's gonna be in your resumes so it's
good it's gonna be pretty fantastic it's
gonna come up soon
Shabnam says remember me yes I remember
every single one hey sir thanks for
resolving my payment problem payment
problems are on to the topmost priority
but Nimisha
I want to just want to update you that
very soon we are making some big steps
to resolve these kinds of problems in
the future but nobody's your payment is
always safe okay so PHP or Python which
one will you recommend I think if you
don't know any one of the back-end
technologies I would say all and keeping
in mind that you are into web
development quite a lot I would say
start with PHP because PHP helps you to
design webs pretty quick and pretty fast
not with connecting with the back-end
technologies but also in when you
actually break down your HTML template
to the PHP one it's far more easier to
maintain that and you might have noticed
that I have debts the same thing
recently at learned code online website
previously it was just one page HTML
website then I made a kind of a big
gigantic template kind of thing and
broken down it into PHP so it's far more
easier I can just update it at one place
and all the menus everywhere and it's
going to be updated so PHP is the thing
I should I think you should go for okay
can I use sketch tool to design UI for
app development absolutely all the
things that you see at learn code online
app are being designed in sketch totally
in sketch I don't use anything else I
think it's fantastic but the only
downside it it's only available for the
Mac otherwise it could have been the
killer tool for all the UI design and
graphic design I think I have already
talked to those sketch guys and I have
asked them hey why are you not rolling
out the Windows version your your
product is awesome absolutely cool
every single design I just love it so we
are having a talk if there is some kind
of plan with those guys I'll definitely
update you I'm in regular touch with
those guys okay
so sign up with Google is not working
yes yes yes I'm there of it you ever get
to resolve that issue recently Google
actually made a couple of changes in
their API as and how they are working so
yes it caused a little bit of the bumpy
roads but programming is all about
errors until unless you are having big
errors that means you are not going into
good directions I'm not making any
excuses it will be resolved very soon
okay have lunch ah not yet I just got up
you can see my eyes are still sweating
up got late little night in the night it
was almost 2:00 or 3:00 and got up late
so you know hey why I'm not hitting that
like button I can see subscriber count'
going up but the light count is still
there so hey please hit that like button
we need it okay as neither Google or
Apple health this is an interesting
question by santosh kumar gupta hey as
neither
sorry as neither Google or Apple have
formally said anything about the use of
react native is it safe to use it for
app based startup es is absolutely fine
and it's absolutely safe although yes I
can understand that they haven't said
anything officially about it but you
will be realized just visit the react
native web site since it's backed up by
open source that's fantastic all the
source code is available at github
that's the number one good thing about
react native and the second thing is it
backed up by Facebook so Facebook has
moved quite a lot deep into the react
native and they cannot back up and back
it up right now because they are they
have implemented quite a tons of
resources and their app has got tons of
updates with the react native so
definitely I would say it's completely
safe to move in to react native no
problem at all in fact I have also moved
a lot of my clients into react native
and I don't think so it's going to be
any bad in the next 10 or 20 years or so
but hey technology changes quite a lot
ok Shubham nirvani says what's the scope
of dotnet for next 10 years I haven't
cared about the dotnet in the past and
here says well not a big fan of dotnet
I'm kind of a PHP guy I like to prefer
to go into more open source kind of
things not a big fan of dotnet don't
know what the reason is I'm not a big
fan don't even try that I learned that
for just about one and a half month
didn't absolutely liked it but it
doesn't means that it's a bad technology
it's good absolutely fine I just don't
like it
ok else you app work amazing sir thank
you so much pretty really that that was
a pretty hard work being done at the app
I'll try to make sure that you meet up
other persons who have helped me a lot
of people are also helping me to debug a
lot of things here by suggesting and
implementing the codes and everything so
definitely thank you so much thanks for
your effort every video is useful thank
you so much and we haven't seen the tip
of the iceberg yet tons of videos are
going to come up as soon as I release
the ios app and that's gonna come up
very very soon okay can I become data
scientists with only self studies I
think yes but that's a very doubtfully
yes because data science is something
which requires a lot of proper guidance
I'm not saying you have to go to some
Institute or something you can read out
books or take online courses but to
bring out all those data sets test data
sets is not such an easy thing so yes
definitely
ok sir I say sir I have purchased your
front-end developer course should I also
go for reacts yes what will be the
carrier path after it for which job
profile should I I can apply even after
just completing the front end of the pen
you can apply for a front-end developer
junior front-end developer you are
pretty good for that but I would
recommend that after you have completed
my 14 projects design at least 3 or 4 on
your own because I have helped you in
those 14 projects but I would highly
recommend to design at least 4 or 5
projects on your own and after that you
are completely ready to apply for
front-end design or front-end developer
job after taking the react.js I would
recommend you to react GS and PHP take
those course also because after that you
can actually apply for a full stack
developer and that would be much more
and far more easier for you once a
person has a knowledge of react and PHP
he can switch up anywhere pretty much
like in the node in other angular he can
just switch on pretty easily how to
learn Python please tell me I'm
interested ah there are a lot of ways to
learn Python you can look out for the
free tutorials on YouTube hang around
there or you can download the learn code
online dot in app there is a course
there and that's it that's it all the
things are covered okay will you make
any video tutorials for new freelancer
and what can I learn after front-end
development should I start in backend or
Android after front-end it's totally on
your choice you want to stay in lab or
want to move in Android because I think
even if you are moving in Android or iOS
or
front end is the essential thing and
after that is totally on you you want to
stay in web domain go for the back end
things like react or PHP or maybe
angular if you want to move into Android
go ahead and move on into the Android
course height H back again with another
Sunday live how are you sir I'm good a
little bit tired but yes fully
enthusiastic to talk to you guys how to
make native Android app there are a lot
of ways to make native Android web apps
like with Java with Kotlin with react
native with ionic a lot of other things
out there
depends what are your interest where you
want to go I want to join your team
right now you can see it just me I can
assure you round see it's just me don't
have anybody to offer help but yes from
time to time I take help from students
from the courses and some time to hire
freelancers to help me assist quickly do
some kind of like writing job and
something like that if there will be
opportunity I'll surely will ask you
okay let's pick up more questions some
repetitive questions are you the
employee of Google company no I'm not an
employee of Google company but I'm in
touch with those guys I do sign a lot of
NTAs with them so that I can test their
products can enjoy their products like
that so I have links pretty good links
in Google in Facebook and Amazon good
companies I have friends there what is
the future of Java I don't see any doubt
in the future of Java just like PHP is
gonna stay around for a long time Java
is gonna stay around for a long time ok
ok I have created a GST calculator oh my
goodness GST is such a such an easy
thing to implement in the business I at
first I thought it's a pain in the butt
but after that I realized that it's so
much easy but yes congratulation that
you have worked on GST calculator how
can I improve further just look out for
the bank's what people are saying to you
hey buddy good morning good morning
sugar okay there is Emmett for HTML and
CSS is there anything for C nice
question there unfortunately you just
have an IDE for C and C++ like Eclipse
or code blocks unfortunately there is
nothing thing like that for the C but
yes code editors like IDE Square helps
quite a lot okay if I skip C++ will I
able to learn Java you don't even need
to learn C to learn Java Java in itself
is a separate language you don't need to
learn C or C plus for anything like that
for learning Java just directly go into
Java and learn that Android course any
info about release date I think you
haven't checked it out Shivan but
Android course is already out with more
than 10 apps and it's constantly being
updated with more fun stuff so go ahead
check out it learn code online it's
already there okay let's play Holi that
was fun
my question is why Facebook having limit
after 5,000 friends now what should I do
in any amount payable about 5,000 if I
would have any solution for more than
5,000 friends I definitely would have
implemented already because I crossed my
5,000 friends like two years ago and
after that I didn't check it out and
then I didn't also made my Facebook page
so it people can join up me there
recently I have created my page so that
people can at least join me up there but
yes there is no such option right now
with a Facebook it's 5,000 and that's it
the Facebook policy says if you have
more than 5,000 friends you should not
have a friendless you should have a page
I think that's bizarre little bit to me
but yes that's the way it goes
app is great UI is awesome thank you so
much Prasad love you for that comment
okay
survive there is no girl here I have no
idea absolutely but yes definitely many
of them are watching already we cannot
be sure that there are no girls here but
it depends on the interest
what they want - I don't bias on these
kind of things okay what is your
educational qualification good enough to
learn programming I think I would say
good enough you can watch my video
resume I do have a lot of degrees under
my belt that includes my BTech where it
was in electronics my Master's enrolled
in doctorate as well but I don't care
much about it but yes I do have pretty
good qualifications I think so
is macbook air 2017 is best for
programming I think MacBook Pro is best
for programming it's fast it's fast but
again if you're tight on the budget it's
also good enough you're amazing thank
you so much
Imran love you for that comment a scope
of Linux certified engineer it's pretty
good pretty good I would say it's a good
scope good line you can go out there no
problem at all have you ever visited
woody saw no I haven't got any chance to
visit Orissa I really would like to
visit that ratha-yatra there I would
absolutely love love to film that thing
make a video about it I would absolutely
love but I haven't got any chance or
invite from there from any university or
company they're sad it's sad how can I
make a chatting app like whatsapp by
using firebase that's an interesting
thing that we make I think I can make a
video on that probably in the next video
I'll walk you through how we can make a
chat app in Android or maybe an iOS
using firebase I think I can walk you
through that it's gonna be pretty fun it
seems just like you woke up yes
I can't book I've just took a shower and
just sat down because I have a lot of
things to do today so that is why okay
like like like yes do it des like that's
awesome okay so how can I learn
Photoshop from zero to hero any book or
tool I think you can find a lot of good
courses on udemy about Photoshop I
learned a lot Photoshop from those
courses as well as I learned a lot of
photography and video making skills from
those people I would also like recommend
to check out peter mckennon's channel
it's on youtube is an amazing fantastic
guy pretty big pretty huge
but it's awesome you can learn some
photoshop skills from him as well
what technology will be great in future
I think react native will give or things
like I only guess where the angular
ionic and react native will give you in
the future technology just like you make
website in WordPress right now you'll be
able to design web apps using these
kinds of tech in the future I think this
is my prediction for the future that's
going to come up the app industry will
be shaped like that in the future but
let's see how it goes
okay technology has evolved quite a lot
in front of me I have seen the very
first mobile phone from the OCS or ACS I
don't know what the brand name was but
I've seen quite a lot evolving from the
first landline phone to the computers
the strike that I have seen in front of
me when people were opposing computer
and I people love computers and
evolvement of desktop laptop I have seen
a lot have seen love makes me feel a
little bit old but yes I have felt a lot
okay so wow Java bootcamp yes it's
coming up it's coming up usually I don't
give you any insights inside updates
what's coming up but yes
what about Chennai please come to
Chennai - I have visited Chennai already
I'll try it to make sure it's gonna come
up in the future I will visit that are
you an iOS or Android or Blackberry or
Windows user which OS do you prefer I
prefer Mac call me biased towards the
Mac or come anything there but yes I am
little bit biased towards the Mac it's
much more reliable good update good
tools what can I say also no constant
updates like Windows I do have a Windows
laptop as well I don't use it much today
is my birthday hey happy birthday Frank
Richardson you have got an absolutely
nice name a fan of you Frank Richardson
looks very fantastic looks cool if I
would have a name like Frank Richardson
I would have enjoyed it you have a good
name hi there in which city do you live
I live in a couple of cities I most of
the time my hometown is in jail
I'd like to stay here most of the time
but yes it's gonna come hi - back again
him in another video how are you sir
learned code online 2.0 is awesome yes
LAN code online version 2.0 is almost
there not yet completely there but yes
facebook login using firebase is pretty
easy I will try to make a video on it
entity coffee with here today not today
I have a friend he is having a birthday

any plans for Delhi meetha meetha I
don't have any that fan base yet - host
of a kind of a meetup thing but yes if
you'll ask I can have a coffee with you

from Delhi international flights are
mostly from Delhi not from the chair /
yes and sad thing so definitely I hang
around in the Delhi quite a lot so
definitely next time I'll be in Delhi
I'll ping you okay we should do video
collaboration so that I can build my
YouTube channel name with Zee Ally yes
we can surely do a lot of collaboration
I have I got a lot of requests to do
YouTube collab but the thing is I'm not
rude but I don't have much time I hope
you can expect by managing clients by
managing learn code online website their
apps videos processing editing because
you can notice my videos are not just
being recorded and being thrown they are
edited quite nicely color correction and
everything and on top the top of that
family friends it's a busy thing I'm not
being rude but the time is very very
constrained to me and I have to maintain
everything and on top of that two hours
of exercise every single day half hour
and 45 minutes of gym and then on top of
that swimming it's kind of a very hectic
thing to me okay let's answer more
questions I have joined your irs boot
camp is course bro it's awesome thanks a
lot thank you so much and on you will
see a lot of updates and that is course
