with another video now this video is
going to be a little bit shorter than
the rest of the videos because I want to
address a very interesting and very
important question related to
programming getting started guide so in
the last four days or so I received
almost eight to ten emails asking almost
the same question and this is kind of a
myth going on in all over the globe
specially in the part of India this is a
myth which I really want to eradicate at
all so recently I got an email that I
want to get started with Java and
Android development but I am NOT good in
Si can I continue another one of the
email say that I want to get started
with the JavaScript and I am totally
interested in web development but I
don't know how to program in C can I get
started now are these statements any
meaningful how much truth is behind the
statement that if you want to get
started with any programming language
the first thing that you need to do is
to learn C how much is the concept going
on all of this coming up in this video
stay tuned
when I received the email that says I
want to get started for building Android
apps and I want to learn Java I really
feel happy for those students because
they are very clear in the mind that
what they want to do and this is
absolutely amazing because if you want
to get started with Android and you want
to go with the Java that's really great
path and you already know what you want
to do of course that can be evolved a
lot with other professional great things
like designing the best practices and a
lot of things but still you are on a
great path and I love this I love these
kinds of email similarly for iOS
development you already know nowadays
that you want to get started with the
Swift and you want to learn iOS
development with that so these are great
emails but the problem is with a lot of
student asked me that I am NOT good in C
so do you really think that to get
started with any language you need to
learn the C first now don't get me wrong
I don't have any personal regrets or
personal enemy kind of thing with the
same but it's a complete wrong notion
and this is a myth which has been coming
from over a decade now and I would think
that somehow not updating the curriculum
by the universities is one of the main
reason of this kind of a myth now a lot
of university especially in the India
goes with the curriculum like in the
first semester he need to goes and get
started with the C in the second
semester you will get started with the
C++ and then comes the Java and then any
other language now this is a complete
myth now in order to get started with
any language you can directly get
started with any language yes that's the
truth the problem that you're going to
face in solving particular problem in
Java that's going to be the same problem
that you will be facing in the C C++
Java scripts with PHP anything pretty
much anything and yes this is completely
true that a C actually holds a lot of
domain there and a lot of language here
the syntax from the C but that doesn't
means you have to get started with a see
all the time this is completely wrong
notion if you look at the universities
like specially the Hong Kong University
and Harvard's and all those big guys big
names shiny names all of these are
changing their curriculum they are now
getting started with Python and
especially the south universities in the
south and part of the India now getting
started with the Python some getting
started with JavaScript some even
getting started with the swim that's a
complete good thing and to be honest I
would like to say that don't get stuck
with the thing that to learn any
programming language you have to get
started with the C yes you if you learn
C you will definitely get help in other
languages because C shares a lot of
syntax there but to be honest if you
learn Python you will get help in a lot
of languages like Ruby if you learn PHP
the the knowledge of the PHP is surely
going to help you in learning the Swift
as well so it's completely a wrong
notion I don't know from where did it
got started but all the language that
you learn also supports you to learn
other languages as well yes it's a good
getting started point of the C but to be
honest if you'll ask me if somebody says
hey I want to get started in web
development I am interested in WordPress
or something I would say hey don't spend
your time in C I would say spend your
time in learning PHP JavaScript that's
going to help you and directly get
started with that so if you are
interested in let's just say game
development why are you wasting your
time in learning the C instead learn
unity unity 3d is going to be the best
if you want to get started with the game
development so do a lot of research and
again I personally know a lot of
programmers who have even in the cause
of duty structure and a Call of Duty
mobile games and they don't know how to
code in the sea of course they know the
syntax but they haven't done any good
project or big scale project in that and
they're pretty massive and kind of a
superstar in the game development out
there so pretty much to be honest I hope
you got my point that to get started
with any language just directly get
started with that language stay there
and spend the time and one more thing
that I would like to say that I have
seen in the past people that who want to
get started with the Android but now
they want to learn programming so they
are getting started with C C++ and then
they are jumping into Java to be honest
almost 80 to 85% of those people who get
started with these kinds of line
drop the programming in between because
this is a long journey and in that
journey you don't get any product so
that you can feel proud on it
like you don't get even a hello world
app on your mobile with the C so if the
product is not going to be in your hand
and you are interested in app
development that's going to be a
complete waste of time and chances are
high you are going to drop programming
in between so my advice would be don't
get stuck with any language and choose
your choose your programming language
very wisely if I want to design iOS app
and I am learning Java to design so that
that would be completely wrong you
already know that and I'm really happy
that students are getting so much
advanced and so much smart that they
know the programming language what they
want to learn to design something
specific so that's the good news that
people and community are going to the
right direction okay I have rented quite
a lot of power to see I don't have any
personal grudge with the sea in fact
it's a great programming language for
the research purpose for the hardware
level for exploit writing and a lot of
such things but again there is always
always an implementation for a
particular language and you should
always take care of that with this I'll
catch you up in the next movie till the
mean time I expect that if you like this
video make sure that you click the like
button in case you don't liked it
no hard feelings I'll try even better
next time and if you think that somebody
can get benefit from this movie make
sure that you share it catch you up in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
