WordPress series in this video we're
gonna learn how the WordPress file
structure is there and in case we need
to edit them how we can do that just to
remind you that this series is not about
editing the existing WordPress or
creating your own themes or widget maybe
we can take them and talk about them
later on right now this series is all
about how to set up your WordPress using
the themes plug-in and to understand
everything about it so in this process
the first thing is to understand the
file structure so that you can be aware
of where things are lying and how they
are lying and moving on to that first of
all just click on this dashboard and you
will be thrown onto your dashboard and
for some of you the screen might not be
looking exactly same because you might
have just dismissed this guy and maybe
somebody else so go ahead click on the
screen options and there you go
all the black boxes that you see here
should be checked out because we want to
explode each and everything about who
WordPress so make sure the screen
options are there now also the quick
draft and everything are completely
moveable so you can move them wherever
you like so you can arrange them
according to what you like that's the
point number one the second point is the
updates you'll be seeing quite a lot of
updates throughout the series as well as
when you'll be installing the WordPress
and everything and make sure you do the
update or as soon as you see them now in
case you are just working out just like
me on a local host the updation is
little bit different on to a real site I
will show you later on that how the
updates actually work on a real website
right now we are not gonna be doing an
update because if you'll try to do an
update here just now and if I click on
update plug-in you'll be asked to put up
your ftp password and something like
that now these are things which are not
being done onto a real website these
things don't appear anytime since this
is a local host installation that is why
you're seeing a hostname ftp username
and password and we haven't said that
anything like that so right now we are
not gonna be doing an update just like
that but for sure I'll show you a later
on how you can do these up to updates
onto a real website and all of that ok
so this is all the thing that we have
now it's important that we understand
the file structure of the entire
WordPress website so we're gonna hit on
Explorer make sure you are into the
volumes and then open this HT
and lco so we're gonna open up this
entire lco folder in our Adam and we
will be understanding all these things
so let's just fire up our Adam so we're
gonna go ahead and launch our Adam there
we go and it's gonna take not much time
just a little bit seconds there I can
minimize that
in the meantime okay so there we go over
Adam is almost ready and we're gonna
open this guy lco let's just go back and
we're gonna just open this folder here
there we go lots of files lots and lots
of files are here now as soon as you can
quickly open this up you'll see that
there are a lot of dot and underscore
files which are not easily seen at your
file system also you'll notice that
there are a lot of lot of things here
and a couple of them are here but there
are just three folders here interesting
there the blue P admin which handles all
your database back-end system there is a
WP content which consists of plugin
themes and a little bit things here and
there and also there is developer
includes we will talk about that later
on how the includes and everything works
up okay so we can see things are going
on and there are a few things that you
don't require just like for example
there is a licensed or txt you don't
need to keep that you can delete that
feel free to even do that there is also
a readme dot HTML which tells about a
lot of things like WordPress install
what is the server version and not the
server version but WordPress version and
things like that so you might want to
delete that as well
there is no such thing that you should
be keeping up like that index and
license and all these things but be sure
that whatever the things you are
deleting this may break up your website
or may not but force your license dot
txt and read me HTML will not break your
website feel free to even delete them
okay now there is one more couple of
more interesting file that I would like
to focus here and the first one is let
me just find that up
this is wp-config.php this is a very
important file and make sure you don't
edit it too much we have already edited
that in the very first video of the
installation part
now here if we'll go a little bit back
we have already added our salt keys but
it will go a little bit deep back here
you will notice the table prefix is WP
underscore now you can change that at
the time of installing and then you will
notice that if you go to the application
let me just find that up applications I
need to bring that up back and if I go
to my applications go to my PHP myadmin
you will notice that all the database
tables of this LC Opress are actually
getting started with WP underscore if
you don't like that you want to change
that this is the place where you should
be looking up and changing that up okay
so this is the important file
configuration file you don't change that
much but yes this is one of the
important part here okay now let me also
show you a way to edit the files in case
you are aware with the HT in case you
are aware of H PHP and things like that
so go back to your wordpress and
wordpress is actually divided into three
categories the first one is home and
updates this is the category one the
second is the CMS category which is post
media pages and comments so all these
four guys are considered as one category
the CMS content management system this
is the Col part and the rest of the
final five things these appearance
plug-in users tools and settings are all
your back-end settings so that how you
can make your website beautiful you can
install more functionality can add more
users and things like that now go to
your appearance and once you are into
the appearance make sure that the menu
is being thrown to you and inside the
menu first of all we are gonna go and
click on this editor now as soon as I
click on editor you will see that all
the code is being available to you now
this code is not a small code this is a
big code and for example you want to
edit the footer you can just click on
this theme footer and can edit these
theme footer in case you are aware of
the PHP but in case you are not no need
of that you can still make a really
beautiful website okay now you know you
know in order to understand more about
what are the themes and everything first
of all let's go ahead and click on the
themes and you will notice there are
three themes which are by default
installed on your system the 2017 2015
and 2016
let's see in the folder structure where
these themes are so I'm gonna go into WP
content inside the themes and we can see
that the 2015 is there 2016 and 2017 so
these three themes are folders so these
are just full-fledged websites that are
available to us and there are hundreds
of others as well which we can explore
so for example if we want to search
install themes or maybe you want to add
a new theme you can just click on this
and you can search for a tons of
websites which are already available for
you of course not every website just
serve exactly what you like but these
are all customizable editable and
usually just serve the job so we will be
exploring that quite a lot but now it's
a time to explore one more section which
is usually not being discussed much in
the WordPress courses and things which
is the Codex of WordPress so how does
anybody learn to create these themes and
all these things so we're gonna click on
this codex in case you want to go there
you can directly go there with codex
wordpress.com and it's a wordpress.org
and it's available in the documentation
as well support and then documentation
here are all the documentation which are
available for example you want to work
with the themes you can just develop
learn to develop themes child themes
blog design layout writing a plug-in and
all that and just like always this is
also a kind of a documentation which is
not so easy to understand but for sure
I'll try to make sure that we do some
things with that now with that let's
just go back here and try to understand
the theme development process not much
in detail but yes we will be learning
just a hint of that so we can see that
we have three basic themes because we
have got three folders there now what do
you have what we'll be doing here is a
little bit awesome so go to into WP
content first of all and then onto this
themes make sure you expand that and
inside the themes we are gonna create a
new folder and we are gonna create two
new files inside that so right click
onto the theme and click on new folder
and we're gonna call this as this folder
as let's just call this as learn code
just like that
and hit enter there we go now we have a
new folder learn code there is nothing
inside it now we're gonna right click on
this folder and we're gonna click on new
file ok and this file is gonna be let's
just call this as AZ style dot CSS we
are not gonna write a single line into
it but still we have a style dot CSS
just follow me long it's gonna be fun
right click on this learn code online
learn chord again and click on new file
and this time the file is gonna be
called as index dot PHP and hit enter
okay we haven't written a single line of
code and we have just created two blank
files style dot CSS and index dot PHP
now go back on to your browser and hit
reload their themes dot PHP and
magically you're gonna see that we have
a learned code online theme yes of
course this theme doesn't have a preview
this theme doesn't work but just with
creating two simple file we are able to
create a new section in our theme which
can be activated so notice all the
functionality we didn't put any
functionality like theme detail activate
live preview we haven't done any kind of
coding for that and still WordPress is
serving that all these things for us
this is all because of the pre-built
codecs that is being that comes up as a
wordpress so right now I don't want to
do these kinds of things but still I'm
gonna keep it just like that and just to
remind you that it's not a big deal to
create themes and all these things we
can surely do that but right now let's
just go back here so they just go back
and we're gonna go into themes again and
click on this add new and just look on
to various themes don't install any of
them we I'm gonna show you which one to
install and all of that just click on
this and click on the preview so that
you can have a little bit preview idea
of how the theme looks like and how you
if we are gonna install and add some
plugins and all these things how this is
gonna look like right now I'm gonna
close this guy and the previews are
available for almost any one of them
it's taking a little bit while to load
the previews ok there we go this is how
it looks like and all these things so
just go ahead and have a look don't
install any of them and the later on
videos we are gonna learn how we can
install a theme which one we are
gonna be looking up how we are going to
editing and all these things so have a
look enjoy and we're gonna be closing up
this video just right here we are gonna
explore a lot of things in the future
that's it for this video and I will
surely catch you up in an extra</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
