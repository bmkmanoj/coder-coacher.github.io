got a new member in the language family
the programming language family and his
name is Katalin his or her whatever his
name is Kotlin and finally Kotlin is in
here now in case you missed out the news
recently Google IO News Google has
finally announced that for the Android
official first-class support will be
given to the Catalan and you can almost
say that Kotlin is officially in for
Android development and Java is almost
almost pushing out pushing out on the
frame so this is the current news but
you're not here just to listen that hey
this is all no we have to discuss quite
a lot of things and this is the most
perfect time to get started in Android
how is that now all of this is coming up
in this video so roll that intro but
don't forget the drum roll for Copland
so in case you have been following the
news Carlin is finally in
so Kotlin is the new official
programming language to design and
develop apps for the Android now first
of all let's talk a little bit about a
Java versus Kotlin and discuss what are
the benefits and disadvantages of
everything in here now first of all in
case you have been falling in around on
my YouTube channel or my facebook page
or me and personally I am NOT a big fan
of Java and a lot of people have been
asking me this around 5 why don't you
like Java why don't you make much more
tutorials on Java it's so much popular
language to be honest personally I don't
like Java and one of the main reason I
don't like Java is its clumsy syntax
even to just write a minimum amount of
code you have to declare classes and
it's very much of the code that I
usually hate now obviously some people
like that but I don't like it now some
people will jump up and say hey most of
that code is being produced
automatically by the editors like
eclipse or IntelliJ whatever you are
using
but hey why that much of the code that
much of the code should be running
behind the curtains not in front of me
that is something needs to be handled by
compiler transpiler whatever that is so
I'm not a big fan of it
so finally Google has also said that hey
hit HB agree with you and we are
officially pushing the Java out out of
the frame there we go and bringing in
the Kotlin so yes that is in now the
good part about the Kotlin is it will be
directly shipping in with the Android
studio version 3 so you don't need to
have to install anything else just bring
in Android studio 3 and you will get a
firsthand first-class support for the
Kotlin and the future is obviously very
clear in the future all the apps are
expected to be designed and developed in
the Kotlin and very soon the market will
get stricter and stricter and will push
out all the apps from the Java now on
the i/o you can obviously see that there
were some reasonable comments being made
like a the Java is missing a lot of
features like stream and the lambda
functions oh my god in this in this
beautiful God's green world how can
anybody live without the lambda
functions Python has got lambda function
Swift has got lambda function and a Java
has got the callback some kind of a
lambda function but they are callback
functions serving the same purpose and
eventually with the time we have seen
that the lambdas are the most beautiful
advantages thing that any programming
language can give sidebar I'm aware of
the retro lambdas but they are not
exactly the same they give us a lot more
things that what we require so that is
pure texting in here but again yes there
are a lot of things in here which I
don't like with the Java and for modern
app development actually Android needed
a lot more things and especially about
the null ability in the Java which is a
pain in them and obviously there are a
lot of feature which gives memory leaks
and a lot of things in the Java which
need to be replaced some day today's the
day that it has the Catalan has been
introduced in here now just onto a
sidebar in here I would like to mention
that I actually see that a lot before
then what people are seeing right
now about three or four years back I
don't remember exactly the date and time
but I read in the tech blogs that Java
has actually filled up filed up a
lawsuit against Android that they
haven't used Android or Java and
compatibility whatever that was but what
they were asking was a share in the
Android Market and some money and all
those things because they have used Java
and the Google's point was that Java is
an open source but they say this
development doesn't comes under the open
source license that we have given I know
this is completely a bold reason but
again this is being common with the
Oracle and the Java and obviously you
don't know this a lot of you don't know
this but a lot of instructor who are a
good friend of mine like John from cave
of programming comm and a lot of other
people who are pretty good in Java has
has discussed this in the past as well
that whenever they put the Java logo in
there courses they always get a
complaint from Oracle that hey you
cannot use the logo so see this this
company is actually doing really bad for
themselves because if somebody is
teaching Java he must he should be using
the logo of their but again I'm not a
big guy to say that we shouldn't be
using logo I should be using logo apart
from all of these that lawsuit I
personally think that lawsuit is one of
the main reasons why Android is shifting
away from the Java and moving into the
Catalan and obviously this time they
might have already sorted out the
legalities and everything's in there now
this is all the normal stuff that
everybody wanted to know about what the
Catalan is will it be shipping directly
with the understood e3 or not now one
more thing I would like to tell all of
the people in here now I told this this
before as well but that that was in the
bootcamp not on the live video when the
shift actually came out I advised all of
my fans friends and followers that this
is the most perfect time to get started
in iOS development why because at that
time when the suit was launched nobody
was having an experience with the Swift
everybody was learning it obviously
previous programming experience helps
but everybody right now
cannot ask people hey you should have
five years of experience census because
nobody has it and that was the most
perfect time to get started in the iOS
development now same thing has happened
in the Android world as well now I can
understand your pain that when you try
to start learning Android version API 20
maybe marshmallow or anything and you
said hey I'm gonna learn it and at that
exact same moment you might be saying oh
crap a new version out there
should I be learning this one or that
one where should I start although they
are almost same but it's it's a it's a
pain and it's a fear that always in us
now this is the most perfect time for
every Android lover if you want to get
started with Android development this is
the most perfect time because Kotlin in
here and Kotlin is actually not a fairly
new language but still for Android
development it's absolutely fresh
absolutely new so if you if you want to
get started with the Android development
today today is the most perfect time to
get started in here this is one of the
lifetime opportunity you will never get
so take my words my dear friends and get
started with Android in case you are
interested with that and apart from this
discussion let's summarize the thing
first of all and I'll tell you update
about one more thing in here that
Cortland is finally in here Android is
now getting on to the Cortland and Java
is being pushed out of the frame Android
studio version 3 will ship in directly
with the Kotlin you will be able to code
out the things directly out of the box
Android actually expects you to write
future apps in the cutlet and not in the
Java and I'll come up to the more think
like how the variables and functions and
everything is being declared and
everything a lot of fun stuff is about
to come on the Cortland as well but I
also want you to write your comments in
the comment down below so that we can
have a little bit discussion of did you
like the Cartland did you like this move
or not are you a big fan of Java who is
little bit hurt in there and all sorts
of stuff okay so coming back in here now
just onto a sidebar update if you have
been falling in around I'm trying to
bring in all of my boot
and courses and all such high quality
videos to every Indian users possible in
there and I'm really really happy to
announce that we are on a very very
bright track and I think we will be able
to roll out everything very very soon
so just keep subscribing the channel
I'll announce everything on the YouTube
and maybe maybe in the next week
upcoming week we'll be able to roll out
everything and you will be really really
happy to see such awesome quality
courses at such affordable rates okay so
that's the quick side but update brigade
drumrolls
happy peoples and personally very happy
with the cartilage let me know in the
comment section below what do you think
about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
