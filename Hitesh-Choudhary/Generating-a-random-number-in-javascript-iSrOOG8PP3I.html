code online dot n creating amazing
videos so that you can learn programming
in a fun and easy way it's easy to
understand let's move forward in this
amazing JavaScript series have you
subscribed to my channel okay regardless
of that now let's roll into the things
and we are going to learn a little bit
about generating a random number or
simply creating a function that can roll
up a dices so let's just say you want to
have a simple app or maybe a website but
you can click a button and it rolls the
dice probably for a Ludo game and you
get a number between one and six so how
you can do that now as what we have
learned so far you cannot do that and
obviously writing is simple if an else
condition for that would be a terrible
mistake so let's just learn how we can
do that so obviously we are talking
about numbers so previously we did talk
about quite a lot about the strings now
let's talk about the numbers
so there are a couple of problems in
numbers not much but a little bit so we
have to take care of them as well first
and foremost let's just have num1 and
this number one is gonna be equal to 22
I'm specifically choosing this number to
show you some stuff and the number two
is gonna be equal to seven and now I
want to simply have a result of 22 by
seven okay so if we're gonna just ctrl
and there we go and we are gonna run
this node diced rjs what is going to
happen we're gonna get a number which is
pretty long actually to be precise it's
three point one four two eight five
seven one which is actually pi and
that's why i chose it because it's a
really humongous big number now probably
in your application you don't want to do
that probably it's a price of something
and do some application error or
something you have just got a pretty big
number so you want to drill it down to
probably just two digits here and it can
be done shortly it can be done so let's
just move ahead and I'm gonna be storing
that result simply 22 by 7 so that I can
play around with it here and there what
you can do is you can have just like in
the strings we had some functions simply
the result has some options not many to
be honest but this result can have like
a fewer options here so what we can do
is we can simply say this result and we
can change it to and actually before I
go ahead and show you how we can do that
let me show you the documentation
because a lot of people were complaining
hey show us documentation in advance as
you wish so we're gonna say numbers GS
MD and of course honestly there are not
much of them like you can read them in
probably like 10 or 11 minutes all of
them so there we go and that's it I
haven't used much of the above ones
except the nan I use that quite often
apart from that these are the ones and
the one I was about to talk about is too
fixed and if you'll click on that it's
pretty easy you can just have a number
and you can simply apply to fixed and
can pass on a value into it so what was
going to do let me just show you that so
once you have a number which is pretty
big if I just run of course the results
save that there we go we have a pretty
big number
so what you can do is you can simply say
to fixed I don't know why it is not
suggesting me anything so what you can
do is you can use two fixed and you can
pass on a value of course the the number
on which you are using it it should be
at a floating point number remember the
things which when I say twenty two and
twenty two point zero are two different
things the one is the float one this is
the integer one so make sure you
understand that and then you can pass on
values probably two three how many
decimal points you really are expecting
here so there we go 3.14 the most known
value of the pie okay so there we go we
have learned but we noticed one thing
that we don't have much to do with the
number so with these with this resource
actually we cannot do the dice thing so
we need to go and learn a little bit
more about amount of libraries here so
let me just explore that so just like
the numbers in gs there is something
known as which is really powerful and
very popular is math so go ahead and
explore the math library here the math
is like a lot of things can happen you
can design your own scientific
calculator here
you have cosine sine tangent sine cost
and caught Cossack it's everything is
here what I want to say here how we can
use that let me show you and I'm gonna
show you with a simple example
now let's just figure out there is a
number in here which is 3.14 you want to
run round it up
so obviously the round up is gonna be 3
but we want to do it programmatically so
how that can happen is we're gonna
simply log and they're probably you know
I want to store that first of all into a
result so I'm gonna be just copying that
and deleting this and let load res 4
float result we're gonna be storing that
just like that and we're gonna be simply
logging it now
so we're float res and we're gonna be
using now how we use these things
actually is first of all you don't write
this you simply use the math library
here and it has a lot of methods being
defined and one of them is flow and
there's a good relation in a room here
let me just show you first of all what
the flow does and then you can pass on a
value which is float rest and save that
and now we can run that so there we go
we got a 3 so there are two options or
two methods here easy way to remember
the floor and the ceiling floor brings
down every floating value to the bottom
part like if even it is like 3.99 it's
gonna bring it down to 3 and if you have
a value if you use a function known as a
seal it's gonna bring it to the top no
matter if it is just 3.14 it is gonna
bring up to 4 so let me show you that we
can have a simple log and we're gonna
call math again and there is a method
seal and we're gonna have low CREZ save
that and this is gonna give you a 4 at
the bottom so I hope you make the point
that how these things are working ok but
still one thing is remaining which is
random can be a little bit tricky to
understand but don't worry I'll make it
easy so there we go we have is if you
look around there is a random here and
this is how it works it gives you random
so let explore
how these random function work and first
and foremost I would like to comment out
a few things because random can be a
little bit tricky to understand let me
just quickly run that yep we are getting
the output ok so let's bring up our
random stuff so first of all let's log
the random now what the random actually
does we can simply call this as simply
math dot random and there we go now math
gives you a number between 0 &amp;amp; 1 I know
math geeks will be saying hey it's
always a seed so it's not perfect random
wait a minute here we're not talking
about that so basically it gives you a
random number between 0 &amp;amp; 1
so how we're gonna proceed is let's just
run that so a couple of times so that we
can see yes we are getting a random
number every time but this is between 0
&amp;amp; 1 so quite a lot of decimal numbers so
let's just say I want a number which is
between 0 and some particular number so
what I can do is I can just quickly
multiply it by probably 10 and now let's
just see what we are getting so we are
getting 5 3 9 and 9 again but we're not
going above 9 so we're getting from 0
which is the base value to the 4 to the
to the 10 actually and technically it's
never gonna be 10 it's always gonna be
like nine point nine nine nine something
like that so if you want to make it like
something like 10 should be inclusive
probably you can add just one here so it
should be included and then drill it
down now a lot of people get confused
when I make an example of 10 I'll
probably other instructor make if you
want from any value you can just write
that number just as simple as that and
with the magic of mathematics you're
always gonna get a number which is
between 0 &amp;amp; 4 point 9 9 9 technically
okay so it's being proven as of now
these random values there we go so this
is being sold and what happens if I add
1 to it now save that and run that so
notice we are getting 3 for 1 I'm trying
to get a value which is 5 there we go so
we have now got the 5 okay so we add 1
now this is one here basic
writing six years so you get the point
now how we can use this knowledge to
build an application which is a dice
roller it can be really simple so I'm
gonna just comment that out first and
foremost we're gonna define our
boundaries so we're gonna say let lower
boundary which is gonna be probably like
six or probably I'm gonna start with a
bigger value first so that you can
understand it and then we'll be drilling
down to the lower one because that's
easier and basically what I wanted to
write here is this is gonna be upper and
then I do have a lower that is gonna be
probably 20 ok there we go these are two
values defined now let's use this math
dot random to generate any number I'm
gonna wrap this up into a simple
variable and I'm gonna call this as my
random and now comes up the fun part
first and foremost we're gonna be using
our power with math dot random so
obviously you know you get a number
between 0 and 1 but we want this number
to be specifically for a particular
range here okay so what we can do how
many numbers you want up here what we
can do is we can simply simply do
something like this put a pair of
parentheses and we can do something like
upper minus lower so what we are we are
generalizing the things imagine it is
just saying 25 minus 20 which is 5 so I
want just to generate these numbers
between that ok so 25 minus 20 gives you
5 ok but since we are multiplying it by
5 we are getting a number between
obviously a 0 and 5 this is not what we
want
and obviously the 5 is not included
remember from 0 to 4 point 9 and 9 so
first and foremost I need to add 1 to it
so that this 5 is inclusive so right now
we have generated a number from 0 to 5
but you might be asking what's the point
of having 25 and 20 if you are just in
rating between 0 and 5 we could have
simply write 5 now we are generalizing
the things you'll understand the power
in a minute ok so what I can do here is
right now it's getting me number but
in zero and four point nine nine nine
nine nine nine I want to just use my
floor magic here what I can do I can
wrap this up all of that in the pair of
parentheses and I can use my power which
is math dot floor you can use seal as
well but it depends on highly how many
cases you want to have inclusive upper
bound or exclusive upper bound and stuff
like that okay now our work is done
almost there's still some stuff
remaining but I want to show you some
stuff here first I want to lock this
value here which is my random there we
go let's just run this and see what is
happening so we get three that's fine we
get four we get five as well four to
five but we are not getting above five
so we are getting all the time between
one to five obviously we have added so
it's one so how we can convert that that
always gives a number between 2025
really simple you just add a lower bound
to it there we go
now what is going to do since we were
already getting a number between 1 and 5
and now 20 is being added so 20 plus 1
21 22 23 you got the point it it's
really simple I bumped the mic it's
really simple when you add a lower value
to it okay so that's the whole point of
generalizing the thing ok so there we go
now if we are gonna run this since we
have added a lower bound there they're
gonna turn that up let me clean the
screen and notice we are getting 2123
2421 since we have already restricted
everything to be just five numbers or
whatever the difference of upper bound
and lower bound is okay this is the
power of generalization you'll be doing
that quite a lot and this is quite fun
now all you have to do is once you
understand the concept you can just
replace it 6 and 1 and probably 6 and 0
or whatever you like and however you
have designed it in my case it's gonna
be just simply 1 save that and we're
gonna open the terminal clean that up
and it's rolled 5 one not even a single
time lucky I'm not getting a 6 here come
on give me a 6 there we go
finally 6
there we go so this is how the stuff
work and how you can generate a random
number in JavaScript and just to remind
you you will be using exact same concept
in variety of programming languages not
just in JavaScript but a lot of
languages concept is always gonna remain
same probably there they call it with
some other names maybe math libraries
changed a little bit but the concept is
gonna remain same so that's pretty much
it I hope you're enjoying this series
and specially this video it was a lot of
tough stuff and if you don't get it like
for the first time it's no big deal a
lot of people get confused in the
randoms for the first time rewatch the
videos practice it a little bit give it
some time it will come as the time will
progress so that's it for this video
visit learn code online dot in I have
amazing videos just like this one
probably a little bit better as well on
the website pull it off videos and hit
subscribe to my channel that's it for
this video I'm gonna catch you up in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
