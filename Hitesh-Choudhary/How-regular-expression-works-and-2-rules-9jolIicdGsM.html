regular expressions so we're continuing
forward with our regular expression
enough of the theories in our the basics
and now from this video onwards we will
be doing all practical stuff and you'll
be you'll be learning more insights
about regular expression so let's get
started and first of all just open up
your regex Ericom and make sure you have
just shrink all of these guys basically
we are interested in text and expression
so so first of all we're gonna just
select all of this and just delete that
just like that okay now what is the
basics here and also I'll be telling you
two rules that you have to keep in mind
throughout the regular expression course
as well as whenever you are designing a
regular expression okay a lot of people
think that finding a pattern is a tough
thing in regular expression and that's
not finding things is super easy D
selecting the thing is the hard one you
anybody can find a particular string
that matches but it also select the rest
of the other string as well which we
don't want to select and that is the
tough part okay so let me just walk you
through with a couple of basic ones so
first of all whatever we'll be writing
this is always gonna go into these two
forward slashes this is like the basic
it changes a little bit in Python syntax
but since we are not much bothered about
a language dependency it can be easily
transformed in that okay
throughout this course we'll be writing
all of our regular expression patterns
into these two forward slashes now after
these two forward slashes comes up a G G
stands for global which is by default
present in most of the programming
language and you can select your flags
and can checkmark more things as well
like you want to write a simple pattern
and it should be case insensitive you
can go into the mode of eye all of these
expression these flags are known as
modes but do take care of one thing that
by default in all programming language
PHP JavaScript Python Ruby this case
insensitive mode is not present you have
to either explicitly mention that or you
have to write your patterns in such a
manner that it selects both case upper
case and lower case somehow so we will
be learning about how we can rights of
such other patterns but in case you want
to check that you can do that
I will be unchecking it for now okay now
let me just walk you through how regular
expression works and how we can do that
so just delete that and let's just write
a simple key phrase here this is a mad
man mango man groove there we go
now what I want to do is I want to write
a simple pattern so that I can select
man and you will notice the very first
problem with regex and which is not
selecting the word which is it just
selects too much and let me just write
here I want to select a man so I'm gonna
write literal characters here which say
is man there we go problem number one
let me just zoom that a little bit so
what is happening here is I wrote man
because I wanted to select man I wrote
literal man the problem here is it
selects man but man is also a same
keyword there in mango and mangrove as
well so there comes the very first
problem I don't want to select them for
these we'll be learning more about
negations and all these things but let
me also walk you through how regular
expression works it is so easy and so
simple to understand it right now as
compared to later so first of all let's
just go directly at mad here because
this is the point where we are gonna
start the backtracking which is the most
important part in regular expression our
regular expression is man so it says hey
I'm looking for M so it just search go
through that and there we go
here it says you know what this is M I'm
gonna select that okay this looks like a
pattern then it says a and it won't sell
here that says okay two consecutive
match that means it can be my word then
it says then I'm looking for an N and it
says no there is a D so it doesn't match
it there a lot of people think that
since it doesn't really match it here it
will just move on ma n onto next word no
it doesn't happen like that if this is
not being selected then it will go on to
a and it will say is it a M and it says
no it is not an M so notice here that
all the two words were already being
checked it doesn't move on it again come
back to a and does a backtracking here
to make a match again so every word is
being matched again this is very
important concept okay
so again do make sure that you
understand that it always is gonna
backtrack
doesn't means it has already checked em
a handguard a match doesn't go to match
it D so either is going to start a D or
M no it's not gonna happen it is gonna
backtrack at a and it's gonna again
compare it with M and then a and just
like that it looks pretty obvious right
now but as we move forward in the course
this will become the most trivial thing
in the pattern matching for regular
expression okay
now also there are a couple of issues
here notice we can see that it also
selects a man it's also select a mango
and also selects a mangrove because
these first part in that now also if
there there is something like a man it
is also going to select that now
something like that okay so it's looking
for that now here comes interesting role
of this global keyword if you have D
selected this global keyword that means
it's gonna select the very first
instance of wherever that word comes up
whether that's an a man or maybe a man
on mango the first hit and that's it
it's gone
usually in programming language this is
just happens in most of the cases but we
run a loop so that it matches all the
prints all the emails or all the links
that I'm looking up for okay very
important concept about the global
keyword so let me just turn that again
back with a global okay so the first
issue you have already seen that it's
it's actually not hard to select the
word it's actually hard to avoid the
words that you don't want to select now
here is my last step for this video
regular expression are so keen to give
you result back that you always should
be worried about it they are just like a
kids they are just like a child who just
want to give you result back regardless
of whether is correct or not so have to
be extra cautious here they will be so
eager to return you result that the
moment they have found anything they're
gonna just give a result just onto an
instance of that let's turn on the
global here and let's just say this is
I'm gonna write a man here I was looking
for a man here but since it has found a
man here automatically it has given me a
result and stop looking for it okay a
very important aspect about regular
expression they are so keen to give you
result back that they don't really care
whether things are going right or not so
you have to be extra precise okay
so this was the basic little character
and how regular expression works in the
future videos we're gonna learn more
about the symbols like exclamatory dot
and all of that and basically record
expression is all about learning what
each symbol means sometimes they move
they means a little bit more than one
okay so this is it
very simple very basics and let's keep
going on let's move forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
