life so just like this time I have
posted earlier at my facebook page that
yes we are gonna be live at 12:30 and
for the future updates I will try to
keep all of my sunday lives around 12 o
clock in the afternoon according to
Indian Standard Time that is going to be
a quick update and I will be waiting for
people to show up usually it's really
quick we don't have to wage wait much
longer all all thank to you so let's
wait for a couple of seconds in the
meantime I can say a hello to all of you
who are sending hello messages here so
I'll just try out that first of all so
hello be v-tech hello helper you hello
st Rafi vishal hey mr. Ergas
how is it going on for you I got of
Steve amid a lot of lot of people hey
beast Marsha hey Rahul a lot of files
thank you so much thank you so much for
the love that you have been showing to
this channel to me it's really
overwhelming situation and just to want
to give you a quick updates before we
start our Sunday life things are going
really quick and you're gonna see some
massive changes in the Android app as
well as the iOS app is also going to
come up very soon
and there is going to be complete
revamping right now the app that you see
on the Android Play Store it was just a
test run to see how the things can go up
with the app and it really went really
well so it's going to get some massive
updates so that I can launch up a Finals
which full of a version for that app for
it will take a month because these
things are not quickly and can be done
fast it's going to take a little while
but I'll try my best to
do it very quickly that was the one
update the second update is gonna be
also trying to revamp the Leonard code
online dot and website as well so that I
can provide you more learning track and
more Q&amp;amp;A sections and all of that so
that is also going to come up so these
are the few quick updates along with
couple of more things that are gonna
come up so that was quick update now
let's come back to answer our questions
because the main motive of this Sunday
live is to help you out to answer your
questions to chat to chat you directly
and all of that and in case you haven't
yet hit that like button make sure you
do hit like at that small button with
the thumbs up go ahead hit that it's
indicator that how many people are
joined up how many people are liking
these live and everything so let's try
to answer a few questions here in the
meantime you can hit that like button
okay so first question is from Rahul
which one to choose PHP or nodejs
now this is a tough situation because
people are going to throw up a lot of
advices to you but I would say go ahead
get started with node.js because it's a
modern tech really advanced AG and once
you are comfortable with node also makes
sure after that you jump into the PHP a
little bit as well
because most of the startups and
whenever you are going to get job since
you are learning right now they probably
might be using node.js but again our PHP
knowledge is something which is like
essential thing everybody should have a
basic PHP knowledge if you are getting
started into web dev so start with the
node.js
and in present error actually no
programmer is good enough to just have
one knowledge you should have a command
over multiple fields and that's gonna
make you successful so start with a
node.js and then slowly and gradually
move into PHP okay let's answer I have
done thank you so much for the like keep
hitting that like I can see the number
going up like that keep that coming up
is jQuery worth learning yes of course
of course he everybody
to be learning to make ready because
sometimes jQuery really makes stuff
easier and specially if you want to just
select any Dom level element or
something like that in the JavaScript
it's little bit trickier sometimes and
in the jQuery it's it's super easy
jQuery is not that tough
I believe you can learn it on a weekend
if you are good in JavaScript jQuery can
be learned on a weekend our max - max in
just a week that's it so it's worth
spending time so go ahead get started
there Frank Richardson okay so hello sir
make video on means tag development I
will try to make a mean stack
development video where we'll be trying
to build a small application not as of
now because things are going rapidly
busy here once I am done with the
Android app and the iOS app things then
for sure we'll get back to more these
kinds of video but because this doesn't
means I'm not going to be posting videos
videos are gonna be there for sure but
what all the time
I want to spend with the app development
and everything like that so expect that
to come up very soon okay I want to make
a website to inspire people because one
of my cousin's is committed suicide
that's sad
so I don't want other people to live
there lose their lives their relatives
so suggest me something what can I do
that's really a good initiative and
really that's amazing
surely you should learn web development
and should create such website that
would be really a good nice smooth but
to do so it's something that we help for
the society because when we do something
a little for the society that makes
society and world a really better place
so really a nice motive there we make go
ahead do that it would be amazing so
learn web development start with you can
try out a complete front-end developer
bootcamp or you can just learn it on the
go you can use Wix or other platforms
that allows you to just drag and drop in
case your motive is just to create a
website I would recommend to just good
four weeks or anything like that
so that you can just do your job and if
you if your motive is to learn the
complete web development part that's
that's a different situation okay
let's answer what is the best database
to learn for Android app development
okay I would recommend firebase I have
been recently approached by the firebase
guys from the Google we had a little bit
of a discussion about upcoming products
and all these things so yes firebase is
amazing I highly recommend that if you
are looking up for something like
internal database or for a local storage
realm would be something amazing I
recently used a realm in my iOS boot
camp very soon I'll try to include that
in the Android some of the videos of
that as well but go ahead try out realm
if you are looking for a local storage
it's new but it's reliable it's reliable
and if you want to go something with the
online one go ahead get started with the
firebase it's amazing there's no match
of that good afternoon sagar glad to see
you again hey Zafar glad to see you
again which one is better react or ionic
and why it's it's not something like one
is the worst one is best it's not like
that it's something like a moreover
personal preference I am a react
preference guy because I love the impact
of the react it's so easy and the
library is so small and when the things
are so small you don't have to read too
much in the documentation compared to
the ionic it's it's far more big and I
don't like big documentation and
everything react is really small you can
just read in a week or so and just start
doing things in it and also I love the
react native part how quickly and
rapidly you can test your prototypes by
designing apps and everything in that so
I love that he's SPH be good for minor
project yes it's it's absolutely
fantastic for smaller project in fact
for all of my smaller projects let's
just say I have to take just an input of
a male or a couple of small things like
that I always use PHP I don't pull out
the big guns like no GS for smaller work
no J's is amazing for that hey guys
don't forget to hit
like button Naveen says hello hello a
page which is a second programming
language other than Python after Python
I learned Java a lot of people just
believe that I don't know a Java or
anything like that no I have designed a
lot of apps in Java after Python I did
learn Java and after that I moved into
JavaScript good noon hello Manu could do
it to you as well hello bye Abby shake
along hello there
SD Rafi bro I want to learn
cybersecurity from where should I start
if you don't know at learn code online
dot and we have two amazing courses on
cybersecurity go ahead check it out
hello with Acer make a video on IOT Hey
Achilles as of now there is no plan of
IOT because there's a lot of hardware
requirement for IOT like Raspberry Pi
and everything I did work on them on
these kinds of sensors and everything
burning out all of that data code and
everything in my Master's I don't know
how to pick that up again as of now
let's just be honest here as of now
there is no plan for IOT in the upcoming
nearby future I cannot say for the long
but as of now there is no plan for AI
atif so let's just be honest here okay
so I have acquired knowledge in C Java
HTML there's quite a verbose domain and
currently learning Android and Python
okay that's that's quite a much in the
future I want to learn CSS and
JavaScript can you guide me okay so hey
ivy looks like you have been quite a lot
of distractions there because all the
things that you're learning are just
scattered around don't do that once you
learn one thing then you have to move on
to other things learning just see each
other eyes tml
so just first of all try out my complete
front-end developer boo
yeah that is going to give you whole
knowledge of HTML CSS JavaScript
bootstrap jQuery tons of other things
once you are good invective then move
into complete Android development make
10 apps we make 10 apps in that course
so go ahead try that out this is how we
move you learn a lot of technology but
not simultaneously because it is not
going to give you a productive future
yes I always say learn knowledge from a
lot of domains but not simultaneously
just learn first then move into the
second create like five or six projects
in one and then move into the second one
so that you know the stuff right now
just learning the HTML and java and see
it's not going to be fruitful so make
sure it creates something product it's
important it's always important ok Java
says what is the minimum requirement
minimum ramp requirement for Android
studio 3.0 I would say four gigs of RAM
at least at least what they say on the
website four gigs of RAM is kind of
necessary
you see you know the phone with Amish I
am talking right now this comes with a
four gigs of RAM or six gigs of RAM I
don't know what that is it so one plus
three T so at least have a four gigs of
RAM and make sure you enhance that I
recommend 8 GB but on their website they
say 4 GB but I would say personally 8 GB
or 8 gigs is must how much Java for
Android and how much time I would say if
you can write some code for loop
function and can make some classes
that's more than enough for moving into
the Android ok nimesh scepter so how do
you manage back-end of LC please answer
this I cannot discuss more about the
backend stuff and all of the things that
are going behind the scenes that learn
could online an app and everything oh
let us say it's it's being managed a lot
of automatically then by me writing the
code and stuff I cannot discuss more of
that I hope you understand that ok hey
Ganesh hi
Sukumar ok
nice so is it possible it's a question
from Nikhil recently from my last life a
lot of people said hey why don't you
shout out my name when you read my
question so I'm trying my best to read
the names of the questions name of the
people who are asking the question as
well for this I should get a thumbs up
don't you think so I should I should
something cool says is it possible to
get job without BCA but having udemy
certificate another Institute
certificate as web developer certificate
really don't count because just like
degrees alone donc out certificates
alone don't count you should have
projects that should be hosted on some
website or github or something like that
because if you're going without
certificates and without degree that
means you are wholly and solely
dependent on the work so make sure you
don't just rely totally on certificate
they rely on your project okay so I hope
this answers your question pratik says
so how to become good in how to become a
good developer in android do a lot of
projects and you can try out my core set
a learn code online dot n we make 10
apps and make sure you scale that app
all those apps to next level by your own
thinking and everything this is going to
give you a great idea of how to become a
better developer in android I bought
your Android Java course pratik says I
must say you made it really easy there
is a lot of plan going on for Java as
well I'm pretty sure everybody will be
excited when that will come out so thank
you so much for that critique but yes I
have more surprises for all of you how
do we keep your hair so cool I just
don't worry about them however they goes
just they goes like that so I don't
really much care about my hairs I don't
get regular haircuts or everything they
just goes like that I'll make a video on
means tech development that's a
repetitive question yogi says hello sir
I'm a PHP developer also I know the
WordPress but I want to move any other
language please suggest why don't you
try out into Java
it's an amazing tech being evolving
quite a lot you can work on nodejs react
angular a lot of things with just
JavaScript make sure you don't just
learn the vanilla JavaScript that means
the plain one try to learn the es6
syntax X as well okay so oh I all suffer
what what should we use native script or
react native react native react native
all the go react native no question no
doubt about that I wanted to confirm how
much Java required for selenium not much
selenium is very very easy you don't
even need to have much of the classes
even there just a few loops and
functions and that's going to be it
selenium is an amazing domain if you are
working on that Nikhil says how can we
achieve AI in Java as of now there is
not much of the popular and powerful
libraries in Java for the AI but it's
going to come up soon I expect that
because it's not like one language is
gonna have a whole or complete domain
over the AI it's not gonna happen it's
it will come up for Java very soon
just like the Swift and Apple have a
habit of doing everything front-end and
setting an example just like they
removed this the headphone jack the 3.5
mm jack for the very first time
everybody ranted about it and now you
can see the recent phone like everybody
is getting rid of the 3.5 mm jack and
it's gonna be it's something like say an
apple habit that it always says I'm
gonna do it for the first for sure it's
going to come up for Java and Python and
JavaScript and everybody as the time
moves on and let's move ahead
good afternoon sir Shelly says good
afternoon sir please upload videos on
python tutorial python videos are
already there at learned code online dot
n if you haven't checked it out go ahead
and check it out ok how to master any
language do a lot of project in it as
simple as that
sooraj
Green okay Green say he's curious to
know from which college did you complete
your degree I'll pass that make a video
how you work in beastmode ah I have been
working on the beast mode in a couple of
days and it's gonna be same in the next
month entire app and iOS is gonna come
up revamping the website it's gonna be
completely like that so yes I'm already
into the beast mode is else.you app
design using react native or Android
studio it's in react native as of now
but it's gonna move up into Android
studio probably it's it's like 20th
August right now I think by 20th
September it's gonna move on into
totally into Android studio and like
that but no not totally onto that react
native part are going to be there but
you won't be able to tell the difference
because it's gonna be so smooth
after 20th of September let's just say
that it can be little bit here and there
okay so I hope this answers your
questions he attained Praveen says I
want to do a certification course adjust
me some please I have an amazing video
coming up for the certifications because
recently I saw an amazing comment in my
youtube channel I took a screenshot of
it I'm gonna just blur out the email ID
of the person who posted that because I
don't want to make any trouble for
anybody but yes I'm gonna make a video
on certificate and it's an actual
scenario in India and somebody needs to
talk about it and I'm gonna be the one
who is talking about it so it's probably
going to come up tomorrow wait for that
it's gonna be very very interesting for
all the people who are going after the
certificates and it's gonna actually
tell you the truth how the certification
works in India at least for a lot of
exams
okay so let's like that still only one
like why no likes are actually going up
a lot of people are showing the love
it's already around one eight ish so I
thought we're gonna cross two hundred
easily today with a like button but hey
let's just see how much support I'm
gonna get
okay so finally 210 likes good number
for me okay Jay asked Renae says is
MySQL updated no man scale is a very
very reliable technology and is being
used by a hundreds and dozens and dozens
of people and it's going to be used by
feature in the future as well for by a
lot of people so it's not going to go
anywhere in the near future
I don't think so like that way so it's
gonna be stable okay oh hey sir Mike
says hey sir I am CSC first-year student
I don't like math my morale is going
down what to do sir I make a lot of
video to boost up all of your morals so
that you can learn programming can start
with that don't just feel down by
yourself because not everybody is a
genius in math or like in playing games
everybody has its own uniqueness its own
power so go ahead try to find that out
math is not that much required when you
do kind of a web development and
everything so why don't you try out
complete front-end boot web developer
boot camp at learn code online dot in or
wherever you like it doesn't really
matter so you won't feel down not
everybody is super genius in everything
so go ahead try out find out your
strengths where you are good at so let's
pick up more questions so just some
projects I do with out projects and
every course go ahead check it out how
can i buy courses from there and code
online dot in from Bangladesh I'm gonna
solve this all the issues because
recently a lot of people from lot of
countries are trying to move in to learn
code online dot in and very soon I'm
going to roll out in app purchase for
Android and iOS
as well so that you can purchase from
there it's gonna take like month or so
less than a month of course after that
you can just jump in there so hi hi
Danny how are you I want to start coding
on data structure and algorithm would C
be useful language to start thorough or
should I compete or should I complete
Java then start oh this is this is a
kind of a myth because data structure
and algorithm is not not dependent on
programming it's not like it can only be
done in C or Java or Ruby or Python it's
not like that
the inner structure and algorithm is a
concept it it's the way how you store
your data or how you align your data or
how the things are going to push or pop
into your database it's all about that
it's not dependent on a language you can
get started with anything anything that
you know sure means back again in our
life in here just waiting for your life
thank you so much for Shiva it's it's
impressive
is it Linux good for learning
amazing amazing I'm always with the guys
who says I'm gonna get started with
Linux everybody and everybody should
learn the basics of Linux at least some
permissions directory structure and all
that everybody should have the basics of
Linux so go ahead son Kay go ahead with
a Linux note no description about it
just go about the Linux it's gonna be an
amazing skills that are gonna be helpful
for Android iOS web dev or DevOps
whatever you are doing it's gonna be
important okay MD Ahmad Azam says
assalamu alaikum
from heather birth thank you so much can
anyone get skills equivalent to software
engineer yes everybody can get there's
no big deal in that i got a job in
start-up should i join or search for MNC
if a lot of startups are going really
really good and not everybody is an MNC
from the day one everybody just goes
with the start and just proceed like
that
so if you think that that startup is
doing something that you are interested
in go ahead and do that and if you are
all about that hey I'm gonna get only
for the money I need a job in MNC go
ahead with that there's nothing wrong in
earning the money and saying that hey I
just want to earn money it's completely
ok it's fine ok in my college two
companies are coming next week okay this
is a question why auditor if my college
two companies are coming next week for
next year someone internship I am a
third year CS student and I have created
some projects of Android app and web
development what can i what can I do
more please answer ah we have done
really good already if you have made a
lot of projects in there I think you are
all ready to set up for go for an
internship I would say best of luck yeah
I've done already good job in making
project ok please make a video on your
journey to become ethical hacker and
pentester probably monk I'll try to do
that very soon let you see oh should I
learn your Java course in one go I
bought it two days ago feel free to take
your time don't be in a rush
pratik take your time spend an amount
good amount of time in learning the
concept and everything there's no rush
rush to just complete the course you
have full time all of that so don't
worry about that ok I can't afford to
buy courses so please make free
tutorials I do make a lot of free
tutorials on YouTube go ahead check them
out and I will be continuing in making a
lot of free and paid courses so both of
them are gonna come up I have made my
college project in Android but now I got
job in iOS development so how can I
start in Xcode with Swift is it good to
go in iOS or search for Android jobs
no go ahead explore different
territories as well you already know
Android so go ahead
get started in iOS I do have an iOS 11
bootcamp
it's very fantastic and amazing bootcamp
Park go ahead check that out at learned
code online gotten all affordable and
all amazing projects we have done in iOS
it's a good start and I believe if you
are already an eye on Android developer
you're gonna pick that up really really
fast
so check that out why don't you make an
Android development course a innovation
in case you don't know Android course is
already out it's there at learned code
online dot n on Android Oh recently
being rolled out I think you are not
updated so go ahead check that out what
apps have you developed I have developed
a lot of apps I don't even keep the
count of that even every course I build
like 10 or 12 amps
a lot of them are follow the clients so
I don't push it on my personal personal
account recently pulled out an app for
learned code online dot and that was
just a test run is going to come up
I don't just push like apps for ads and
everything I like to push the app that
do something really good and I don't
like ads in the house so I don't do that
okay what about sift language is it
worthy yes if you are already having a
macbook or you are interested in iOS
development
sift is the only way to go in there are
lot of other ways but I would say so it
is the most common way what is the
difference between web developer and web
design web developer actually writes the
code while the design that is most over
in the UI and UX part working on the
sketch or Photoshop or illustrator or
more over like that and the developer is
more over into writing the code it's a
very thin boundary but here it sits
there for college student which is
better for deep learning Java or Python
I would say peyten yeah why Linux is
secure than other o OS I think you might
want to say that it's secure because
it's open source
everybody just modify its according to
its needs so there is no common source
code that's one of the many reasons why
it's little bit secure but that doesn't
mean it's a foolproof
things get hacked and everything it's a
process so you know how this is goes on
okay I am in SharePoint admin want to
jump into developing only them C basics
hey why don't you get started just get
started there okay any scope in
cybersecurity hey there is a tons of
scope in cybersecurity that's not even a
good are you hiring no as of now I can
manage all the things on my home it's
not a big deal for me like managing
website Android app iOS app lots of web
dev updates making courses videos it's a
lot of work it's a lot of it but still
I'm managing to do it very soon there is
a plan actually there's plan to hire
people from different colleges to make
like coding clubs in the universities so
that I can guide them maybe in a month
once in a month and something like that
so that is kind of a plan I am being
recently approached by a lot of students
from the college to make a club like
coding club or something like that in
colleges and that is planned up so in
case you are also planning to go
something like live coding Club or
something like that I can definitely
help you out some of the college's as
invite me to be on the campus for these
live code sessions and everything we're
gonna make like live Android app there
or maybe a website there just in front
of the people to tell them how things
are being done so yes that kind of
hiring that's not even a hiring that's
kind of a making expanding the team is
going up so in case you have something
planned up like inviting me to your
campus for these kinds of things
that would be really happy to talk about
it please add a course on advanced Java
on LC oh yes that is in the plan okay
you didn't make a video about career in
hacking I can try that to make that
Prince Abdul says do you make videos on
concept or programming language only or
any other concept like mobile computing
networking I don't make much on the
videos on just the concept I like to
bring it bring up the code and directly
on to the computer that's what I mostly
like to do okay how much time will it
take to complete your Android app
development course first and foremost
let's be honest programming or making
Android app or iOS app is not magic it
takes time I expect that it's gonna take
up like two months or so to complete
that course it looks like a small course
but when you try to do all these apps
and everything it's gonna take a lot of
time I expect if you spend like one hour
or two hour daily it's gonna be a course
of around two months but make sure you
are consistent there and write every
code that I do so I think within two
months you you will be good to go
Hika showed how to develop a complete
ecommerce website there are hundreds of
ways to do so like react and with our
PHP node wordpress joomla drupal there
is a tons of things that's a very vague
question maximum speed with which your
react GS course can learn ok maximum
speed I would say a week if somebody is
like full flush into the JavaScript and
also the basics of front-end web dev I
think within a week whether the week one
can actually finish up the entire
react.js course but but with saying that
not with the recent updates that I'm
gonna roll up in the react.js course
it's gonna make a little bit longer
course but hey you're getting more okay
so a lot of mics are coming up
automatically that's something amazing
thank you so much it's been thirty
minutes and I have to get back to my
work things are popping up around I have
