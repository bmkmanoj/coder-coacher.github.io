all regular expression training and in
this video we're gonna again talk about
one more thing one more meta character
and this is quite common if you have
programmed past in C C++ Java Python
JavaScript or any language you might
have seen this character quite a lot so
let me give you more examples of this
and this character is literally known as
a slash here and usually it's like this
one slash and there are obviously
variety of usage for this and just like
always it's much more easier to
understand this thing as far as I'll
just walk you through okay so the common
example is let's pick up from the last
example so let's just say that you have
something which says you know I have a
file here so it's a file dot txt and
then there is something like some let's
just say some one and then I say txt and
when you are getting an upload from this
file maybe in PHP maybe node or whatever
ie you are having it you somehow want to
make sure that your file name should be
of only like full character of five
character but at the end of it there
should always be a txt and not just any
txt just one just dot txt okay now let's
just say for this moment that we are
saying that you know what we are just
looking for matching up dot txt so you
might be thinking you know what I'm
gonna just write dot txt okay see the
problem the problem is it also matches
one dot txt if I write like some maybe
some and just two dot txt this is also
getting uploaded and we are not looking
for that we are looking only for dot txt
now in such situation we we actually
don't want some special meaning of this
dot what we want here is the exact dot
to be matched and this is a quite common
situation so in that particular
situation you just put a slash here and
this is a backward slash and this is
just says you know what this time I'm
not saying the dot as a special
character I'm saying you should match
literally the dot character and that's
what this escaping of the character
means now here is a kv8 point
I'll mention all of the cave it's mine
that I possibly could find now it's a
very common situation that as a
programmer you try to just say you know
what I have to make I have to match this
code and like something something is
written here by a very famous person so
you want to match that so you might be
thinking you know what these are also
double quotes and we need to just put
escape character and we have to say you
know what this is how double coats works
and then we have to use it no you don't
do that in a regex at least so these
double courts don't have a special
meaning thing meaning they don't need to
be escaped so please never never never
put an escape character before the
double coats or even the single coats
they are not treated with anything else
you can just be relied and just put a
single coat or double coat there okay
okay now just a couple of more example
these are like the most common ones and
almost everybody doesn't make mistake
here so for example there is a directory
that you want to match that a slash user
slash our slash USR slash home slash
Python and or Python 3 this is a very
common path which everybody gives who
wrote code in Python and you want to
match this so you might be thinking you
know what I can just copy this and just
paste it there and here we go there are
obviously some problems here and this is
why I'm using this particular regex hard
this is really good so this is not a
valid syntax and you might be saying why
is it not a valid syntax the problem
here is the regex is not able to find
out that when you want to start it and
when you want to end it because
ultimately reject simply means start
with a double the slashes and that's it
and you have just confusing this guy
with putting a lot of slashes now in
such situation this backslash actually
is super helpful what you can do when
you want to say no this time I don't
want to end the regular expression
instead I'm saying literally find out
the slash you can just put this slash
here and now it's gonna say you know
what I'm not ending it here I'm just
putting a special character here okay
and this is how you do the stuff again
one more cautionary thing if you have
understood this example let me just
delete that and delete that
one more caution example is that
sometimes people say let's just say I
want to match a domain word here so I'm
gonna say domain but I want everything
to be literally domain so I'm gonna put
a slash after everything like / d / o

don't do that don't do that I know 95%
of people won't do it but I saw one of
the programmer when he was learning the
regex trying to do it this is not how
you do it please don't do that okay so
make sure you don't put a backslash
unnecessarily because it can turn up
simple things into meaningful and
meaningful into simple remember the dot
example okay so this was pretty easy
stuff again and don't worry we're gonna
just walk through easy easy steps and
then we will do complex stuff by
combining all of these things I trust me
regular expression will become so much
easy with this okay that's it for this
video and I'll surely catch you up in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
