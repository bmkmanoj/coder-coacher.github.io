my youtube channel so today this host is
going to talk about how to learn to
program that is very difficult question
a lot of us are actually stuck with this
they really want to code they want to
design their app maybe a website maybe a
web application or maybe a software but
everyone is stuck with one problem how
to learn to code and it's a tricky
answer it's obviously it's a tricky
question and should get a tricky answer
but again just like all of the videos
I'll be completely honest with you about
how to learn to code out there so stick
without it stick with me for in this
channel and in case you haven't yet
subscribed do subscribe to my channel we
will be having a lot of talk videos
about I use development Android
development web development what carrier
path you should choose and how to learn
code and stuff like that you know so
let's get started out here so I get a
lot of emails and most of them say is a
lot of time that sir I want to learn to
code I'm really interested in that I
have no idea which language should I
start with I have no idea how to do that
but still I want to learn to code but
I'm not able to do so
some of them says that I'm learning
programming from a couple of days but
I'm not getting good in that so what is
actually the procedure to learn to code
ok so let's discuss that first of all I
started my programming with C because it
was in my curriculum in the college in
the BTech days yes I'm an engineer and
helis just now talked about that so I
started with the C failed badly the
first code that I returned and believe
me this is the point here that when you
ask a lot of experienced programmer what
code they written they'll say I wrote a
hello world first I wrote a tic-tac-toe
program but what I wrote first of all
was a program full of errors I'm not
proud on that but yes that's true I
wrote a simple hello world program and
it was completely with the bugs a lot of
semicolons were missing curly braces
were missing and it took me about a day
an entire day to solve all that problems
but you know what's important behind
that I didn't left the programming I
stuck with that for a whole day and
solved my problem and finally I was
having a hello world out there that is
most important so the key idea behind
learning the programming is to stick
with it stick with it you will not learn
programming in a day in a week in a
month maybe not in an ear but what you
have to do is stick with it
there will be situations where you will
be not able to solve problem you might
be feeling comfortable with declaring
the variables but not using them you
might be feeling comfortable with
entirely variable declaration and the
usage but not with the functions maybe
not with the loops eventually with the
time you will feel comfortable and your
area of the topics in the programming
will expand out there like first of all
you will you will get comfortable with
variables floats like that and then you
will get comfortable with if-else and
then functions then loops and finally
you will be able to declare the classes
objects polymorphism inheritance you
know geeky words but the whole idea is
to stuck with it problems will be there
challenges will be there programming is
not about learning the syntax about C or
Java or maybe suit it's about learning
the approach if I just say to myself how
much time will I take to go from surf to
PHP maybe a couple of days because at
the end of the day it's just about loops
it's just about functions it's a it's
just about the syntax of declaring the
things but how do I solve a problem is
always going to remain the same so how
do I solve the problem of finding an
even number or odd number is almost
exactly the same in the Swift in the
Python in the PHP in the see the syntax
actually varies the whole logic behind
it always remains the same so number one
goes stick with it number two is just
look out for the code sometime it's not
easy to get the code at worst but but
keep around looking and Stack Overflow
is always the best friend of the
programmers so stay a lot of time on the
on that and on top of everything once
you are comfortable and choose just one
language for the starting days maybe for
six month or an
because you will get comfortable with
the syntax over the time and once you
have done that now decide a goal for
yourself like you want to build a
tic-tac-toe or maybe a web application
that takes the email or maybe a simple
number guessing guessing game or
anything like that so take a goal and
stick with it
now a lot of people will say that a
programming language are equally
important yes I do agree like if you'll
try to design an iOS application in Java
you will fail badly or if you'll try to
design an Android app in the Swift you
will fail badly but that's talk for
another day that what programming
language should you choose for what
platform that's in another day talk
right now the important part is stick
with it and decide a goal for yourself
now it's up to you and only to you that
how much time you take and how much
effort you are putting in solving that
problem to achieve your goal so make
sure that you complete your goal I still
remember that I wanted to design a
simple to-do application in the iOS and
it took me over a month to just
completely finish that application with
the polished icons so in the meantime
process I had to learn a little bit of
the designing a lot of the Swift which
was eventually new from the very first
day and following the sift so the
language was new there was no online
resource available not much help a lot
of function like swipe gestures adding
more other than delete a lot of
functions like that but still what I did
I stuck with it I was completely there
with the language didn't cheat it out
every single day was into the solving of
that problem that is important ok so I
know a lot of you got the answer that
how to learn to code let me summarize
that quickly so the first thing that you
have to do is get a good language maybe
see Python Java anything once you have
taken that search for a good IDE as well
now I have planned that I'll make a
separate video on IDE usage as well how
to choose the best IDE but choose a good
ID it's always a good approach if you
write your C code in the turbo that's a
bad idea
you should be writing your code in good
platforms like a
be lower-end dev or maybe high-end
eclipse but choose a good IDE for
yourself and save some time and once you
have done that get comfortable with the
syntax it will take a lot of time and
once you have done that look around for
the codes that other people have written
and try to follow their approach that
how they have tackled the problem and
solved that and finally decide a goal
for yourself that I want to build this
and that can be anything a billing
system a hospitality system or maybe a
simple tic-tac-toe game a hello world or
a greetings or a simple program that
simply greets you on a 9:00 a.m. 12:00
a.m. 12:00 o'clock and 6 p.m. and just
like that you know so decide a goal and
make sure that you finish that goal
that's the only way to learn programming
there is no shortcut there is nothing
you can skip give it some time and
eventually it will come it's not about
the syntax it's not about the language
ok so quite a lengthy talk but compared
to my other videos it's very short and
in case you do have any other problems
or questions do notify me in the comment
section
once you have subscribed you know you
have to hit the red button out there
police please please subscribe to the
channel it always motivates me and I
love to talk with you so go ahead and
post down your questions I read them all
of them and let's see you with another
question in another movie bye bye to
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
