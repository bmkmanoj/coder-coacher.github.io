with another video and in today's video
we have got a very famous question that
has been asked to me quite a number of
times and in fact in most of my iOS
development codes or iOS bootcamp people
ask this quite a lot that is hackintosh
a good idea to get started with iOS
development because simply people can
people have seen a lot of videos where
people are just installing OS X or Mac
operating system on simple Hardware the
hack hardware or windows-based hardware
so is it a good idea to get started your
iOS development in that case quick
answer's no it's not it's very very bad
idea the detailed answer is coming up in
this video stay tuned
in this channel we talk about
programming mobile apps web apps
technical things and everything related
to technology so in case you are new
here consider subscribing now let's talk
about is hackintosh a good idea now
before we begin on I would say that
hackintosh is a good idea in itself if
you want to get started with knowing
about your hardware playing around with
the bios second tosh is a good project
in case you just want to get started as
a hobby or a project then again it's a
good thing you should get started with
that but again if you are looking for an
alternative to Mac operating system
because it's expensive and you can build
up a hackintosh PC a PC ish thing then
it's a bad idea although you can save
some money but it's not a reliable
computer at all and for the iOS
development let me get you started with
the scenario now in case you don't know
what the iOS development and submitting
your app is like let me just quickly
explain it and then I will show you why
it's completely a bad idea now when you
submit your app you have to actually
pack your app into a package and then
submit it on to the App Store now it's
not like anybody can submit you have to
pay a $99 fees there and on top of the
fees they verify your credit cards and
some account related information so that
they can pay you in case your app makes
really good and they wanted to pay you
so that also requires you to agree some
license in terms in agreement they also
want you to install some certificates
onto your computer and those
certificates actually verify your app as
a unique publisher there now with this
also let me introduce to another terms
in agreement of the OS X that the
operating system like Sierra or Yosemite
whatever you are installing just make
sure you read the licensing terms and
agreements now License Agreement says
clearly that if this operating system is
not installed on Apple hardware then you
are violating the terms and condition so
number one thing you are violating the
copyrights or the copy or the terms and
agreements there and violating the terms
and agreement and submitting the app to
the same company and expecting you to
pay
little bit not a good idea now that's
kind of legalities there of obviously
are violating the legalities there
that's obviously a bad idea now on top
of that the reliability of the
hackintosh is a very very big issue
obviously you'll be spending a lot of
time on this website that I'm mentioning
here so obviously hackintosh is not
something that you have got a PC as
paired on to your home and you can just
install a Mac there it's not like that
if you want to do a hack in DOS project
you have to spend some time on this
website and then you have to simply grab
a lot of hardware specific hardware that
is mentioned it's not like any processor
any disk image or any of your audio
hardware is going to work it's it's not
like that you have to be very specific
on what hardware you're choosing on top
of that you have to play with the BIOS
and then you can install and run on it
until and unless there is an update now
if you're designing something you're
creating your app you don't want that
there is an update in the Xcode as soon
as you did the update voila
your system is gone it's not and
obviously those people who have worked
with the hackintosh project ask them
this thing that as soon as the update is
being released their sound driver gets
bad their Wi-Fi gets bad maybe Xcode is
not running maybe Final Cut Pro is not
running or maybe the system is not even
getting started so again they have to
look out for the hacks and they have to
play around with the BIOS so on top of
everything I'm saying is there is a big
reliability issue let's just say you
have designed an app onto the you are on
a Midway your system crashes it's not
reliable then your whole of the things
are gone actually so it's not a good
idea and in case you're looking for
getting started in iOS development I
would say that get started with some
reliable machine there in case you don't
want to go for the high-end expensive a
Mac Mini is completely ok to get started
and relatively cheap and also in case
you don't want to spend that much - then
there is a good option of Mac in cloud
comm which gives you for a minimum price
of $1 for an hour to get started with
Xcode and basically they gives you an
entire OSX
to the Clyde so you can use that but
again hackintosh is a good idea to get
started as a simple project knowing your
hardware and how to do some fun stuff
but for the iOS development it's a bad
idea because first of all you are
violating the terms a second of all it's
not a reliable system as soon as the
updates are being rolled on well
everything will be a messy thing also if
you are not installing the updates
obviously you will not be able to design
the apps because it's not being
supported your Xcode new features are
actually required so basically it's not
a good idea so I hope things have
cleared it quite a lot yes it's
completely possible to do complete iOS
development on hackintosh but is it a
good idea not at all it's a complete
wastage of time let me know what are
your thoughts about hackintosh and let
me know in the comment section if you
have actually done a hack interest
project in the past so we can discuss
quite a lot about it and can make sure
we will get a lot more videos about the
hackintosh
in case you are a hackintosh guy who has
done a project recently in the past let
me know in the comment section and I
would definitely like to talk with you
and discuss some talks about that
project so with this I would say if you
liked this video make sure you give it a
thumbs up in case you think that this
video can be helpful for someone make
sure you share it on your social
networks website and I'll catch you up
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
