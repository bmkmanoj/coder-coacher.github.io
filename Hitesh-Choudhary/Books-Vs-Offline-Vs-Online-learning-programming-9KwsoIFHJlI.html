back with another video I hope everyone
is ready to learn programming and today
we have another interesting topic so I
expect that you are all set what
programming language you're going to
learn on which platform you're going to
learn but important question is still
left and that is where you should learn
either you should learn from the books
from the documentation from the offline
boot camps or from the online courses so
which one is best so let's just check it
out in this video so before we move on
obviously there are a lot of people who
are fans of books some people fans of
online courses some people just fans of
having offline boot camps so obviously
people do have a choice but if you are a
beginner let's get started with the
perspective that you want to have okay
so let's start with the books now first
of all before I begin with the books I
want to say that every person have
different needs and different criteria
for learning for example if I want to
learn something I usually get into the
technology really fast so if I had to
learn something like let's say I want to
learn Swift in the time when I started
to learn this if there were no books on
the market no online courses no books so
I had to dig up in the documentation so
everyone has a different need and
everyone has a different situation and I
get that I do look up into the
documentation quite a lot sometime I
book buy books and most of the time I
buy online courses so everyone has a
different need so let's take down the
situation which situation is best for
you ok
so first let's talk about the books now
books are a great way of enhancing your
knowledge but from a couple of years and
maybe a little bit more than that I'm
not reading any technical books and
there is a solid reason for that I'm not
just talking randomly here now why I
don't read technical books from a couple
of years because first I have to learn
quickly and the technology is new so why
all the time I have to dig up into the
documentation second and the most
important that I believe that if I have
to learn something technical like iOS
development or Android or anything I
would not
like to see a screenshot in the book I
would like to see things in action I can
understand these things better so I like
to purchase an online course on let's
just say Android or maybe other
technology and I can just watch this
course and can consult with the
instructor and can learn directly but
again don't get me wrong I still do read
a lot of books but most of the books
that I am reading from couple of years
are on time management and increasing
your productivity increasing your daily
skills life hacks and some science
fiction as well don't judge me on that
but still I do read a lot of books but
not technical and some of you might get
agree with me that yes the books are
getting little bit outdated
especially on the technical part for
other books are still great and I would
still like to read a books but for
technical I would not like or recommend
anyone to just buy a book but that
doesn't mean you should not buy or have
a look on the book always go with the
books but not for the technicals okay
now next up let's talk about the off
lines okay off line boot camp having
instructed just in front of you is great
way of learning in fact it is the best
way everybody has been learning by the
same method over the years but things
are changing again especially the
conditions in India are really changing
so let me just put another perspective
out there and this is just again a
thought I am still a big fan of if I'm
if instructor is accessible offline
obviously it's going to be much more
costlier than compared to online or
ebooks but again if instructor is a
variable offline that's always a good
thing but let me put the things in
perspective let's say you want to learn
something and the instructor in your
area is not that much high profile or
that much not skilled up obviously
everybody has a different skill so let's
just say the instructor in your area is
not so good and you want to learn
offline so you are moving into the next
city or maybe a very far city out and
you want to learn there so calculate the
amount of time that you are spending in
moving to the different city the rent
that you are paying the traveling cost
the staying cost the food cost and on
top of that I have seen the situation
and in fact I have personally
experienced
situation where we just go to the
Institute to learn something we just
spend let's just say half an hour hour
to reach the Institute then my lecturer
was not that much ready and he was just
trying to fool us around here and there
with some random talks and then after
half an hour he just started and talked
something and then he talked teach dust
around 45 or 30 minutes again after that
then one hour back to home and I was
just tired
so just for taking a 45 minutes or 30
minutes class I wasted my three hours or
maybe sometimes four hours and that is
not at all recommended in fact if you
are reading any of the time management
skills or time management books this is
the last choice that I would have but
again if you can afford the offline boot
camps because quality boot camps are
costly in Indian currency they cost
around 25,000 to 30,000 and from if
you'll talk about the US or London or
cities like that it costs around
thousand bucks or thousand dollars or
maybe two thousand dollars so it's
pretty expensive okay and again that's
just perspective I am putting out here
now let's come on online okay let me
first get here that I do teach online so
I have a love of online teaching and
online learning but that doesn't is not
going to bias this video online videos
have their pros and have their cons
let's just get through them one by one
first of all if you want to go with the
online then obviously you have to do a
lot of research before buying the course
yes the courses are pretty cheap within
the $20 or $50 you can buy almost all
any courses which are high-profile and
that's just one chomp but again you have
to look quite a lot about how the
instructor is teaching am I getting or
connected with the instructor from a
distance and how quickly he is answering
the questions and whether I am getting a
support or not because everyone will
have problems so based on that you might
want to do a lot of research but the
good part or the best part about online
things is instructor always get ready
before preparing their lectures it's not
about instructed is getting there
writing some code it's not working and
then trying
it happens in the offline boot camps but
it doesn't happen in online instructor
do prepare a lot and in fact recording
just one hour or two hours of lecture it
it actually consumes a time of maybe two
two days or three days or even maybe
more sometimes and then post-production
edits sound quality audio quality video
quality or tons of things needs to go
out there so the best part is you have
to get through the instructor first okay
let's move on now what else think that
you can get now the courses that you
might be looking for example the iOS 210
course which is still not available in
many cities all over the globe is
heavily available online so you can just
learn iOS development or Android n
development quickly via online now one
of the best thing that I have seen the
online with the online courses is I'm
kind of AB I used to be very dumped in
learning
I used to don't get the concept or
things in just one shot I had to repeat
that again and again over the time I got
better in learning but in the initial
days I used to be dumb so I need to just
understand the topic again and again
quite a number of times this used to
annoy the offline instructor quite a lot
because hey if I'm not getting how the
loop works that's it I'm not getting it
so you need to teach me again and again
that and once I just asked the teacher
three or four times he got really
annoyed but when I moved to the online
learning I rewatched the lecture maybe
fifteen or twenty times and the lecture
was not annoyed because it was this
video I was just playing it again
playing it again playing it again till I
didn't got the concept that's the one
charm of learning online another thing
that impressed me personally of online
learning is let us say I'm learning
today I am very packed for learning I
want to learn three hours today instead
of just one hours but tomorrow I want to
take a little rest and I just want to
learn maybe 15 minutes so I'm completely
free to do so course is having a
lifetime access most of the time and I
can just watch them anytime anywhere and
as much as much as I can so these are
the things that have impressed me quite
a lot about online
but still you have to practice whether
you are learning online offline or with
the books practice is the key to become
a great coder so it's not about just you
are learning one day you are just moving
five hours a day and the next our next
day you are just having five minutes and
awe and to the next week you are just
not touching the code code is pretty
easy to forget so do code every single
day I hope you got my perspective quite
right that how the things are different
with the books the offline and the
online again there is no such thing that
you have to choose just online
everybody has their perspective
everybody has their need and everybody
has their situation but the point is you
should be learning with this I would
like to say that
subscribe to my channel we will be
talking quite a lot do like the video
share the video if you think that
somebody can get help from this video
specially the hello world series so with
this see you out there in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
