my youtube channel
in this video we are gonna talk about
how we can utilize the camera and the
save photo library is in an app so
basically it's gonna be using the
functionality of the camera so that you
can click it and can import that in a
view as well as some of the saved images
that you can import in your views so in
case you might have noticed I have
become super active nowadays on the
YouTube and that is because I'm actually
getting free nowadays and I have just
finished a couple of big heavy projects
didn't got the credit for that but pay
was good so I have finished those
projects and nowadays I'm just taking
the boot camps on the iOS and in the
free time I just like to roam around on
the YouTube and Netflix so I saw a lot
of comments that people are facing a lot
of problem with iOS 10 and I'm somehow
feeling that Iceland is far more easier
than the iOS 8 actually so I'm just here
sharing a lot of videos so in case you
request me to some of the special kind
of videos feel free and just free out
there to help you out helping the
students is the best thing that you can
do I just like it I just like it okay so
let's get started out here so what we
need to do to import a super-awesome
functionality of the camera and believe
me camera is super easy in the iOS so
let's click on the file new project and
we need to ship this guy here so that
you can see it as well I hope you can
see that now okay single view
application and let's call this as photo
demo nice name I know and we don't need
codata we won't be using that it's gonna
be pure focused video on camera and
saved photo library next you can save it
anywhere I don't care
this project is eventually gonna go into
the trash because it's not worth it
it's just about displaying the
functionality not polishing the things
okay main storyboard there you are I
think we should utilize more space yes I
feel so so tada and there we go
and believe me all of my bootcamp
students actually know all of these
stuffs because this is so easy for them
and especially then I try to teach I try
to make sure that I teach everything in
the easiest man are out there step by
step of course so this is a review
controller looks good I cannot bear with
this white screen so can I change this
color actually will even allow me to
that background what we can do bring
this guy here and nope this is gonna
work okay now we need first of all let's
put into a navigation bar so navigation
bar so let's just call this navigation
bar and place it somewhere here and
let's call this as camera our photos our
photo library whatever you like to call
that and let's try to pin it from the
top and left and right as well these
constraints and I think I should change
the color of this I don't like the blue
okay yep like that nope nope and you
might be thinking why this guy is
playing with that I like to play with
the images and the colors this is good
actually no problem with that now we
need a button so I'll search for the but
again and this time we need a navigation
bar button item so let's just drag and
drop this guy here and we would like to
call this as camera nice camera button
in the blue looks good and we also need
an image view so that we can just place
our image out there this is gonna look
good here let's pin it from the top this
constraint and in fact let's pin it from
the left as well not from the right and
let's make it Center from the horizontal
and should I pin it from the right as
well let me hit the command see a couple
of time because I think this constraint
is not gonna work so let's just try a
pin it from the top only or let me show
you one more thing instead of that so
let me just dismiss that and hold down
your control key and just drag it to the
top and press down your Shift key and we
want vertical spacing we want Center
horizontal and let's just add these
constraints okay so these two are goods
good actually
and what else we want ah there is good
way let's just resize it to suggested
constraints or that okay x and y or the
width so you can just give it an x
position or maybe a bit bit would be a
good option but I'll just Auto layout
you know I'm lazy okay looks good and
what else we need we need to now link it
so press down your option key and click
on the view controller and this opens up
again this is a shortcut a lot of people
just like to do it with a click of that
you know the what should I call it
although this is assistant editor but
some people call it as Olympic rings and
that some people is me so let's just
delete that okay I don't like that so we
need a couple of things first of all we
need an image view so let's just drag
and drop it here and call this as image
view there we go looks good and we need
an action from this camera so instead of
outlet click on action and let's call
this as Camera Raw tptp tabbed looks
good and there we go looks good let's go
back here now the very first thing when
you use the camera is you might have
seen that permission thing that says we
want to access your photos we want to
access your cameras give that nasty
permission it is required otherwise your
app is gonna crash so go to the info dot
pay list on the top we want to add
something yep and look for the privacy
huh I know privacy is kind of a fun
nowadays but
we have to do that and what should I do
I'm looking for the photo library usage
in case you're gonna use the camera make
sure you assign the permission for
camera as well photo library save photos
whatever you want to wish the procedure
of using the camera and photo library is
exactly the same just one key word got
change out there so we will just try
first of all with the photo library
usage then we will move on to the camera
so this is good now this is the
permission what message you might want
to give to the user goes here so it's
something like this we want to access
your photos to give it to and I say I
don't believe I did this but it's it's I
didn't plan for that but this happened
we want to access their photos to give
it to the NSA okay so this is good now
let's go back to the view controller
okay so how do we access the camera now
what will happen now first of all you
might want to go into the viewdidload
and you might want to create an object
so let image picker this is gonna be an
object of UI image picker controller
there we go
this is compulsory you need to do this
every single time and also I should
actually have done this wrong this
should be not inside the viewdidload
this is wrong this should be outside the
viewdidload this is gonna be required by
a lot of functions so it needs to be out
there now here what we can say is image
picker mm dot delegate is equals to self
there we go
easy peasy looks good now it's gonna
yell us and it's gonna say you're not
following the protocol and in case you
don't know the view controller is
actually getting inherited from the UI
view controller and it can inherit from
one class whatever the rest thing that
you put after comma our protocols in
case you don't know what is that
you need to brush up your sift skills
still okay now let's see what's its
yelling up its yelling that you are not
following the two protocols what are
those two protocols let's just see that
here tada
there we go the one is the UI picker
view controller delegate and the second
is UI navigation controller delegate I
know big names nobody remembers them you
don't need to you just need to remember
that you need a UI image picker view
controller that's it everything else is
gonna fall eventually so it's pretty
easy now let's just see what happens so
UI image picker controller delegate what
is done the next one is UI navigation
controller delegate I'm hitting the tab
by the way you can hit the enter if
you're seeing that directly on the list
up to you so it does now start yelling
that is good sign good sign okay now
what we need to do okay so once the
camera is tapped now the very first
thing that you might want to do is to
tell that what kind of source you might
want to use so let's just do that so
image picker dot source type and here's
the word the magical word that allows
you to use camera photo library whatever
you wish to do so just put a dot and
there we go three options camera photo
library or save photo I think I have
given the permission for photo library
I'm not sure but I think I've done that
let's just see that what I have given
yep photo library is it so we have given
access to the photo library okay so
first of all that's gonna say my source
is photo library go to there and once it
will actually go there now we want to
present a navigation controller by which
you can go so let's just see how we can
do that so it's simply present put
bracket and there we go this is the one
we are looking for view controller to
present enter now I have already said my
view controller is image picker view
controller so our image picker
controller not view controller so I'm
gonna say I want to present image picker
animation why not
true what you want to do when this
actually completes you can write a block
of code but I'm gonna say nil right now
we don't need that this is a simple
application cool really cool you know
now what do you want to do now this is
actually camera trapped is only
responsible for saying the source and
just presenting that navigation
controller out there now once you're
finished with the selecting then you
have to call another function and it
simply says that I'm done with the
picking of the image I'm done finishing
with that so you have to say it did
finish picking media with info look for
that now don't look for the image picker
controller don't ever search for that
this is not a way to remember the things
always look for what you want to do like
in this case I want to simply say did
fail finish picking images with info
like that so hit enter now you can
notice it just returns back an info
object now that object but let's just
say it returns an info which is actually
a dictionary of string of any object
string and any object string is key that
is good so what we can do is simply I
can define an object I can simply say
let image is going to be equal to and
with info it it just gets a lot of
objects out there and we just want to
access one of them and that is UI image
picker controller original image there
are a lot of options hit the ctrl +
space there were and we have a lot of
options like crop rectangle media you
are a live photos media type I'm gonna
look for the original image right now
you know its basics it's on YouTube it's
not on the bootcamp how bad am i okay so
this is good so now our object or our
photo is saved into a new object which
is an image that is good but now we want
to assign this image to our the image
view as well so what we can say is image
view dot image and it's simply gonna be
an image it's surely gonna yell at me
save that come on yell at me yeah there
we go it's simply saying that we need to
typecast that that's it and uiimage
there we go fix no big deal and there we
go this is good but there is a problem
and you will not remember this problem
if I'll tell you here here at this point
so let's just run this application and
let me show you what the problem is
so iPhone 7 run that why iPhone 7
because my simulator is already running
you know this giant simulator is
actually big deal so gray looks good
you know my favorite and hit the camera
here we go photo demo hand it says we
want to access your photos to give it to
anything I can't believe that I did that
click on OK there we go camera roll
select that but here's the problem we
have actually introduced the we have
actually said that present the image
picker view controller but we haven't
actually dismissed that you know my bad
but this is actually the problem and I
think somehow when the object is being
selected it it should dismiss that but
you know if you want to edit the photos
it could be a problem so everything is
good on that place so let's just stop
this and let's just dismiss that
dismissing it is really simple what you
want to discuss dismiss image picker dot
dismiss animated why not true completion
nil there we go now it is fixed and mix
good now run that for me and there we go
somehow there we go there we go a rap
hit the camera it's this time it's not
gonna ask for permission because it has
already got permitted moments and what
should we select I think this waterfall
is gonna look good there we go looks
good now you have learned how to access
the images out there now how do we
access the camera so in case you have an
iphone disconnected with the cable out
there there is some certification issues
but you will
man is that it's just an easy process
and instead of this guy photo library
all you have to say is camera there we
go you have converted that same
application into a camera usage pretty
simple pretty obvious but I'm gonna hit
command Z because this is gonna say
photo library only and you won't be
having the exercise file access I know
so there's no sense of changing that
okay so I think this video was good
pretty informative you enjoy it a lot
because I enjoyed a lot making them so
do horrify me in the comment section
below um see are there in the next
