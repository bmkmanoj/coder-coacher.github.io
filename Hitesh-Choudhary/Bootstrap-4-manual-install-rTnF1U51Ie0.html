bootstrap for training now let's get
started with a bootstrap and obviously
the first good thing to do is to install
that bootstrap now installing the
bootstrap is really simple because all
you need is to reference a CSS file and
JavaScript file that said now although
it looks really simple in the words it's
not that much simple so we have to
follow a couple of steps now first of
all I'll open up my bootstrap folder
which is on my desktop now obviously you
will be seeing this folder completely
full there because you will be getting
it at the very top of the course and if
you want to download the github there is
a link for github as well
now I highly recommend everybody to just
don't use those exercise file just keep
them for the reference but create
everything with me writing the code is
the only way to learn it so first of all
I'm gonna click on 0 1 there and this is
going to be my first folder there in
which we'll be talking about all the
basic stuff like typography images
carousal x' maybe tons of things other
as well I'll create a new folder as well
that is gonna hold all of our projects
in the bootstrap 4 so this is where
whenever we will be moving away from the
basic training and we'll be jumping into
the project area this is where we'll be
going ok and inside the zero font folder
now the first thing that we are gonna do
is create a lot of folder now since we
are in the section 1 that's why we are
in here so let's just create a 0 1 again
inside this as well I know this is
confusing but this is where we want to
keep all of our file ok makes sense now
what we're gonna do is let's open up
this project folder in the atom and what
we're gonna do is go into bootstrap for
0 1 0 1 open that it's completely blank
command and to create a new file or you
can go file an new file no no big deal
there and I would like to save this in
here with the name of index dot HTML
okay make sense now I'll press an
exclamation and hit the tab key so
automatically a boilerplate code is
being filled up for me now this is
nothing if you have coming from from any
HTML website or anything you might
already be familiar
that I'll save this now what it does
gives us a dark-type gives us an HTML
tag with a language reference of English
heads tag and a body tag in the head tag
we have few information like character
set to be used his character encoding
basically to be utf-8 you have to use a
viewport which we'll be using quite a
lot
I'd automatically detects on which
device you are maybe mobile maybe on a
desktop screen or maybe a smaller screen
it automatically does that okay right
now we don't have any CSS so what we
want to do is go into the package and
load a live server there
now this live server is gonna launch up
there and there we go I need to put this
live server in here okay and I can close
these guys now we don't need them okay
and what we can do in here is at just
this guy - to the left of the screen
okay let me just do that quickly okay
where is that here it is so this is
going left and this is going right I
should have remembered that keyboard
shortcuts okay anyways let's go in here
and let's just write a paragraph in here
now notice on the right-hand side of the
screen maybe we can get a little bit
room in here okay that's nice it is I'll
type an h1 then arrow sign there and I'm
gonna light a right lorem and let's
write five now this is the magic of
Emmet plug-in that we have installed now
hit the tab key there and again make
sure your cursor is at the end of the
lorem five and hit the tab key there it
has automatically filled up some of the
h1 and notice as I save it it
automatically reloads everything for me
that's the fun of life server there so
notice now the one thing that I want you
to focus is when I you wrote an actual
tag there automatically the browser does
apply some CSS to it and that is one
thing that bootstrap does quite a lot of
good things for you now let me just walk
you through with the one line of the
documentation is if I go in here at the
bottom this is the power part they're
normalized our CSS now since browser
automatically applies a few style rules
and CSS for you
this normalize dot CSS which is
automatically comes in with the
bootstrap package is gonna flush out all
those CSS and we'll apply its own CSS
okay
that's one good thing you have learned
now how we can get the bootstrap in here
now there are a couple of ways to
install the bootstrap and we are gonna
click on the download there by the way
I'm in the documentation and I'm
downloading it now there are a lot of
ways to download the bootstrap but we
are gonna focus only to the man will
download and the CDN yes you can also
install it Bower and all these things
but let's just stick with the basics so
I'm gonna download the bootstrap and in
a second it's gonna pop me up I'm gonna
keep it on my desktop and let's just
save that
okay I'm gonna unzip my bootstrap and
let me open up what we get into the
bootstrap folder so basically what we
get is CSS a lot of file in the CSS and
in the GS we got two files GS and min G
is now min GS basically is a magnified
version of JavaScript and it's of a
smaller size basically and and removing
all the comments removing all the
unnecessary spaces and all these things
if I go back in here you can see that
it's just 100 KB and this is 47 KB so
men minified files are much smaller
basically these are the same code and
same goes for the CSS again there are a
lot of CSS in here we are not worried
about like math and all these things we
are just worried about bootstrap CSS and
bootstrap CSS min dot CSS okay we are
not gonna do anything else in here so
what you have to do you can use
bootstrap dot CSS or maybe bootstrap min
dot CSS basically they are the same now
let me open up our bootstrap 4 folder
there and what I'm gonna do so let me
talk you walk you through with the best
practice as well we would be skipping
these best practice sometimes but I
think because we are just dealing up
with the basics so let's create a new
folder there and name it as CSS create
an another new folder and name as J s so
JavaScript is going to go into J s CSS
is going to go into CSS ok so let's drag
and drop CSS although we should be
working with the min doc CSS because it
smaller but right now let's just stick
to the basics so this is bootstrap dot
CSS let's go back in the jas we have to
go with the JavaScript as well so let's
just link up the bootstrap GS and that's
it
so we need these two files let's close
this bootstrap guy this one as well so
we can see now that our folder structure
has got J s and CSS as well let me
expand it for you okay there we go
now we have to link it through it now
let's first link at this bootstrap dot
CSS so how we are gonna do that now what
we have to do is let's go in here and
hit an enter and there just below the
meta tag what we're gonna do is we're
gonna write CSS and column let's hit the
tab there
oops not the CSS oops I'm writing it
wrong we have to write style column CSS
and hit the tab key there and it's not
working let's just use the only style
and the style tag is working okay that's
good and now we're gonna give it a
source there as well
oops I happen to remember now sometimes
these happen to me these happen to me
sorry for that we have to write link
column CSS sometime it's easy to forget
the image shortcuts and there we go with
the link CSS we get all the boilerplate
code for linking the CSS now our CSS
file is actually inside the CSS folder
and it's named as bootstrap dot CSS so
we're gonna do exactly the same let's
just remove this guy and we're gonna say
now notice one more thing if I go into
the document in here notice when I just
say it as CSS slash bootstrap dot CSS
and I hit the save key there notice
automatically things have changed for me
now the browser keyboard shortcuts and
everything is being flushed out and
things are looking much better now you
might be thinking hey if that's it yep
that's it
that's this just the CSS but in order to
use the JavaScript file we need a couple
of more things now what we need although
it just says hey you can just link up
your script JavaScript source and
that's pretty much it but it's not gonna
work like that the JavaScript of the
bootstrap requires the jQuery and in
this version of the bootstrap four it
also requires tether as well now you can
always link up them download your jQuery
and tether and can work with that I can
just copy this and just below the body I
can paste that I need to expand this a
little bit okay now this is good and you
can see again these are linking with the
CDN you don't need this I'll it I'll
place my cursor here command X to just
cut that and we also don't need these
Integrity's and all these things we can
just get rid of this make it a little
bit cleaner so this is how our code
looks like but is it going to work I
would say no it's not going to work and
obviously we need to link up a couple of
files we could have downloaded the
jQuery and we could have linked the
jQuery and the tether as well but I
think we can go with a couple of good
steps like the bootstrap CD ends and we
can walk in through with a CD and C as
well so this was basically just I would
say half installation of the bootstrap
because we haven't linked our jeaious in
here now we can do so but it's not kind
of working that is why I'll walk you
through with the CDN and along with I'll
walk you through how you can do that
manually as well okay so let's catch up
in the next video and walk you through
with how the things can be done exactly
the same but with the CD ends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
