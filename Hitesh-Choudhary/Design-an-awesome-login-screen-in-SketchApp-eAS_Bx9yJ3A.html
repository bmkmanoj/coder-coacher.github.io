on this channel we're gonna do something
new usually we just code out at this
channel but again an important part of
coding is designing as well so don't
underestimate that it's it's really
important so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna design an awesome dope login
screen now it is not a usual login
screen we're gonna do something
different with that usually you have
seen that there is a login options there
then you have a register button at the
top tap on register it takes you didn't
need a screen but let's do something
different here and I'll be using the
sketch software here love you sketch
guys this video is not sponsored by
sketch or anybody else yes I genuinely
love these guys they have a lot of good
options that I awesome that are just
awesome so we're gonna get started with
that the sad thing is sketch is only
available for mac but it's awesome so if
you're on a Mac get that straightforward
okay so press a on this and now we can
choose our artboard also known as canvas
but they call it art boat here so you
can choose your iPhone 8 se X whatever
that is just click on that it will be
available I don't like the iPhone X as a
design perspective not much the top
notch is really painful so I'm not gonna
be designing on it I'll be instituting 8
plus and this is what we are gonna be
designing okay so how do we want to take
down this so I have already selected a
photo this is gonna be a login screen
for messaging apps so I have selected a
photo from pixels and this is a free
copyright free photo that you can use
okay looks good now you can use
customized design or whatever the things
that you like to have here I'm gonna
design download it into a original size
and I'm gonna put it on my desktop the
only disadvantage of this pixel is it's
too much in Eric a lot of people use
these kinds of images so if you want
something to be extraordinary just get
just get paid pay for something good and
awesome so right now let's just use this
design okay so I'll just drag and drop
this design and it is gonna be humongous
so press command 1 so that it just fits
the screen size and I'm gonna drag and
drop it a little bit like that so just
fixing it I'm not gonna be doing a like
extreme satisfying thing I'm gonna just
eyeball the stuff and this is gonna look
great like that or probably I'll press
command 1 again so that it fits on to my
screen I'm gonna move this to a little
bit like that okay so this looks good
okay I'm happy with this so far okay but
this is not yet ready I'm gonna press R
to get a rectangle so get a rectangle on
to the screen make sure it's totally up
here okay so this looks good now we can
press command select all of these guys
right click on to it and hit mask so
that your screen actually is of exact
same size and when you export this
entire screen it doesn't export like
everything it just exports this
particular size looks pretty good so far
and I have also kept a little bit space
up the top because I want to put a
gradient here just like the gradient is
there at the bottom I want exactly like
that or maybe a little bit more than
that so I'm gonna just move this a
little bit like that okay it looks
pretty good to me now
and there we go okay that's it adjusting
a little bit okay
press command 1 to make sure it's Center
here there we go looks pretty good okay
next up we want to add some gradient it
it's a little bit sharper image and
sharper image on login screen doesn't
look really really dope because the
feature of the button like signup and
sign-in is not being visible by the user
that much okay so first thing first
let's press R to get a rectangle and
we're gonna do that
okay so rectangle without borders of
course and a fill what we're gonna do is
we're gonna do something like this okay
and we're gonna start with at the top
being a little bit darker yes just like
that okay yeah you'll get to know what
I'm doing in a minute and we're gonna
also get it a little bit darker at the
bottom
okay that looks nice and now what we're
gonna do is we are going to reduce the
opacity here okay
a little bit like that now a little bit
more maybe 70 percent or maybe 75 76 %
ish okay so this gives a nice shiny
feeling that yes there is an image there
but whatever the text or whatever the
buttons are gonna be there on the top of
this image it will look really really
dope and really shiny and what I can do
else here is I can just add one more
point here and now this point can be a
little bit like a less darker and this
point can be a super dark okay just like
that so that the top notch of the iPhone
doesn't really bother much okay looks
good now okay eh okay looks good to me
okay now let's come up our weather
things that we want to encapsulate here
so let's just press T to get a text and
that is what we want to do so this is
let's just assume this is a messaging
app so let's just call it as oh my not
like that my new is the name I just say
assume that so this is gonna be my new
and I'm gonna reduce the font a little
bit okay now it's totally dependent on
you what font you really want to use I'm
gonna go with a veneer next and it it
can be I like a regular okay it looks
good okay and my new is gonna go
somewhere like this
okay a little bit like that and let's
just press T again to get a text and
this is gonna be message okay my new
message looks good anyways so this is
gonna go just like that a difference of
10 points is good and we are gonna go
with bold yep bold looks good a little
bit like that
not exactly if you want to get the
details of that you can press option key
and can just get with that so they are
all chili this is actually looking good
I like it okay looks good we don't have
any logo for the messaging app if we
would have a logo it would have really
looked good at
this point here because this design is
actually oriented towards left and right
not in the top and bottom usually their
designs are top and bottom
this is centered like on the right hand
side there is an image with the scripts
that what this app does and on the left
hand side it describes that what we
really want the user to see up here now
we're gonna keep initially everything
has to be white and then we are gonna
talk about the colors a little bit okay
so I'm gonna press all four a rectangle
and let's just get a rectangle here okay
so looks pretty good okay there we go
the rectangle looks good okay and there
we go so we're gonna move these corners
not like that
I want this corner to be there okay and
yep I want this to be let's just say 25
and then I want this guy to be let's
just say 25 okay
I should have typed there this looks
pretty good to me okay looks good
mm-hmm just eyeballing this stuff okay
let's just remove the border and make it
absolute dope white okay I think this is
good and we're gonna press our option
key to duplicate this guy and we have
one more okay this looks good
probably a little bit like at the center
ish thing a little bit gap in between
them just eyeballing the stuff there is
no such rules that I'm following here
okay looks looks pretty good now I want
to have one more text here usually it's
at the bottom and it just says take tool
like a tour of the application how does
it work but it's usually not that big
and bold it's actually smaller a veneer
next is good fine but it's actually just
medium here so that it just looks stands
out there and make sure it's at the
center position not too much at the
bottom but yes it looks good okay so
this is what we have so far okay let's
just press T to get it
and obviously they're gonna be two
buttons the sign in and sign up okay so
we're gonna go with the sign in I know
you cannot see it there we go we're
gonna change color to them so color and
how about a red no we are gonna talk
about the color in a second right now
let's just go with the grayish thing all
the gray looks really dope here I like
it I like it to be great but we're gonna
move into the colorist thing here in a
second press the option key and we're
gonna copy this here and this is gonna
be sign up okay and you can just put
anything anywhere sign up at the top or
sign in bottom depends how you see the
things okay so we're gonna keep it a
little bit like bottom each thing and
we're gonna just grab one of these
indented lines so that I can actually
make them just where I want them to be
exact same or I can just zoom it a
little bit okay looks good and I can
just make it a little bit like that okay
and I'm gonna right click and remove
show guidelines remove that okay so this
looks pretty good to me
okay this looks a really dope design
minimalistic simple but what we can do
extraordinary here is we can actually
reverse the things okay
so just click on the sign in and we're
gonna go with something which is similar
to let just go with this kind of bluish
thing yeah which is quite or maybe a
grace thing like that so how about a
greyish thing okay this looks good kind
of fair really good great so 8f HC HC so
this is what we are gonna go copy that
and we are gonna select this guy and
we're gonna fill it with a color there
we go hit enter and there we go so now
we have to reverse this guy into white
okay how does that look yep but it
doesn't stand out that much so changing
my mind again you see this is the part
of designing and coding and everything
you change up your mind you do things
differently so let's just go with that I
want to depict it a little bit sharper
than that
okay so we're gonna go with this yeah
that's that's a soothing color make sure
it's flat it's not yet shiny because the
theme that you're falling here is
something like this so we're gonna go
with 21 a triple Z so copy that and I
want to just include this into this guy
and yep this is what I like I like it
so a new messaging app is my new message
and we have a really cool and dope
design we say is my new message you can
put up a logo here as well that looks
good okay and what else we can do let's
just have a text and we're gonna do
something awesome here as well maybe a
little bit maybe the company has a
tagline something like taking messages
to next level and an exclamation just
like that so make sure it's also just
here you can just put it here
in case the company has some tagline or
something like that and make sure it's
also in the white because we're
following a white text pattern so that
it looks good okay it looks pretty good
and pretty dope although what I can do
here is I can align it okay how can I
line it yeah that looks that looks
pretty good to me okay so there we go I
have within a few minutes we have got
everything that looks good that looks
dope and I think if a messaging app has
this much of the minimalistic feel here
it's gonna look dope so next up we're
gonna just select this now a few good
habits is press G so that it becomes a
group and press command G to make it a
group and then command R and name it as
BG for background because this is a
separate background for us now texts
usually people don't like text to be
exported as that because simply saying
that it's just a text any developer can
do the text according to him but make
sure you also give him the name of the
fonts that you are using in this case
it's mostly a veneer next and we need
buttons as well so we're gonna press
select this rectangle and press my
command key and select this sign in oops
the shift key and this both the guys to
make sure these are selected press
command G so that becomes a group and
command R and let's just call it as
sign-in
b TN or e TN okay so this is a sign-in
button we have to do the same thing
select the rectangle press the shift key
sign up and command G to group them and
command R to rename and this is gonna be
sign up BTN okay he looks good and for
rest of the stuff we don't need to give
anything to I don't think so we need to
give and rest you can export just this
guy directly and the good part about the
sketches you can just export it into 1x
or you can just add a tap it and looks
to X so let's just export this and we're
gonna export that on to Dec stop okay
and let me show you how does it look
okay so come on you can go up here there
we go
looks pretty good pretty dope actually I
like this messaging app that we have
quickly came up
so yes designing is also important and
interesting part of the coding as well
if you have such good designs they're
obviously gonna look awesome so I try to
be minimalistic it's easier for coders
as well it's easier for a designer as
well so I'll let me know in the comments
section
did you liked this dope design and for
sure in the future based on requests we
can do more such videos where I can
teach you how the things are done how
the looks awesome and how you can make
all these amazing stuff that's it for
this video and I'll surely catch you up
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
