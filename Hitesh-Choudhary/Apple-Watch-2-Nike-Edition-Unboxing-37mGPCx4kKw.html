back again with another video now this
is again an very interesting video
because today I have a gadget and I
would like to do an unboxing of this
gadget so what's this gadget you might
have already got that from the name of
the video but this is Apple watch and I
got recently my Apple watch I tried a
lot of things to get this because I was
not getting a hand on my Apple watch a
lot of the genuine stores were not
giving me because they were not having
this Apple watch but then again when I
could store in the vaishali helped me to
get their hands on this watch which is
the Nike Edition I wanted this so I have
the Apple watch I have a knife which is
nice and to cut an apple we need a knife
so in this video let's unbox the Apple
watch so this is the Nike Edition and it
looks nice it comes and the mine one is
actually the grey band the black and the
gray band so I'm really excited for this
so let's get the unboxing now you might
be thinking hey a lot of videos for the
unboxing are just about two cameras and
all of that I don't have that so you
have to just walk around with me so I'm
gonna be just doing a simple unboxing
there nice cutta cutta cutta apple and
there we go
and it's really nice to say that to cut
an apple we need a knife I hope I don't
cut myself with that so yep that's open
the job of the knife is done so the
hardest thing is already over so really
excited come on I'm making a lot of
things here so there we go and this is
how it opens up and the first thing that
I like to see in all of the Apple
product is the product itself but this
guy is staying behind the product logo
that says designed for athletics by
Apple and Nike athletes not athletics
bear with me so this is what we have
here and some paperwork
I guess or some bands I'll keep that
here for a moment and this is now the
Apple watch that you see of course
obviously I'll be doing more videos
about how I liked it
reviews about the functionality how fast
it is and all of that but right now I
can see that this is the actual product
pretty nice so the first thing that you
get is an Apple watch there which is
nice let's leave it for a moment here
and what else do we get now this is not
useful
now you get your charging station dock
that is really nice looks like a tablet
to me a big tablet that you get when you
get operated or something like that it's
nice actually and apart from that you
get a charging dock as well and this is
how it looks pretty nice I hope you are
being able to see it it's really far
from the camera but again this is what I
can do best the resources that I have so
nice charging adapter and a charging
dock which it gets so pretty nice what
comes up with this guy it was lying at
the top
I don't liked it but it's having a band
that's nice a lot of paperwork I don't
need it what's there I don't need it
and a lot of paperwork and this is how
the paperwork looks it tells you about
what you can do what are the faces that
you have and no idea what to do with
that so I'm gonna make it a plane and
I'm gonna throw it and after that I get
a band there how to get it off this is
what I have and I guess that's all about
the unboxing experience what we have
here now let's come back to the actual
product itself it's nicely wrapped in
the paper I'm gonna look I would like to
peel it off so there we go
and there we go and this is the shiny
product that I was waiting for it's nice
I need to peel off a little bit more I
guess now it's it's just fine and there
we go
it gives you an extra band as well
that's really nice but I think I'm gonna
leave it there for a moment and this is
how it looks how does it look on my
wrist that's gonna be important as well
so all you have to do is first of all be
careful as I told that I don't drop my
or any of my Apple bands or Apple
products so I would like to stay with
that so this is how it goes and this
band goes there
yep this looks nice this is how it looks
on my wrist it's so nice and of course
I'm gonna turn it on and I hope it has
got some juice yep it has the tiny
little Apple logo and it's getting
started
I hope the connectivity issues and
linking up with my iPhone is not gonna
be a much problem but for sure I'm gonna
be back again with another movie talking
about how I like the experience and how
I liked it while I was running doing
some workouts exercise and all of these
stuff because that's why I have bought
this Nike watch so I can I would like to
say it's it looks pretty solid at in
your hand and I would like to say thanks
to that card store in the vaishali do
check them out they are the new stores
but again this this video is not at all
sponsored by any of them this is not
being given to given by them it's
completely mine purchased one so I like
it it's taking a mean a little bit while
to get started but again I would be back
again with another video about reviews
how I liked it what are the things I
liked about it what are the things I
don't like about it but for that of
course I need some hands-on experience
with this product so check out the
