with another video in this video we are
talking about the top 10 chrome plug-in
that I love now just to give you a
context here I'm a programmer I write
code every single day now situations do
change obviously sometimes I write I
wrote code for react where PHP may be
android may be iOS but I'll write them
every single day and I'm a big fan of
boosting my productivity and workflow
using these plugins whether these
plugins are for editor or maybe for an
Chrome or maybe anything else I like to
boost my productivity with the help of
these small tweaks like Chrome and all
these things so in this video I'll tell
you what are my favorite 10 chrome
plug-in that currently I'm using just
onto a side note I'm a big fan of Emmet
which is a plug-in that you can install
on your editor whether that's a sublime
text or atom or maybe anything else you
are using if you are more interested in
getting know more about this free plugin
Emmet you can go ahead and check my
course at learn code online dot in
absolutely free and you can boost your
productivity for writing HTML and CSS
codes and trust me it's super fast when
you write code with Emmet installed it's
absolutely free go ahead check that out
now before we move head and go on to
computer and check out those plugins
here is my quick thought now I'm not
covering like all of the best plugins of
course I'm not aware about each and
everything I would like to know your
thought as well maybe I have missed your
favorite plug-in and that is so much
awesome I would love to know about it so
go ahead in the comment section and post
down your favorite chrome plug-in that
you are using currently or whether it's
covered in the list or not as well so
now let's go ahead and move on to my
computer
first down to the ocean we are
programmers and we like to get started
with zero like 0 1 2 3 there is no
brainer in that we love to do that
so at position number 1 I'm gonna keep
my most favorite and the kind of a best
for everybody is chrome inspector tool
yes this is not a chrome add on at all
but this is like the best feature which
made chrome popular among the developer
so right-click and inspect element and
it will just open up here and you can do
a riot II of things you can inspect any
particular element you can do consoles
some sources and one best thing that I
like recently is the network now yes it
was always there but I recently explode
the power of this network tab and in
case you are designing and developing
apps like progressive web apps this is
super helpful and super powerful in
testing the stuff now yes I do aware
that this comes this brings actually our
first honorable mention yes there are
two actually the first honorable mention
is postman now a lot of people love
postman and in fact you can do variety
of requests and parsing and changing all
these things kind of a network stuff
with the postman plugin there's a
separate like an app for that in the in
the Mac I'm not aware of the Windows do
let me know in the comment section if
there is a separate app for Windows as
well I'm aware of the Mac as well so yes
if you're testing out your network
situation for your progressive web apps
you can obviously do that in that I love
this this is so amazing so let's move on
to the first and it has been asked to me
like number of times whether that's an
offline boot camp online boot camp or
course whenever I just open up a new tab
in my Chrome it just gives a new
beautiful image and my focus and my goal
I love to use it and this is the plug-in
like most email asked plug-in it is
momentum I'm a big fan of it it gives
you a new image every single day and you
can just be focused by putting it on
there's a paid version as well I haven't
tried it probably I'll try that if
they'll sponsor me or just will give me
okay now let's go ahead and move on to
my next favorite one which is a react
developer tool now
I am I'm being coding react quite a lot
nowadays and this is really super
helpful and the best thing about it is
that you can just simply have this react
in and it just opens up in your bottom
console to the inspect element kind of
stuff and it gives you so much better
things about your props and States and
gives you more idea about inspecting and
debugging
I wish really that this should be like
default tool in the chrome but it just
integrates so beautifully that I highly
recommend for all developers and all of
that that it gives you a beautiful icon
at the top if you visit the websites
like Facebook comm it automatically gets
activated and tell you that this website
is using react and stuff like that so I
like it the next one is very popular for
web design and developers which is
mobile responsive web design tester and
what you can do with this you can just
click on it and it can give you a
variety of sizes and landscape and you
can test your website how it is going to
perform on that or look like on that
particular multiple devices and really a
really good list and the most best part
is the width and height so you can
mention your device and can check this
out so I like these guys I love it now
another one is yes there is no surprise
with it colorzilla it is like tea guard
for picking up the colors yes there are
a couple of others as well like a little
bit better and I use multiple of them
but yes colorzilla is like be must
mention if you are picking up colors I
usually pick up my color from learn code
online dot in slash flat color picker
there are a couple of others website as
well like flat UI colors and you can
just choose your color directly from
there but obviously we need to pick up
some color from websites we love them
sometime and we just do that now another
one which is the must-have plug-in is
the Jason view now yes there are a
couple of others as well and the point
is you should have one of them now if
you work with api's quite a lot these
Jason files are not so easy to read when
they are just being thrown at you on a
web page
so Jason view just beautifies them and
helps you to be more productive more
readable Jason that you are gonna have
sometimes I use like website for that
there are a lot of juice Jayson
beautifier website but having this is
like I wish that this is like a default
one for all the developers I really wish
that sometimes chrome gives you a like a
package bundle for these most popular
ones and you can just install by one
click and that's it okay but I'm just
demanding too much now next one is like
not so important but still I use it
sometimes which is what font sometimes
you just love the font on the website
and it's so hard to dig up on to the CSS
and try to find this exact font and all
that so you can just install this
plug-in and just hover over it click it
and you get the font so really good and
really it's not a big deal but I like it
and the next one is the bookmark manager
now this used to be offered by Google
like in an active development but right
now they have start working on that I
think they have reached to the
saturation stage like this is the best
we can do it's still a good in managing
bookmark maybe you want to bookmark
learn code online that was smooth and
obviously it's a good login I recommend
it highly because there are a lot of
resource on web site on the web which we
forget about that and having a bookmark
is like a good idea I use it all the
time
then there's one which is like not so
popular but still you can just use it
which is changing your user agent in
case you don't know there are a couple
of user agent for different for open up
Internet Explorer and Chrome and Firefox
and you can just work with that in just
one plug-in directly here not so useful
I don't use it that much often but I
thought it would be good mentioning that
sometimes it just saves you and the next
one is for beginners this is the page
ruler now I used it in a couple of my
boot camps while teaching the web design
front-end stuff and people just loved it
because in the initial stage the bigness
are so much confused about having the
perfect height and width of a particular
element or division it just helps them
although I do recommend later on that
you should be going more responsive
things for that but sometimes you know
it's helpful for beginners so that is
why it is being mentioned
and the next one is visual inspector by
canvas now here is a quick tip about it
I haven't used a visual inspector but
one of my friend recommended it and he's
a developer you can watch the video it's
pretty easy like you can just edit all
the things of course you can do that an
inspector element but you can just
change anything on the website and just
copy the CSS and stuff and can paste
that but here's the one thing that got
me a little bit TWiki and I should
mention that if you'll go into the
reviews here's a review by Avinash and
he says and not by Avinash it's a review
by Mick Venice it says it's a good
plugin but he got a malware while
installing and I'm a little bit like oh
that's that's not good and they have
figured out this issue they have
resolved it completely I am with you
guys don't want to like bash you around
every review is like awesome I watch the
video it's so amazing I haven't used it
personally that's why I kept it like at
the very last but again our video looks
really good I'm gonna give it a try but
I'm a little bit a little bit about on
that edgy side that is it gonna install
a malware I'm not sure I think they have
rectified it totally again I would like
to get in touch with a team to know more
about what happened in the situation
more clarification it's always good and
now I have already mentioned one
honorable mention here which is postman
and another mention is I recently found
it out which is wiser now if you are
developing for Android obviously we all
know that the Android simulator are so
so lazy and they just don't work like
awesomely and this having these things
consume a lot of rams a lot of people
want to develop on their actual devices
and you can just connect your phone with
this it downloads the wiser app on your
phone and well a somehow it just mirrors
your actual device on your screen and
it's so much easier to see everything on
the screen directly when you are
developing of course you can look at
your mobile again and again but my
preference is just to have it now the
only like not so big deal about this
visor it it just launches
in the first 10 second and after that
also it frequently just launches some ad
but of course developers need support so
somehow editor iseman is supporting them
I'm really glad that they are they are
having a paid plan as well I am planning
to buy that because I loved it
absolutely it's so good to develop your
Android apps directly on your phone and
not to worry about the slow simulators
and stuff like that so these are my list
of what I like as a developer these
plugins of course this is not like all
the lists have we all used like variety
of other plugins I would like to know
your thoughts about what are the plugins
that you are using and is not mentioned
in the list if it is mentioned in the
list go ahead in the coming down section
that and say it was covered if it was
not covered
go ahead mention that in the comment
section I would be looking forward for
your comments so that I can also improve
my knowledge and get to know about more
of these awesome plugins that are
available so that's pretty much it for
