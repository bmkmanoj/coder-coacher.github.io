again with another video in our
JavaScript course I hope you're enjoying
this series if yes don't forget to let
me notify in the comment section I read
all of them so let's move further and of
course learn code online dot in visit
that so now let's get move ahead and try
to make this Trello into version 3 but
this time you're gonna be making it onto
version 3 this video consists of a big
assignment but first I need to cover up
a few topics so that I can teach them
first and can give you assignments for
that it's gonna be fun
believe me so let's move on to the
Trello version 3 and you can just select
this guy and let's create a new file and
that's gonna be Trello we three dot J s
there we go ok so there are a couple of
things that I want to talk about first
of all we can borrow some things from
here so let's just create an object
which is exactly like the previous one
so we have already learned that how we
can create objects how we can create
functions and stuff like that now let's
move further and what I want to discuss
is something which is like this console
dot log so how we can create a method
just exactly like console dot log ok
exactly like this we want to create a
sum method which says my two dues dot
and let's just say add meeting and there
we can pass on directly like five or
four this would be much more easier and
better as compared to our version two
okay so we're gonna learn a couple of
things first of all I'm gonna show you
one then you'll you're gonna be doing
this assignment for two okay maybe more
so how we can proceed in that further
now just like we have learned that we
can create a kind of a property here
which can have a string boolean a number
we can also create a property which can
have a function these are known as
methods but you might be asking what's
the difference between a method and a
function and technically there is none
if the thing is inside this object or
maybe inside some class we call it
method otherwise it's a function so
technically there is no difference at
all yes a lot of you can argue with me
there but I'm gonna leave this as
totally on you decide what's the
difference in here so let's just call
this we're gonna call add meeting
the meeting there we go now this ad
meeting is gonna be a simple function so
how we can convert that as a simple
function exactly how we have learned
previously just create a name which say
is function and I can surely write
function there we go and define whatever
you want to do inside this function for
example let's just say you want to log
out something saying hey are hey I am a
function there we go so now you can have
a call to this function just like what
we have done in the past in fact if
you're gonna be learning any framework
or maybe a library like react or node or
anything you will be using this exact
same thing quite a lot okay so how we
can access that is the next question so
obviously it can be really simple you
can simply say my two dues and just like
we have been accessing all these
properties like day meeting done and
meeting our meetings we can simply have
something known as ADD meeting and just
like that we have to call it just like
that so notice the similarity here
between simply this console dot log and
me bad meeting yes it's exactly same so
from the day one when we started the
series we have been actually doing
exactly what we are learning now so what
we're gonna do is remove this Council
log and we want to run this version 3 of
Trello so we're gonna just open up our
terminal and not like that so there we
go we are gonna open up our terminal
clear the screen and we want to run this
version 3 so that's gonna be simple node
Trello read 3 dot J yes and notice it
says hey I'm a function ok so now we
have learned the very first thing off
our JavaScript which is how we can
create a function and can call them just
like console dot log now comes up the
next part which is how can we access all
these properties which are defined in my
object and how I can manipulate them I
have already learned in the previous
videos that when I manipulate any
property in my object its permanent
whether I'm doing it through a function
or any other way it's done it's it's
done in the original one
there comes up a new thing which can be
little bit tricky to understand but it's
not much because we will be revisiting
this topic again so this topic is known
as this keyword a lot of beginner
programmer who are getting introduced in
the JavaScript get him can get easily
confused with this topic but don't worry
this is totally totally easy and when we
will be revisiting this topic it will
become completely clear right now what
we have to worry about when you are
calling this anywhere inside this object
in these functions what this means is
it's trying to refer is an object which
is just just in here for example in this
case we are referring to all the objects
just like here okay yes it's context can
change a little bit but we are not
worried about that at all right now just
try to understand what I'm saying here
is here and you know what's the big
issue about pro teaching the programming
the people who doesn't know anything
about programming they are much more
easier to teach while other person who
have some knowledge from here and there
they are not empty canvas so they are
much more harder to teach so don't
become that guy who has some knowledge
from here and there just believe in me
and right here when we will be
revisiting things will get clearer so in
order to understand this more notice
here what I am trying to refer here is
this and I want to just print it here so
let me just save this and first of all
let me run this so that we can see what
this is referencing right now here so
clear that up and there we go so notice
here this is now referencing to all the
objects or all the properties which are
in this current object if we are gonna
be calling this somewhere into other
object then this in that particular
object means to that only now how we can
verify that we can quickly copy that and
we are gonna have another let's call
this as my to do two and in here we have
another add meeting exactly and we are
having this function and this context
here
so if we're gonna be just duplicating
this guy and we're gonna call this as
two so now we have exactly same keyword
and exactly same methods and everything
but
this keyword right now here reference to
all the objects all the properties which
are defined in this one this keyword now
refers to all the properties which are
defined in this one and we can simply
verify that by saving this file and can
run this and there we go so notice here
that first hour it is referencing to
Monday and everything I should have
changed a few things here so that we can
understand that probably this is like
Tuesday Tuesday and this should be like
probably 12:00 this can be like 3:00
something like that now let's just run
that again so we're gonna clean that up
run that again so notice here right now
this was referencing to all these things
in the day Monday Tuesday and all of
that and the second one it's referencing
to Tuesday and meeting all of that so
this reference point is pretty good and
you need to understand it don't worry we
will be revisiting this this keyword and
things will get clearer much more there
okay right now all we are worried about
is how does this works this is really
simple this just says whatever the
objects are whatever the properties are
there in this current object okay now
how is it going to be useful for us what
we can do is we can say let's just say
somebody says add meeting and pass on an
object which is gonna be false so I have
four meetings today so all I can do is
in this function I have to reference on
this meeting I have to use this I cannot
simply say meetings like that and can
assign it to whatever the number is
passed on so let's just say num is
coming up from here or probably have
initial value 0 so we can simply say is
equals to meetings meetings did I wrote
it correct nope meetings and plus num I
cannot do that now let's just see how
how is it going to work if I just do
something like that okay so we need
another function which is gonna be
display or can be summary summary and
this summary is gonna be something again
the problem is still the same so let's
just say we have a function
it doesn't take any parameter at all and
we forgot a comma there your hand
summary and now if you want to access
like all the meetings in here we have to
return this so return and something like
this and we can say you have a certain
number of meetings meetings today there
we go now the problem is I cannot still
say something like meetings okay and you
know why this is happening let me show
you that why it is happening my two dues
dot and this is summary there we go so
have it now let's just try and run this
because that's always a good idea to how
see how things are going on or how
things are going on wrong now notice
here although over technically we're
code is correct but meetings is not
defined our function have absolutely
zero idea what this meeting is now this
can be a little bit tricky situation
that hey it is just defined there but
remember when we are using these curly
braces a thinks kicks in which is known
as scope so this in order to get rid of
this scope problem we use this so
whenever you have to reference this
particular meeting when you're inside an
object you can use this keyword we did
notice previously that this has an
access to all the things which we have
defined so what we can say we can simply
say this dot meetings and then we can
say this dot meetings and I'm gonna show
you a confusion part as well where a lot
of people get confused and in here as
well we can simply say this dot meetings
okay so now what we have said that hey
since this has an access to all of that
just like previously we have learned
with the dot we can access that property
we are accessing that so that sounds
cool it should be running fine now
according to the theory which I have
mentioned here so there we go
we forgot to console.log anything at all
so I should console.log this summary and
I can just cut that out and I can say
console.log there we go so now it should
work correctly and there we go you have
four meetings today now let me tell you
where actually the confusing part comes
up confusion part comes up when people
just try
to teach in a way they then that they
should not be teaching something likes
when this num instead of this num people
try to refer that as meeting or probably
meetings how comes to the tricky part
because what you have learned so far is
exactly same but what usually the books
I have been on to this pain I don't know
why people do that and say this like
that and people eventually get confused
that why with some meetings it says this
and why with some meetings it just say
meeting now the only question is if
you'll replace this to numb her to some
number or does this numb it gets
absolutely clear and that yes what we
are referencing to this here and you'll
be seeing this in a lot of like a blogs
or books that people just reference it
with the same name it happens quite a
lot but the point is when you're
referencing to the things or properties
which are inside an object then only we
use this otherwise if something is
coming directly as a parameter call it a
num call it a meetings it's totally the
same thing okay so now we have learned
that how we can use this add meeting and
can get a summary now here comes the
assignment part which I think everybody
is excited so a sign meant okay so what
is your assignment the first part is we
have already done for the add a meeting
and we want to do is is meeting done so
handle something like this handle
meeting done this time we don't need to
calculate anything you can just take
these things convert that into a
negative number and just say meeting
done and it's gonna in the summary it's
gonna just calculate just handle however
you like okay all I'm saying is just it
should work fine and we have already
done what are other functions we have
add meeting we have a reset one as well
so create a function so create a
function that can reset entire day so
there we go so we have just two
functions handle the meeting done as
well let's create a function we have
already got the summary you will surely
need to edit this summary part as well
okay so this is all fun you have learned
about some of the methods which we can
create inside the object
we have handled a little bit about this
keyword I will be revisiting that this
keyword when we'll be talking about
difference between es 6 es 7 and the
regular JavaScript and stuff like that
and how it can get messy all of that
later on
and I have given you a couple of
assignments so I hope you're enjoying
and having fun this with this amazing
JavaScript series if you're enjoying it
don't forget to hit the thumbs up and
subscribe button is important it
motivates me to do all these things I
hope you want me to keep doing these
stuff so that's it for this video and
let's catch up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
