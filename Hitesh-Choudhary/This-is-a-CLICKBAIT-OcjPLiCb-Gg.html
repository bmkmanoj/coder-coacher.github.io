clickbait video the title says it so the
thumbnail says it so and still you are
inside this video in this video I'll try
to explain what is this click baiting
and why people actually do that also
will try to judge some people based on
is click baiting good or not let's get
started click baiting is simply an
element of surprise you just try to put
something in the title or in the
thumbnail or in the blog post title or
in the news article which is completely
maybe contradictory or simply an eye
catching thing and based on that people
try to read that newspaper try to watch
that media article maybe image maybe a
video and based on that and you all know
that most people hate click baiting
because it's simply deceiving people
don't like it it say something and
inside there is something else and this
is not a new thing now in fact YouTube
is fairly a new platform compared to the
blogging world if you are a blogger or
already are aware of the situation this
happens quite a lot in blogging and the
way that you see on the YouTube is like
the teeny tiny one
it happens massively in the media
channels it happens massively on the
blog articles just if you're a blog
reader you might already be aware of the
situation that blogs always look forward
to put a catchy headline in their title
or something which is more catchy or
just like that and this is the only way
to grab the attention of user and they
do it especially if you're living living
in India you might be thinking hey all
these media channels do click baiting
and they do it quite a lot
trust me my dear friends this is not
just only India it happens all over the
globe in the United States in the United
Kingdom in Australia New Zealand
everywhere it it is happening click
baiting because somehow they need to
grab the attention of user and this is
the easiest way everybody does that now
this doesn't means I'm backing up that
everybody should be doing a click
baiting thing but still there are a few
things that you need to understand that
why people do click baiting now the
entire world of internet or click
baiting or whatever you call that
YouTube everything just drills down
these two things one is user acquisition
and probability and these are the whole
soul which
the entire internet every possible
website and every single thing just to
give you a quick idea just remember the
news vein the day back when whatsapp was
sold and Facebook bought it do you
really think Facebook was looking
forward to by a company which offers a
chat that's it
Facebook don't have these skilled
engineers who can make another whatsapp
surely they have but trust me my dear
friend you are the most valuable
property on the internet and you didn't
even realize that but you're you were
sold to Facebook you didn't even realize
it was not the whatsapp on which
Facebook was after it was about the
millions and millions of user data
remember user acquisition it was
millions of user on which the Facebook
was after because now Facebook has
bigger data make bigger reach to the
people and this is all about user
acquisition so where does it comes and
drills down to the YouTube now whether
it's a YouTube algorithm or a search
algorithm the more people are seeing a
content that brings boils down it to the
more valuable content you might be
thinking that a song is crappy you might
think that this content is completely
crappy but it's not simply because you
have given it a dislike or a thumbs up
it might have a 5,000 dislike just one
thumbs up but still since more people
have botched those that content that
content is far more valuable in terms of
algorithm as compared to the awesome
content which is only being watched by
four people so end of the day everything
drills down to this guy user acquisition
the people who were able to grab more
people this is all the winner here so a
song might be crappy a content might be
crappy but if more people are watching
it drills down to the more acquisition
okay so now do you understand that what
is user acquisition and that is why
everybody is after they user acquisition
the more content you're going to put the
more user acquisition you are going to
make but what does it has to do with
this probability thing then here comes
you interestingly now you are since the
most valuable assets every single
decision that you make is based on
probability whether you think that like
way or not the entire shopping
experience that you do on Amazon
or Flipkart or any other given website
on this entire planet it's all based on
probability the more you'll see the
product the more you'll see many times
on Facebook on Instagram on YouTube the
chances are high that you'll be buying
more product and this is it
the product that you are purchasing the
service you are producing this whole
runs the entire economy in the world and
this probability of seeing a product can
be increased quite a lot when you have
got more user acquisition and this is
why when you visit a website like
amazon.com you search for that product
the same product is being displayed to
you on Instagram on Facebook on YouTube
you see suddenly that there's a change
in how the ads are being displayed to
you this is all because they want to
increase the probability they want you
to see their product again and again and
this gives them more chance to sell
their product and this is not about a
special kind of product it can be a
laptop it can be an iPad it can be a
service like hosting website or maybe
just a regular soda it all depends on
user acquisition probability and you are
a chain of that now some youtubers and
blog article writers do this click
baiting quite a lot because end of the
day some of them yes this is actual fact
only some of them understand that this
will generate more views this will
generate more user acquisition most of
the people are not even aware what they
are doing they just think that this is
fun and we're gonna get more views and
that's it end of the day yes there is a
certain part which is like beneficial
for the youtuber or content writer but
end of the day the big game the big guys
the big guns who are the advertisers who
are selling some product are the ones
who are behind this kind of entire click
baiting thing who are getting benefited
from that not you my dear friend who are
doing a simple click baiting on youtube
or on a blog article again the question
drills Brown is click baiting good or
not now it is a very subjective matter
every person has a different opinion on
that now if somebody is a youtuber or
blog writer he's gonna say that it's
okay I have explained the rest of the
things inside the content maybe it's a
video content or blog article some
we'll say that at least user was able to
get attention to my article or my video
and that's why I was able to explain him
the further situation some people think
that that's okay
some people take an aggressive step that
says no it is not okay if you want to
present a news just present a news like
that I don't want to see that flashy
limelight soft click bathing's but again
it's a subjective matter some people say
that hey even if it was was a clickbait
I was able to get that news I was being
entertained in that manner so again
there are two groups of people I'm not
saying any one of them is wrong or this
one is wrong it's all depends subjective
really subjective some people are X some
people are Y both are necessary element
of the society
clickbait ting is the thing how media
delivers the news and this way of
styling of delivering the things using
clickbait ting was I would give the full
credit to the media guys the newspaper
ones they have started this thing before
that there was no such TVs and things
they were totally dependent on such kind
of click baiting news so that their
newspaper can sell their magazines can
sell and eventually the same a lot of
click baiting was utilized by media
channels and thereafter the blog writers
and finally the youtubers surely it's
going to continue whether you like it or
not it's gonna continue it is not in the
hands of me or you it is gonna just work
like that so that's it for this video
and again I'm really sorry if I click
baited you but I Sayed it in the title
as well as in the thumbnail so that's it
for this video I'll surely catch you up
in the next video and Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
