again with another video and in this
video I'm gonna walk you through with
some amazing stuff I'm gonna walk you
through that how you can use a simple
text file and artificial intelligence to
generate any android app this is so fun
so all of you can follow me along here
so fire up your favorite text editor and
in my case I'm gonna be firing up the
sublime text so there we go here's my
sublime text
now notice down the feature here you
have to be absolutely precise while
you're writing all of that the first
thing is make sure you write is capital
so inspired by now this works in a
simple way first of all you have to
write inspired by and then the app name
through which your app is inspired
probably Twitter probably Facebook or
probably Instagram and we're gonna use
Instagram so Instagram and make sure the
eye is in the smaller case and N is in
the upper case so that's what your
Instagram is now the next thing that you
have to use is gonna be log in so how
many login feature you want to provide
so I'm gonna be using phone log in SMS
login and I'm also gonna be using
Facebook logins so Facebook again follow
the feature here that the second word
should be the caps so these are the two
features that I'm gonna be supporting
here and then comes up the database so
this is gonna be data base and for data
base we're gonna be using firebase so
fire base okay now make sure that you
pay a little bit of Inchon that the
second letter is caps in here but the
first letter in the first word is the
cap and that's it that's pretty much it
your app will be completely ready now we
have to fetch this file into artificial
intelligence so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna save this with a special
extension so save this and we're gonna
be saving it on my desktop and we're
gonna call the name exactly what you
want to call I want to call this as
Instagram and extension should be dot
dot AF all in caps and just save this
now once you save this file you have to
fetch it into artificial intelligence to
generate an app now this AF file is
supported by a special type of
artificial intelligence and name of
intelligence is this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
