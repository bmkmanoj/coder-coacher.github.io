again with another video now in this
video we are again gonna talk about the
programming and coding interviews so yes
recently in a couple of videos I'm
talking quite a lot about these
programming interviews common question
and we're gonna solve one exercise
regarding such issue here I'm not gonna
be keeping any surprise with you let's
just say that we are gonna learn how to
reverse a string any provided string
that is being given to you now it may
sound really simple to you but I have
seen surprisingly many candidates being
failed in this simple task and yes this
is a this is a very common task being
asked in almost all programming
interviews and the reason why most of
the people just fails he is I have no
particular reason that I have figured it
out actually either they have come like
unprepared for the interview yes they
might have build up projects they might
have done amazing internship and
everything but just like I always tell
you that there is a sequence there is a
format that you have to follow if you
are showing up an interview be prepared
for interview not a project if you are
showing up to take a project be prepared
for showing up a project as well so
there are different kind of things okay
so we are gonna learn how we can reverse
the string now also before we move on
and write this is a very simple code
first of all and before we move ahead
and write code for that let me tell you
one more thing which is interesting you
should know it now there are two kind of
interviews that happens and there are
two kind of companies looking for the
candidates the one is the domain seeker
which says hey we want to hire maybe a
Python developer and that's it and some
say we want to hire Java Script Dalibor
and that's it
it goes for all languages by the way so
there are these kinds of companies which
are specifically looking up for that hey
you should code in only this language
and that's it yes these kinds of
interviews to happen because let's just
say I have a product which is being
designed totally in Python why would I
hire a JavaScript developer but again
sometimes these companies as well as
other companies do understand that it's
not easy to find experienced and good
programmers in the particular language
that we are looking for so they also
understand that if a person is like have
done a couple of projects and stuff in
Python within a given amount of frame of
time he
we'll be able to learn JavaScript as
well or maybe in that case any other
language let's not just be specific
pointy about the programming language
here they are just all tool it's no big
deal and eventually you'll code you'll
get friendly in a Hall of them it's it's
a no big deal
so let us see how we can do a simple
question is being given to us that hey
write a simple program using functions
you have to reverse a string here okay
that's pretty cool and it should be
really fun I'm using a jsbin comm it's a
pretty famous website I have used in a
lot of my courses so you must be
familiar with that so in order to write
simple function we are gonna do write
function it's a pretty common thing in
JavaScript and let's just call this as
my rev for reverse of course it's gonna
take a parameter which is gonna be
string so there we go your function is
defined and now comes the important part
it's not about how you are dealing the
problem in the coding interviews most of
the time your function should run that's
it and of course there are like two or
three ways how you can handle this
particular problem at least I can say I
can figure out like three ways to handle
this problem at least the bigger and
experienced programmer that me might be
saying my five bra five ways to handle
this things or maybe six ways to handle
these things I can come up with like
three ways to handle this problem but
I'm gonna be using the simplest one so
let's just declare a constant here and
I'm gonna call this constant as my name
really bad idea and don't do that but
yeah we can do that now take this string
now there is no such function that you
can do just like reverse it's it's not
there unlucky for us but yes this kind
of function do exists in arrays so first
of all we have to split our string into
an array H thing so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna use a split function now
this is split function when you pass on
any parameter like divide my entire
string or split a string or a sentence
based on legislative you based on space
separated a string ArrayList I hope you
got that this is not too much confusing
but when you don't pass on any parameter
it's gonna take that string and split
every single character of that okay so
job number one is done now we have got
an array hit H and that said so now the
next thing that you can do is simply you
can revert
and that is pretty easy now you have got
the option to reverse if I can tagged it
correctly reverse it okay and you might
be thinking job done but not done the
approach that we are following here is
first of all take a string split that
into an array reverse that array and now
we have to join that again back into a
string and that shouldn't be a big deal
it's it's pretty easy and we are gonna
just return this now in order to return
we have to use a join function here
that's not a big deal and all I can say
is if they start join and I'm gonna join
them based on nothing so this gives us a
string back okay pretty good pretty fine
and then we can simply call this so my
Rev like this name and we're gonna pass
a simple string here let us call this as
hello and there we go now if I run this
string come on don't do this to me okay
I have to just console it so a console
dot log I can type that correctly
console dot log there we go and we can
have this so where is my console there
we go and if I run this I got a syntax
error okay I missed an S haha what what
I missed there okay run that and we can
see that there we go hello all l
whatever that is so you can just call it
just like that and you can say simply
like hello world and it's gonna just
reverse the everything that you have got
pretty easy pretty basic apart from that
the constant that I missed there really
bad but again let's just not worry about
it so this is just one approach how we
can reverse the string now similarly if
that would have been a Python interview
I could have deal that a really really
simple in the Python all I can say is
simply like Hello
and the easiest trick this is not
invented by me this is already around
the programming community everybody
knows it just to give you a context not
being designed by me okay
so what you can do you can use splicing
technique to reverse the string this is
the most common and I use it it's a
column column and the negative one we
are just leaving start N and we are
basing on the steps we are just
reversing it so it's a pretty common
thing you can just do that this is just
one of many ways of dealing these
problems okay I can just probably code
that into like many other programming
language but that doesn't make sense if
you have a command in any language Java
JavaScript Python PHP you should be able
to design such kind of easy function for
the interviewer this is the most common
thing that if somebody cannot do this
kind of task and has showed up for that
language interview probably he's taking
us like too lazy or he's not at all
prepared so go ahead and do exercise for
these kinds of things the important
thing is how you think with the
programming language it's not about
language it's not about how you're
dealing even with the situation the
major thing that the companies are
looking up for it should work it should
be done okay so pretty common exercise
and I hope this video is these videos
are helping for you if these all videos
are helping for you please notify them
