another video in this video we are going
to talk about WordPress now WordPress is
an amazing content management system and
a lot of big nurse especially in the web
developers and web design and all these
fields especially the web programmers
when they see the WordPress for the very
first time it is an overwhelming
situation and a lot of people think that
hey if WordPress can do all the things
and can install the website just within
second why even we are learning HTML CSS
JavaScript and PHP and also stuff we can
just use WordPress all the time and
that's it no it's not actually correct
and we are going to talk a little bit
more about what WordPress actually is
and when is the right time to jump into
WordPress now before I get started and
talk about the WordPress in itself I
would like to mention here that I have
handled more than eighty or ninety
clients in the WordPress and all those
clients had a different demand some
wanted to have optimized invoicing
systems I wanted to have a kind of a
built-in chat system in their website
some wanted to have just a plain simple
website with a contact form some wanted
to have a blog and all these complex
system like billing management system
and some some wanted to have kind of an
appointment system so yes I have handled
all such situation and based on that I
want to give you some really good advice
that when is the right time for the
bigness to get started into WordPress
first and foremost what is WordPress now
WordPress is a content management system
also known as CMS and this is a
beautiful thing now what happens in a
CMS you get an admin panel and you get a
front-end whenever the things are needed
to be updated you can simply go into
your admin panel can update your
navigation bar or the content and just
hit the publish or post and it's gonna
be appearing on the front end side now
this is so amazing and so good that when
the first time beginners see that hey
this is the WordPress I can just click
click click and install it and that's it
it's done it has shown me a basic
template I can just go into navigation
bar put an awesome menu and I can simply
design some ma
and all these things in there and that's
it my website is ready it becomes a very
important questions that Bignell usually
ask me that hey if WordPress is so
awesome and so amazing things are being
said on the internet for WordPress why
on this God's green earth we are even
learning HTML CSS JavaScript and all
these things when we can do all the
stuff in WordPress now I will answer all
of this but first let's talk about the
two types of WordPress yes there are two
types of WordPress
the first one is wordpress.com and the
second one is wordpress.org
now what press.com is for those people
who are not on this channel these this
is specially meant for those kinds of
people who are just actress or actor or
maybe a musician who just need a blog
and that's it they are not going to take
down any much detail in that they just
want a basic one-page website and a
contact form and that's it no much big
deal or maybe a writer who don't want to
bothered about intuitive systems by a
web designer and just want to write blog
but since you are on this channel I
don't expect this kind of thing for you
because you are there to provide some
solution for an in-depth problem that is
going to be taken up to you so you want
you are a programmer and wordpress.com
is most of the time not for you because
on the wordpress.com you don't have much
Liberty you have limited amount of
templates and there is a limited amount
of plugins that you can install and
that's all it you want more freedom you
want more Liberty and that's why you
jump on into wordpress.org in the
wordpress.org you get much more freedom
free compiled version of WordPress
entire CMS thing is being given to you
so that you can install it on to your
server and that's it you can install as
many plug-in as you wish you can
customize it however you need to be
customized and all these things but it
doesn't also take care of your security
anything because it's your own server
you have to manage everything on your
own
now this gives you a lot of creative
freedom and this is kind of a situation
where beginners usually fell up and they
say hey I have just put my files onto
server hit the click click Next again I
agree and all these things and that's it
my website was ready so the website is
ready where does the web developer jumps
in now web developer jumps in when they
is some unusual situation either in the
WordPress installation or client needs
some kind of extra feature in their
website now obviously I think you do
understand that nobody is going to pay
you for WordPress installation if he's
going to pay you maybe it's just a $5 or
$10 and that's it
nobody is going to pay you just for
installation of WordPress people pay you
because you are solving a typical
problem maybe you are adding a billing
system into the existing website or some
extra feature now how you are going to
code that feature most of the people
will say I'll just find a plug-in there
are hundreds of situation where the
specific plug-in that you are looking up
is not there or maybe you need to
customize an existing plugin or maybe
your client need the social icon at such
a specific place that it's not even
possible by any plug-in there now at
that particular situation your web
development skills comes handy if you
know and you are aware of HTML CSS
JavaScript and PHP yes there is PHP
involved quite a lot in WordPress then
only you are able to fulfill that
clients request and that is why client
pay you the more typical the situation
is going to be the more amount you're
going to get as simple as it sound so
this is really really super important
that big nurse who have no idea
absolutely about HTML CSS JavaScript and
PHP should not be jumping directly into
WordPress yes it looks so amazing from
the outside but when you try to just dig
up into files and explore the files it
becomes quite easily messy and for the
big nurse
it's a nightmare so for any big NER who
has absolutely no idea about HTML CSS
JavaScript and PHP I would never
recommend to get started with web
developer and especially what you are on
this channel that means you are quite
interested in programming getting
started with the basics and build
yourself a better programmer just by
handling the mouse and just clicking
here and there you don't become a better
programmer you become a better
programmer by simply writing some codes
maybe editing some code but most of the
time writing some curve so you need to
understand what the PHP is actually
doing there how you can customize the
CSS manually how he can remove some
footers some nav bars or maybe how you
can design some of the plugins as well
so no no it's not for beginners
okay this now we do understand what the
WordPress
and when is the right time to jump into
it so what are your thoughts then
actually a big nerd should jump into
WordPress now yes I think this is a good
question great question in fact I would
recommend that anybody who is just
having a front-end knowledge should
rarely jump into the WordPress and I
would say once you have completed your
HTML CSS JavaScript and boot stress
stuff mostly the front-end part then try
to take some of the PHP course now I do
have a PHP course as well the link is in
the description as well as on the screen
but again know are such hard feelings if
you take PHP learn from anywhere else as
well
the point is you should be aware of the
PHP as well
now with the PHP I would recommend you
to design a system which has an admin
panel and should have a login system the
login system is kind of a compulsory
here once you have a login system after
that designer system where user can
write just like two or three lines and
can hit a submit button and that exact
three or four lines should be available
on the front end when you visit a
website user should be able to write a
post delete a post as well as edit and
save a post if you are able to design
all this system on your own this is the
minimum requirement then I would say
that yes now you are ready to get
started with WordPress but again this is
the most minimum basic that I would say
the more you are going to explore the
WordPress I'm pretty sure once you have
that amount of PHP knowledge later on in
the future you will be learning quite a
lot and you will learn how you can
customize the themes customize all of
your plugins and everything so yes
that's kind of a basic overview of
WordPress and I hope you have got the
idea that is it good for beginners or
not yes it's good for beginners and no
it's not good for bigness again I have
tried to explain everything that I could
have explained for the WordPress so on a
whole story short don't be disheartened
when you see or your friend that hey I'm
able to just click click and install
WordPress and you are learning the HTML
CSS all these boring stuff no the time
will come up when the hard work what you
have spent the time in all those
front-end technology will come handy
your friend who has no idea about the
basics is going to stack up somewhere
and you are on this channel to become a
better
programmer and this advice will surely
make you one I hope you have enjoyed
this video so far and if you have liked
this video make sure you give a thumbs
