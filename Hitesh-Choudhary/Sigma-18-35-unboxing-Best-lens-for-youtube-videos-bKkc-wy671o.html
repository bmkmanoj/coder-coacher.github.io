with another video and you might have
already guessed what I'm gonna be doing
in this video it's there in the title so
I have been recording quite a lot in the
last year and in fact I have learned
pretty much so much about videos editing
filmmaking audios post-production a lot
of things and that is the reason why
you're so seeing so much stuff on the
youtubes so in this video we're gonna
talk about the lens change so I'm about
to upgrade my lens and let's just talk
about it so I have recently been filming
a lot of stuff and wherever I go
wherever I travel I'll look for the
moments which I want to capture or I
want to film them and this is not my
work this is not professionally I do
it's just an hobby for me everybody
should have a hobby so previously I have
been recording all of my stuff with this
guy and a lot of you might have already
seen this this is nifty 50 the 50mm for
the Canon and this is pretty awesome
lens and I have been filming on it quite
a lot in fact I'm very happy with that
for the indoors because it's a prime
lens it has got a few huge hole there
and it it absorbs a lot of light from it
and the reason why I used the prime lens
is because I most of the time shoots
indole and in the endo you have a
problem of the lighting I know a lot of
professional guys have a lot of lighting
setups and everything but I don't so I
like to use the prime lens so recently I
thought this mirror I'm gonna give one
gift to myself I do it quite a lot and
the box has finally came up so we're
gonna be doing an unboxing for the Nifty
prime lens and it's not a prime lens
actually it's a zoom lens but I call it
prime because a lot of people who are
saying about it so it's a sigma lens
let's just try it out so again I'm with
my unboxing knife and let's just try
that out and it's gonna be pretty
awesome I hope I don't hurt myself let
me just try that there we go nice
packaging I expect this from the Amazon
and they have always done a pretty good
job from it
let me just there we go okay a nice
packaging as you expect a lot of bubble
wraps let's just throw them out this is
the packaging oh this is quite awesome
so let's just explore this this is
pretty cool actually and of course they
should be doing something like this
because this is not just anything I'm
not ordering anything this is the lens
which needs here which needs protection
just like a baby so there we go this is
our Sigma 18 to 35 this is how it looks
and this is the most beautiful lens I
have found and every researcher every
unboxing every reviewer has said quite a
good words about it that's why I bought
it and this is my first experience with
this this is an art lens in case you
missed that there is an a there we go
the little a and Sigma has been doing
quite a good job let me just try to
focus that okay don't focus on my face
focus on this okay there we go
this is what we are having so let's just
unbox that quickly and do I have to do a
little bit more there we go and what you
see is I guess this is for warranty okay
I have to keep it don't through that if
you'll throw that that's gonna be a bad
thing and we have got some paper works
limitation of warranty limited warranty
blah blah stuff and Ellora a lot of
paperwork believe me it's a lot of
paperwork it's a lot of paperwork and
it's a lot of people but that's I can
use it for the poster of my room you can
see this is the whole newspaper a lot of
information a lot of language but maybe
someday I can use that or not and to our
valued customer okay
they are trying to sell out something
and there we go time the moment of the
truth box
nice box I'm gonna keep it so there we
go and now it's time to have it so this
is gonna be my box
and there we go okay looks awesome and
yep I was looking for this
I was thinking whether I had to buy a
hood or not but gladly they give you a
bird that's awesome
let's first unbox unwrap this hood and
yep this is what I was expecting a lot
of people think why the hoods come in a
different shape but it depends on what
kind of focal length you are using
because for the smaller one like almost
a 50 this is okay but for the longer
lengths which sees quite a lot at the
difference at the distance like 200 mm
they need the full giant ones the
circular ones but this is okay for the
50mm because it covers a lot of range
like that so this is good okay one thing
I can tell you from the very start this
is heavy this is heavy
okay the moment the moment you hold this
lens in your hand you can immediately
see and can tell that this is something
awesome with the build quality compared
to the nifty 50 which is very plasticy
and this is very plastic ii made and
this is this is extremely something
believe me this this is heavy extremely
heavy maybe I need to buy a new tripod
because I believe that my tripod may be
able to handle this a lot because I'm
using a very cheap one a very cheap I
found that pretty cheap one I guess I
have to
shift to something like Manfred or
something oh my goodness glass that is
some serious glass there and there we go
I may open it later on because I don't
want to damage it this is pretty costly
stuff and rings are pretty sturdy now I
can tell you if somebody is looking for
the manual focus or something this is
pretty sturdy zoom and one thing even
notice immediately there there is
nothing which zooms out there like my
this lens which is 18 to 135 kit lens
with the 70d this is actually something
which you wear you can see when you zoom
it it comes and pop of it it's a big
lens but this guy doesn't pops even an
inch of centimeter there it's just
awesome and the Rings rings are so tight
this is so sturdy
believe me this is this is one thing and
link the ring had got a pretty much
distance to cover to focus and
everything
believe that's a good thing another
professional photographer here but
believe me the quality is gonna be super
awesome because I don't have much of the
lights here and to shoot good stuff we
all know we need a few things one of
them is glass and another thing is light
that's all what we need to shoot awesome
videos so let's just wrap this up and I
hope you enjoyed the unboxing experience
for sure I'll be making a review of how
I like the lens one thing I can tell you
it's a heavy study built and a lot of
youtubers are using it and none of them
actually had said that I have recreated
the purchase so this is pretty awesome
thing worth an investment but it's not
for everybody because it's a little bit
heavy on the pricing range
I'll link down below all the pricing
range that are about but again this is
not anything sponsored by anyone I just
bought it kind of a new your gift for
myself for my hobby you should spend a
little bit time and you should spend a
little bit money on yourself as well
whether you are buying something for
yourself just go ahead don't just work
there because it's gonna be boring just
give yourself some time and try out with
that so with this this was a quick
unboxing of the Sigma 18 to 35 lens and
maybe in the future video will rock on
onto a review that how I like the lens
but we will do it later on till then
I'll catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
