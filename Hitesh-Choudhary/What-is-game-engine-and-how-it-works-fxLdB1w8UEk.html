with another video so we are discussing
a little bit about the game development
in case you haven't watched the previous
video go ahead and watch the previous
video where I have talked about how you
can get started with a game development
so in this video we'll be talking about
what actually is a game engine and few
components that game engine take care
for ourself so this is gonna be a pretty
interesting movie let's get started so
before I go ahead and discuss about what
game engine is and what does for us I
have to go a little bit back and talk
about how computers and how mobile phone
works and especially the operating
system for that now let's talk about the
computers at the soul heart of the
computer if I just say that computer
just work on zeros and 1 or simply the
low voltage or high voltage you can
understand that that is pretty obvious
we have learned that in the school or
maybe high school as well but what would
be typical if I would say hey this is
the Machine which works on high voltage
and low voltage and all you have to do
is write a hello world there or just
play a movie there I know this is going
to be a pretty difficult task but we all
the time designs such apps and it is so
much easy now with the abstraction layer
that has been created for us so that we
can design some cool players like video
a video LAN or VLC or maybe a QuickTime
Player and everything like that and
similarly if I go on to the mobile if I
give you some chips and say hey you know
what you have to utilize camera with
that but look how so much easy it is to
code an app in Android or iOS or Windows
whatever it may be that you just have a
simple device in your hand and with some
touchscreen and you are able to open a
microphone or maybe a camera or maybe a
GPS setting so the layer of abstraction
is so much good now you might be
wondering why I am saying all of these
things I'm just saying all of this to
set a stage for you now a lot of people
think that game designing would be so
much daunting it much it must be so much
scary but it's not actually it's rather
much more simple what makes it simple is
just like in the Android it's the
Android operating system on which you
can design your app similarly we do have
some game engines which
makes our job so much easier but again
it's again a rather bit more advanced
than the app development but again it's
much more simpler with the help of game
engines so what are those game engines
now game engines are simply an abstract
layer which handles a lot of tasks for
you like for example inputs physics
networking a lot of things which we'll
be discussing in this video so what are
the popular game engines now some of
them are like up the cry engine or the
source engine or the indie game
developers favorite unity3d these are
some game engines which you can utilize
but again before decide deciding the
best game engine for yourself one tip I
would like to give yourself now make
sure that you don't look for the game
that was designed in that engine for
example Far Cry might be designed in the
cry engine and you might be saying hey
I'm gonna design a Call of Duty game I'm
gonna choose this engine no you should
not be doing that because most of the
engines are really specialized in one or
the other thing but most of them are
cold-heartedly same and for your first
game or that I would like to call as an
beta game it is completely okay to go
with any engine but make sure that you
understand the pricing of that game
engine some of them are in fact most of
them are completely paid so you have to
pay a little bit of the money to use
this game engines but again some do have
other payment options like for example
unity3d has a very interesting gaming
and rather pricing structure so with
that if you aren't more than $10,000
then you have to pay certain amount to
the unity3d but again we can talk about
the pricing structure later on but this
should be your first point because you
are about to design a crucial game and
you have to stuck with your game engine
ok quite a lot of stuff with that now
let's go ahead and talk a little bit
about what kind of things the game
engine handles for yourself now the
first thing that the game engine does is
handling the event and the polling that
is just the input so for example you
might be having a lot of input when you
play the game for example you have
keyboards you have Mouse your joystick
access changes a little bit
and just like that so we use majorly a
mapping table now all of the game engine
call that with a different names but
usually it's the mapping table in which
certain kind of input are injected and
based on that input we just utilize what
would be the position of the player or
what would be the axis that we you have
to rotate or do we have the shot a fire
or we have to trigger a some script to
trigger the shot or maybe reload the
stuff and just like that now this is all
handled in the input stuff and again we
don't have to worry a lot about that we
just have to call a function or do a
quick click and everything is being
handled by the game engine itself the
next thing that game engine handles for
ourselves is the 3d graphics now I'm not
just talking about the 3d model that you
have created in the Photoshop but yes
somewhat like that now most of the
rendering work of the graphic is done
using some advanced and modern tools
like like Maya or maybe blender again
blender is free and Maya is somewhat
paid but again we will go may-maybe we
can go much more in depth about the
graphics and everything but again it's a
little bit different graphics than what
you might be designing in the paint and
everything yes it heavily uses the
Photoshop but again the rendering is
pretty much important and that is why
you see the 3d games and you can rotate
your guns pretty much here and there and
just like this room everything is being
created and rendered next thing that our
game engine handle for ourselves is the
sound engine now most of the game engine
do come up with a built-in sound engine
but the best part about the sound engine
is you don't have to worry about
anything because in the usual
programming stuff when the one sound
actually ends then your next line of
code is gonna be working otherwise we
have to use multi-threading but again
game engine handles all of such things
without a hassle and of course nobody
likes a game of call of duty without the
nice gunshot sounds or maybe the grumpy
voice that they gave again our sound is
the most important part of a game it
might be simple cling or maybe a simple
grumpy voice but again having sound in
your game is the most important part
next let's talk about the physics
is one of the most important part in the
game engine
now when you design your game you might
be having a plane or maybe a ball and
you want to drop the ball on the plane
now it's not that easy because you have
just created an image or a graphic which
have no idea our with our real-world
physics so we have to apply a lot of
behaviors or physics to that plane or to
that ball we have to say you had a solid
object nobody should pass by through it
you should follow the gravity as well
you should follow the collision as well
again we don't have to worry much about
them it's just a matter of clicks or
calling a few scripts and game engine
handles all of us all of these things
for us now it's somewhat similar to like
calling a microphone like if you want to
call the microphone actions you just to
call it WebKit or just import some
things and calling audio videos and
that's it you have called the microphone
similarly we have to utilize the physics
and again the more complex the physics
is and more adjustable it is to the
graphics then the game would be much
better the next part of the game is
nowadays networking now luckily for us
we don't have to call up any servers or
anything game engine again handles
everything in the networking part as
well now most of us like to play call of
duty or maybe counter-strike maybe your
friend is sitting in the States you are
in the London and you want to play the
game pin him again networking helps us
with that now most of the engine
nowadays which are coming and in fact in
the recent updates for all of the engine
I can say almost 90% or maybe all of
them are coming up with the networking
capabilities moving put to the next part
that is the GUI now you might be
thinking we already having a graphics
and talks about I talked about that but
again a graphic or GUI is a little bit
different now the menus that you see on
the game are like choosing the options
and everything are usually designed in
the game itself previously it used to be
somewhat like the windows advantage or
DirectX advantage but now you feel just
right in the game when selecting all
those options so the nasty menu bars and
the cross buttons are now completely
modifiable whether the game engine
itself and that gives us a lot of
advantage
of designing the game and you just
always feel right at the home in the
game itself now last but not the least
the script now you might be hesitant
with the programming but game
development cannot be fulfilled without
learning some programming skills now I
have also discussed in the previous
movie that if you already know Swift or
something then you can completely move
directly in the 2d gaming's and just
like that and we have also discussed
previously how we can move on to the
windows and other stuff let's not talk
about that right now if you want to
really watch that go ahead watch the
previous movie but again scripts are
really the most important part and in
fact most of the behaviors that you add
to your objects like your machine can
man or maybe a plane maybe your balls
are everything done by scripting 'he's
not most of them but really technically
it's most of them or all of them but you
don't have to very much about that there
are a lot of functions which you which
are already built up for you you just
have to call them modify a few variables
and there you go so in fact most of the
behaviors that you would be adding would
be highly based on your game engines and
again some game engines like unity use
c-sharp some use others some use others
so there is no such one thing that you
really should be focusing like I'm gonna
be learning Python and I'm gonna be
designing a game yes you can but I think
you would be much more satisfied by the
decision and choosing a language once
you do a little bit research about your
specific game engine what you're looking
for and based on that then you can focus
up on the programming or where you want
to go for example as I have said quite a
number of times you have to learn C
sharp or the unity and you can design
some of the quite good games in the
JavaScript as well but most of them are
too DS so again do a little bit of
research now you have plethora of
knowledge about the game development I
think you would be pretty happy with
that
so go ahead find out your favorite
engine have a little bit research on it
find out what programming language you
can utilize to code in that particular
game engine is it free is it not and
what you will be having with that so
