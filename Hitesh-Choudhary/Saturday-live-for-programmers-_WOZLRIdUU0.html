share back again the other Saturday life
a life a programmer by a programmer
trying to talk about tech stuff so I
hope everybody can listen to me and can
see me as well life is looking pretty
good so hey Raj hey sambar hey son Gabe
hey Mon hey Raghuveer Singh hunt watch a
hacker artful J hey every anime pro yo
man everything I mean any April yo man
why so like it should be like even your
hand not on my hand everything is
working fine I can see the screen is
going pretty darn good
so echo echo to you as well yes sir some
echo problems a memo Cobian thank you so
much for the support I love that thank
you so much you are doing a super chat
thank you so much so hope you are doing
pretty good we missed last Saturday life
because I was on a travel and I tried to
go light there and it was a pretty like
not so good Internet there so I suffered
internet that is you know it's not
really good so that's why I miss the lie
but we are back again but there is some
ego problem let me try what is the ego
problem okay so now it's not the sound
is around against the surrounding
actually this mic is really darn good
we are looking forward to grab some of
the more life so that I can do bold life
this microphone is actually yes it has
some resonance issues this is like can I
products as well very soon we're gonna
get rid of that ego issues problem and
okay
so I hope
okay so I hope it is pretty good you can
ask you a question as well
ah good that is so traffic I need your
help sir or how can I help
only your back yes I am finally back
this is pretty good you can turn on your
echo on your system if you're hearing
that on the speakers because this mic is
pretty darn good and eco is very bad
okay voice isn't clear how's that even
possible
okay let me try to remove that a little
bit how's that eco is still a problem
okay
yet Yeti this is blue Yeti we're
spreading two times okay that is really
bad issue okay let's try some different
all you set up as well let's try that I
hope we are setting this up so
are you invert
okay let's try that
okay
and
okay so
you
okay so can you hear me now
I'm not pretty sure that you can hear me
now
okay
okay please continue can you hear me now
the sound is better now or not clear now
good good good I think speaker let me
know if the sound is good now because we
are not using any speaker it's my
inbuilt speakers in my direct iMac so
it's good okay that is awesome if the
sound is pretty good we are all good
okay if you give the thumbs-up you said
it's okay then we are all good and yes I
know the audio the video is not so
amazing because I'm using my webcam for
this for this HD but surely very soon we
are going to turn that into DSLR as well
so it's perfect now thank you so much
thank you so much other video is a
little bit blurry yes I know this is
just a webcam
okay to the
question is is gaming laptop good for
program and my answer is yes it is
because you know if you are moving on to
the programming and if you are doing
just the web development thing kind of a
basic stuff for fronting any laptop is
good but when you come on to things like
when you want to have Android things or
maybe you want to design some games you
want to go for unity then you need high
processing power and in that case a
gaming laptop do really perform really
really amazing so yes gaming laptops
especially due to their graphic cards
are amazing so how is your trip sir the
trip is a amazing ship O'Neill hey
Siobhan in first of all how are you
doing I I see all of your comments every
single day so yes the trip was amazing a
little bit hurry
in the March also I do have right now
eight invitation within India of course
I'm not going abroad in the March at
least so I do have eight invitation as
of now and I really wanted to go all of
the places but I have something amazing
work for all of you guys which I'm doing
right now but I'm just picking up two
invitation of them one is in the vit
velor I will be there and there is one
more I'm talking to them I I really have
a very short time to visit and planning
so that I can just go there and can same
day I can come back so there we go let's
pick up another question selenium or
scrappy for web scraping selenium is not
so good for web scraping it's not being
designed for that it's being designed
moreover for testing yes
raping can be done with selenium but I
don't recommend that let's just keep the
selenium for the testing part and just
keep the scrapy for the web scraping
react native versus emery now both are
amazing I won't say that one is bad one
is good but since it depends heavily on
what kind of stack or technology stack
you really want to go in if you are
already into the dotnet stack it makes
sense to go into the xamarin but if you
are not into the dotnet stack then it
makes much more sense for you to switch
into react native so there you go you
got your answer
so show epic on say is how to program
just visit learn code online dot in
that's the website letter news yes I
covered recently in today's video a
flutter a little bit things about the
flutter and in fact I am looking deep
into the dart language I found it
amazingly easy and in fact I don't think
it will take like more than three or
four days to learn that programming
language if you wish we can make videos
on flutter as well I found that
amazingly super simple easy language its
initial thoughts are it's kind of okay
there is a I use days I use my head
Rhodri I'm sorry if I butchered your
name I use are you doing thank you so
much for the super chat hello sir love
your videos thank you thank you thank
you so much the flutter is amazing and
by the initial look of the dart
programming language what are my initial
thoughts I think that it's super easy
it's kind of a hybrid of Java and
JavaScript this is what I felt an
initial level it's not and there is a
question make a video on distraction due
to girls this is the most various
comment I have ever seen distraction due
to girls come on man sometimes we are
especially funny
says okay why I'm not in focus hey come
on get me in focus okay now it's good
how can I work with you we are planning
for are working with me very soon we are
going to focus on that probably in let's
just say what time stamp I can give to
you probably by the April end or the
next month then April or we are planning
so that some people can join me and can
work with me and can help me in building
of the next big things which we are
building up for a variety of clients and
very soon I'll ask for interns you will
have to come to my studio it's not a big
studio but it's cool and you can just
join me here I like your beard
thank you so much take some time to
manage this but I like it make a video
on dark web probably I can link you to
another good channel who is making good
videos on dark web so probably I'll link
you that
anymore course our content for the
Django project
I cannot say because you know because of
the pricing that we keep for the courses
we like to keep them short as well as
input because you know to create a big
course you need some time and some
efforts need to be there which needs to
be paid as well so as of now we are not
planning to include any one big project
into the Django course but definitely
you cannot say much about the future I
always like to surprise you guys how to
learn programming without burning out I
don't know what do you mean by burning
out but if you mean at the hard-working
thing there there's an exception so this
is how it goes and it Tao works also
give this video a thumbs up if you are
watching this
okay so hacker rod says thank you so
much for the shout out
super shared as well hey a little
confused I am 15 year old and I'm
actually in information security that's
actually really good you have started
really good early I have got some
bounties with some site like freelancer
that is amazing at fifteen year old you
are doing such things I think you are at
a very right track but I'm confused okay
where is that
but I'm but I'm confused that if I
should go with this or do programming in
future thanks okay so let's talk about
this this is an interesting subject now
you are already into the information
security and honestly if you'll ask me I
will say that a hacker is a hacker if he
knows a lot about system and if you
probably might have learned about these
things as well on top of that if you
want to add something
a hacker becomes an amazing hacker when
he knows more about the system like how
nodejs works are probably how the MySQL
database work or how the Postgres
database to work and these are important
thing because obviously you know the SQL
injection that he used to do a very
earlier in like ten years ago by single
code and all of that are not at all
working now because technology has
changed and now firebase and Postgres
are there
the programming is always advantageous
to all those people who know a little
bit about hacking skill so I would
recommend you to just keep your hacking
skills there because you are already
amazing in that and you are getting some
freelancing bug bounties and all of that
so keep it that as a practice stuff but
also side by side learn programming this
is going to give you an extra additional
feature which nobody can match and
eventually within just five years or six
years you're gonna be coming in no match
so I would say just keep going you are
onto a very right track but don't get
distracted by anything you're already
performing really amazing in hacking
also perform really good in programming
and you will become like unmatched
successful person I'm pretty sure about
that so just keep in loop I'm really
positive about here
okay so let's pick up more questions
bootstrap is oz awesome but I want to
know disadvantage of bootstrap ah I
would call this tiling is a little bit
disadvantage of bootstrap not much not
much but you know sometimes hacker Raj
says thank you thank you so much you can
ask more questions the more advantage
the disadvantage that I see about the
bootstrap is the styling because
sometimes we become a little bit lazy
and the font themes and the color scheme
that is there on the bootstrap sometime
it's kind of a common thing apart from
then I don't think any downside of the
bootstrap it's amazing it's good it's
it's not much also sometimes there are
so many unnecessary code that is there
on your website which shouldn't be there
but hey who wants to write that much of
the CSS that is also kind of a shout out
my name is Saki dargah dargah da ki
darga I hope I pronounced that right
okay so high-paced tells me something
about - I'm not much aware about the -
in spite and learn - huh is Python hard
to learn no it's not it's super easy
it's super comfortable I think it's one
of the very first language which people
are now putting up there in the college
curriculum as well because super easy to
learn
know how to become full-stack developer
visit learn code online . --an take
complete front-end developer bootcamp
then he can take either react.js or PHP
or Django and there we go
you got your front-end and back-end so
full stack developer there you go dude
there is a question by a dead man if
you're already dead how can you ask the
questions anyways dude is getting ok it
just okay here it is dude is getting a
project work as a freelancer a tough job
well I'm planning to be a freelancer
rather than working for a company after
my college at initial days it's tough
and it requires a good portfolio it all
depends on your portfolio because if a
client is coming to you you have no star
ratings and get star rating from your
friends or maybe from your family just a
couple of good stars so that there is
nothing in the portfolio right now so
get something there are tricky ways to
do it but at least your level but make
sure you do that and after that line 2
requires portfolio a big portfolio that
hey if I'm giving this project to this
person he can do it so the stronger the
portfolio you are going to have it's
gonna be easier for you to have
freelancing client let me take my
example at initial days I didn't had
portfolio I bid it for like a week they
didn't got in a even a single project
then I said enough of this I'm gonna
make my own projects I created like six
or seven websites big scale once
uploaded them on my personal website and
whenever I was bidding now I was giving
the links of these website client got
really impressed and gave me projects
was forwarding them too few years
eventually my world my name got out in
the market that yes this guy can do
projects and even can lead our teams as
well and things got really good from
that and after starting the YouTube
channel and showing that yes I can write
code things are really amazing now so
just wanted to tell you dudas game says
how to become full stack Android
developer now first and foremost in
order to become an Android developer you
need to brush up your java skills as
well as Kotlin skill as well a little
bit but full-stack simply means that you
are storing things in the database as
well now for Android for a big nerd
level the great choice
ire bass and there's no surprise you can
also have parts being hosted on AWS as
well but the initial choice should be
firebase but onto a production level
there are some times you might want to
use api's through MySQL the one thing
that I would like to say here is make
sure you are able to handle any kind of
API just make a lot of project to api's
because what will happen when you'll be
working as a full stack developer on
Android there is going to be a guy on
the database who is going to fetch the
data to you and he's going to be using
the APS whether that's in MySQL or
Postgres the one advice when good advice
is make sure you can handle any kind of
API and can read documentation as well
reading documentation is kind of a part
of programming so make sure you do that
that's how you become full stack
developer and eventually you are going
to learn a lot while doing the project
so do a lot of projects okay let's pick
up more questions okay where can we have
more questions
sometimes I even miss the Super Shot I
need to pick up some alarm system or
something
okay what do we expect from engineering
final year students how to get job in
big companies now expectation from a
finally an engineering student is
personally my expectation is pretty big
I expect that you are aware about the
latest tech should not be able to code
in most of them but you are still should
be able to answer the question when
somebody says do you know something
about react native and you should say
yes I am aware of it but I cannot code
in that's fine but you should be aware
about the latest tech what is react
native xamarin and all these stuffs you
should be really good in your data
structure and algorithms as well if I
just say hey write a program or a bubble
sort or maybe for a merge sort you
should be able to write that choice of
language is totally on you
I don't blame for the picking up of the
particular language it can be Python
Java C++ even C whatever that is because
it's easier to train a person who knows
how to build a logic in any language and
it's so much harder to train a person
who just don't know even how to build
logics and he knows a programming
language so for me personally you should
be able to build logics that's how how
to style websites like CSS but writing
less CSS
please do a video on so if to push
notification yes we are planning to
launch a couple of video series on
YouTube on in-app purchases as well
we're gonna do that very soon in
thirty-year-old learn programming uh in
my last bootcamp up last like last last
bootcamp there was a person who was 42
and I have a youtube video of one guy
who was from London beautiful town and
he started learning programming and web
designing at the age of like I guess
what t5 or something so you are younger
than him so definitely you can start
programming
okay so let's pick up when it comes to
logic please answer how to improve it
logic is something that eventually comes
and you need to learn how to break down
these problems probably I'll launch a
couple of videos on the YouTube about
building the logics and breaking a
bigger problem into the smaller one I
probably it will give you some idea so
I'll try that and it comes eventually by
building a lot of projects and
eventually it's not it's not a thing
that you can teach somebody that this is
how all the ways the logic works now
it's not everybody just sees the logic
in a different way this is what makes
programming unique so yeah
okay there's an interesting question by
partito she says Adam vs vs code for web
development personally have a big fan of
Adam I tried to use vs code it's okay
but some some hot I feel that sublime
text and Adam is the way I'm gonna go I
don't really like this you know vs code
as of now it's it's good really it's
really fast performing really well but I
think I'm comfortable more on sublime
text and Adam as of now
so confused between PHP or node or
back-end I would say go for Django
because it's a good start for a back-end
if anybody who is getting started in
back-end he should be really starting
from Django it's rather easier it's not
like one is bad one is good but Django
is rather much more easier okay
and why the connection okay it's live
now back again
okay so we are having some issues why
Wi-Fi Internet
okay so I hope I am back Internet just
cling to their you're using pycharm also
Kaushik Paul says are you using pycharm
also yes I use pycharm as well but most
of the time I find myself using mostly
Adam even for the Python as well as well
as I use a Jupiter notebook mostly for
personal stuff the notebook is much
easier for me for the teaching purposes
so that's why I use that own gap now
PhoneGap is over don't invest your time
in PhoneGap at least don't do that
there are better options than PhoneGap
so look forward for that
so let's pick up more questions
so a a lot of people are watching here
almost 400 so pretty good
so let's pick up more questions hello
from Iran I thank you so much
lovely country Iran I'm planning to
visit that
has already learned the basics of Python
how much time will it take to learn a
web development with Django so if you're
already comfortable with once to hit
actually was already comfortable with
Python it finished my Django course
within three days so imagine just three
days and now you are a pretty decent
intermediate level in Django within
three days so that's what makes the
course is amazing within three days you
can almost get on to intermediate level
at Django so it depends on everybody's
learning capability and how much time
you can invest I really appreciate that
guy who covered up everything and showed
me some projects as well within just
three days so that's kind of a really
good achievement I would say okay please
make a video okay it's it's gone in
India which is better to learn iOS or
Android both demand are pretty high all
companies really like to go for both so
there's the demand for both I guess
developer gets a little bit higher paid
because only a few people knows iOS
development so it's a little bit higher
side Android is little bit less but not
there's not much difference it all
depends on how was she learning learn to
challenging yes machine learning is
little bit challenging we recently did a
project on machine learning about a
making kind of a suggestive Chad bot app
it was good pretty tough I would say I
would agree there it was pretty good
okay so let's pick up more questions
okay hello from Naples hello how are you
doing
what is Adam used for Adam is an editor
or rather an IDE not IDE its editor but
it can be converted into it almost an
IDE you can use web development you can
learn Python you can learn Java you can
do a tons of stuff in Adam it is the
place where you write the code okay and
cheers for iced tea
okay there's an interesting question
that says and a commerce student can
learn programming of course you can
learn and you can design free amazing
apps I remember in one of the conference
I met a programmer who was from totally
a commerce background and he designed an
app to manage all the things about your
daily expenses and picking up things
from your SMS about your money sms's and
all these things data and everything it
was pretty amazing honestly I can never
build an app like that because it uses
so much of the mathematics and Excel
formulas that it would take me a help
from my friends to make such kind of
apps so much of the division calculation
and all of these things only a commerce
student would have achieved that so yes
everybody can't learn programming Denise
says I'm interested to learn mean stack
how to start what to learn first a of
mean where I will find good courses okay
so if you want to go into the angular
stack I would recommend you to start
with the node I know it's at the very
end of the end but the first good step
is to start with N or M at is Mongo you
don't need to spend much of the time
because it's rather easier so start with
the node J s and then you can move to
the angular and automatically the 'part
and the M part will be covered there so
start with the node GS and then move on
to the M EA part ok means yes the mean
stack is gonna be a little bit tough for
you but again if you are a total big
nerd let me also walk you through for
that as well start with the JavaScript
then go for JavaScript es6 syntax and
then you can go for a node and then you
can take a little bit look on the
MongoDB and then you can move to angular
this honestly would be my approach if I
would be learning it from the very
scratch but again you can endeavor here
and there mix up the things but this
would be an ideal way to go for the main
stack okay I hope this answers your
question donation thank you so much for
the super chat I love you guys
if anybody is of 11 to code okay that
was an interesting question if anybody
is of 11 I hope you're talking about age
to code what is it guidelines for Java I
have no idea what you really want to ask
there okay so then what is the value of
I usually avoid these questions what is
the value of degree from college I am
very bad at learning who made computer
but I have true interest in programming
and I T let me tell you honestly I am
from an engineering background and I did
my engineering in electronics and
communication not even at a single place
I have been invited at iit bombay some
of the foreign university is london
university and a couple of other
universities as well i have been invited
there i have went to variety of IITs and
nit s not even at a single place i have
shown my degree there so our degrees i
have multiple so i would honestly say
that if a project is good if your skills
are amazing it doesn't really matter
what kind of degree you have but this
doesn't mean you should drop out or do
something i don't really appreciate that
but if you're dropping out or doing
something make sure you are fully
responsible for that so take that in
mind and yes
all that depends on what are your skills
and how hard you are ready to work for
so make sure you do that
okay there are a lot of big questions
hello me to an EC student hey Ravi th
how are you I'm from a quarry ec
electronics and communication and read
all those things all about electronic
circuit the dears day all these digital
circuits everything has told all of that
and even in my masters also we had all
these subjects about noodle networks
modern compiler design machine learning
AI amazing mathematics in the if you
know the PhD the very first subject is
your mathematics and you have to study
about correlation main mode median
I can't even them a lot yes and I
enjoyed rather my master's curriculum as
compared to my electronics because I had
the subjects like C C++ Java data
structure all of these subjects I
studied but I enjoyed my Master's
curriculum more because the things like
building up neural networks and all
these things were amazing I I enjoyed
every single day of it
so
uh are you
okay it's going really fast now in which
company you are I am in learned code
online in corporation registered in
Delaware United States I am working here
say my name hey Bobby Shrivastav how are
you hope you are doing good are you
taking part in Rajasthan IT day health
on me I haven't been invited in
Rajasthan IT day but I have been invited
to Bhuvaneshwari
so I'll be going there I haven't got an
invite for Rajasthan IT day if they are
celebrating anything like that I would
be loved to be a part of it but no
invitation
I'm thinking to buy an iMac please tell
about your IMAX fax my iMac is 27-inch
and I guess it has yes it has 32 gigs of
ram and it's a maxed out whatever that
was available like 2 TB of SSD these are
the configuration let me check what are
the other configuration that I can show
to you so I have like a 2 TB of storage
yes it's 32 gigs of memory being
installed here and it's
I 5 processor so it's pretty good pretty
decent
another question I have created thank
you so much kalpesh for the super chat
and let's pick up his question I have
created a general business app in
Android and iOS but how can I present
and market it I'm not able to create
proper demo video for it as well I can
help you with that because a lot of you
don't know because previously coming
onto the YouTube I was doing such kind
of apps videos and website videos and
that's why I'm so good in making these
videos and tutorials I used to do that
for a variety of people so probably you
can drop me a mail at Hettich at the
rate he thre calm about your app link
whatever that is and I can make a video
for you which is like marketing video
for that so let's just talk about on
this email I do that and do that pretty
good I am not getting much time but I
really wanted to do some kind of that
similar videos for learn code online app
as well very soon I'll do that
okay for machine learning is Python
mandatory absolutely either you have to
pick one language that can be either
Python or can be R both are great use
any one of them I would honestly prefer
Python if it would be if it would be me
but it's totally your choice but pick
any one language either Python or R
without that you cannot move further how
are you gonna code if you don't know the
programming language
oh there is a good question by the dart
does
is data scientist a progressing part of
computer science data scientist and this
all these things like data mining and
data science all these used to be a part
of masters in computer science I did
study that during my Master's but now
it's kind of an independent thing that
you can learn even during your
bachelor's and things so yes it is
growing pretty good apps like uber when
they say that your driver is will arrive
in three minutes these are all being
calculated using machine learning your
Google Maps your pay ta not pay diem
your paper fraud detection all of these
things uses machine learning and before
the word machine learning was so popular
all of these things were using that at
that time it was called as data mining
and sentimental and analysis all these
things were already there now it's a
little bit more popular that's pretty
much it
okay out
with react native I would recommend to
go ahead check out my react native
front-end course at learned code online
dot M who just says you are looking so
cute thank you so much I appreciate that
because says Baba bhai Prakash how to
learn full stack development from Lehren
code online dot n the first step is to
take front-end development course the
second step would be to take django
course that's it and you are almost
there
buddy says I am really bad in maths does
it matter uh yes and no if you're
looking forward to do like web
development math is not gonna be much
useful apart from calculating a few
pixel subtracting them adding them
calculating the gutter width there here
and there that's pretty much it just
addition subtraction that said but if
you're looking forward to going to
machine learning or data science you
shouldn't try that because you'll be
finding a lot of main mode correlations
and all these things like machine
learning is all about finding code
relations and he will be doing that a
lot so if they're not that much amazing
in maths especially that so avoid that
machine learning part but yes you can be
programmer you can go into web
development that would be super easy for
you you can also go into Android and iOS
as well the math is there a little bit
but not much you know you won't be
feeling much difference
I can for react native react native is
compatible with almost all tech you can
go for firebase MongoDB Postgres
whatever you like it just clicks
everywhere almost will be coming to
smart India hackathon in adapt or again
not being invited yet if you would like
to invite me I email is already open for
everyone to invite me I'd love to talk
on these conferences meet people and it
just improves my network and I'm finding
bigger audience I love that
okay so
testing is very sit testing is better or
development better I'm personally a
developer I like more over development
things so I prefer development but it's
not like testing is should be avoided or
things testing is also good I prefer
development
okay so there is a good where is it
there was something print or something I
just lost it more about flutter yes we
are going to talk a little bit more
about flutter it's an interesting topic
any plans for Bengaluru I know Bengaluru
is not being planned
I guess till May I am avoiding I am
avoiding my travels because I am
designing something really amazing you
know all the things are here I just to
tell you as some tablets and stuff are
here there's a lot of work going on and
I'm pretty sure some big things needs to
be done so that's why I'm avoiding that
somebody says why PHP is dying it's not
it's not it's not dying it's nobody on
the lying bed up there so yes
okay so let's pick up more question
Chennai yes I will be in Chennai in vit
Albion velor not exactly Chennai but
I'll be in velour
beeper says please come to Bangalore
sometime I will be I used to come
Bangalore quite frequently but nowadays
I'm not coming to Mangalore I really
like to be in Bangalore because the
weather is awesome and I have lots of
friends and subscribers as well in
Bangalore I would love to visit
Bangalore's in fact whenever I visit
Bangla I meet a lot of subscribers here
and there so Bangalore is like one of my
favorite cities I like to visit there
the food is awesome everywhere every
restaurant is amazing so definitely I
love to visit lands are not getting well
for Bangalore but I would like to visit
lunch creation says vit waiting yes I am
about to come vit and probably I'll
share a couple of my existing projects
which I am working on in vit as well I'm
planning to show that I need to take
permissions so that I can share these
things on a public stage definitely I'll
try to do that
ah good doo-dah say sir you are great
thank you so much
how should I prepare for a cyber career
in cybersecurity respect respect thank
you so much we do now preparing for
cybersecurity now let me tell you
something which is arguably nobody is
going to say to you the first thing is
of course you need to have a great
knowledge and of course don't forget to
hit your OWA SP top ten pretty nice and
thoroughly also if you want to get jobs
and everything this is the one thing
which is controversial a lot of people
are going to blame me but you need to do
a really bad certification I'm not going
to name it it's really popular or
hackers because a lot of firms are
hiring based on that so if you want to
get your resume a being evaluated or
being picked up that certification needs
to be there but again make sure you
learn a lot and of course do a lot of
these bug hunting's as well this is
amazing experience as well as good
money-making thing as well to start with
that that's a good thing
your awesome does AI have good future in
India yeah yep it will take a little bit
time but it is going on a right track I
have been in touch with a couple of
Dean's
of universities and their plans for the
upcoming like two or three years are
amazing for AI and machine learning I'm
really happy with that so yes these are
all good things
future of react native receive Kumar
says you mean yes I mean exactly that
you got that future of react native
optimistic fully optimistic I used that
for like in last like six months I have
used like three or four projects for
projects in react native all of them are
working amazing so amazing react native
I loved your office this is my office
surrounding all of you really colorful
and it's awesome
where to find shared hosting for nodejs
no GS hosting is expensive little bit
but I would say Heroku is like the best
one
okay explain the gray t-shirt this is a
great t-shirt there's the explanation
maybe someday maybe ten miss Janice is a
net ocean evil you got a tough name man
you got a tongue twister in your name
system dot out dot print hi from Jaipur
hi from Jaipur - I am in Jaipur
I use on blockchain we have talked a
little bit about blockchain in the past
as well I have good things about
blockchain but not about Bitcoin did I
say is any plan for pony
you know pony my one of my very close
friend from my childhood lives in Pony
and I always kind of had I'd to be in
Panay just to meet him and like I would
love to visit pony but as of now there
are not any good conferences or anything
happening in Pune if I'll be in Pune
because I know I most of the time don't
post on my Facebook on what city I am
but definitely I'll try to be in Panay
very soon very soon
okay learn learnt HTML CSS GS bootstrap
these tells me how to get small projects
on freelancing in beginning it's going
to be tough for you because if you want
to get freelancing projects at least the
minimum project that I have seen that
usually people give is a project where
at least your contact form should be
working so just with the things like
HTML CSS GS and bootstrap you won't be
able to do it learn a couple of
scripting PHP that can send email from a
contact form to the person's email and
then you can get project let's be
realistic here let's not give you extra
high for extra hope you won't be getting
much of the project with these skills
invest little bit time in learning yes
the simple steps of the PHP through
which you can build a contact form a
working contact form that's it not much
a big deal probably can be done in like
two or three days at a max and then you
can get project and build a couple of
sample portfolio a website where contact
form is working
okay okay so some questions are like why
is it going like too fast
let's pick up more question steps to
learn machine learning yet your Python
absolutely done hit it out of the park
that's the step number one and it's
necessary necessary necessary step this
Saturday has just gone
log you are my happiness Hagar of noggin
thank you so much sir please reply how
to quickly learn AI and contents in AI
by the way a nice beard hey canal thank
you so much
there is no fast way of learning machine
learning and artificial intelligence
it takes time probably like six months
at least these are the things which you
cannot just master in like one week or
two week or in a month
it takes time so don't be in a hurry
start with Python then master the
libraries in Python like numpy sci-fi
matplotlib and all these things so this
is step one
why did you okay there is a
controversial question Hunton writer
jabber says why did he left InfoSec
okay uh like it's not like I have left
it completely
destro console.log okay so I haven't
left that domain completely I still do
have one of my best friends in the
InfoSec domain but honestly I love the
community in programming the community
at what you make at Stack Overflow in
the conferences at developer conferences
the people who you meet in the
programming community are more open
hearted as I have felt I might be wrong
but I enjoy it more over here creating
the stuff yes of course information
security is amazing it is a requirement
you cannot avoid it all these facts are
true but I somehow enjoyed building the
things much more as compared to this
there can we make app development
company without funding yes of course
you can but you should be damn good in
your skills I don't have any funding but
we'll doing pretty amazing oh yes you
can
are you single is that an invitation
dude that man again that men ask
questions it was really funny that man
you should come up with some epic pic
for that man you know it would be
awesome
he says dude I'm learning x86 assembly
and it's very boring I agree I learned
that in my bachelor's it was boring
still is boring you know any fun way so
that I can learn it at the same time
have some fun no it's not it's boring
let's just be honest it's it's damn
boring hello Ironman fish I like that I
like that Thank You captain he page I
like that too well Ironman was awesome
okay should learn react before PHP
learning es6 currently if you're already
learning es6 and you don't need to learn
like PHP or stuff jump into react or
maybe angular us a taxpayer
yes I am because my company is
registered there I do have a tax ID of
United States of America of so why am i
tax payer at united states love from goa
let me tell you garish the pig that i
posted on my facebook just today it was
clicked in goa
I don't know Java can I join your
Android course no I won't advise that I
would advise you to be patient and first
join my Java bootcamp and then join on
Android a lot of people just pick up
Java on the go but I would recommend
that be patient and time is not going
anywhere but thoroughly and on to a
gradual step start with Java boot camp
okay so freelancing tips okay I can make
a video on freelancing tips yeah
uhh
okay
Andre
thank you so much for the honor I really
like that will you come to Hyderabad if
you'll invite me surely you know we have
spent 46 minutes and I don't even see
that we have spent like time just flies
Haidee she thank you so much love from
Mumbai love from Jaipur as well I loved
it
okay this is a question by puja thank
you so much
Flattr where is that question is flooded
going to smash react native no I don't
think so react native is already at a
very high position in popularity as well
as in actual production so I don't think
so that react native is going anywhere
it's not like one technology only came
into existence to just have a
competition directly no both can exist
in the coast in this space consistently
but I don't think so react native is
going anywhere I please visit Haryana
only I haven't much visited Haryana part
there you know why
deadman say is dude my name is tribute
to Undertaker I love that I love that
good job there good respect there
I liked it I loved Undertaker too
uhh
does front-end is good enough I have
completed your course now front-end is
not totally enough if you want to get
some projects or anything but if you are
looking forward to get hired as a
front-end engineer then it's totally
amazing and good you don't need much of
the things you already have a portfolio
also being built or if you have taken
that course and have coded everything so
already you have a portfolio so you can
just start there while listening to you
simultaneously learning C from scratch
you are one talented man I cannot do
that
Shahana say is hey hey to you
ego lady programmer oh I have actually
given a talk on Python for women so I
have met a lot of girls who code it was
amazing it was a good talk I have
visited to act a lot of developer
conferences Python for women was was
amazing
of any of your course on udemy I have
been teaching on udemy from the very
first year hey hey Abhijeet how are you
oh these hi from Haryana high because hi
from Jaipur as well and it's going
really fast I still getting hot
yeah I failed that
so you are honest how to start with
JavaScript and iOS development target
usually thank you so much I try to be
just present the fact as it is they are
there are already lot of youtubers and
news channels which are just molding
down the facts in a wrong way I just try
to present what I see there so
regardless if you want to get started
with I us there are variety of ways
react native xamarin are one of the ways
for dotnet stacks it's the amine or
JavaScript it's react native and the
ideal way to go into it is through swift
and you will need a Mac computer whether
that's a MacBook Air MacBook Pro I
recommend MacBook Pro it's a little bit
pricey but I recommend that if you don't
have a budget go for Mac Mini it's also
good so that's the way how you get
started for that
how is django django is super easy
what's the flavor of iced tea it's
always lemon always I don't like the
peach one I like the lemon
did you celebrate Holi who asked that
question Deepa says did you celebrate
Holi no otherwise I would be red I don't
have even at and my nails as well so I'm
not much of I don't like that get
colored I like to click photos of the
people who are in color but then you
need to have a better camera I don't
have a to camera probably I'll do
upgrade
Oh
Oh something wrong I have deleted my
chat how did you read that
technically Sheen in YouTube yes YouTube
has having a lot of issues sometimes my
livestream just drops like that and then
it just goes up again I don't know why
your thoughts on the YouTube channel who
has programming courses at about $400
it's okay honestly I would say $400 is
like okay price it's not very high I
charge for my boot camps the offline
boot camps around $200 to $300 it all
depends on how much value you are giving
and how much you can afford the second
part is most important like if I cannot
afford all these things which I am doing
through my projects I would also be
charging my these courses pretty high
like five hundred dollars or four
hundred dollars but since I'm making
good amount of money through my projects
and my talks that's why I am I'm able to
afford these courses at a dirt cheap
price but $400 I think it's okay if
somebody is giving you dad command that
kind of value
I don't think so for any dollar is
really good in person boot camps do cost
this much so yeah even my boot camps
cost this much so I wouldn't say that
it's not it's it's okay
don't forget to make videos on
freelancing I will I'll try
who is programmer everybody who is
watching this chat and including me are
programmers how do I earn profit by
publishing a website Edson's is one of
the least way that you can do we write
have other ways as well I don't like the
Adsense idea that put up the ads and
just earn the money because through that
you are much of the dependent on Google
and their ad revenue and their rules but
if you have your own products and stuff
it is much easier
hey remember me I'm yes hey yes I
remember you
I from Kolkata come Kolkata game I
enjoyed Kolkata the amount of love the
people that has given me in Kolkata as
well as the amazing breakfast on on a
street I don't remember the name
was very fancy restaurant I enjoyed that
okay so let's
a couple of more questions and then we
can mind up its BTech degree is
necessary for getting a job no yes
for big companies yes for mid-range
sized companies it's okay
okay so where do you live in Jaipur
I live in jeopardizes tan an amazing
beautiful place pepper okay so we have
been talking quite a lot and now my
dinner time is there I need to take my
dinner as well
okay so let's bind up this amazing talk
of this Saturday live and probably will
go live every single Saturday we missed
the last one but I'm sure we are not
gonna miss the next one so that's it for
this one thank you so much for coming I
hope I was able to help some of you to
get started in programming and again
regardless of variable you pick up your
courses or books important point is keep
going keep learning also you can visit
learn code online dot in or more courses
and more amazing stuff at affordable
rates
I hope you'll do that so bye bye for now
keep enjoying keep coding it's important
to have consistency consistency is the
hard work show the world what you have
got and make amazing programs and curves
