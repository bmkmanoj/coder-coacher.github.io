with another video now in all of my
videos of not all and most of my videos
are rant about github and uploading your
profile on to the github now in this
video we are going to do exactly the
same and github is really a great
platform to show off what you are coding
up there and for a potential employee
who is going to hire you you can
actually show him your get a profile and
getting and he can simply check out that
what kind of code you are able to write
what kind of project you have done so in
this video we will talk about a lot of
things in here first of all what is
github are why it is actually being used
for what purpose we are going to use the
github how to upload our code on github
and now let me just put a sidebar there
that in this particular case I have
created a lot of react application and I
will be uploading all of my react
application to github in this particular
case but this might be the case exactly
saying for your iOS application maybe
Android maybe PHP maybe simple HTML CSS
application so the process remains
exactly the same and we will talk about
how we can upload those stuff and can
get back those stuff so we will talk
about that so slidebar completely over
back on to the github stuff now we will
also talk about what are the ways by
which you can upload things onto the
github as well and don't worry I'll take
you to my computer screen as well in a
minute but there are a couple of things
that we first need to talk about so
first of all what is github
now github is not the only service there
are lots of others so there is a bit
bucket and couple of others as well that
are not that much famous and the
services like git or github is actually
a version management system or version
controlling system now you might be
asking what is that now obviously when
you design a big scale application let's
just say it uses signup it uses login it
uses some get maybe AP is and then some
other management system as well now you
have designed your Sinus you have
designed your login and when you are
trying to implement the api as things
didn't went that way everything just got
messed up and now you are thinking that
hey if there could be some way i could
restore my application to a certain
point where it was working nice and
fine there comes your version control
system so when your application is
working quite fine YouTube is a couple
of good points where you can push atomic
there commit simply mean say this code
is working at this page quite right and
in case I mess around in the future
everything goes bad I can get back to
this point so that is a version
controlling system very very incredible
in case you are working with a lot of
big applications now also it has used
many cents when you are working with a
lot of colleagues there because let's
just say your colleague is working on a
different file there you are working on
a different file you want to merge out
everything then committing your code to
the github is always a good idea now I
won't be talking about how how to work
on a github with multiple people in this
video it definitely requires a different
video so that is your github but again
although it's the version control system
but it's also a good idea to upload
things on to the github so that
potential employee can watch out that
what kind of code you are writing and
what kind of languages you are working
it's a good profile that you can send it
to anybody
now with this I would say that not all
the people like to upload all of their
files on the github because they are
public if you are working on some
sensitive or maybe a kind of a big
application for a company you might want
to use the private part of the github
which is of course paid and we are not
going to focus on that ok so with this I
would also like to point out one more
funny part about the github that a lot
of people rant about that if you want to
work with a github you should be working
with the terminal now I know a lot of
people are afraid of the terminal but
although there is nothing to be afraid
about the terminal but I would like to
put a point in here that it doesn't
matter on which platform or by which
means you are working with the github
it's just a means of committing your
code pushing your code to the github and
pulling out your code from the github it
doesn't matter whether you work on the
terminal or github also gives you a lot
of GUI based application for Windows Mac
Linux pretty much everywhere and all I
want to say that in the end of the day
it simply matters that your code is
being pushed to the github it's being
pulled back from the gate
maybe some you might have done some
comment it's nobody can find out
actually from looking at the Gator but
whether you have made those pushes from
the terminal or maybe from the GUI based
application so I'm saying it's nothing
to be afraid
feel free end of the day you should just
finish up the job but again terminals
are very useful
they teaches you quite a lot and in fact
I do recommend slightly higher that you
should be using terminal but again no
problem at all now let's move on my
desktop and we'll show you quickly how
to configure github in a couple of GUI
based application and can push your code
to the github let's move there okay so
let's talk about how we can work with a
github and can upload a few stuff in
here now let me just quickly show you a
couple of things let me just go here
sign out there very quickly this is the
github everybody knows about it by file
now and you can do a quick sign up there
in case you haven't your account just go
ahead create an account choose a
username which is by the way a very
tough process nowadays use a username
anywhere and you can go with the email
password create an account it will ask
you to choose your plan obviously you
are ready to rock and roll with a free
account in case you are looking for
pricing yes there are pricing options as
well we don't need it everything that we
want as of now is ready in the free plan
in case you need a lot of private
repositories working for a big client or
maybe in a company obviously you would
be having this kind of option there by
the way I this is there just to tell you
let's go into the sign in my account on
this one is free one so I'll just go
quickly log in there and let me just
quickly log in there
okay so nope I don't need any account or
anything there so this is how your
profile looks like if I go back there
this is the profile that you will be
looking up there come on go there and
let me click on your profile and this is
the URL that you should be looking up
Gator comm /fa Chaudhary is my username
luckily I got that okay so this is your
repositories where you checked yours
might be completely empty but that's
okay what does a repository mean
depository means simply a project in
your case it must be just a folder where
you're working
a directory in my case I have cleared up
a lot of files in here known as react
application so I will be uploading
everything in here that is in the
reactor application and just onto a
sidebar if I go into any project for
example op0 login you might notice that
I don't have my node module folder there
now for all of the pro guys there yes I
know there is a way of using get ignore
and I can ignore this completely but for
the bigness again back we never upload
not node modules there because once you
go into the folder clone it there and
run the command onto your computer
of course after going into this folder
npm install and that node module
dependency will be there rocking and
rolling there okay so we never upload
node modules for the guys who are
working in c c++ maybe is we never
upload our compiled version of the apps
like in case you are working with see we
never upload our dot exe file square ok
just in case you don't know that ok so
this is the entire thing that we will be
uploading in here it's relying on my
desktop
that's good thing now in order to upload
things on to the github it's really easy
anytime you can create a new repository
and can ship the file but there are
better ways to do things instead of
copying and pasting every one file there
ok so and I won't be discussing the
command line ways of initializing the
gear doing a commit going you get ignore
and everything will be doing everything
from the graphical user interface one
option that we do have is a texture
github.com which gives you graphical app
for mac and windows and there we go
pretty simple application just create a
branch create a poder pull and push very
easy to work on with there is another
much more easier that I like it just
call it preference is on the source tree
app.com you can just look out for source
tree on the google and the first link
obviously would be so Street app comm
available again for Mac and Windows
I will be using this guy because I've
been using for so long and I just and a
little bit biased towards it again it's
free
ok so let's just go in there and we
don't need to create any repositories
we'll be creating that using SourceTree
remotely as
well right now I don't have any account
there so I will be connecting my account
first of all go into the source tree and
preferences for Windows guys it would be
Windows in preferences and in the
general you will see things of obviously
there but we are interested in the
account we want to add an account
obviously you should have a github
account by now
click on the github by the way if you
are using bitbucket that is also
available I'll connect an account this
guy usually takes a little bit while but
this time we are lucky so give it a
username and I'll be giving it my email
oops
and there we go and let's click on the
sign in there okay and SSH key no key
was found I'll copy this to clipboard I
don't think so we need it but I'm not
pretty sure okay
I'll click on OK and this should be
happy and I got immediately a
notification that SSH key was entered to
your github account okay so my github is
ready dear I think so and let's close
this guy we don't need it if I click on
the remote I should be seeing my
repositories okay there we go
I can clone any repositories this means
I can download any of my file on which I
was working on any system of course I
should have ID and password and I can
start working on it
that is good if I let's just say I'm
back on to pin testing stuff and I want
to work with a Avenger so I can just go
ahead clone that and start working on it
no problem at all now in this case we
will be uploading our react application
and who have been talking quite a lot
but these details are necessary so let's
create a new repositories this time I
want I have add folder on my desktop and
I want to create that as a repository on
remote system so what I'll be choosing
option is I don't need a clone from URL
I'll tell you what that means is and I
just want to add existing local
repository ok if I click on that oops
no that's not the option I was looking
for I'll say create local repository
sorry for that and first of all I will
choose a destination path it's on my
desktop
this name is react application this is
all the stuff that we want to upload
open that it's name is react application
that is good it is a gift not a
mercurial so that is good too and I'll
also check mark this guy that says also
create remote repository that means I
don't have to go onto the github and say
hey create a new repository for me it
will do everything automatically for me
okay
I'll click on create and there we go
it's automatically going to detect the
owner there get this is not a private
repository come on and the rest of the
things I think is good you can describe
an optional and I'll say react files for
course anything and I'll click on create
and it's doing the stuff it will take
some time and there we go now it's being
done but you might be seeing a hey there
is nothing being there on the
repositories if I just go there and
click on the react application there is
nothing inside there okay how can I work
with that okay let me just show you how
you can work with that double click on
your react application and there we go a
lot of files out there now all those
files that you want to do a comment you
can just select them in case let's just
say you don't want to upload webpack txt
you can just ignore that that's how we
could do a git ignore they are very
simple but in this case I want all of
the files to go there I'm pretty sure on
a fit and by the way you can go ahead a
click a git ignore and everything I
won't go into the detail of that and
I'll hit the comment their commitment
hey I'm ready to commit all these things
so I'll be saying simply files oops
files for react applications okay now I
can later on do a push changes but since
it gives me option in here that pushed
changes immediately to original master
that means they upload my files to to
the github that that's all it's saying
and I can do a comment there and it says
hey do you want to upload all of these
things and I would say okay and
obviously it's going to take a little
bit while a lot of things are going to
the github
not on the fastest internet on the
planet and there we go so it has done
all the things now if I do a quickly
reload there we go
everything is on to the github now and
everybody can use it now in case you
need any file in here you can just use
this link and we can copy it from the
URL and in clone there or you can just
download the zip whatever you wish to
have okay and anytime you need any
repository you can go onto the source
tree and I'll just close this guy and I
can simply say hey clone from URL and I
can clone any repository whatever I wish
so that is a good thing so I hope
everybody learned quite a lot about the
github I know I was not that much
thorough but it it's a good thing to get
started okay and I'll also post down the
link in case you need these react
application or if you want to get
started with the course that's okay too
so we do have our react application
there and I would be deleting these guys
because these are just a copy which is
already there in the react application
so I would be deleting these
applications and that's it for this
video and I will definitely catch you up
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
