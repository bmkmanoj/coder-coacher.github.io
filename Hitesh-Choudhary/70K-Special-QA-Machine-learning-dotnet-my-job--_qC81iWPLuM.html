with another video and this is 70k
special Q&amp;amp;A before we move on to this
video yes I am totally aware that we
have crossed 70k like almost quite a
days ago but in the last month I posted
on my Facebook wall that hey I'm gonna
be doing a Q&amp;amp;A session and you can put
down your questions in this thread and
after that I didn't got time to record
the video so it's a delayed video but
anyways it's again a special Q&amp;amp;A and I'm
planning to do all these Q&amp;amp;A every
single month they are always fun and to
be honest these are my favorite kind of
videos that I always like to do
answering your questions is the best
thing that I can do and I honestly love
this part I did receive a lot of
questions in my facebook thread where I
post heard about Q&amp;amp;A session a lot of
questions did came in the inbox and
email as well and I have selected a few
of them to answer in this particular
video so without any further ado let's
get started
so let's start with the first question
the first question here says effective
time management tips you are doing a
great work sir
Vishu a million subscriber the only
reason why I'm doing all this channel
and YouTube is your warm wishes I just
love to receive all of your wishes and
thank you so much keep this love coming
up and I'll be doing more effective work
related to your question effective time
management tips I have already done a
video put a link in the description
below make sure you check that out and
of course in the future I'll be doing
some more time management tip videos for
sure question number two is interesting
it says Bangalore Meetup time date and
venue yes I do have planned to come up
to Bangalore but I'm actually making
sure that my stay in the Bangalore is as
long as possible a lot of my friends and
a lot of subscribers really want to meet
me at Bangalore so for sure I will be
staying like almost 5 or 6 days in the
Bangalore whenever I'll be at Bangalore
I will be posting down my hotel name and
at the time when I'll be available for
sure at my Facebook page make sure you
subscribe to my Facebook page as well I
know I'm asking a lot subscribing on
YouTube subscribing on Facebook page but
these are the ways how you can be
connected with me and can get all the
information so make sure you hit down
the Facebook page and I'll for sure meet
everyone in the Bangalore as of now
dates are not yet confirmed but the tour
is for sure confirm it will be there and
I will be in Bangalore for sure the next
question says Congrats bro and you can
hire someone for dotnet boot camp
tutorial for your dotnet viewers yes I
would love to hire someone who has
actually good knowledge about the dotnet
for preparing a course but the problem
arises when people ask like insane
amount of money for preparing these
courses I do understand that preparing
these kinds of courses is really not an
easy process and you have to prepare all
these projects two times one before
recording and one at the time of
recording then again there are a lot of
fumbles in recording that you have to
delete a lot of post-processing work and
people usually charge for these kinds of
courses like 1.5 lakhs or 2 lakhs or 1
lakhs at least and I'm offering these
courses for all the students at
affordable price usually people sell
these courses for like 10000 or at least
8000 and selling these course
that pennies so people usually don't
like to work for these kinds of things
in case you know somebody who can work
for me for dotnet development things or
is ready to willing to give his time for
the benefits of the student I would be
really happy to have him on board I have
seen this honestly in the past that
people who actually joins on some
company our big giant names it's easy
while sitting out that position it's
easy to say that I'm not gonna waste my
time in teaching their students or I'm
not gonna help them I'm not gonna
support them it's really easy to say
these kinds of things but actually it
takes a lot of courage a lot of guts and
lots of hard work to come forward and
say that yes I am gonna teach this
alongside with my work I'm not bashing
around anybody but yes it's easy to say
things then doing it in case you know
somebody who can do it or you really
want to support some kind of things by
preparing courses or anything I would be
really happy to unboard you of course
prices are going to be there and I'm
ready to willing to pay to you for your
hard work but I'm not ready to pay like
three lakhs for hacks or just for a
single course and on top of that I'm
gonna be offering these courses for just
pennies just to maintain the website the
next question is about the most hot
topic in the market which is machine
learning I want to learn machine
learning should how should I begin
and all resources and all now learning
with the machine learning is actually
fun and a lot of people want to jump
onto it but before you jump on to
machine learning make sure you have some
kind of prerequisite as I told earlier
in my videos as well python is number
one essential thing that you must you
should always have in your bag if you
are looking for word for machine
learning yes there are other ways like r
is a great language if you want to get
started with machine learning but make
sure without any kind of option
mathematics
yes maths is an essential thing for all
of the machine learning you should be
really good in Fourier transform your
Bayes theorem your probability your
statics and discrete functionality and
noodle networks these are the most basic
thing for machine learning it's not like
anybody can stand up wake up at night
I'm going to learn machine learning it
doesn't happen like that you should be
really good in me or mathematics and
then
for sure you can jump into machine
learning regarding to your questions
just recently I did a giveaway for
machine learning that was an amazing
book you can check down on my Facebook
page you can buy it or you can wait for
the next giveaway where we'll be doing
more such kind of books giveaway that is
an amazing resource to get started with
machine learning as of now get started
with peyten or are this question will
invoke some kind of war between windows
and machine and let me answer that and
start this war which you will choose
MacBook I 5 processor 8gb RAM or Windows
laptop i7 processor 16 gigs ram both are
having same price any given day I would
choose a MacBook the reason why I would
be choosing the MacBook I'm not saying
Windows machines are bad I have started
my whole journey of programming on
Windows platform the reason why I would
not prefer a Windows machine now and
would prefer a MacBook right now because
right now my time is really the most
valuable thing with me and I don't want
to waste my time in just doing updates
random updates that automatically just
appear without any intimation there or
or a lot of time is being wasted in just
setting up the machine on my MacBook
devices I just open it up and I start
working and that's the most efficient
thing here other reasons that I would be
choosing a MacBook is its rendering time
the videos that I produce here are very
more shorter in the rendering time as
compared to what is being produced on
the windows a very high-end devices so
that's one of the reason I would like to
stick because I make a lot of videos and
that's why I like to stick on to the Mac
but again I'm fully comfortable on
Windows as well so there is no such
problem here next question is about
social media why are you not on Quora
honestly maintaining these social media
is really tough thing for me I'm not
even on Twitter I am on Twitter somehow
but I don't have any app or I don't
manage it much often only thing that I
manage is my Facebook page and this
YouTube channel it's really a time thing
I would love to be on Quora
or Twitter but it's really a time
constraint for me we are getting a
little bit personal here and he says
what are your future plans what is your
main source of income freelancing
contracts learn code online or something
else if you can tell how much percent
the make of your total income it's
really a personal I don't like to
disclose my income on these public
platforms but really it's good enough
it's decent enough and majority of them
is still coming up from the contracts
that I did for the other persons
maintaining their apps and website that
is again a huge part of it and learned
code online is kind of a public social
work that I love to do
yes YouTube is generating pretty good
amount of money from there to Ty Singh
and other resources I cannot tell you
exact figure but yes it is good enough
to buy a Harley Davidson or to have some
Europe vacations or vacations in India
it's pretty decent and I'm happy with my
income and that's the most important
part how much you are earning and in how
much you are happy that's the important
so I'm totally happy with it okay you
might a lot of you might be having this
kind of questions
what if AI takes everything in future
and there's no more need of programmers
just to give you in the context of your
situation there are driverless car
coming up does this means that everybody
should be stopped applying for driver's
license everybody should be stopping in
learn to how to drive no it doesn't
happen just like that it's the process
and it's a breeze and I'm not sure
what's going to be the future but right
now I can say that don't worry and don't
stop learning programming just because
some media guys or some blog post has
been written simply saying that hey in
the future there will be no need of
programmers they have done this just to
get some TRPs and some visitors on their
blog it's not going to happen not
anytime soon at least for 10 years I can
say for sure
even if machine learning in AI are
totally the future there there is going
to be need of programmers who can tell
those machine learning to learn from
where so obviously to manage those I
believe there will be in fact much more
high rise in the programming fields and
programming demands so I would say stop
worrying too much you are getting
worried too much don't do that start
learning now interesting question here
while you came in freelancing and didn't
join any big giants actually I have
joined a couple of companies in the past
I did work there one of the companies
for six-month in India
then I worked as a kind of a remote
employee for a company in New York it
was a startup and then I was invited at
Amazon for my ns3 work so yes I was
offered a couple of jobs to be done here
and in the United States as well but I
preferred India here because I love the
environment honestly the thing that I'm
doing right now here is not at all
possible if I'll be working in
somebody's company driving down your
harley-davidson is not at all even
possible even after like two or three
years of job in United States and here
I'm living a happy life with my holiday
wits and enjoying making peace videos so
I would prefer this kind of a lifestyle
on top of that they would have their own
dress code and I like I like to wear all
the time my gray t-shirt probably this
is also one of the reasons not strong
but yes this is one of them okay so this
was a quick Q&amp;amp;A 70k a special Q&amp;amp;A but we
have moved forward quite a lot and
definitely I'll be posting again a
thread for the Q&amp;amp;A
I love these interesting question that
came up for my personal life as well as
programmatic life I really love to
answer them definitely stay tuned on my
Facebook page as well as on YouTube I
will be posting again a thread for
putting up your questions I would be
really really happy to answer all of
them with this that's it for this video
