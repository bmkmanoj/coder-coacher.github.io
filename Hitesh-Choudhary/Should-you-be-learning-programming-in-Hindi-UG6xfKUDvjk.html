about Hindi and English in the comment
section I'm pretty sure of it
hey did everyone if they share back
again with another video in this video I
want to discuss something very very
interesting now if you are the kind of
person who is looking up for programming
tutorials in Hindi of course there are
dozens of them but should you be
learning programming in Hindi and if yes
what's going to be advantage if no
what's going to be disadvantage and this
talk really meets your attention so
let's get started of it
in this channel we talk about
programming web apps mobile apps and
pretty much everything related to
technology and programming so in case
you are new here consider subscribing
now let's move on to today's particular
this video topic which is should you be
learning programming in Hindi and
basically to be to be honest here this
video is actually being inspired from
one of the comment that is being posted
in the last video so let me just open up
my phone there and read this email to
you because you can already see that and
that is in the bottom part of the video
but for me I have to just read it okay
so let's start this and this is a
youtube comment and it says I want to
learn Android in Hindi classes it's good
for me or not because I am a Hindi
medium student does my BCA in Hindi
please suggest okay so first of all
before we move ahead and talk about is
it good or not let me put up my point of
view and again feel free to disagree
it's democracy there and everybody is
having a right to completely disagree
with me but here is my point just listen
to me now when you try to learn in the
regional language by the way just before
I do that again I'm super cautious about
it I don't support any language inside I
am by trilingual there I speak a couple
of languages and there we go okay so
let's come back onto should you be
learning in Hindi or English now my
point of view is when you will be
writing your code it's going to be in
English I know that's not a special
grammar knob the English it's just
English when you read the documentation
may be of bootstrap may be of Swift may
be of Android have you ever seen the
documentation specifically being
oriented in Hindi no you you never see
that it's always going to be in English
because that's kind of one unity
language that the programmer has
achieved there so what I'm trying to say
you is that it is okay to learn a
programming in Hindi but I think I
personally think that you should be
start moving in English I know it's not
an easy process since you have you have
been done you have been doing all of
your studies in Hindi and sudden switch
into the English is not going to be easy
but what I'm trying to say is switch as
quick as possible and there is no good
time
switching just right now that is what
you need to have now it's okay nobody is
born genius or if we are by trialing
well it's not easy to grasp other
languages for example when I do speak
Spanish to my Spanish friend there they
always make a laugh of me but eventually
I am getting better at that and the same
goes for the language like Hindi English
and whatever you are trying to learn so
and again on top of the documentation
and all the answers of a problem you are
going to find them in English as well as
there are two important things since you
are trying to learn Android or maybe
other languages there are high chances
that you will be moving to Silicon
Valley of India that is a Bangalore and
a lot of people there are coming up from
different parts of the country maybe
from the northern part of the country or
maybe the southern part of the country
and they don't generally speak and Hindi
there they try to speak English so it's
really good for you to get started in
English of course I agree it's going to
be very very tough but again everything
is tough in the beginning and I I
personally recommend you that get
started with English it's not that tough
it's obviously tough in the first couple
of years then eventually you will just
grow in that and obviously if you're
trying to learn programming maybe your
app just grows up there and you will get
a chance to visit maybe United States
maybe Australia maybe Germany and those
people are trying to get you back for a
conference or something you may want to
deliver a talk to them and at that part
of time if they're not that much
frequent or familiar with the language
like English nobody's going to listen to
your talk in Hindi now I know there will
be supporters of Hindi who will join in
and will say that hey our Prime Minister
is even giving the talk there in Hindi
but again that is a political agenda and
we want to try to completely be
restrictive from the political agenda we
are not supporting anybody here all I'm
trying to say is the language convention
that the programming is English and I
think you should get started with that
as quickly as possible
now again a lot of people are going to
come in to come and hey why are you
supporting with English so much you
should be banned from the country and
all these things now again I have no
political motive at all I try to keep
away from the political news
as much as possible but I am trying to
say this this is going to be helpful for
you when you will be invited to some
conference at US or Australia you will
be thanking me that I suggested you to
get started with English when you will
get stuck in the problem and there will
be a complete blog about the solution of
that particular problem in Android you
will be thanking me that you were you
were being able to understand every
single thing about that problem and you
were able to solve that problem
because you got good in English so I'm
saying if there is no good point
or no good time to get started other
than now so get started now if you if
you get stuck with there there are lots
of hindi tutorials there obviously you
can refer some time to them but not all
the time try to stick in English you
will be thanking me later on and of
course we are all Indians in here we are
bilingual obviously a lot of us know can
be some English part so we are obviously
bilingual there so get started the more
language you can learn in real life as
well it's going to be awesome there so I
think this helps you to clear up a lot
of doubt and this doubt is being all
there for a lot of people like you so it
is you think that this video was awesome
give it a thumbs up and in case you
think that this video can be helpful for
somebody make sure that you share it on
social media as well and with this video
I'll say I'll catch you up in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
