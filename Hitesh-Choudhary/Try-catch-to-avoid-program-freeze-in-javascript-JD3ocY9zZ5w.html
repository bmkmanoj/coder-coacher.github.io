code online dot in and welcome back
again to this awesome amazing JavaScript
series I hope you're enjoying it if you
are enjoying it do let me know in the
comment section below this motivates me
come on you can write a comment so now
let's just go ahead and proceed with the
further things that we are gonna learn
in our JavaScript stuff and one of the
stuff which is really key point about
any programming language at all is the
try and catch now so far we have learned
that if we get an error right just there
at the exact point where the error comes
on the program freezes out and that is
actually a good thing and actually a bad
thing now we want to gracefully handle
these errors we just don't want to shut
down the entire program imagine if you
are using an app and just one feature is
not working because of that entire app
is being shut down it's probably a
nightmare and we don't want to do that
so similarly we have options how we can
handle these errors and of course some
of you might have guessed that
it's a try and catch syntax now
previously when I used to talk about
these try and catch one place I always
used to recommend that if you're making
a web request probably the website is
down or you are not getting a proper
request back on time just to use a
try-catch that's a better option but
surprisingly we do have another better
option now which is promises which we
are going to talk later on but just
assume whenever you're not sure that
there might be a potential error it's
always a good idea to use try and catch
so let's just have a simple example of
this try and catch how the entire
workflow works with the try and catch
and we're gonna just create a simple
application a currency converter and
we're gonna see what are the potential
fall pits where we can have an error so
let's just go ahead and do that so we're
gonna create a new file and in the
advance of course so let's just call
this s try catch dot J s there we go
okay so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna create a simple a simple function
which can take an input from user and
convert that into we're gonna take input
in dollars and we're gonna convert that
into rupees so that's a pretty pretty
simple math so we're gonna say get a
rupees or maybe convert rupees convert
to our
that's actually a better thing and just
like we used to do we can either use a
functional or now that we have learned
about these arrow functions we can
actually use them so there we go this is
your arrow functions that you really
want to use and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna take an input so we're gonna
call this as dollar and we just have to
multiply this dollar by 60 to get it
into rupees so who has as simple as it
sounds now here comes an interesting
part that either you can just write a
return and all these statements let me
just write that again because we are
fairly new to these arrow functions so
let me just convert that right here so
we can just return and we can simply use
dollar and we can just multiply it by
like 64 ish it's always roam around
there between 60 and 65 so there we go
and in case you want to shorten down all
of these things so you can just delete
this guy you can also just delete all of
this stuff and can just say something
like this in case you are comfortable
right now with these kinds of things
that's totally fine so this is our
function working fine totally with that
but you know what this function may have
potential a lot of errors let me just
show you what are these so let's just
say we just first of all let's just have
a Const and we're gonna say my value so
what is the converted value we're gonna
use convert to our s and we pass on a
dollar probably five dollars and then I
want to log this value my value so let's
just run this and try to see what things
can happen so there we go we're gonna go
into zero one advance come on we're
gonna go zero one advance and now we can
run this node and try-catch there we go
and there we go no problem at all
nothing nothing at all but what happens
if user don't pass on five or probably
pass on something like this then
obviously if I run this notice the
multiplication actually went well for
this kind of five but what if user
something goes like this now this is not
something that we are expecting we get a
null value here or non value so we don't
want something this to happen to our
program so we need to rewrite this
program a little bit so what we're gonna
do is we are gonna just cut it for a
moment and we're gonna just use our
curly braces again now what I want to do
here is I want to use an if and else
statement here okay and if an else
statement first of all I want to check
the type of this dollar what is coming
up so if the type of the dollar is
actually a number then only I want to
proceed so if it is equals to number
notice in the previous video talked
about that this type of gives you a
string value of it and we are exactly
comparing that okay once we are getting
that then only I want to actually return
this dollar multiplied by 64 so I'm
gonna say return dollar multiplied by 64
okay otherwise I don't want to run this
program so what I want to do is in the
else case I can either probably give
user a message that hey this is not
gonna be working but additionally what I
can do I can throw up an error just like
it's a system generator that or
something something like that so I can
simply say throw throw and there we go
now in the throw actually you can throw
a little string that yeah this is what's
the error but it's not a best practice
that you throw just a string that you
can do in the console log as well so
makes no sense so what he can do is you
can use this error as well notice it's a
capital error it's a description says
interface error it's exactly the same
error what we see when we miss type
something or something like that and
you'll see that in a minute
and what this error gives you it gives
you a parameter that you can pass on
like something like amount need to be in
number something like that so this
actually makes much more sense here okay
so let's just run this and we're gonna
run that and there we go now you might
have seen these kinds of error quite a
lot I make a lot of them so this is
something what we're getting and the
best part about these error it throws up
the line number as well like notice we
are making a mess at line number five so
this is where it's throwing up the error
and also it gives you that where it was
called so that you can fix up that so
notice it says that hey we're making at
line number eleven so now this line
number 11 is actually calling that
function so it gives you a lot
information instead of just throwing up
and these things and right now we have
created a very good program which castle
catches the error but throws an error
and just freezes over program they're
not a probably a good idea to have it
something like that but we can do
something more better than that okay so
what we can do is we can just comment
that down because this is not what we
want to do when we have a potential
error probably you are making a web
request I know again we are gonna handle
the FEV request using promises but bear
with me we don't know about promises yet
okay just forget about it so let's just
say you're making a web request to get a
temperature and your website is down so
you might want to check it out somewhat
like that that whether the website is on
or probably this dollar conversion
you're using some of the Google API or
Yahoo APs to catch that so obviously we
don't want an error to freeze our
program right now here we just want to
have an error and move on there okay so
let's just see how we can do that and
for that we use a try/catch and notice
this vs code is really amazing to help
such things for me and let me just have
it from the try-catch notice it just
gives you like that boilerplate code I
love that and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna do all of this stuff inside
this so I'm gonna cut that and paste it
inside that I am gonna uncomment this
there we go and there we go makes much
more sense okay so we are trying this is
kind of an attempt when everything goes
right but if something goes wrong you
can just have a message here for the
error and what you can do is you can
simply have a log use this error and
notice as soon as I have oops come on
control-z error and as soon as I hit a
dot notice there are a couple of options
this this dot can access actually now
the option is displayed what I really
want to display here that is actually
message it has first of all let's see
what is this error so that you can get
more idea what this error is this one
usually some people call it just as e
that is also totally fine but let you
see what happens okay
first of all let's go for the regular
stuff if it is of just a $5 we want to
convert so there we go
in the screen run that again everything
goes fine no big deal and if something
goes like this someday somebody says
five in a string save that and let's
just try to run that and there we go we
got an error now notice uh we got an
error okay that amounts needs to be in
number and let me just show you a couple
of good stuff here okay and what we are
gonna do is instead of this error we
want to move on now let me also show you
one more thing just by printing a log
here that I will not run if program
crashes this is the most important part
so this line obviously if we have got an
error on line number eleven our program
is gonna get freeze and this line 17
will never be printed out so let's just
have a clean screen and run that again
and notice I will not run if the program
crashes so that's the most beautiful
part you have got your error but you
have also got your program flow to be
continuous there and some of you might
be getting confused here I can totally
agree with you let me just walk you
through that then I just copy this paste
that directly here and I comment out all
of this try and catch block again notice
the line 20 will never run if our
program actually crashes on line number
9 or 10 okay so let's just see and
verify that always a good idea is to run
the script whenever in doubt so let's
just see and run that and notice this
time our line is not being printed so
the program flows actually is being
freezed just exactly the moment where it
hits the error and throws an error or
something like this okay and with the
try and catch what we can do is we can
avoid this situation where program
actually freezes we don't want to freeze
our program yes definitely we want error
but we don't want to error which you can
totally freeze our program okay so a
better approach would be handling these
situations using a try and catch block
now just one more thing one last thing
that we want I want
tackle down here is sometimes you'll be
seeing that people use different
variables here in case of error
sometimes people just like to call it as
E whatever you call that it's just a
variable call it whatever you like call
that P call that Z call that a whatever
you like it doesn't really matter so
this is all about try and catch now
here's a quick word that again I have
I've shaded previously but I want to
talk about it one more time now
previously we used to do all these try
and catch for a web-based request
whether that's an API request or
anything like that but now we have a
better alternative to handle that kind
of situation which we are gonna learn
later on these are known as promises and
the chain of promises that we can do but
right now I think it is more than enough
that we have discussed one topic and
it's always a good idea if you have a
potential throw up that can cause your
program to crash handle it into trycatch
that's a better approach so that's it
for this video and I'm gonna surely
catch you up in a next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
