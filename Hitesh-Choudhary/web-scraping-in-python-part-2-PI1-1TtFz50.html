another video where we are talking about
web scraping using Python for absolute
beginners so again just before you start
watching this video go ahead watch my
previous video just before this and I
have talked a little bit about big nerd
friendly guide that how you should get
started in these web scraping and what
are the cave it points and required and
request and all these libraries and
stuff so it will make much more sense if
you go ahead watch that previous video
otherwise this will sound all like
jargon moving further let's try to step
up a little bit game on to the web
scraping part and let me walk you
through that how usually the web
scraping is done so let's just go back
onto our browser because obviously just
showing up error code and start writing
with that doesn't really make sense make
sure you analyze the thing for which you
want to do scraping again this is my
website go ahead check it out it's
amazing website you can find AMA about
amazing courses on Python as well here
what we are using for the web scraping
now let us go ahead here now open up
your any favorite page on Wikipedia
we'll be doing some web scraping here
not much intention like intense kind of
work basic stuff okay so this is the web
page on machine learning on Wikipedia
that I want to do a scraping maybe I
want to find out all the links maybe I
want to find out all the headings here
and all of that but before I do that
first of all I have to make my mind that
what I really want to do the next step
is to analyze the CSS of this like it
might sound a little bit strange to you
but CSS is the most amazing thing that
you should really look into web page
where you want to do that chances are
high that whatever the web page you are
analyzing it's all CSS are exactly same
in all of the other pages as well so
let's just go back here and let's just
say we want to grab all the titles here
titles you can grab it there are a
couple of places like there is a
overview here then the history Theory
approaches application all of that you
can grab it from here
or you can grab it from here as well
these are like overview then history in
relations so it can be dependent on what
kind of approach you are having let's
just try it here first of all so right
click on here and click on inspect by
the way I'm using Chrome browser okay so
here we can see there is a class that
says to
see texts so this is the class that I am
having for this that's one thing that
I'm getting from this and then let's
move on to the next one which is history
and relationship again I can see there
is a class that says to see text really
good point
so it takes really good time good amount
of time to analyze these things and you
should really not ever hurry and right
now I can see directly on to top of my
cursor there's a span dot T text then
again this is all over there but you can
also notice the subtopics are also there
here so if I want to just grab I have
got my first thing out here directly out
of the box that there is a class in all
of these list item which I can directly
target that can be one approach let's
try to move on to another approach
because I can give you a couple of
assignments as well that I can check out
on this overview and you can see in this
overview the classes MW headline and the
ID is overview I'm pretty sure that ID
is changing quite a lot because it's
related to the name as well but this MW
headline looks like it's being used for
all the headlines not pretty sure and
there we go you can see that this is
also having an MW headline and then the
dash headline remember that and IDs
changing quite a lot so ID is not at all
useful we are looking for some kind of
consistency so that we can write a
Python script and can loop through all
of the webpage to find out find out all
the things here okay
and yes approaches can be a little bit
different so I'll give you a couple of
assignment as well that would be really
fun to do so so far I'm assuming I've
already checked it out honestly that
these things like theory all of them are
having MW headline as their class so we
will be writing a Python script the
first job is to use a request and send a
webpage request to this web page store
that as a request object the step two
will be to convert that object into
beautifulsoup
objects so that we can run our functions
and everything in the past we have
learned that we can use tags of HTML to
get that particular information in the
last time title was pretty okay it just
happens in one time in any web page but
this time we are looking to how somehow
we can select the classes here again
your front-end development skills are
always gonna be helpful in here so in
case just to give you a quick eye
here when we are selecting the class we
can use dot class just exactly how we
select the CSS part to target any class
if we had to select the ID we use the
pound sign here as well it will make
sense when I'll just walk you through
with that so let us go here first of all
I would like to copy this link because
we will be using it now let's just go
here I want to fire up my Python 3 again
I will be working on the terminal you
can fire up your idle as well whatever
feels comfortable to you let me clear up
the screens here as well so that we can
have it okay so things what we have done
in the past exactly same first of all
we're gonna create a resurrect oops
before that we have to import some other
things so let's just import bs4 and this
is beautiful soup for in the previous
video we talked about installation of
that as well it's pretty simple pip
install beautiful soup and of course
read the documentation as well we are
also going to be using requests again
requests for making a request beautiful
soup for doing the parsing and we'll be
using our L XML again just like in the
previous video so I don't think so we
need to import the XML I'm not sure so
let's just create again a request so it
is going to be simply a request dot get
and then you simply mention what you
really want to get in this case I want
to get this web page pretty simple okay
no big deal and once this is done I can
obviously check the type of phrase and I
know this is an object of type request
this is not at all any good use I want
to convert that into soup so I have to
create a soup object you can in this
anything it's just available and then
there are too much spaces then I can
simply say from the bs4 I want to use a
method known as beautiful soup so it is
gonna be beautiful soup there we go
ok as I mentioned in the previous video
as well it takes two parameter first is
your request that what we have got and
the second is what kind of tree
structure you want to have like HTML
parser or L XML just like that in case
you are not aware of this if I type in
just this res dot txt it will give me
the entire web page here which is off
honestly no use for me ok so what I can
do is
I can simply go ahead I by the way
pressed ctrl + L to clean up my screen I
can simply say let us create an object
soup and we're gonna call this as B as
full dot beautiful soup and make sure
you are aware about the case sensitivity
here as well so the first parameter is
rest or text so it requires all the
webpage to be passed on here and the
second is what kind of tree structure
you want to have I'm gonna use L XML
here you can use HTML beautify or HTML
parser or whatever you like now what now
just has happened this soup is now not
at all anymore an object of request it
is an object from the class beautiful
soup again
it's no harm to just verify that again
so you should always do that there we go
ok so this looks pretty ok now we have
learned about one method which is soup
dot select we can use that so we can
simply say soup dot select and we can
parse on whatever the things we want to
select ok in the first part of the video
we notice we can pass on the text like
title maybe div not like that div and
then we can use like h1 and h2 but in
this case we want to select the class
here ok now if you have a class use a
dot and then a class name in this case M
W dash head line ok and if you want to
use like if it is not a class base
approach that you want to go maybe
there's an ID that you want to target
there then obviously it's really simple
you can use just a pound sign there or
hash sign whatever you call that and you
can simply do that maybe there is some
special h1 tag or span that you want to
target obviously you can mention that
maybe I want to target all the span that
are in too and just like next child off
there's two tags so I can simply say I
use these kinds of CSS tactics that you
already have might be aware in the CSS
class or in my front-end development
class so this is all you all you can do
as well in this case mine is just class
so I'm gonna say dot and then mention
this MW
head line so as soon as I do this uh
okay we have got like a pretty lot of
things okay so there we go it has got a
lot of things here which is having like
too much of the data that I'm getting
here so we need to extract some of the
information from this as well
and that can also be done so let's just
say we can loop through the things to
just kind of it because there are a lot
of classes this is a long web page as
you can see so obviously there are tons
of data that is coming up so no big deal
we can look through it that would be
better so what I can say is I can simply
say for I in and I can use like soup dot
select if I can write the select soup
dot select and then I can mention the
things like dot M W dash head line and
just close that and put a call on
science so I'm looping through it and I
just want to say that please print now
here you want to approach like whatever
you want to have a printing for that in
this case I'll just say you know what I
dot text because I just I'm just
interested in the text part so I dot
text and there we go so I think this
should do the work and there we go we
have got a lot of data here and notice
here that as soon as I approached for
the text rest of the information is gone
because in the previous video we learned
that what this soup dot select gives you
an array of all the things that you are
requesting so you can look through this
object and all of that so no big deal
there and now we have got this overview
type history relation theory approach
decision tree it's it's like too much of
the things so we have got all of this
and this is like one approach of getting
all the headers now of course as I told
you it depends on what you want to do
further maybe you want to transfer that
into a CSV file or a PDF file or just
want to store an HTML page it's totally
dependent on you what you want to do
there are plenty of packages and by them
that you can work on with okay so it's
time for assignment okay so I hope many
of you are following me and
to do an assignment as well so right now
I did a job with using the class MW
headline now I want you to get an
approach of a different one I want you
to take approach where you just get all
the data using this content section so
you should analyze only this one which
is this guy so overview all of these
which is already having a span of two C
text it is easy it's not that much hard
if you have watched all of my two videos
so you need to grab all of this and just
look through it and all of that I am
expecting all of your answers and your
snippet code to be posted in the comment
section or the discussion section below
it should not be really really tough for
all of you and I hope you're enjoying
these sessions on the web scraping as
well I know these are pretty fun
everybody loves it so do note if I mean
the comment section as well that if you
are enjoying these sessions or not so
that's it for this video and I'll surely
catch you up in the next one hey don't
forget to subscribe the channel as well
it's going pretty cool and I like it
