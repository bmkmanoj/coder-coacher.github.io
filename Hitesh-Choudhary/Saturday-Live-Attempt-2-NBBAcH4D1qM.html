don't know how it is working or not this
is a 10/2 okay let's see if it is
working but not this time
and how is more of it importantly the
audio this time
come on YouTube don't do this to me so
hey Deepa
hey tiger how are you so attempt to he
just like CB FC guys so sorry for all of
you you have to give that time to okay
so looks like it's working decent this
time audio is good thank you so much I
know it's not like my courses it's just
decent okay so love from Kolkata thank
you so much okay it's going really fast
now I hope this time it's better I can
see the quality is much better now I
hope so attempt - yeah attempt to for
Saturday life first one just only sound
is playing come on YouTube come on come
on
do that a little bit new player in LCS
also and thank you so much it's gonna be
better over the time you know version
one is always not so amazing then
version 2 version 3 version 4 so it gets
better every time love from
Bhuvaneshwari I enjoyed really punished
for so much
it's name is technical Babaji and that's
a nice name okay so notification
squirrel so YouTube send a notification
this time thank you so much YouTube love
from Mumbai I might be visiting Mumbai
probably in this month if I'll be there
I'll surely let you know guys and I
would love to meet you okay so how do
you increase programming confidence bro
make some projects bro you need to make
a lot of projects in order to make in
order to get a lot of confidence without
the project no matter how many
challenges you saw how many loops you
write how many functions you
you'll never gonna get there once you do
the projects that's where the confidence
starts coming up too much of the
buffering I have absolutely no idea how
this YouTube stuff is working on a issue
ever oh thank you so much for the super
chat I have absolutely no idea how this
YouTube stuff is working on with the
life I have seen a lot of other creators
facing some issues with the life and
even when I use my other softwares to go
live
they just doesn't work and the YouTube
Browser stuff which which you can go
directly live it's like so are you CSK
pen or mi fan I don't watch much of the
cricket nowadays I used to watch it a
lot but the moments touching retired the
Dhoni retire it's it's gone for me now
and also now the priorities are on to a
different level so instead of watching a
cricket match I would like to prefer to
pack up my client work probably record
more YouTube videos or course videos
sobriety's are different so the per se
is finally live is on yeah I think so
finally it's live is on and it's
reaching to you so okay let's pick
Rahman says in amongst other just say is
how are you I'm doing good good please
say is will more Adobe XD tutorial come
yes it will surely come I really need a
break and my break is like working on
something on design or something because
this machine learning thing took a lot
out of me and the challenge is the big
challenge with this machine Larry was
somehow or how I should make this course
so that it becomes easier because the
topics are already there the challenge
was nobody was able to understand these
things so I wanted to make simplest
possible example a lot of ideas going
through and back that's how it was long
time consuming brain consuming
brainstorming thing I need a little bit
relaxed and that relaxed will happen
with Adobe XD and sketch so you can
expect a lot of videos can I become
professional Android developer if I take
it of course
shortly you will be learning about
designing 10 apps and I think if
somebody can design their apps designing
the 11th hour 12 app should not be a big
deal you'll be learning all the basics
but in order to call yourself as
a professional one I would recommend
that after building those 10 apps I
recommend you to make at least five are
struggling on your own post video on
payment gateway integration Hayhurst
Joshi actually we are planning something
on to it it's not yet confirmed on
neither we have started working on it
we are looking over so that we can do
something big scale for that but again
recording a course or anything like that
requires twice amount of work as
compared to doing a project because
first we have to do that then we have to
break down that into chunks and then
rerecord and then post-production then
uploading it it's a lot of work can we
expect any collaboration anytime soon
let me be honest here I would love to
get collaboration but I think I'm a
little bit afraid of collaborating with
other youtubers because just like other
youtubers I I also see all the YouTube
things which are going on right now and
I'm a little bit afraid that if I will
be collaborating with somebody and later
on he doesn't like me he will say that
hey I'm going to put a strike on your
channel or just remove my videos and
which is not a good thing so honestly
I'm a little bit afraid of doing
collaboration with other youtubers but
on but inside somewhere me I would love
to collaborate with specially some of
the youtubers in India I am a big fan of
their although their subscriber are just
like 20,000 or 30,000 but still I'm a
big fan of those guys but yeah a little
bit like on to the edgy side so you know
are there any pre courses on red code
online yes we do have free courses one
on Emmet which I highly highly recommend
everybody should have an Emmet law Emmet
knowledge and one is there on bootstrap
for Robin says hey this do you want to
say anything about your gray t-shirts no
is hackintosh a good option for iOS
development
hey Rehan I think it's not at all a good
option and in fact Apple are taking a
good measuring steps so that they can
totally totally just get rid of
hackintosh by using their own chipsets I
hope everybody is aware of it that Apple
is getting rid of the Intel they will be
now moving on to their own processors so
not at all be an option in the future
it's also not a good stable thing
because when you tell the things you
need latest everything fully updated as
well as full stable its things and hack
into it is like not fully updated one
okay sir completing enjoying LC om l
bootcamp 30 person completed Oh Roman
that's you are on a really nice track
you have already completed twenty
percent just to give you a little bit
insight
I usually don't give that but probably
it's not confirmed yet but probably
there might be more content in existing
bootcamp without any extra charges
probably I'm not pretty sure that it's
going to come or not but yeah Wendy says
you are close to two legs of Congo thank
you so much I think once we hit that to
next subscriber I can unbox my silver
play button
I have unbox it once on the life but
haven't made a proper video for that I
would love to do it so definitely so
probably on 200,000 we will do a
unboxing videos up on this silver bottom
currency is what do you suggest about
ui/ux
with machine learning I don't know but
if it they are both like compatible or
not yes surely we can detect some of the
results on that I have no idea
offline feature in SEO is very helpful
I'm really happy that you like that
feature it took a lot of time to encrypt
the things and moving was a big step but
I'm really happy that people who are
genuine lovers of programming and
understand the value of these things are
loving it and that's what we want can
you include some projects and lco
machine learning bootcamp we will look
forward into that probably probably we
are looking forward onto that that how
much more content we should put on to a
time there is a lot of discussion going
on personally with me as well so we will
think of that surely how much projects
matter in getting a Java I think it
matters a lot because companies do avoid
a lot of freshers to join into their
company because pressures are completely
like they have to train them for they
have absolutely no idea and that's why
project because once you do the project
you are not at all depression you are
experienced person who hasn't worked on
to a corporate culture we're still you
know everything so you are not called a
fully-fledged pressures so yeah okay so
okay somebody says how is the chat app
and the LC is different from another
website I have no idea what they are
teaching
I haven't taken like seeing their
curriculum but in case you like that one
go for that one there is no such harsh
thing as that wherever you go just enjoy
their courses okay how long okay it's
gone is ml can be done in web
development I think yes because a lot of
options are getting unpacked for the web
developers as well specially with the
tensorflow Jas there is a room now for a
lot of web developers to get started in
machine learning
but again the concepts need to be
learned using the Python or maybe R but
the concepts remain exactly same they
can be implemented now using the
tensorflow GS but yes of course I would
highly recommend to get friendly with
the data science as quickly as possible
okay so say my name Abbey kaput okay
whoever you want okay so I guess just
okay it's gone like it's it's just keep
on rolling really can I add github
copied apps into Play Store you can but
surely you will be getting a strike and
your account may get banned into that so
if you're just taking anybody's code and
just pushing it as an app that's not at
all a good idea you probably might want
to have tons of features on that like
having couple of code copy and paste it
and solving that problem is okay
versus punch creation say so you angry
with me no I don't i never remain angry
for a long time it's probably there
might be some words we have taken onto a
personal ad and might be
I never angry with anything how much
github is important for jobs really
really big-time if you have a rock-solid
github profile I think you can skip a
couple of lines of interviews
okay Salim Khan say say my name hey
Salim Khan how are you doing hope you're
doing good I guess is it's gone okay so
it's really hard to see the questions
they are going really fast
your views on IOT I did read IOT s one
of the subject I didn't liked it much of
the things it was all about any sensors
and lights and dye rooms and all of that
I didn't like it much so not I'm not
much into the IOT Internet of Things
surely it's a big deal doesn't means
that I don't like it it's it's not all
the big deal it's it's surely a big deal
but you know it's not something which
connects with me okay your favorite
youtuber ah I have a long list I'm a big
fan of variety of youtubers not just
with you might have heard these names
Casey nice there Peter Macallan's these
are just common names which I follow
along quite a lot one youtuber which
which actually brought me on YouTube for
creating an account because I wanted to
see a lot of his video was crazy Russian
hackers you might have heard about him
I'm a big fan of that guy I love
absolutely how he starts in video
welcome back everybody
all these welcome back to my laboratory
safety is number one priority
I love that guy so let me know in the
comment section if you have seen that
guy crazy Russian hacker and personally
a big fan of that guy I love the
simplicity of that guy so I was I
actually came on YouTube to see all of
his videos and that's how I've created
an account and all of that so I love
that guy absolutely yeah crazy Russian
guy his accent is so funny I love that
guy no matter however he speaks or I
still watch all of a lot of his video I
still take my time I probably might be
skipping a Casey Neistat video and I
still watch that video
Logan Paul no I don't fall in Logan Paul
Adam watch many of his videos I don't
find it much of a trusting
you know I love the I love watching the
guys video who is just writing the
script doing everything on his own like
boom boom boom BB I love that guy
because he writes his content he edits
that that's actually perfect blog for me
the blog actually means that somebody is
taking the camera writing the story
editing it and just getting best out of
it so that's the kind of a guy I love to
watch so yes that was cool yeah but I I
actually guess that a lot of you might
not be knowing the name Taurus schools
of Isis a crazy Russian hacker but yeah
they cram a lot from Pakistan thank you
so much a lot of love from India as well
hello sir which laptop is best for
developer Mac or Windows alum a guy I
prefer usually Mac because it's Mac is
like less problematic I don't have to
worry about anything and it just kills
okay issue roll thank you so much for
super chat is a steps for beginners in
penetration testing field first and
foremost if that I can give you always
always keep that in mind
put the show think aside I repeat that
again put the show of thing aside you
are getting into a very great domain so
first of all respect that domain second
thing the respect others work okay
respect somebody is a developer who has
created a website or app and you have
you are able to find a loop that doesn't
means that developer is an idiot okay
first of all learn how to respect that's
the most important thing I think is
missing from the spin tester thing a lot
of people not all but again that's the
first thing that you have to learn now
when you find a bug or you are
researching for anybody it's all the
secretive work so don't just show off on
their Twitter or Facebook or anything
don't try to defame it's an amazing
field but the first thing that you have
to learn is that developer who has
created that I have or a website is not
a idiot guy okay remember that he knows
a lot more probably than you and what
you are looking forward here so first of
all give respect and you will have
respect and it's an amazing field I
would say if you can really learn a lot
of things and specially south
programming
so you can perform really good in there
okay let's pick up more questions okay I
have seen him and your radio video
however why not any startup
I don't know I'm probably not programmed
for the startup and hardship thing
I'm just a youtuber I like to create
content I like to write code I like to
make videos I have combined them and I'm
happy with that
so that's what I'm doing here is it easy
to get internship in Python there's no
such thing as easy or hard it all
depends on how much now that you have
how you can add your knowledge to that
company's benefit there you go you got
your internship or probably a job as
well okay so what's that new status says
hello sir hello what's that new status
what do you think about Django okay my
thought about Django it's probably the
easiest way or easiest door through
which you can get into the back-end
development everything is almost cooked
up and that's the reason why also the
startup chooses that but I think it's
the easiest entrance into the back-end
development obviously you can switch on
and Jake is fully compatible MySQL
PostgreSQL I ate all of that so it's so
much easier to work with the Django so
that's my I'll be around the other says
your IPL favorite team I haven't watched
IPL in a long long time and I have
absolutely I know that Tony is a captain
of Chennai team and I even don't know
who is the captain of Wrath on team I
have absolutely no idea so my preference
have changed as I mentioned my
preferences are moving towards being on
YouTube or online
that's the reason I am not watching much
of the TV I for probably months and
months I don't even turn on the TV
sometimes I just watch it because my
father is watching it and that's it okay
so which language should learn for web
designing HTML CSS J s must have without
this nothing is going to be happening
okay machine learning versus AI
difference I have looking forward to
make a video on that I think that's the
interesting subject a lot of
controversies may happen but I'm gonna
do it anyways and yeah most of the when
you have to sell a product you just
usually say it's an AI it's an
artificial intelligence but under the
hood it's all about deep learning and
machine learning and neural networks so
here you know the stuff scoop of
robotics as I always say is there is
scope of everything and there is no
scope for everything both the statement
of a truth it all depends on how much
knowledge you have what are your
applications and how much you are
skilled on okay your thoughts and
certification hey and mold my thoughts
and certification are already uploaded
on my channel goes look into my archive
and you'll find the videos there okay is
Jango enough for back-end development
oh yeah it's it's almost more than
enough what you'll be needing but of
course if you say that page amber is
more than enough and I believe you are
saying that you have at least knowledge
of one kind of database because along
the Chango cannot do much you should
have a knowledge of any one database
probably MySQL is the easiest one
Armando for space whatever that is you
need to have at least one knowledge of
one platform
shavoo deep says okay there is the super
chat how to learn effectively and become
master in react need to build apps and
improve logic building please some time
tell some exercise to practice and
improve thank you so much for super chat
are the first thing I would say is
go through with my 10 apps that I build
the react needed course that was a lot
of front-end stuff that I have designed
there once you take this course now
building any component would be a piece
of cake even we have designed a fully UI
for YouTube so that's going to help you
to understand the front-end part once
you have done that then you can focus on
your regular stuff like firebase or
other things and one thing that I would
say that will at least two clones in
that one can be like you're probably a
snapchat or maybe whatsapp just build an
exact tool for that don't upload that
otherwise your account may get banned
just keep it with you or maybe on the
github and the second one would be
something a little bit more like
Instagram or Facebook or Twitter once
you're able to build these things I
think you can call yourself as totally
professionally you ready and you can go
after that dude you got there - sir oh
yes I do have a tattoo couple of them I
usually don't show them but yes I have a
tattoo two of them and probably in the
future I might get one more as well so
yeah pronouncing your job I think
YouTube YouTube is good stuff
yeah freelancing is I personally
Illuminati yeah I get a lot of that
Illuminati stuff on my comments on a
YouTube
I check them and by the way I checked
almost all of the comments okay so any
videos on networking no as of now we
haven't plan any of any of that hey game
aboard thank you so much for the super
chat it's a check working is the
streaming working good okay so which is
better for back end Django or no Geus
both a great depends on how you want to
implement that both are amazing easier
is Django for a beginner and
professional one might be choosing any
one of them it's not a big deal
Django versus PHP which one to choose if
you're an absolute beginner Django can
be really easier for you / yes you can
choose the flash as well but I would say
if you're choosing something which is
based on Python
for Django okay so a random programmer
says how do we manage your time for all
these things probably because I would
love to do all of that and probably I
just sleep very very less I just try to
grab time for all of that
so probably that's one reason and the
fact is that the love that I'm getting
from this community is actually well the
reason to keep me boosting and all the
time now I'm thinking about how I can
serve more how I can push more videos to
YouTube that are actually meaningful for
everyone how I can have more values to
the courses this is all going on so how
long usually probably like five hours or
so usually but on Sundays or something
like that I usually take like eight or
ten hours of sleep sometime
but usually it's mostly like five hours
or something and if I'm traveling that
may reduce down to sometimes with four
hours probably days I don't sleep much
so that's how everybody does that
ok-ran 4ml you don't need a high end RAM
for machine learning in my course at
least if you have to like four gigs of
RAM that's likely enough but if you want
to do some high-end fancy stuff like
using tensorflow or something involving
of the GPU probably millions and
millions of lines of financial data you
want to analyze that so that's the thing
you should be doing up thank you so much
for the super chat that's technical guru
Kannada I hope I've seen that right I
hope so
okay so thank you so much for the super
chat hi - cruise ship around here back
again
hey chef Rob thank you so much for
joining us
I want to enroll in machine learning
course go ahead go to course the stop
learn code online dot in and you can
join there please make a course and
enough structure and algorithm I was
thinking about it today because a lot of
requests came up but I wanted to do a
little bit more just having a course on
algorithms and key you these things I
don't think I think I can do better than
that so that's what I'm looking for we
start just like few algorithms being
explained I want you to do
little bit more so that's why you know I
am thinking still on to it
discount on m ml discount is already
applied so you can just go there and
it's already applied do we have team I
don't have like bigger team I usually am
a one-man army
but I do consult with a very close
person to me he doesn't know anything
about tech but still I do consider
everything with him although he doesn't
understand Italy but it gives me another
perspective on the things so usually
it's just one man army and that's the
reason I'm so much productive as of now
because everything every string is under
my control that's what I like okay so is
it possible to make apps using Python
yes there is one framework I don't
recommend that because it's not very
helpful so I would say don't spend much
of the time there instead choose
something else like flutter or react
native or capacitor is there Severn is
there so instead you can choose on there
so whom curse they still tell how you
get up at 4:30 head and be fresh and
productive just think about like
something when I get out the first part
that automatically comes to my mind is
how can I be more productive today how
can I do something which is amazing with
my life and that's the thought always
keeps on going on and how can I go on
till YouTube hi can I steal some time
and honestly this thing that I've
started on my Facebook like day 1 day 2
indeed hitting one of the big impact
that they have given to me is
productivity second is YouTube the more
I come on YouTube the more productive I
become and I think that's what makes me
I love what I do and that's what keeps
me fresh even when I get up at 4:30 or
maybe five or six or whatever time is I
love spending time here I always wanted
to do it so that's it okay so let's pick
a couple of more questions hey guys you
forgot to hit the thumbs up there so go
ahead please hit the thumbs up it's
always amazing
have some up here okay so people have
started to give light there I know some
of you forgot almost there as a youtuber
it's my responsibility to keep you
bugging with the likes and subscribe I
do that sir-sir internship second year
CSC okay there's the super chair from
Ramon saying what to do to get a job
I have PHP freelancer but no degree yet
please help if you're a freelancer I
think you already are onto a better
position it's not like all the degrees
and stuff one thing that I can recommend
to you if your PHP developer already
learn how to develop plugins of
WordPress as well so go ahead and start
doing that and that will make your life
easier because there are a lot of big
companies who are big into freelancer
and are making a lot of WordPress
websites and plugins and all of that so
I highly recommend you to check out how
you can make themes on WordPress as well
as plugin this is going to be super
helpful for you
okay so issue say is thank you so much
issue issue say sometimes feel motivated
sometimes not you know what I don't
always feel motivated there are low
stand-ups in everybody's life so don't
just assume that I am always like
alright Here I am always like mostly
productive and happy but there are
always lows enough so don't worry too
much about it the good thing and the bad
thing about the time is it's not going
to remain the same and that's a good
thing and bad thing about time so don't
be this motivated unless and until you
have like good clothes to be here you
have food to eat that's it that's that's
all all things that matter at the most
and that's all I can say about it okay
so let's pick up more question okay so
technical guru Canada thank you so much
for the super chat says how to build
custom wrong for Android Easter
honestly I am NOT into building up
custom wrong thank you so much for the
super chat but I'm not into it so I'm
not be guiding you into any long path
simply saying I'm not into it I'm not a
master for that so probably this
question is not good for me and then
sometimes it's really hard that he makes
which I'll ask a question and I'm not
able to answer but you know I always
prefer to be honest as compared to just
guiding you into any path that's what I
prefer
what are your golden moment well
programming
I couldn't movement is something when I
have done a project and I'm breaking it
again for recovering and that recording
is done that means I have worked on the
project twice
that's my golden moment it's done it's
working that's that's very awesome
because once you build a project and
once you break it down again for
teaching purposes it doesn't work
sometimes that's what I can say I can be
good with okay can be good with iOS as
well as Android developer parallel yes
of course of course why not
okay so romance' is completed 30% of the
machine learning boot yeah it's awesome
thank you so much I am really happy that
you're enjoying it and learning it trust
me after after this once you have
completed like 100% right now on your on
your xxx once you'll be done with 100%
you will be saying that yes now I can
deal up with anything on machine
learning or even it will be taking other
folks or courses it will feel like a
breeze it will be all good with video
that was the main goal of that course
SQL scope listen Michelle SQL is going
to be here for a very very very long
time so there is no such point in asking
SQL has a scope or not SQL is going to
be the walking thing every programmer
it's like everybody should know SQL okay
there is no exception whether you are
working on mobile whether you're working
on there or maybe iOS Android whatever
because the core skills of how to query
with the database always are helpful
whether that's Mongo Postgres maybe our
other some know SQL or maybe - Gilberto
that is SQL hands down it should always
be there okay so that's nice one
roses are red violets are blue
unexpected curly braces on line 32
Tricia I like that that is awesome
I love that thank you so much
Amita Jane for the super chat I
appreciate that okay so machine learning
course is super super awesome it is very
helpful thank you so much
what are the advantages of PHP / Django
in the PHP have to write everything on
your own but that's an advantage for PHP
because you'll be learning a lot but in
the Django you don't have to write you
much of the code everything is already
being cooked up here if you just call
them or integrate them and walleye it's
done so it's less code more work done in
Django
big nerves fields - really really
awesome and amazing there but if you're
a kind of a guy who likes to like go the
hard cold way like I'm going to be
writing everything on my own then in PHP
might be good for you okay so probably
we can take a couple of more questions
and because I do have a quick travel so
I won't be able to take much of the
questions just a couple of more so let's
pick a couple of more questions is -
good for machine learning course hm then
I cannot make comment on any other
instructor or website I'm at a position
on YouTube which is a public platform
easily people can misunderstand what I'm
saying about other professors or courses
or website so that's why I i don't
really say anything about that so sorry
height age I don't know much about
Python can I add role in machine
learning hey CY you don't need to be an
expert or guru in Python just basically
datatype functions and loop even if
you're not comfortable in not playing
ever fade in the free promo video this
course is not for you first you should
go in Python but if you think you can
write like probably a basic loop a
simple function and some if and else
condition that's I think is enough for
you and rest you will be learning in the
course itself I do have a refresher in
that course okay so meet sony says how
to become entrepreneur like you I meet I
don't consider myself as an entrepreneur
and opinions are usually like the code
suit worrying about fundings and stuff I
I don't consider myself as an
entrepreneur I am just a freelancer who
works on a variety of projects love to
switch into technology a lot and that's
about the reason I'm still staying as a
freelancer I don't want to stick with
just one deck I want to keep on
switching I want to learn everything
that's new and on top of that I would
like to call myself more over Azzam as a
youtuber that's probably a better
definition for me programming
youtuber I would love to be called as
that okay so is the internship from
valuable I'll be now again I cannot
mention anybody's name here probably yes
probably no I cannot say anything about
it okay so let's pick up just probably
one or two more so it's gonna be really
fast and trying to meet some of them but
it's really hard how many hi how are you
copy/paste in programming let's just
take this one one final question
copy paste in programming is totally
totally fine I do have my friends at
Amazon yes amazon.com the u.s. one I do
have my friends on Expedia I do have
friends in facebook as well everybody
copies and pastes nobody's like a genius
who is never going to be looking into
blogs or Stack Overflow everybody copies
and pastes because it's not just copy
and pasting it's copying the correct
code because there are tons of them
first of all and then implementing into
your your logic so you'll be changing
lots of variables lot of flow of the
program it's completely ok if you're
boring some code and having that but if
you're boring it tons of library then
probably you might have to give credit
to that for the poly not so yeah that's
it if you're copying and pasting don't
worry about it it's totally fine at
least you have skills of finding out
that specific coded it it requires a
special ID to find out exact code and
then edit that and go through with that
yeah ok so I think that's it I'm
probably getting a little bit late there
so that's it and please check out
learning code online dot and I have an
amazing courses library there the recent
one is on the machine learning if you
have any more questions shoot me on my
Facebook page or you can join such my I
supposed on the youtube comment as well
so that's it
for this amazing celery light and we did
it successfully on attempt two so let me
say bye to a lot of you hey buy it open
my top on bye
okay it's gone by animation Roy by
hearin by machine by Tyrone avinash more
cienaga
it's it's kinda it's going really crazy
fast don't forget to hit that like
button
hey I gotta say Irish hey Siobhan my
beeper I use
hunkers it's going crazy fast I've never
seen this much fast here bye bye bye
everyone bye a mode by ownership by
bearish by Hersh by prepping my gosh and
more nourish my group rate okay bye bye
we keep coding the whole idea is it
doesn't really matter from where you are
learning which book which courses which
website the point is make sure you learn
programming so that you can make your
life better the more you are going to be
learning it's more cool you are going to
be making your life better in the future
so don't hesitate keep on learning
whatever the platform is whatever the
resources important point is keep
learning and keep coding that's it bye
bye good night and thank you so much all
of you for joining up give the thumbs up
and make sure you subscribe to the
