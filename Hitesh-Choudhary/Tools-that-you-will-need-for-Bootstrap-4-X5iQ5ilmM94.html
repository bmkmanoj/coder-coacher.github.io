bootstrap full course so now that
basically you understand what is
bootstrap and just to remind you quickly
just a free written CSS written by
somebody else that we can use in our
project and that's basically it so what
we're going to need is to get started
with the bootstrap now the very first
thing that I would HIGHLY highly
recommend to each and everybody is get
bootstrap calm now as at the time of
this recording it just says oh yeah
bootstrap is coming and then you will be
watching these videos bootstrap will be
fully launched there but you need to go
into the bootstrap folders coming right
now and notice this is currently three
point three point seven version and we
are always going to work in bootstrap
fold in this curve so now it's done
alpha six but yours is going to be
exactly same you don't need to worry
about anything
there will be exact same things that you
need to do okay so this is the official
documentation which you will not need to
read much of the time but still in case
you want to reference anything there is
a documentation that you can go ahead by
the way you don't need it because I'm
here to help you out now another
interesting point that we need a ver we
are going to write our code now I expect
that you might be coming up from HTML or
maybe a little bit CSS background and
you might already have a favorite text
editor there but for this entire
training I'm going to be using Adam now
recently I switched in on to the Adam a
few months ago I guess six or seven
months ago and I totally loved it now
this is available for all platforms
Linux Mac and Windows and I totally love
it one of the reason I love it is
because it's completely hackable means
it's completely designed in HTML CSS and
GS and you can completely rewrite that
and there are tons of packages for that
okay so this is what I'll be using and
also you will need a browser for this I
will be using Chrome because I love love
the chrome developer tools in here but
again if you had a Firefox fan or baby
maybe just saying you might be an
Internet Explorer
or ham there if that's the case hey go
ahead for this training please use the
chrome not Internet Explorer okay
and in case you don't want to use Adam I
don't know what that reason is but in
case you are not a big fan of Adam then
always there is another option like
brackets which you can use again
cross-platform and freely available
there and after that there is the
sublime text now in case you are the
sublime fan hate you are not going to be
switching anything else so feel free to
use sublime text as well in case you had
a die-hard fan of subline there now this
was a quick video obviously I know
because we just want to grab the tools
there
so go ahead download the Adams as well
and I'll also walk you through with a
couple of settings that you need to do
with the atoms okay so let me fire up my
atom it's somewhere it's here so this is
the atom that we have and there are a
couple of packages that I expect you to
have okay so go into your atom and click
on to the Preferences if you're in the
Windows it might be into Windows and
preferences there now Adam comes with a
lot of packages and settings there now
we will be installing a couple of tacket
is there now my packages are already
installed there so I'll walk you through
how you need to do that now you have to
go in to install click on the packages
and you'll see something like this when
you'll search on that and you just have
to click on the install and there you go
the package will be installed so what
are the packages we are looking for now
the first package that we are looking
for is Adam live server it's by Jess
Chan and this is the one I'm looking for
what it gives you if you go into the
package it gives you live server now
what is the live server now life is so
much easier than the web development
when you don't have to reload the page
again and again and this live server
just does the same thing you don't have
to reload your page hundred times after
every save it does automatically this
thing for you quite a handy tool now
first thing is Adam live server then the
next thing that we are going to need is
Emmet EE mm et it's by Amitai oh now
this is kind of a hack for HTML and CSS
and by the way we do have a free course
on Emmet but you don't need it as of now
I'll be walking you through with a lot
of things in the Emmett on the go it is
there I'll I'll walk you through with
the usage of everything there as well
now also I do have file I can this is
just for the fancy I can purposes no
extra usage there that you want to have
and one and the final one is pigments
now what does pigment does pigment just
display the color in your project file
and I'll walk you through in the CSS
that whatever the color we are writing
in the hash C 1 C 1 C 1 it automatically
shows us what color that is okay
and yes I know there are a lot of
plugins packages are installed on my
system you don't need all of them
because I do work on react and Python
quite a lot so that is why other
packages are here ok so this is
officially over why I am saying
officially over because some people like
to use my teams as well now by my teams
these are not created by me these are
just I like to use now throughout the
course I'll be using the default theme
of one dark one dark by the way there if
you are not a big fan of light themes
there is a dark theme but it's so much
harsh on my eyes so I like to use one
dark because we will be spending a lot
of time on the code editor and it should
be soothing to the eyes in case you are
a sublime fan then there is a mono chi
team available as well you can choose
one dark and click on the mono chi again
you have to install it and this looks
like kind of sublime text no big deal
and I'm going to go one dark again this
looks good again to install that click
on the install search for mono Chi and
click on the themes and there you go
that's it
also there are a couple of settings let
me just walk you through go into your
editor and what I want you to do is
click on this guy scroll past end a very
good thing that everybody should have I
think so but this is I would love to
have it not super compulsion but I think
it's good to have it and this is the
official to over about what we need in
the atom that we want to have again just
onto a quick revision we have talked
about the basic documentation on
bootstrap I'll be using atom I'll be
using Chrome you can use brackets or
sublime text too in case that is what
suits you a few
packages that we need for the atom is
emit a live server and that's pretty
much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
