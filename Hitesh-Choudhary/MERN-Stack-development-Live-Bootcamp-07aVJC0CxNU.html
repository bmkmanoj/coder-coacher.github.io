with another video and in this video I
want to share one amazing exciting news
so in case you are interested in
becoming a full-stack Marin developer
then this video should interest you a
little bit now the morn stack stands for
your Mongo Express react and nodejs
so in case you are interested in these
technologies and want to become a full
stack developer then please watch this
video this video is about my upcoming
live bootcamp on the Marin stack so let
me give you first a little bit history
detail how this bootcamp actually was
created so recently a group of 22
students from Greece asked me that hey
Tish we would like to learn from you
about myrn stack so can you prepare a
bootcamp for us about these myrn stack
and I said hey give me some time and I
can surely do what I can do so after
like 15 or 20 days of work we are coming
up with an application on full stack
modern development first and foremost
what will be preparing in this bootcamp
now this bootcamp is totally dependent
on the application that we are designing
so we'll be using Mongo to design as a
database for this particular stack and
first let me explain what this
application is in this application user
can sign up and login into an
application and on that application user
can ask any question now based on that
question other users can upload and
download their questions and also can
post a reply yes of course I took
inspiration from Stack Overflow for
designing this application also user
will be able to fetch their github user
ID and once they fetch that we'll be
fetching all the repositories from their
github account we have previously done
that in one of my react course but we'll
be redesigning that from the scratch so
we will be fetching all that information
from github and that will be creating a
user account there so for this entire
stack of application will be using Mongo
and node as a back-end we will be
following the all modern standards of
designing any application which includes
a lot of API so yes we will be designing
a lot of API is using Mongo and nodes so
that can be fetched into our react now
on the front-end we will be using
totally a JavaScript front-end and the
backend as well so we'll be walking
through with the react and of course to
make things a little bit more simpler
and scalable we'll be using
Redux as well and after that finally
we'll be putting up all this application
on to Heroku so that you can learn and
understand how these applications are
deployed on a website and is ready to
serve probably thousands and thousands
of users so if this all sounds
interesting to you yep that's what we
will be doing the only prerequisite for
this course is JavaScript knowledge so
in case you have been following me along
on my youtube channel and you have taken
up the JavaScript totally here or on my
website you are totally fine as a as a
knowledge perspective also we'll be
using a little bit of HTML and CSS so in
case you have that existing knowledge
that will be super helpful in case you
have taken my front-end developer
bootcamp you should be more than ready
to take this course now let me explain
you a little bit more detail now this is
not a recorded course session this is
going to be a live bootcamp so I'll be
providing a link through which you can
join up into this particular course you
will be able to see me live along with
other students as well joining up you
will be able to join up discussion and
these are not gonna be typing discussion
you can ask your questions by just your
voice and regular stuff how we ask the
questions and I will be writing all the
codes in front of you know copy pasting
of the code you can point me at any
point of time and can ask more details
about the code or whatever I'm writing
on the screen every single day we will
be spending - are into writing this
application and after that probably 30
minutes or 45 minutes on your questions
that you have now there are a few things
before you join this course here should
be aware of now in this entire live
bootcamp there will be no video sessions
and I will not be providing you any
videos here so you have to take your
notes and build your application surely
you can share your code with me and can
figure out what are the mistakes you are
making and all these things in
discussion will be happening no problem
at all in that okay so this all sounds
interesting to you let me also tell you
that there are some of the things that
you should also know now first and
foremost this is a course designed and
dedicated for this particular
application that I just mentioned in
case you are wondering that hey I have
my personal application lying around
there and I can just get into this boot
camp and sneekly ask the questions about
my particular application no that's not
going to happen we will be
on this application and design of this
application obviously I hope you can
understand that if I will be taking your
personal project into this boot camp
then I'll be totally designing your
projects and will not be able to focus
on my particular work that I really want
to share so that's going to be number
one point number two point is to avoid
unnecessary audience and who are those
who are not interested in learning
itself there will be no certification
provided in this live boot camp this
going to be pure knowledge and pure
application building process no
certification at all and third in the
most important thing which is we do have
limited seats since 22 students are from
the Greece which are joining up of
course they are the whole reason why we
have designed this boot camp and three
students are personal favorite you can
say and they'll be joining us from
United States they were first living in
India now they have moved to United
States and they also wanted to join this
boot camp so we do have 25 seats already
filled up and I cannot take more than
thirty students because I think that's
my ability and limitation to figure out
and answer each one of you so turdy
students is the max that I'll be taking
because obviously I have to answer your
questions and figure out your problems
and this will be a lot of work that I'll
be doing in the upcoming days so how
we'll be starting this boot camp this
boot camp will start from 2nd of May
every single day we will be spending
like two or two-and-a-half hour of every
single day I'm expecting this boot camp
to be finished by 10 days but there can
be a little bit like extended of that
but no more than 12 days in every
condition we'll be finishing up in 12
days but I'm expecting it to finish up
in 10 days so there is gonna be a lot of
regular work a lot of things that you'll
be reading aloud a lot of assignments
that I'll be giving you it's gonna be a
full pack of knowledge based course so
coming up to the point yes there are
charges for joining up this course in
case you are free bird' hang around on
the youtube learned from other resources
no problem at all will be still posting
some of the videos on JavaScript on my
youtube channel feel free to check them
out but this course comes with a simple
pricing and we are slashing down the
pricing to 50% off
usually it's 12,000 rupees almost as in
indian rupees
we are slashing down death to 6000
rupees in case you are thinking that hey
it's your taking charges for that I also
have to pay my bills for all these
equipments and my internet bills my food
bills and stuff like that so yes I'll be
taking a small fees of 6000 rupees for
that in case you are not interested
that's totally fine but the seats are
limited only for five students and this
is the first time I'm opening up my
doors of my live boot camps to Indian
audience so feel free to enjoy and in
case you are wondering about the quality
of my teachings teaching style or
bootcamp feel free to check out my
courses on youtube or probably other
platforms there we have two you might
have seen me there as well as on my
website learned code online . --an so
these are the updates that I wanted to
share you I'm super super excited for
this boot camp and that's it let's get
started and I'll surely catch you up in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
