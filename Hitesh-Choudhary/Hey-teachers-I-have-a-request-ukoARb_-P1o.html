title of this video but today I have
something special but why all of the
sudden thing in here now this is because
I met somebody special today and she
reminded me of a lot of things and yes
really it is important now I need to
figure out a way to present this
properly so that it makes it interesting
as well as I just convey my message in
here so let's figure out something
okay let me tell you a quick fact in
here that people or students especially
the student remember only those teachers
who are kind not the people who are mean
to them now today I saw one of my school
teacher perhaps from fourth or fifth
class in the school days it's it's a
long time and I asked I just saw her in
the mall and I asked her - hey ma'am can
we have coffee I want to sit together
have some words with you and she is
still so much kind so much generous I
cannot believe that I saw her today it
was so much overwhelming experience it
was so awesome I really felt really good
that I I went caught a coffee with her
and it it was so awesome completely now
one thing that caught my attention in
here that why do I remember her I
remember her because she was so kind let
me tell you one quick thing I haven't
been open so much with anybody in here
but I feel like I I have to share this
now when I was in my school time I was
completely broke my family was
completely broke we didn't have enough
money to buy books or even to school
lunch now she was always kind to me why
other teachers were bothering me that
hey why are you not bringing the books
to the school you are some lazy guy out
there but she understood that he's not
having enough money to buy the books she
understood that and she gave me her book
she even shared sometimes lunch with me
and what even caught my attention that
now I'm doing pretty good and I asked
her coffee I was paying the bill there
and she even didn't allowed me to pay
the bill she paid the bill and that
actually caught my attention now if I go
back to my college days I would like to
say to all the teachers that oh why are
you being so much rude - there's so many
people because I see in a lot of college
universities people get rude teachers
get rude I'm not seeing all the people I
still do remember some of the teachers
who are still very good friend of mine
they are very kind always have been
supporting to me even try it some of
them helped me to just sit in the exams
even though my attendance was short and
all these things I do
them but what I don't like about the
teachers is all those teachers who were
rude to me mean to me I might be saying
this but hey this this was the fact
actually and to all those people who are
teaching in the Universities let me tell
you a fact in here if you have chosen
the career as a teacher your number one
job is to be kind now if you cannot be
kind if you want to show extra
strictness there perhaps you have chosen
a wrong thing in here you are not at all
a good teacher number one job is to be
kind so that if the teacher is going to
be kind then only student can just
approach him drop him a mail can ask the
questions can share the problems and
everybody wants to be a topper why don't
you get one thing in your head that
everybody every single student wants to
be a topper wants to perform well but
some students are not able to perform
well because they do have some issues
and if you are not being kind enough if
you are not being emotional with those
students then obviously they are not
going to come to you and are not going
to share their problem video so make
sure you understand every single
students who want to perform really well
some are doing because they can some are
not because they cannot and you need to
go to them ask to them that hey if I re
not performing well that's the job of a
teacher whether it's a school it's a
college or anything so make sure you get
that now I'm here nobody to tell
whatever I am telling in here I am in no
position to guide those so much awesome
and brilliant teachers who are doing a
great job in those universities but I'm
the teacher I'm not telling you how to
teach or anything like that all I'm just
saying is be kind to those students they
are just here for four years or maybe
some five years as well but it's just
that that's it not more than four years
or five years make sure you give them
some good memories they're good things
there so that when they just meet you up
on the Samal maybe in some conference
they just remember you and they're only
going to remember you if you'll be kind
okay I hope you got that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
