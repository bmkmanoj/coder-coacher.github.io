they are not here to discuss and have a
debate about the names we are here to
give an information video about what
I'll be Ransome there's how do they
affect your system can you get back your
system or most importantly how they are
spreading into a such a large scale in
every computer out there and also we are
going to discuss about what all the
preventive measures that you can take to
get rid of this ransomware in here so
let's get started and roll that intro
hey you did everyone they shear back
again with another video if this channel
we talk about programming web apps
mobile apps and pretty much everything
related to technologies in case you are
new here do consider subscribing now
let's come back and talk about what are
these ransom layers now first of all a
lot of you might be asking Who am I to
talk about these Remsen where's now I
have been into information security for
quite a long time a lot of people know
me about information security I have
been presenting these demonstrations in
a lot of college university seminars
corporate seminars quite a long time in
here also I'm a programmer and I do
write code for web application and
mobile apps like iOS and Android as well
so pretty decent little decent person to
talk about these ransom bears so let's
get started
now before we begin and talk about what
are these ransom bears it is very
important to understand about what are
these trojans because these are the base
lines of these ransom bears basically
they are the modified versions of the
old trojans you might have heard about
the Trojan horse back in a long time ago
so we will understand the concepts first
and then we will take care of how these
are spreading and when did the first
outbreak happened out there so let's
talk about it now very first thing is
what are the Trojans now totem is
nothing you might have heard about the
remote software support as well in which
you just take a control of another
computer and just do help the people or
do things like that and Trojan is
exactly the same but the only problem
with the Trojan is the user is not aware
of the system that their system is being
taken care by somebody else so that's
your basically Trojan you can do
shutdowns you can transfer files can
import the files export the files
whatever you want to do now ransomware
is another just a highbreed of the
Trojans a little bit advanced what they
do they somehow get into your system
I'll talk about how they get into your
system as well but somehow they get into
your system and now they take control of
your computer basically what ransomware
does is take care of your computer get
into your computer try to spread into
multiple land networks from which your
computer is being connected and once
they have done a reach to the end
of the lenss they try to encrypt every
file into your computer they change
their extensions and encrypt everything
into their they they target pretty much
a large area of the file like dark file
your video files your excel files your
paypal notebooks and pretty much
everything they target everything and
finally when all the files are being
encrypted they just lock out to you or
you from your computer and say hey pay
this much of the amount and we are going
to free your computer kind of a
kidnapping and but this time the
kidnapping is done by kidnapping of your
computer and it's a virtual world the
computer is not being taken manually
it's being taken virtually so this is
basically your ransomware now the most
important question is how does they
actually get into your system now most
of the time this is being done by
sending UF file now it's not like that
it will happen magically there now
somehow the files needs to be delivered
to your computer it can be physically or
virtually physically a person just comes
onto your computer plugs in the pendrive
and there we go voila the autorun will
does all the things in here now also
sometimes these files are delivered by a
document being attached in the email or
some file being automatically download
when you visit some malicious file to
download some unethical softwares as
well so these things also happen now
until unless you allow those files to
enter into your computer nothing will
happen at all but we all are human
beings we do need file to interact with
things for example when my clients send
me a docs we need to have to open these
docs so it is very important that you
open up all those emails and dart files
when only and only they are coming from
a trusted resource now what are the
things which we follow up in here me and
along with my interns which just work on
some things I always advise them to keep
a virtual box or virtual machine in
their system running something like
Ubuntu or some Linux like that system
whatever it is and when I was a client
or new client approaches us we trying to
open up all of the document documents in
there in that file usually we ask the
client to just put every information
into Google Docs which we have made only
paste them there so that
you can check them and Google manages
security for us but usually what we do
is open up a virtual machine and all
open all the documents and everything
into that machine so that it's a
sandboxing environment and our main
system doesn't get affected now also I
would like to say that this video is
only for the windows guys because this
ransomware is affecting only on the
windows users so Mac users you can get
back to whatever the designing part or
coding part you have been doing and
Linux guys you can just get back and
keep finding whatever the drivers you
are looking on so just do that keep
doing that okay now what does this wanna
cry and wanna cut now so far the talk
was only about the general idea of the
ransomware
now recently a very high-end high tech
banach rip ransomware has been into the
outbreak and it has been doing a lot of
massive massacres in there and it does
it got famous about after the UK's
health center it got a tag it attacked
the UK's health center and a very big
logistic company FedEx and after those
attacks the incident got right into the
media and now there is such a have I
think now obviously this ransomware is
spreading quite quite a speed Lee and
overhit have a got hit over more than 70
countries so it's a little bit were a
time but now since you have been into
this talk and in this discussion about
how these ransomware is spread you can
actually take a lot of preventive
measures as well like you know that
first and foremost it needs to be access
to your computer while some malicious
email or some unexpected lottery email
or some an unexpected job offer just
like that so please when you open up any
anything any document or attached file
be make sure that you are very very
quirky about that now one of the main
reasons why this ransomware spreading
around is because people haven't updated
their Windows system now a lot of people
a lot of people this is the truth in
here in India a lot of people just run
the Windows version which is not legal
in here which is just violated so of
course Windows doesn't care for you
obviously it shouldn't be because you
haven't purchased the software so
you get encrypted nobody is there to
take care of you now for those people
who have actually purchased the windows
there is an update already being
released so that you can just update
your securities and BitDefender and can
get rid of that now for all those
tech-savvy people it is just like m/s
zero eight zero six seven which you have
seen in the previous good old days of
the windows just the same exploit has
been used almost the same I would not
call it just exactly same but yes almost
the same the same vulnerability SMB is
being exploited again and some people
call it that this one durability or
exploit has been designed by NSA
allegedly by NSA and is being known as a
lot of name blue stacks and blue strings
and a lot of names are there but some
people are calling allegedly being
designed by NSA so that's the pure Tech
Talk in there but again my whole idea of
saving this thing is who are responsible
because this is being attacked quite a
lot and this is spreading quite a lot
number one people who are responsible
for them are the people who doesn't
update the software whenever you get an
update in Windows whether it's a
security update or any kind of update
you should be making an update and
number two people who are responsible
for that are Windows guys now not not
because they have designed a crappy
software because the the frequency or
the way that did they flow out the
update is really really pathetic this
shouldn't be done like that like every
other day there is an update and if
you'll just roll out every other day and
update people will just get frustrated
and will just turn off their update and
that's the reason why things are getting
so Windows you are also responsible of
throwing just randomly updates and
updates on updates
check out the linux check out the
windows they just roll out the updates
or the version release on a specific
duration amount of time and they just
pack up all of their update and just
roll them out once and and be equal once
in a month or just like that
so windows go ahead make more creepy
softwares and these things will happen
quite a lot in there ransomware is just
the start of the things ok so just on to
a final note I would like to say one
more thing in here that if you pay this
amount to
ransomware guys with just larger
computer when you get your system back I
would say the chances of that are point
zero zero zero one let's just say for
the sake of positivity in here that you
get your system but the problem is they
are
untrackable because of the day of the
money they are using they are not using
your credit cards they are not using
your debit cards they are using bitcoins
which is anonymous money online in here
and one of the reasons why people are
not in favor of the bitcoins is because
of this they are having ransomware
kidnapping they can just ask me in the
bitcoins and that is almost untrackable
almost untrackable so even if you pay
there are very less chances that you
will get the system back very very less
so the solution is just format your
computers and get back to work again in
case you haven't been taking backups or
putting things on things like Dropbox or
maybe onedrive thing things are bad for
you I can understand your pain but
that's that's the life of the cyber
security being impacting every day's
life in here ok so just on to a quick
update let's just summarize what we have
discussed in here first of all ransom
waves are just a modified version of the
Trojans they just encrypt your computer
and ask money in just for unlocking your
computer again even if you pay there are
very less chances that you will get your
computer back and actually that's that's
kind of pushing the things into the
wrong direction if you pay they will get
some kind of confidence that yes we are
getting paid and we'll get into the news
again ok so this was all a quick talk I
have just equipped quite a little techy
things as well like SMB s and exploits
all these things if you didn't get that
nobody is quite it's ok but now you are
a good person who understand about the
ransomware so what are you waiting for
share this video with your friends so
that they can get aware about these
rants and where's share it with your
family so that they can get educated
about these ransom layers make sure the
education is reaching to every proper
people who just needs it share this
