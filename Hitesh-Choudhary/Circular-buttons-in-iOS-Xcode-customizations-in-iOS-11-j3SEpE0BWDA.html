training so iOS 11 is so much fun to
work and this is this is not a specific
feature for iOS 11 but what we are going
to do in this video is we're going to
learn how we can customize our Xcode so
that whenever we need something we can
actually do it from the Xcode itself and
rather just creating new classes and
adding all those properties and
viewdidload and other stuff what we are
going to do is we are going to create a
customized circle around our buttons and
that is going to be a fun and exciting
thing to do let me also show you what I
have created some assets for you and
just like always all these assets are
completely free for you even for the
commercial purpose so I have created a
lot of them and I will include a lot of
them in your assets file as well so go
into the constraints and the circles is
going to be our app and let me open the
sketch here I happen to work in the
sketch all the time kind of a Photoshop
is stuff it's a good if you had a pro
Photoshop guy it's okay you can keep on
working with that I happen to work in
the sketch so this is the UI that we
will be creating exactly the same but
there are a couple of ways to handle
this situation here for example you can
ask your designer to actually export
these icons together so that the circle
appears there and we can then customize
the height size and everything just
right there that is going to be one way
of situation handling the things but we
are not here for that we are here to
learn the things on the hard way and
we're going to learn how we can create
new classes and can customize our Xcode
for that so we will have a UI something
like this and then we realize that hey
we need to add the circles there and
we'll be doing that looks amazingly and
exciting there okay now also I have
exported these backgrounds which are
recently okay
I'll call it a good job just for a 15
minutes or something so this is my Mac
and this is my phone icons again all
free for you so this is what we are
going to have and let's close this let's
open up our Xcode beta and create a
fresh fresh project for this guy come on
open up the Xcode beta for me there is
that guy okay there we go and always
allow always allow so this is the
project that we have button
Circle and it's ready and it's already
being created its indexing but there is
nothing inside the project I will show
you the files and everything this is
what I have done you always do by going
file new and project and select that
single V project next and just name it
that's all what we have done but I have
tried to save a little bit time for you
but it's not allowing me by indexing it
okay looks good let's run this app and
it happened to be my simulator is not
running right now this is the beautiful
simulator of the Xcode loved it loved it
did you see a little bit of the red
glitch red glitch there probably that's
a beta bug okay let me show you the
files this is a review controller and
which is completely empty it's taking a
little bit while to settle down I have
okay there we go so this is what we have
and exactly the same nothing much here
and in a storyboard we have nothing at
all just blank storyboard there we go so
in the meantime it runs up let's
configure our UI here so we're going to
select an image view there drag and drop
this guy come on okay there we go drag
and drop this guy and we'll extend that
to full length let's add a little bit of
the constants not much not much so we're
going to pin it from 0 0 0 0 and should
add these constraint this guy is not
going anywhere so there we go just a
blank app let's stop this guy okay let's
bring our efforts if I can find them
somewhere there we go
and this is our assets and it's not like
that just open it for me come on there
we go we forgot to create I can no big
deal assets and the constraints circles
we are going to need all of you except
the sketch so let's drag and drop this
guy now we have 1 X 2 X 3 X image for
higher devices like iPhone 7 and by the
way it is don't need to get this one x
because Xcode now don't use 1x pages use
2x and 3x but they just haven't let's
just have it
so go to the main storyboard and let's
select this button and change that to
bTW there we go looks nice and now we're
going to have a button there we go let's
have a button here okay and this is
going to be a button with an image image
will be let's just have a Mac at the top
and once it has a Mac I like to delete
the button there title and there we go
now this is not looking good because the
constraints ratios our size is actually
not perfect so let's go into the size
inspector and change its size to I have
actually designed them for 50 by 50 and
that will look exactly what they were
meant to be we can actually place them
somewhere like this let's add a little
bit of the constraint so they look
decently good there and I want fixed
width and height as well this time and I
will also say that horizontally centered
in the container should be happy it is
okay that's one thing now I can actually
press command-d nope if I'll press
command D the costumes will get copy as
well I don't want to do that let's add a
new button there and yep that is good
let's make it 50 by 50 as well so 50 by
50 there we go okay nice and we need a
phone image there we can just delete
this button text and why is it not
looking 50 by 50 why why on the God's
green earth there we go 50 by 50 cool
and looks good now these are the good
and I would also like to add a few
constraints here so let's fix it from
left and right and up yeah left to right
it's actually fine let's have constant
weight tonight and also fix it from the
bottom so there we go is happy okay
let's run this on our iPhone and see if
we are making any good progress so far
should be looking decently good there we
go
we have a button nice animations there
looks good I am happy with this but now
we decided that hey you know what I want
to add a circle just outside this button
okay so how we can actually do that now
all although we can add these properties
here by going to the identity inspector
add a key path values here but we are
not going to be doing like that what we
are going to be doing is select this guy
right click and we're going to create a
new file here so new file that is going
to be a cocoa touch class next and it's
going to be from the subclass of a UI
button there so UI button and we're
going to call this as round just like
that round we don't need to create an
init file or something let's just click
on next
yeah just keep it there we are not
following any MVC or anything right now
otherwise I like to keep my all these
drawable designs things in a separate
folder but we're going to learn that
later on okay let's get rid of the
comments now okay now in order to show
everything on our Xcode right well first
of all we have to add a property that is
at the rate IV design above so let's
just do that
ib design a book that is one thing that
we have to do okay
now let's add few properties that are
required for a roundish button there and
these are simply corner radius border
width and border color that's it but in
order to show them on the right side of
this we have to add one more property
here which is IB inspectable so IB
inspectable okay and now we can set our
methods there so what we're going to do
is we're going to first of all create
available for that and we're going to
call this as corner radius corner radius
there we go
so corner radius it's going to be of
type CG float not just ordinary float
it's going to be
oops CG float there we go
okay now initially it's going to have a
value of zero it's a good idea but again
if you want all of the guys to have some
values you can always assign that
no big deal and once we have this we
want to set a property on it which is
dead set again the default one did set
okay it's not suggesting me no big deal
so this did set what it does it actually
applies the changes right just there so
as soon as you click on these changes
the changes will be shown to you in the
simulator there itself okay so that is
what we are going to do did set and
there we go and all you have to do is in
case you do remember in some of the
previous video I told you that you
always apply these things to the layer
so what you do is cells dot layer dot
and then you add these properties so
which is corner radius and set that to
whatever the value of this okay I can
get rid of that for a moment and you can
set that to whatever the corner radius
is okay so this looks good and should be
happy and now what we can do just to
test this out we have to add a couple of
more properties but I can go into the
main storyboard select this button bring
this guy back we can actually expand
this a little bit and now we can see
this is just having a uibutton class I
can drag and drop and select my round
button and since we have inherited from
UI button all the features of UI button
will be there but some of our
customizable will be there and if I go
into the inspector there by selecting
this of course the corner radius is
there now so we have added the
properties here and if I just go there
it can be added but what we are seeing
here is nothing because a corner radius
is there but since we have it at any
corner border-radius colors this is why
it's not showing but as soon as it shows
there it's it's okay it's fine
we can keep working on this guy okay now
what I need to do is add more properties
and one of them is border color
otherwise things are not going to be
shown so let's just have border color so
border color and border color is not
going to be CG float it's going to be
simply the UI color there so let's just
change it it's type UI color there we go
initially it's going to be clear so we
have a dot clear there we get that clear
okay looks good and we have to change
this guy as well because it's not going
to be just like that it's going to be
self dot radius got a border color there
we go is going to be equal to border
color sounds sound simple yeah it is a
border color what is your problem CG
color fix that okay you want to cast
that as a further go ahead do that you
should be good as okay and okay so it's
again okay what I can do here is I can
fix this guy with a little bit better
things here and I can see that CG color
now this guy should be happy yes again
you can cast that as well or you can
just add a dot property if it's not
happy
okay CG color and yeah this is my bad it
should be smaller one CG color okay now
it is happy my bad my bad
should be looking good now good and fine
corner radius border color we didn't add
the border of it so let's get bothered
with as well we forgot that get that by
the way you can add more properties like
if you want to change the colors on the
go maybe add some bit just like that
they are there but still if you want to
add that you can do so this is just a
way of how you can customize the thing
and adding these I mean spectable and IV
design herbal is super important I've
inspected will is responsible of showing
that on the right 10 bar see see okay so
this is going to be border of it and
this is going to be I think all of this
is going to be CG float so I can copy
this guy border width is going to be
come on let me add CG float there zeg
float initial value yeah of course we
know that's zero and this is not going
to be just like that it is going to be
just like border width and this is going
to be border width okay
and looks good let's just allow it to
build for a second there we go we can
see a lot of things are happening at the
top and things should be good now why we
have done it like this way we can all
always add these keyframe properties
there but we have to apply this on a
multiple objects if we would have gone
here selected this added these key paths
we have we would have to do it again and
again but now we can do is go here and
we can see all these properties here so
what we can do surprisingly and fun we
can add this as this guy which is a
sharp red and I can add these
border-radius
as two and border with as one and you
can see that this is being shown here
okay and since my icons are actually
very small this is not working and
looking as good at it should be probably
I can select something better like white
now we can see that but again we have to
actually shrink down our image asset a
little bit so it looks good if we will
do that if you are thinking that you can
just go ahead and do something like 40
and 40 there hit enter it is not going
to work let me just clear the constant
there for a moment okay but since all of
these things are just impact and their
designs are just like that so that is
why it's saying but again we can do a
little bit customization here to show
you that how the things are going on so
we can have a border radius there and
you know what since we have got the
border radius as 40 we should be saying
that the corner radius should be 20 and
hit enter and now we can see that we
have got a perfect circle there I know I
did fail there in creating the assets
there but again we can actually produce
a little bit smaller graphics there and
can have exported by the way if you can
stay me here for a little bit more we
can actually solve this issue so let me
open up the sketch file there and these
are the guys which are having 50 by 50
so what we can do is we can create an
artboard there
and this artboard is going to be let's
just say 50 by 50 okay press the set key
and okay whatever you're doing okay
let's have this 50 by 50 copy this guy
copy and paste it there and now I can
actually zoom that in here and I can
shrink this guy a little bit so that it
is still 50 by 50 but there's some
margin being thrown away to it okay
now what we can do here is we can select
this canvas this artboard which is 50 by
50 and now if we'll add any circle this
circle will appear just here and this
guy this guy can be a little bit smaller
as well this will look just amazing
there
okay so let's export this artboard in 1
2 &amp;amp; 3 export the artboards and we're
going to call and pass I don't know what
to call them it will be called as
outboard I am pretty sure ok let's just
see and yes we are having some hard
boards there and let's just drag and
drop them artboards there you go
okay these are a little bit smaller
images we have quickly created them ok
now let's go to the main storyboard
select this button I want to select this
button yep there we go and we can change
the image there if I can find it
somehow and let's call it as artboard
and now we can see that now this guy is
actually working fine let's expand that
a little bit maybe 50 by 50 ok
this is looking like more over like an
oval because in order to make a perfect
circle this should be first of all the
button should be 6 square and whatever
the square width is like 50 by 50 just
make sure the corner radius is just half
of it so that it can tilt an angle there
I hope you do understand there so I'll
say 25 here and now it's a perfect
circle the best part is we can actually
work on this guy as well we
at a phone there but I hope you got the
point that we can add these guys as well
make a little bit smaller art board
should be a little bit longer and then
you can add these circles there okay it
looks amazingly awesome and should be
working equally good on running the
simulator as well if I can run this we
forgot to add the constants there so it
might go here and there a little bit
okay so there we go
this is a nice circle I can looks a
little bit jagged on my screen because
this is a smaller screen and iPhone
pixel intensity is quite high so there
we go
finally you have learned how you can
customize your UI in the Xcode as well
as you have learned how you can add the
circle button so a lot of things in just
one video and I hope you are happy so
let's go ahead and talk about something
else in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
