with another video in this video I want
to talk about herring now you might be
asking why we are talking about the
Harry this is the tech channel we talk
about programming web apps mobile apps
everything but this is important we need
to talk about Harry
and the next question would be has had
he made it to the Facebook or he has a
got a job in Google or has he made it a
million dollar online no none of them
but still we are going to talk about
Harry and there is something special
about the Harry
now what's so special about the hey now
Harry is one of my student in my iOS
development code but it doesn't really
matter whether he has been into my
course or not let's keep that aside here
now Harry is one of the person who has
mailed me a number of times and ask me
questions over my facebook page my email
and other coaches website he has asked
the questions like hey how I can install
that oh I can install that I'm getting
this error I'm getting that error and
then messages me hey I forgot to put the
NEX Clemente mark put that comma put
that all those things he has done all of
this and probably all of you might be
also doing this when you learned
something you always ask question so
what is so special about the head now
let me take you back to a different
scenario I receive hundreds of email
every single day saying that hey my
college is not supporting me they are
not giving me enough time to learn they
are always keeping me busy in assignment
my parents are not supporting me they
are not encouraging me to learn mobile
apps web apps and all such other emails
this is common this is really common
that people do not get that much of
support that they do really require to
learn something and he is one of them
but there is some more challenges in
front of Harry Harry's among those
persons who is not young like you and me
what will happen if you'll not go to the
college probably you will get an absent
there are probably you might get debar
from the college not able to give exam
probably you can give that in the next
semester but what helps Harry to deal up
with is little bit more tricky situation
he has to maintain his family and pay
all those bills which are required bills
of daily life food bills and other stuff
and it he'll not go to work he will not
have money to pay those bills but had he
decided that no enough is enough I'm
going to take control of my life he used
every resources that could have to be he
could have found on offices on online or
offline or at home whatever he could
have he thought that hey this is a
really struggle and not getting enough
time out of my day because there is so
much of the workload so he says nope but
this is not going to be something that
is going to stop making me app and
taking that to the App Store
he said I'm gonna wake up four o'clock
every single day in the morning and from
last four or five months he has been
doing so he gets up four o'clock every
single day and to do watch to learn now
imagine yourself in front of Harry you
are just on the one side you are
watching the season of Game of Thrones
back-to-back on a night while on the
other hand
Harry was making sure that his life gets
changed his app makes to the App Store
and finally what he has got an app in
the App Store he openly says that my app
is not to show off or to serve a million
people this is just to make sure that I
can do it I can make an app and can
reach it to the App Store so that I can
show a potential employer that hey I
might not have a degree I might not be
young but I can make it I can reach make
an app reach to the App Store and I will
be soon changing my job so from non I
tip that background he is moving into
the IT background how with some God gift
talent not at all this is the pure
awesome example of hard work raking up
four o'clock in the morning and doing it
every single day now hey I'm not asking
here to wake up four o'clock in the
morning all I'm asking is then you will
be getting started I know many of you
want to make an awesome website many of
you want to make an awesome Android apps
iOS app when you're going to get started
now all I'm trying to do with my courses
is to help you and make sure that you

programming but this is not about my
courses this is not about learning only

is an example of saying people can move
from non IT world to the IT world having

consistent hard work that hey I can do
