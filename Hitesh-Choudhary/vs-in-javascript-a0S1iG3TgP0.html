quick video on couple of topics that I
want to touch
I even have no idea what I'm gonna name
this video but anyways this is important
because we haven't talked about it and
it's a quite important step and we'll be
shaping up our Trello application
okay so let's create a new file what's
what's the harm in that we can create as
many as we like and let's call it as
equals because that's what we are
talking about equal start cheers there
we go and let me clear up the console as
well and just I'll keep it there because
I want to talk about a couple of things
okay so first of all when we log out did
you notice that when we compare anything
it returns us a value or true or false
probably you want to say something like
you might have heard about two is
greater than three so obviously we're
gonna get a false here so similar to
this if I check if two is equals to two
so what do you expect is gonna return
and some of you might be saying that is
the most ridiculous question anybody can
ask but bear with me we're gonna learn
something new here so we get a true here
that's fine what happens if I check two
is equals to 2.0 interesting now when I
do so it says true and similarly when I
use you might have heard about this we
talked a little bit about it just
touched it bitterly when I check two is
gonna be triple equal to 2.0 what we're
gonna get is again true so what is
happening here now that's the simple
difference is a lot of people get
confused in here when I do this example
especially a lot of people expect no.2
is not gonna be equal to two point oh
this is a little bit different concept
now when you check for double equal it
just checks inequality between these is
this but when you use triple equals it
checks whether the object we are
referencing from the left hand side is
exactly the same object we are
referencing on the right hand side and
let me show you a quick example of that
what I really want to say in here is is
something like this let's just say that
first of all let me give you this
example as well
let's just say we are setting that empty
string is gonna be equal a
two empty string and this can be a
little bit tricky example and when I run
this notice we get it true here
completely true obviously the double
equals we're gonna get true but let me
show you what happens when I do
something like this so let my wor for my
variable this is an empty string and I
say let my wor - it is also gonna be an
empty string interesting stuff no this
year and when I simply lock the console
simply checking out my var is equals to
my var - now what do we expect to have
in the console name it out please there
we go true but interesting stuff comes
up and I add an equal sign here now the
true equals notice we are still getting
it true okay you might be saying hey
that was expected huh my dear friend you
can beat rigged here a little bit so you
might be expecting hey string empty
string is an empty string and we're
getting it there that means it is just
comparing exactly same thing but things
actually change drastically when we work
on an object notice this is an object
and this is also an object and you might
be expecting hey this time I'm pretty
sure we're gonna get a true but when I
run this we get a false
so what drastically happened when we
were comparing string it was going good
but when we were saying object it just
changed a little bit now here's a quick
example that a lot of people get
confused let me show you again let me
repeat that what I say it again double
equal only checks whether the value is
equal in the string case it's a value
it's a value so it gives us exactly what
we expected some of you at least and
when we are checking for the object
object is far more complex design as
compared to your strings your integers
or your float values an object here is
completely different from the object
here and that's how the entire base of
the internet is now shaping up using
nodejs react and everything so make sure
you keep this concept especially with
simply the objects a lot of people get a
confusion that hey these are just equal
double equals 2 power equals you just
check it for 22.0 even they give you the
same result
no they changed drastically when it
comes to the object for let other things
you can be a little bit sloppy not for
object at all now let's just say I want
to get exactly same result here and I
want to simply say that hey I want to
get true in here somehow so there is a
way that I can check it for here
absolutely yes there is a way so what do
you have to do instead of separating and
assigning an other object notice this
object is different this is different if
you want to reference to one object
again especially in the case of object
you have to refer something which is my
war here now my war and my war two are
referencing to the same object
now when then you're gonna run this up
you are gonna get a true result here
okay very fundamental very easy thing to
remember but I know I made it a little
bit dramatic here but this is a
confusion which which kills a lot of
people so let me just remind you again
so in case of object you need to be a
little bit extra cautious about the
using of the equal sign or triple equal
make sure exactly what you're looking
for and this can be a little bit tricky
when we goes around with that so when we
are referencing even something like this
directly here we created an object here
and we checked out an object in here
still it just follows the same concept
and same rule here you get a false here
expected one so here's my two sent that
I want to add with this very very short
and quick video be careful about usage
of the double equal and triple equal
double equal checks whether the value
here equal and triple equals checks
whether actually the object which we are
referencing in the memory is exactly the
same object that we are referencing in
the memory are same or that it can be
used for a variety of purposes
especially in the databases it uses it
gets used quite a lot so make sure you
are aware of it in the string or integer
do get a little bit sloppy if you wish
but I don't recommend that obviously but
in the case of objects take special care
here okay so that's my quick two cents
about using of the triple equals with
the objects I hope it was pretty clear
very short video so that's it for the
sex
let's catch up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
