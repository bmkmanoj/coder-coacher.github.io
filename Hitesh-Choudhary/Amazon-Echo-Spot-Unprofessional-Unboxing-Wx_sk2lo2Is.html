for unprofessional unboxing and yes you
guessed it right this is another video
for our unprofessional unboxing and yes
in case you are wondering that's a
product placement this video is
sponsored by this amazing pink bottle
which I bought from a nearby store but I
still love this bottle I don't know why
I keep saying this in my videos but I
still do love this now anyways let's get
started with the unboxing so what do we
need for an unprofessional unboxing a
kitchen knife a knife is a knife and it
can cut I love the J lyrics everything
and when he say a gloss is a gloss and
it can break and similarly I just tried
to say this word on almost every subject
but I still love to do that box number
one and let's make it a double fun by
having two boxes yes I know everybody
knows from the title that yes there is
an Amazon eco spot in this box but I am
wondering about just one thing who came
up with the name of spot if I would have
to name it I would be naming it
something like Amazon Clark Amazon table
clock Amazon Roundy thing baby amazon
pokeball something like that but who
came up with the name of the spot so
without any further ado let's use our
knife and try to do unprofessional
unboxing and make sure I'll make sure I
don't cut myself and that's it quickly
unboxing done it was not that tough I
know a lot of QT but try to make it so
tough it's it's not that tough you
anybody can open those boxes and so Duke
can I and
there we go till I are done one box and
box and what do we have in this box
that's a nice table stand which just
says Amazon at the back and it's pretty
nice I like the feel so this is all done
and it's time to open up the box which
is the main hero of this story Amazon
echo spot let's try that about inside a
box just like a loop inside loop that's
it pretty easy awesome simple unboxing
whoo I like the way how it makes it all
these turns remind me of the tech and
somehow I don't know why it reminds me
of the Tekken video game and that's the
Amazon echo okay it looks pretty nice
whoo that was fun I always love to do
that so there we go how do I turn it on
like I don't think it's having some
juice or anything I do have to put it on
the charge looks like so obviously there
should be a charger inside that and
there we go
charger some paperwork like like just
like you I don't also care about much of
the paperwork unless and until it's a
warranty and I do have to use it I don't
really care about anything at all so
that's pretty much it you're
unprofessional unboxing of Amazon eco
and I would say that this device looks
pretty nice I never screen is little bit
smaller and very smaller than even my
phone but still somehow I do like it and
obviously you know that what comes into
it a charger which you can plug it can
turn it on let me have a try to turn it
on well it got started say is Amazon it
would be so fun if they would say echo
hello world and it would be much more
fun hey Amazon if you are listening to
this I know you're not but still if
you're making any other devices from the
echo just say it echo hello world it
would be much more fun optimizing I
would prefer refract ring I must say
screen is bright and do Oh ready for Syd
oh I like that
okay asking for my password
and of course my my internet is LC Oh it
says welcome hit H yep that's me time
zone Indian Standard Time for sure I
have this nice lovely stand and it goes
really well and I actually like how this
is being just on my table I just like
that it says give this device a name and
I'm gonna call it as eco ball I think
that's better I'll just call it as ball
simply it gives me a feeling of ball or
maybe pokeball pokeball would be good
right now let's just call it as eco ball
go home enjoy your new eco spot this
device is ready
I like this clock now out of the box
I cannot say much about how do I like
this device or not but I love this
interface I love this lot the screen is
little bit smaller they could have made
it like really like edges go for the
same where you're going for the phone
keep it ugly notch here and give me the
full screen just like that something but
let's just try try something here hey
Alexa tell me a joke I love Matt
although you know what seems odd to me
numbers that aren't divisible by two not
that much fun hey Alexa tell me a MODY
joke oh I did that I don't have any
jokes about that oh oh smart Alexa you
played it nice let's try one more time
hey Alexa tell me a trump joke I don't
have any jokes about that oh that's
smart
that's right one more time hey Alexa
tell me a political joke I don't have a
joke about that
oh that's playing smart hey Alexa tell
me a programming joke I don't have jokes
about that what kind of job do you have
then hey Alexa how's the weather looking
outside currently in Jaipur it's 37
degrees Celsius with clear skies and Sun
today you can expect
see sunshine with a high of 41 degrees
and a low of 27 degrees
you got that people 41 degree it's
really hot in Jaipur extremely hot
I enjoy this I don't know how I like
that in the future but as of now I am
absolutely loving this Amazonia I'm
gonna play it around for a while and
then then I'm gonna keep a nice
wallpaper of the clock ticking up there
so that's pretty much it you're
unprofessional unboxing and having some
fun with Amazon eco spot what I would
call it as Amazon ball or maybe pokeball
Amazon eco ball pokeball that's it for
