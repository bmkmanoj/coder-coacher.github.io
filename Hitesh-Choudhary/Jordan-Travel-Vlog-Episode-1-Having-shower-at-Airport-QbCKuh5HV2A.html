some quick packing one extra pair of
jeans I've already got one then what we
need is a few great t-shirts because I
just wear one color and on top of that
we need a few more great t-shirts and
there you go done because journey begins
in here I'm a shepherd airport right now
and we'll be travelling to Delhi and the
funny incident happened just at the
gibberish but there was a guy just ahead
of me in the line and he was arguing
with the policeman okay I want to just
take this knife with me as was although
it was the kitchen knives just
innocently there but why would you carry
a kitchen knife with yourselves in a bag
and he was continuously arguing with the
guys not listening to Hugh and finally
the police guy said either you just take
this knife and leave the airport
or you just take your flight and finally
you just get there sometimes people are
just crazy make right here
so I cannot do that wrong terminus it's
not my fault but sometimes lights do
that on the on the wrong channel I would
say so I have to get upon to the
International so because I took birth
there and now using onto my spot that is
a put in here
let's get up in a second that looks nice
have to wait in the launch not so good
not so good but it's better than missing
the flight I hope so
so I'll be waiting here spending some
time maybe I'll go live on the YouTube
or maybe I will write some code that's
what I'll do
you guys might haven't seen this but I'm
going to show you something cool really
really awesome let me show you how you
take a shower on the airport that is
gonna be my bed that's a table little
bloody but that's my table
that's my pants because I'm in pajama
okay that's cool and there we go that's
that's awesome and by the way that's
dryer and if I go back in here this is
where I'm gonna have showers so you can
actually have a shower on the airport
that is very cool so this is how you
looked at check this out
isn't it cool yep it's so awesome so but
first of all since this is this entire
room ish thing is mine for next next
four hours what I can do whatever I wish
and let's go back in here let's talk
something so this room is mine for the
next four hours of five hours I can do
whatever I want in years so I'll be
taking a nap up three hours because my
flight is delayed and after that I'll go
there and take a shower and this makes
me of the Katy nights pad he also got
there but he was taking a shower
on this plane maybe someday I'll get
there but right now I'm completely happy
with this I'm gonna have enjoy this is
so much I'm gonna have so much fun in
here let's go there and it's a nap time
it's a
naptime so but I catch you in a second
good morning people a quick nap is
always a good idea to get refresh there
but now it's time to get out of the bed
and get in shower
I can barely see this is the Sun - which
of the Sun but look at the beard so
majestic didn't expected that from the
Jordan but it's it's very cool it in
here and expected this for the Jordan
because you know we expected that kind
of stuff in the Jordan God completely
off-guard in it so good you'll be
