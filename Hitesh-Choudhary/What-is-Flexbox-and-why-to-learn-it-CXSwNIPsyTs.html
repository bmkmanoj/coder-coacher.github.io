flexbox series so some of you might be
wondering what is this series this
series is going to be about flexbox
explaining what if flexbox why we need
to learn flexbox and where you can use
them also by the end of the series you
can call yourself as pro in using the
flexbox i'll try to make sure to include
enough example about the flexbox in a
real life scenario how you can use them
in the mobile environment as well as on
the web environment so without a further
due let's talk about what is flexbox and
how we can use that so let me continue
in here and what we can see here is a
FAQ section what is this FAQ now when
people get started with the Flex bug
that is common to have few common simple
questions that need to be first answered
so let's talk about a few questions here
ok let's take them one by one so first
of all what is flexbox now I know many
of you are wondering what is this
flexbox is it a new tag to design apps
or is it a new tag to design website no
it's not it's just CSS and yes that is
just CSS now you might be thinking
thinking hey we do have CSS why we need
to learn flex box now flex box is just
like a tit it's just like a cherry on
the top of the cake and it makes things
simple and I would say simpler now I I
want to give you a simple example of the
Flex box now again flex box is just
plain CSS and it's just a writing style
of the CSS with few additional elements
being given to us in the CSS now you
don't need to install anything
extraordinary for working with that your
existing web pages all can utilize the
flex box properties and all these things
it's already available for you but what
I want to show you here is a why flex
box why we are learning it now flex box
is amazing and sometimes the CSS gives
us some challenges like centering the
elements and floating to the right and
left and aligning proper spacing to each
division these are some of the
challenges which surely you can do with
the CSS but flex box makes it really
simple just like you don't write your
code in simple
like text pad or notepad you prefer to
write your HTML code in some text editor
maybe that can be a notepad plus plus
atom bracket or sublime text and exact
same reason we are going to use flex mod
it makes things easier and that's what
we are going to do now let me also show
you a couple of reasons by the Flex box
of gaining so much popularity now in
case you are aware with the framework
which is react native and not a
framework it's actually an entire
library here and what it does it allows
you to write a native apps in iOS and
Android using your existing scale of
HTML CSS and JavaScript and you can read
the whole documentation here and you can
see apps like Facebook Messenger
Instagram Tesla are already utilizing
this great react media thing and yes you
write native it's not a hybrid app it's
a native app that you write in HTML CSS
and JavaScript coming back onto a topic
so why do we need to learn a flexbox for
this react native and it's not just only
for react native you can use that for
web as well but let me show you a simple
example here now what I can see here is
likely pass this in for a second now
don't worry about the code or anything
you can see there are two apps in my
screen here one of them is iPhone 6 and
one of them is Nexus 5 which is on
Android emulator now this code at the
back end is being generated by react
native but the main issue is layout and
we all know that laying out the things
on whether it's an iPhone or it's an
Android it's not such a easy thing but
you can make things really really simple
and easy using flexbox so flexbox
specializes in the things should look
exactly same no matter what the screen
size is and we can see the screen size
are drastically different for an iPhone
6 and a Nexus 5 it's just look
drastically different and yet our
elements are placed just exactly same
and this is the power of the Flex box
and similarly on the web pages you can
just lay out the things exactly same and
no matter how the page is shrinks to a
mobile size or a tablet size it just
looks amazingly awesome and that is the
reason we are
we are learning for the flexbox okay so
now that you understand what is flexbox
and why it is so important it just makes
life so easier let's also talk about
what is the prior knowledge you should
have before getting started with the
flexbox now flexbox does require a
little bit knowledge of HTML and CSS and
that's it now throughout this video
series I won't be explaining the things
like how to change a background color or
how to increase the font size or how to
layout h1 heading tags or h6 heading
tags I won't be explaining that I will
be skipping that bare-minimum basics
apart from that HTML and CSS you don't
require any kind of special things it's
just work like that ok the final
question is what tools we need to be
using in this entire course now this is
a simple kind of a web dev course you
can call it as a web dev course and for
that you are completely fine to use your
favorite text editor there now mine
happen to be atom which is crock
cross-platform and is available for
Windows Mac or Linux wherever you are
hanging out you can see it's available
for all of the guys here's the windows
here is the Mac so it's available for
all of that I will be using that this
guy throughout the course and if you're
a big fan of sublime text just hang out
there hands down I cannot say anything
just keep on working there I know you
are a big fan of sublime text keep on
there if you are a fan of another text
editor just be there there is no such
extraordinary thing with the text
editors here and as my daily driver I
use Chrome so I'll be using the same for
showing out the output of entire flexbox
results so apart from atom or maybe your
favorite editor and a browser we don't
need anything extraordinary so now that
the things are clear that what is
flexbox why we are learning the flexbox
and with all the tools that you really
need to have for a flexbox
in the next video we are going to talk
about directly writing the code and
we'll understand what is flexbox in the
code scenario and how we can utilize
that to lay out some amazing awesome
layouts here ok I'll surely catch you up
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
