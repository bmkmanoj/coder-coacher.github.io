where I talk about something and you ask
questions and all these stuffs this is
like are you Bengali no I am Indian
what's your monthly income from YouTube
enough to talk to you guys and I'm
fortunate enough to just live a happy
life that's more important not alone
with the YouTube I actually don't rely
totally on YouTube income it's like
nothing as compared to what I can
actually do so I don't consider the
income much okay my net is slow
there is a lot of Smiley's my night is
slow the reason why okay the reason why
I'm not showing the chat window here I
could have shown it here but you know I
don't trust that much on what people are
gonna be putting yes I know you are
great you won't be putting putting
anything like mischeif here but
sometimes when the chat is going on
people try to be like extraordinary
visible and they upload some nonsense
thing that's why I'm not putting up this
live chat here how much experience you
have enough where you would I have
worked on a couple of startups a couple
of startups in India as well in New York
