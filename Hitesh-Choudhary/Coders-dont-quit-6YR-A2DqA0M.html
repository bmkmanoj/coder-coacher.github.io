with another video now today's video is
a little bit different it's not like a
regular green screen videos where I talk
about some knowledgeful stuff or tell
you something about what's happening in
the world it's a little bit different
and this video is all because I received
two emails on the same day and I really
think that I should share it with all of
you because a lot of people really need
some code motivation so let me go
through with the first email and then
I'll go on to the second email and this
man really needs some talk and in fact I
think that I'm a good person to talk
with him so let me just tell you what is
this person saying and I won't be
calling out the name of this person
because I think this is not good I
should not do that so let's just go with
this email by the way I'm reading from
my computer hi - my name is blank I am
learning programming for over an year
now I am I was never good in math and
even after a year I'm not able to write
code for logics I am thinking to quit
programming perhaps I was not born to be
a programmer your courses were awesome
and helped a lot but it looks like I am
not smart enough to be a programmer I am
looking for new fields and just taught
to say hello to you over mail hope you
will take some time from your busy
schedule to say hello back to me okay
I'll surely say hello to you over the
email so you are thinking to quit
programming okay that's okay that's
acceptable it's okay but let me tell you
one thing it's always easy to quit it's
always easy you know a the easiest part
about learning anything it's always easy
to quit you want to learn a new language
it's easy to quit you want to become a
basketball player it's easy to quit you
want to run a mile it's easy to quit you
want to hit the gym for a month
continuously it's easy to quit you want
to learn a guitar it's easy to quit the
easiest thing that anyone can do in this
world is quit
and everybody would be quitting the
things nobody would have learned
anything maybe it would be a guitar it
would be an audio specialty it would be
videos editing photos programming
designing apps it's easy to quit okay I
get your point you might be not good in
mathematics or you might not be building
good logics but it's always easy to quit
you know programmers like me and a lot
of other people were born with a gift
they were born with a high amount of
knowledge in them when they born up
they didn't cry they cried out loud with
the table of 24 you know it's easy when
we were five we were a mathematical
genius you were reading our books if
that's so it was not like that it was
never like that we will never born a
genius people think a lot of community
thinks that programmers are born genius
no they will not they are not they will
never be it's always easy to quit the
reason why we are programmer the reasons
why we are learning the things is
because we are not quitters we don't
quit a programmer never ever quit and
I've seen a lot of people who are
working with the website web designs
their CSS never works out they want a
specific color on a specific letter or
specific a background it never works on
the first time and in fact web
developers know better than me because
they covered every single day it's
always easy to quit and let me show you
another email and I'll discuss further
and I will come back further that what
is the wrong thing that you are doing
and this is actually not a mail this is
from one of my students from IRS course
iOS development and his name is Douglas
he says quicker return to yes got it
worked after four months can you even
imagine that he has spent four months in
a single problem and you know how the
solution works out in just a couple of
lines it just a couple of lines and he
said I've been working on picker with
return to first wheel you select the
provenance and the second wheel
automatically displays to associate the
cities it was
I'm excited so this guy has been working
on a single problem for over four or
four months and I have no idea what the
particular actually the problem is he
might be working on it it might be a
very tough problem it took him a whole
month maybe if I would have been working
it might have took me maybe fifteen days
or 20 days to solve it maybe somebody
who is much more experienced than we
might have solved this problem in a day
or two or maybe in an hour I don't say
that but you know what Douglas is doing
he is not quitting that's important and
if you learn anything it's very easy to
quit you can quit in a second in an
instant and that doesn't make your
programmer
and I believe if you are learning if
you're trying to switch into any other
field or domain as well let's say you
are learning basketball as well or maybe
you want to learn about mechanics of the
cars you won't be good in a year
programming takes years and a lot of
people nowadays expect that it's going
to be magic I'll take a course I'll read
a book and within 15 days a month or
maybe two months I'll become an expert
programmer I'll launch an app I'll
design my app better than Facebook or
something I don't say you cannot do it
but for sure there is no such magic it's
just all a lie it's just a myth it never
ever happens it is not going to happen
ever so I'm not saying you should not
look for other job opportunities maybe
you can do some very good better than
programming I'm not saying that but just
within a year you're quitting it some it
is something that I cannot digest it's
not something that I can actually adjust
my mind to say this man is a quitter
this man is literally I'm a little bit
getting a little bit harsh but this man
is a loser
he's accepting things so easily he's not
a fighter and that's all about it I'm
not saying that programming is the only
career programming is the only job there
there are thousands of others people are
carpenters people are mechanics people
are electricians they can they can be
anything but they have become good at it
because they are not quitters they don't
quit many times I design a website I
want a specific color I want a specific
font that's not happening
and I was able to do it at the end of
the day or me the end of the month
because I didn't quit and that's
something which is not in my blood
I don't quit things I maybe I was broke
at one time I I struggled with it I'm
doing a lot of things now but one thing
I cannot accept with myself is quitting
I have actually approached that I'm
going to be making better videos for the
youtubes I'm learning every single day
I'm attending a lot of boot camps all
over the globe and traveling with my own
expenses to learn the things and that's
what I do I don't quit the things and I
think you should also never quit
programming takes time it's something
that requires a lot of mental focus and
in the upcoming videos as well I'll talk
about how to increase your focus how you
can be more productive and things
because I have been very much productive
in the recent couple of years I'll share
you with my tips and tricks how I do
that and everything but one thing that I
say all the time never ever quit you
need to work a little bit hard if this
guy is spending 4 months in a problem
and you already know the syntax in a
year of any one programming language I
think you are ahead of me already I
never got the syntax in here it took me
a lot of time now the things are really
easy for me because I have spent a
doesn't amount of this like a lot of
years in all about all about the
programming so all I'm saying to you is
ok let stuff like go ahead try out other
carriers I'm not against it actually
it's good I still would like to be in
contact with you it's really good but
again I think just one year it is too
much a little bit you might could have
done a really great things in that but
again Who am I to decide Who am I to say
that all I'm saying a random programmer
guy who likes to code is saying to you
that sometimes we do spend four or five
months in just solving one problem it's
pretty common even a website designer
sometimes spends a month in just
changing some color or combination or
something is not right even even he is
not adding an idea what's not right but
still he do spend time so don't expect
ever for magic it's not about magic it's
not going to happen over a day over a
month it takes years and years
years of practice so III have no idea
what to say how can I stop you and can
put you back into the programming
grounds but let me know in the mail if
you really think that I can help you
somehow and I would definitely say to
all of you guys out there who are
thinking to quit programming now here is
a very short time if you are doing even
if you got the syntax in the first year
I think you're doing really great you
should stick with that and you should
explore move about yourselves do more
projects and learn a little bit more
about it
and I hope you like this video and this
video was actually dedicated to someone
special mail guy I'll be linking him in
the mail but again if you think that
this can this video can inspire somebody
else as well make sure you share it and
I'll catch you up just like always in
the sub next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
