if I can't stop hey did everyone this
year back again with another video this
is not a regular video we don't do these
kinds of videos but you know you can
call me unprofessional for this and
that's why the title of video the
unprofessional unboxing of a TD no I'm
not gonna make any kind of suspense I'm
gonna unbox a TT in this video and
that's gonna happen unprofessionally but
before that let me let me just want I
just want to talk about something so
this video is rather unprofessional I
don't do these kinds of stuff but
sometime it's fun now the moment
everybody starts a YouTube they really
want to unbox the things they want to
just open up mobile boxes or camera
boxes or something like that and I'll be
honest with you I I really wanted to do
that when I started all these things
still I want to do this but eventually
in the time I got up into the
programming and stuff and teaching that
stuff but still unboxing videos are
awesome but I don't know how to do them
so this is unprofessional and box saying
let's get started here no cut shorts or
no takes but again we need to throw
those - let's just do that
so let's bring up our box and it's just
right here some of you might have
already seen that so there we go
throwing up the ATD on the screen so
we're gonna unbox this and I need to
clean my table a little bit throw aside
my macbook a little bit ipads here in
there just like that okay so this looks
not good okay looks good now we can do
an unboxing video of a TV just like
everybody does at their home so just
like every other youtuber I don't have
like professional life for unboxing but
we're gonna use ten by the way it's a
gifted Ben so we're gonna just use that
come on let's just do unboxing I hope I
can do this should have bought my knife
it would be really better and I broke
that a little bit yep
and this is how I regularly do my
unboxings not with the fancy knives and
that's why it's called a professional
unboxing there we go okay hope it works
now okay so here we got instruction
manual that nobody reads so throw aside
I wonder how anybody ever read that
instruction manual I have read it once
when I bought to get it I have no idea
how to operate that but that's what
warranty and stuff I actually have never
used any warranty on this 70d which on
which I am recording buy it now so you
can show that aside some cables who
cares about that
I really wonder sometim by all these
unboxing videos cares so much about rest
of the stuff which is not the main hero
of the story like here we have got a
hero a TV here but everybody will be
saying hey let's just keep it aside for
a moment and see what's inside the box
no I don't want to do that i
straightforwardly want to see how my
body looks like okay so let's check it
out
it's actually
a bit heavier than my 70d I would say
that okay so this is how it looks
come on focus that 70d you can do that
focus this guy so this is our new camera
Canon 70d looks pretty much exactly the
same there are subtle differences I can
tell you straightforwardly that a little
bit okay I can straightforwardly tell
you that there is difference in the mic
here it used to be a little bit like at
this side but now it's it has moved a
little bit forward not that it makes
like a big difference here but it's it's
okay and again we have got HDMI cable
and rest of the stuff and I'm a big fan
of this kind of screen hey Sony are you
listening to this come on do this one
now slowly what the does the screen
actually just gets here and it just
tells like this much what's the use of
that I don't like it looks nice pretty
good and I want to turn it on so how can
I do that I should have I should have
been telling what you have got in the
bar that would be a more over a
professional unboxing but come on okay
so there we go
a charger that's a nice blue I like it
that's a clean one I have another one
charging out of there
a Canon branded strap out which also I
don't use it looks smaller would like a
touristy like this you know like a
touristy stuff I don't do that on my any
travel then we have got a battery I also
won't be reading any kind of reading or
material on this battery how much volt
it is and all of these stuff because all
these things are already available on
the website it's like reading a brochure
I couldn't want to do that there are
already lots of professional youtubers
doing that so I think it should have
some of the juice in it I think you
should be able to put it out and do we
have a card okay we do have an extra
card okay we got a card inside here
lexer that's nice
the focus is speaking quite a lot but
okay how can I open this card that's a
mystery okay looks like okay okay it's a
16 gigs of card nice okay and by the way
if Canon you are watching this video I
hope you will be thank you so much for
making such these great devices
I love the Canon thing and it's like a
Windows and Mac war but ultimately the
Canon wins here the video on which we
are shooting right now is 70d Canon
products this is also a Cameron product
I usually put a tape here I don't want
to do extra branding but this is thank
you so much Cameron I do have any
comment let me show you that I do have
that okay so this is my Nikon I have no
idea 20300 that's also a pretty good
camera decent camera not a good camera
it's a decent camera it doesn't have
that flip screen anything
it's still good camera my first camera I
enjoyed it a lot but I don't use it much
now I probably think I'll be using 70d
mode even after getting a TV we need to
put a lens I actually bought only the
body here because I do have a lot of
lenses lying around so who looks awesome
see check this inside looks awesome ok
need to throw up a lense how about an
f250 really good lens if you are looking
for being a youtuber 50mm is like a
killer lens you should have it ok ok and
there we go finally does this have a
juice nope battery is totally dead
battery is totally dead I cannot show
you how it looks like probably I have to
charge it a little bit ok we'll take a
small break here and I'll charge it and
I'll come back in a sec need a little
bit more charge so what we can do is we
can flip and I can take the battery from
this device so we have to move more
unprofessional and give a recording
mobile so let's just see how it looks it
really looks like I'm making and setting
a benchmark of being an unprofessional
unboxer here so we've got this this
battery has no juice I plugged it down
from another device let me show you how
does that device looks like so let me
just show you so this is my hand other
camera recording there this is by the
way 70d looks pretty decent but we're
gonna switch the battery now this is new
one this is new one ok so there we go
and hopefully it has got some juice now
ok it is working one thing I can say
this is cream is so amazing it's
actually much more clear than by the
whole 70d one I like it ok looks pretty
good
I can click a photo of me
let's see this is a 50mm it should be
working fine oh come on I don't want to
shoot a flash I'll never shoot on auto
mode it's it's bad let's see how it
looks I can touch it
so I'll pose this video in
post-production and take in here so that
you can see that how it looks it looks
by the way pretty awesome I like it I
like it
and plus when you have a lens like this
it looks pretty awesome you can see that
this is pretty pretty dope
so again this lens is a pretty high
quality I like it absolutely we can have
a test shot here a test subject Statue
of Liberty or maybe let's bring up me
for a test subject this is me and this
is test subject so we are going to do
that so I just click a photo right in
front of you I'm being setting a
benchmark for being unprofessional and
boxer here so let's just do that
looks pretty dope so they push posting
these things down and then of course I
cannot review this because I haven't
used it much so far I'm a big fan of 70d
I use it almost all of my trips and
everything but now ATD is here let's see
how it looks good if it is worth using
it I'll be making a few videos in the
next couple of days with this this
camera and of course with multiple
lenses I do have got lenses as well this
guy and of course I do have one very
famous Sigma lens as well I use it quite
often but surely maybe I can renew it
someday okay so the masa care of
professional unprofessional unboxing is
over right now and you won't be seeing
much videos like this on channel but yes
again thank you so much Karen for making
these amazing awesome cameras I'm not a
big fan of your lenses they are pretty
expensive but still you make you does a
pretty good job they are all worth every
single penny so that's it for this video
and surely we will be moving on to some
tech videos after this this was kind of
a unprofessional unboxing that we did I
have also posted about this on my
facebook page if you are yet not
connected with me on my facebook go
ahead and check this out and if you are
subscribing this channel based on this
unprofessional unboxing here please
don't because we don't do much of the
things here of unboxing things there are
other great channels you can follow for
unboxing and reviews and everything at
the shoutout sometimes we unbox most of
the time we talk about programming and
tech so that's it for this video and
watch out other videos they are pretty
much fun anymore awesome than this one
that's it for this video and I'll surely
catch you up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
