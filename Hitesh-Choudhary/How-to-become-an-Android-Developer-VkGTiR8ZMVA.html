with another video in this video we are
going to talk about the Android
development now the specific point that
we are going to touch upon are how you
can become an Android developer what are
the prerequisite before getting started
as an Android developer also we're going
to talk about what are the free
resources and paid resources available
online as well as how you can publish
your apps to the Android Play Store as
well as how you can earn money with
those apps so all of this coming up in
this video stay tuned
in this channel we talk about
programming coding technical stuff and
porp our technology stuff all the things
related to the computer so in case you
are new here consider subscribing now
let's talk about the Android now I'm
going to touch upon a few points that
are going to be really helpful and will
help you to get started as an Android
developer now first of all I am assuming
that you have decided that from iOS and
Android the Android is going to be my
choice and all of the users that I want
to hit are actually behind the Android
devices so that's why you are choosing
the Android so let's clear up that that
you have decided perfectly I'm no
confusion at all that yes Android is
going to be my choice now the great
thing with the Android development is
it's not that much platform oriented
like for the iOS development you need to
have an iOS device of course the iPhone
is not necessary but I I u.s. devices
like Mac Mini or your iMac really helps
a lot but Android is not like that you
can get started as an Android developer
on a Windows platform or on a Mac
platform it really doesn't matter it can
be anything now if you really want to
get started the first prerequisite is
have a decent machine now why the term
decent machine I would say that if your
machine is having just say 2 gigabytes
of RAM or one gigabytes of RAM it's not
going to be much fun as an Android
developer because when you simulate to
actually run in case you don't know what
the simulator is you actually don't need
a real hardware devices of Android to
test your app in the Android studio
which is the platform where you write
all of your code gives you a lot of
simulators that you can run and can test
your apps now these simulators consume a
lot of memory now of course you can get
started with the two gigabytes of RAM
but your system will perform really slow
and that is not a fun so I would
recommend at least four gigabytes of RAM
would be really really awesome in that
case so once you have cleared up that
hurdle that you have a decent machine in
case you don't have it it's a great time
to invest in a machine because you are
about to be a developer all the money
that you are going to be spending is
going to come up because you're having a
great app idea now once the hardware
consultancy is over
the next hurdle is the programming
language now if in case you are coming
up with any other programming language
Java won't be much of the hurdle but in
case you are coming for the very first
time
it's a good time to get started with the
Java now there are plethora of free and
paid resources it's completely your
choice how you want to get started but
here is my tip don't get stuck with the
usual convincing part of first learn C
then learn C++ then learn Java no it's
not like that you can directly and
directly jump onto the Java it's a
language in itself and you can clearly
and simply learn that directly no need
of other prerequisite languages and also
I would like to say that you don't need
to jump into the advanced hyper advanced
level of the Java the basics about loop
function few object oriented tips would
be completely ok and don't spend too
much of the time in the Java
otherwise you'll be getting stuck in the
Java you won't be ever moving into the
Android now once you have learned the
Java then the obvious step is to
register as an Android developer to get
started learning the Android now while
learning the Android you also need to
take care that there are a couple of
ways to get started as a developer now
one of the great way and free way is to
get started from developer.android.com
now this is an official resource by
Google and to support all the Android
developers now of course they will teach
you all things about how you can get
started as an Android studio how we can
install it what are the requirements how
you can design a few simple apps that
all the things about material designs
design specifications and pretty much
everything they are going to teach but
the problem is that's an official
documentation and official documentation
are always toughest ones to read around
they are not always so much easy because
there is so much of the detail that for
a normal user it's not easy to go around
now obviously it's time-consuming and
it's free so definitely get ready to
invest a lot of time now of course there
are please' of blocks that can teach you
to design this app or that app of course
that's a game time consuming but a
course it's free now there are a couple
of paid resources as well don't really
have not selling you anything but there
are a lot of paid resources online
tutorials or online courses that you can
purchase and I personally recommend them
now I'm not going to link any of them
I'm not gonna pass any of the link to
purchase them or anything but I
personally believe that that saves a lot
of time of course that cost a little bit
of money like thirty to fifty dollars
which is much more efficient than the
offline trainings so you can also go
with that now you can also go with a lot
of books as well but I would say going
with the books is secondary in my mind
first of all I would like to go with
somebody if he is teaching me lies there
that would be much more awesome okay so
now we have cleared up the hurdle of
hardware we have cleared up the hurdle
of Java and now we are Android developer
what is the next step the next step is
very simple to register as an Android
app developer now it again costs you a
little bit of money I guess it's around
$30 as of recording of this video so
investing a little bit amount like $30
and paid to the Google and there is a
little bit process of verifying your
addresses and uploading your IDs and
everything once you have done that now
you'll be fully able to upload your app
now once you have your app ready in the
app store it it's not an easy process by
the way not the app store actually the
Play Store now your app is there
actually now what is the next step now
the next step is actually to market your
app now an app which nobody downloads is
not a good use but in case you want to
just make your portfolio or profile as
an Android developer just upload all of
your apps that you have learned or you
have designed that's actually a great
resuming but in case you want that your
app should be hitting that app marketing
is the next step you should be looking
for the app review guys a blog guys to
make sure that your app reaches to a
wider audience and that's all about
that's the whole process of getting
started as an Android developer now for
sure in the upcoming few movies I will
discuss more about the resources how you
can get the online free resources and
paid resources but definitely that's
going to come up in some of the later
videos
I hope this video
have given you a quite a clear guide and
how you can get started as an Android
developer but again my tip would be
again don't get stuck in the path of C
C++ Java and everything you can directly
get started with the Java don't spend
too much of the time in the Java
directly try to expose yourself as a
simple Android application the more
simpler apps you are going to make the
more you are going to enjoy and more you
are going to get as an experience I
would also recommend to use firebase as
a back-end services because it's going
to give you much more exposure as an
Android developer and that app would be
much more complex so I hope this video
has helped you quite a lot in
understanding how the Android everything
learning process actually works and if
you liked this video make sure that you
share it with all of your friends and
I'll catch you up in another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
