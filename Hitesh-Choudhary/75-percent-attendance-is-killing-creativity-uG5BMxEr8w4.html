criteria which is applied in most of the
engineering universities and colleges is
actually killing the talent now I won't
be just making a statement there I would
like to prove it as well now yesterday I
was giving a simple seminar for one of
the clubs in Indian universities now it
was all in online section and almost 100
or 110 students showed up in there for
from my side it was just a totally free
online thought about how we can grow up
in the IT industry how you can land up
in a great job and something like that
now it was secession for 100 or 110
students and as the session ends up I
started a Q&amp;amp;A and 30 to 35 students
showed up and and showed me the things
that they were doing and they were
really great things some of them were
doing really great in information
security at such a young age they have
won quite a lot of bug bounties they
were working on their own info tech
product they want to deliver and they
want to do a start-up for that some of
them were working on a great idea for an
app for Android and iOS and that that's
really something great that students are
now combining and are working in a team
and are delivering such a great product
now the only issue that all of those
students were having was simply the
problem of 75% attendance and as I
always say if there is one problem and
you want to solve it the very first step
is to come up and say that yes there is
a problem and until and unless you are
going to accept that that this is a
problem you are never going to solve it
so I thought I should come up and talk a
little bit about that okay so let's
start with that and from let's talk
about from the both the perspective from
the student side and from the university
side as well and let's just figure out
is where the things are actually going
on wrong okay so starting first of all
you want to impose 75% criteria let's
talk about from the university side web
and then I'll talk about from the
student side as well now most of the
university management says that if they
are not going to impose the 75% in is
criteria students will not show up in
the classes okay
that's great acceptable first of all
students are not that much interested in
the classes that they are that you are
doing up so it's really good to impose
such compulsion of seventy-five percent
in a criteria but you should only do it
for maybe a couple of semester or legacy
at a max for second year not for the
whole four years and now the university
management side will say that because we
have so much worried about the careers
of the student that's why we are
imposing that now let me state you a
quick fact students are much more
worried about their career than what you
are what do you believe that students
are going to stay their entire life in
the universities no not at all they are
going to be just there for maybe four
years or at the max five years and what
you are doing in that year you are just
trying to make a student to sit in the
class that's not how the teaching goes
on I don't think so I don't believe that
that's how the teaching goes on so what
you are doing is you are trying to make
a compulsion that students should be
sitting in the class for the
seventy-five percent of the total class
and let me say you that if the students
are not showing up in the class that
means the classes are boring and they
are not much attractive they are not
much interesting they are not teaching
the latest trends they are not teaching
the latest technology by the student can
learn something or can deliver a good
product and that's how the things are
going on it's not a good thing you
should make your classes much more
interesting so that a student can show
up try to teach the student about
Android apps and by the end of the
semester the project should be that you
should have five apps with you or try to
teach them about iOS app development
students will surely show up in your
classes or teach them a full semesters
about web development where students
will be designing one massive online
website or a banking system which goes
right there
students will shortly come up students
wants to learn and this is completely
wrong notion that it will just impose
75% of criteria that's going to be good
it's it's starting no pencils at all you
should understand that that's the big
problem going on there okay now moving
on to some more points that I want to
discuss what's going on wrong now I have
also seen this even have experiences
that
when sometimes a lot of faculty do this
they show up with a PowerPoint
presentation let me tell you with this
very clearly that the implement of how
the the technical education should be
moved on to the computerized education
system or modern online education system
is going completely wrong side but the
wrong gist part that we could have after
it going there just just believe me
trust me on that
now what the teachers are trying to do
they are trying to build up a PPT most
of the time they are downloading the
PowerPoint presentation from any
university like IITs or maybe some
Washington universities or my you are
like that they are just showing up the
PowerPoint presentation on the screen
and then just reading line by line by
the end of the lecture they just convert
those line by line into Hindi or their
native languages and that's all about it
and I don't think - that's a teaching
teaching should not be like that it it's
the worst kind of teaching that you
could ever do so make sure you follow up
all these things in the universities
okay now coming back on to the side of
Twitter of the seventy five percent
attendance criteria also I would like to
state that you should really come up
with a great solution of this imposing
button up there like you can go for the
two years of the compulsory seventy five
percent attendance and for the 30th
final year students should be allowed to
do whatever they want to do maybe they
want to learn the mechanics maybe they
want to love learn something
microcontrollers or maybe want to design
some good cool app they should be
allowed to do so now what is going to
make impact on that now what you're
trying to do is you are trying to
control the students so much that
ultimately their talent is going to
sacrifice if they are not able to clear
the engineering in the given time period
they are simply going to show up they
are going to leave their projects they
are going to lead their dreams and are
going to get up into the college now
what this is going to do they've been
eventually get past you will get your
burden off but you are not producing
great engineers you are not producing
someone who can actually deliver
industry-standard
kill this is not so what all I'm saying
is something is wrong going on there
with the 75% of criteria and if in time
we will not be able to solve this this
can lead to produce some bad engineers
which will not be eventually in the
future would be skilled enough to get
great jobs everybody knows that the
engineers from India and China are the
leading engineers in all of the great
tech giant so make sure that they are
able to produce that much of the skilled
engineers in the future as well and this
75% criteria is actually making the
students just passing their exam they
are not getting enough talent or that
they are not learning enough so that
they can deliver some industry standard
products or services like that so I hope
many of you caught my point and and try
to understand that this 75% in this
criteria is actually killing the talent
you you are killing the screen crowd
here let's just say a 25% of the
students are going to misuse if you give
the liberty of that 75% no more criteria
but believe me that then a 25% are
nothing if the end person of a student
which is a cream crowd is trying to
build something great if they are not
able to do that that's 10% you to that
10 person it's not a balance scale it's
it never will be so make sure that you
understand that these scream crowds who
are building something who are
passionate about something we should
give them enough chance to do so so make
sure this message reaches out to a lot
of administrator who are in the colleges
or something and make sure you do
something about the 75% and it's
criteria otherwise things are going to
be really bad in the near future already
they are quite bad you know that and
you're already facing these issues in
the university but trust me
this is going to be a whole lot bad
situation in the future so stop this 75%
 idea this was the but the worst
thing that you could have ever come up
so my all message is stop this and try
to produce better engineers try to make
your classes much more interesting so
automatically students showed up in the
class
not 75% but for Apple 100% of the time
focus on the content focus on your
material focus on what the chapter are
going to content so that's all I was
saying here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
