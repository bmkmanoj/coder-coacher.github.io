with another video this video is special
this video includes an amazing and
awesome tip for both Android and iOS
user so you have almost done with your
app and it's ready to be launched on
Google Play Store or Apple App Store but
before you upload your app let's just
watch this video first of all and then
upload it this amazing tip is going to
make sure that your app actually
performs really well on both of the
platforms
so let's go in case you don't know what
are the requirements for uploading the
apps and everything there is one certain
thing that both of the platform does ask
you that is screenshot of the app and
that is necessary because users really
want to see what your app looks like and
get a feel of how your app actually
looks like so both of the platform does
require to have a screenshot upload now
you see different two different kind of
apps in the market one those are having
just boring screenshots and like that
they are also required and I recommend
to upload a couple of them but you can
actually level up the game a little bit
up you can use the product known as mark
you you up and inside that product you
just have to simply drag and drop your
screenshot and voila everything is done
they have got some amazing pre-built
designs or I would say start photos like
some girls holding the phone and inside
that phone your screenshot is going to
come up automatically as soon as you
drag drag and drop it now there are a
lot of screens available and it just
works like a magic there is no such
technical requirement to work on with
that you simply have to drag and drop
that and voila it's done it's a
relatively new product and david fromm
which is one of the cofounders of mark
you you up approached me and said hey
the issue were quite a lot in Android as
well
iOS app would you like to try our
product here I said hey why not just
throw it up and he did send me a product
and I didn't got much time to use it and
all of that but recently I said hey I'm
going to give it a shot so in the recent
learned code online dot in-app I thought
hey I'm going to give it try to this app
it was amazed
simple to just work on with this product
just drag-and-drop your screenshot that
you have taken either from Android
studio or Xcode and that's it
just drag and drop it and it's going to
work like a magic and this is so precise
and amazingly done if I could have
surely done that in the Photoshop or
sketch but the time that would it would
have consumed is very more what I can do
quickly in the Mach you you up studio
best part about the mark you you up is
there free be they have a lot of free
such screens and you can just try their
product you can simply use those
freebies can drag and drop those
screenshots and decide by yourself that
whether you like this or not or either
the free one is going to do for you or
you want to buy and go ahead dot now I'm
not putting up any affiliate link or
something simply because I like the
product and I want you to try that out
by your own previously at the very very
early stage they used to have a
subscription kind of a plan which I was
not a big fan because it's not something
worth subscription but they have done an
amazing move of getting into the product
base like they are offering an amazing
huge discount right now which is just
$29 it's steel if you honestly ask me
somebody who works a lot in mobile app
development or just work on a lot of
design element I would surely buy this
product if they wouldn't have send it to
me so this is what I have to say about
mark you up studio but there is a bad
side of mark you you up as well and that
is with the name I don't know why they
come up with this mark you you up name I
would surely like to get the story
behind the scene how they came up with
the name because it's really a mouthful
mark you you up how many you you really
want to use with the you you up so from
now onwards whether you are making a
website for your app or you are just
uploading to the App Store or Google
Play Store don't just upload those
boring screenshot use mark you up even
the freebies at least and let's just
level up the game and present some
amazing user experience so that user
feels really impressive with those apps
in their hands mobile phones and just
like that let's just do that
so this was the only quick tip that I
wanted to give all of the designers and
developers of Android and iOS and that's
it for this video now in case you are
new to this channel don't forget to hit
the subscribe
if you liked this video give it a thumbs
up and I'll surely catch you up next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
