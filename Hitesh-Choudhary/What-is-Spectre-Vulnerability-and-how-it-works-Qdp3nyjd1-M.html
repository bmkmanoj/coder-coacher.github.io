have experienced just right now is
spectre-1 durability now this was for
all the users who have been watching my
content regularly but let me try to
explain it in a little bit more detail
and simplified example now let's just
say you are a runner and you have been
running for not long but just for a
month now your body is kind of a habit
of running and for a month you are
running really nicely now for the next
week you have decided that I'm not going
to run so previously your body was
speculating that hey this guy is a
runner so I should just adopt like a
runner now for this week you have
decided that no I'm not gonna run that
means now your body is start speculating
that this is not running at him anymore
and when you start running again for the
next week it becomes a little bit
difficult for you to start running and
this is all happening because your body
is speculating something your brain is
speculating something and of APRI
judgmental thing or we can also say kind
of adjusting with the habits of what
things are usually happening exactly
same kind of thing you have just
experienced if you are watching my
videos regularly now I usually start my
video by saying hey there everyone hit a
sheer back again with another video so
your brain automatically start judging
and kind of speculating that this is
what this guy is gonna say but since I
didn't completed my sentence there your
brain didn't thought much about it and
just thrown away that kind of a thought
into garbage time and nothing happened
this is completely okay now similar
thing was tried to be done in the
computer so that we can enhance the
performance of a processor this whole
process is known as speculative
execution in which whenever you try to
open up your computer there are a few
programs that needs to run there a few
computer and the calculation that always
needs to be done and kind of a
user-friendly thing for example in your
Mac there is a finder thing which all of
it needs to be open up in Windows there
is a Windows Explorer which always needs
to be open up and there are so many
programs in calculation which always
happens and it would be really good for
computers if they can do these kinds of
calculation in little bit advanced I
know this is not a
perfect example of using Windows
Explorer and max finder but some kind of
a thing happen like that computer is
doing pre calculation for the work that
you are kind of about to do kind of
speculating that yes you are about to do
that now things get interesting when you
don't do that things which are
speculated now we're humans we like to
go random ways but still these are
prediction that are being made and
sometimes these prediction doesn't work
so what happens these computers when
these calculation are not being used
they just throw them away just like
exactly your brain does but where these
calculations are being thrown up is a
cache memory and some kind of other
parts of the memory which are not
secured and this is exactly the
spectre-1 durability these calculations
are being thrown at such part of the
computer memory which can be accessed
easily by anyone and yes there is a
valid question that you can ask here
that why nobody thought of kind of
attaching this one durability for almost
20 years now this is where the one
durability researchers and pentester
comes in these kind of a guy always
thinks what should be happening just
reverse of that or kind of out of box
thinking and nobody thought about it for
20 years that this one durability or
this dumping of the calculated data can
be used or can be misused is a point of
interest here and this is exactly what
is being taken advantage through the
spec Tier one durability now this whole
advanced programming or pre calculation
of work are also known as speculative
execution this whole thing I definitely
recommend you to read about them but
this was all done so that we can enhance
the performance of computer nobody
thought that this could have been
misused and now the vulnerability is in
front of us everybody is trying to patch
this on a very serious note and yes onto
a side note I would like to add up a
really great thank you to all the
community of InfoSec pen testers and
security researcher who have really
worked hard and brought everybody's
attention towards this one durability
and really it's a thankful thing that
they have done so that the guys who are
having malicious intent cannot really
take advantage of this also I would like
to add here that by understanding the
concept of speculative execution this
vulnerability sounds so simple but it is
not it's a little bit more but yearly a
whole concept is just about the pre-made
execution that was being trying to done
here and being thrown without thinking
much about this one durability and yes
also we can say that in the previous
days like in 70s or 80s or like around
it's that time very very old time the
things were not like as they are right
now at that time these resources
mainframes and desktop all these things
were not shared so that these memory
dumps cannot do really much harm but
right now how the things are changing
towards cloud the sharing of the data is
so much connectivity so much so that is
why this one durability just popped up
and kind of a done a really a nightmare
and yes on to update a lot of people are
just pushing up a lot of updates to make
sure that these wonder abilities are
really patched a lot of mobiles or
software systems Mac has recently
released out a lot of patches and these
are all just kind of a good patches to
do a kind of a final job for that yes
Windows is also pushing out and if I'll
find more about that I'll try to make a
video on that try to explain more of
these things but yes this is all about
spectre-1 durability that's it for this
video in case you have enjoyed this
video and do give it a thumbs up and you
can also hit the subscribe button there
if you want to get the notification you
can hit the bell icon as well I do
upload a lot of content on this channel
that is all related to programming so
that's it for this video and I'll surely
catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
