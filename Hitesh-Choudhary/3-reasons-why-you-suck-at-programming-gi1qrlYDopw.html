with another video now it's little bit
early in the morning almost 5 o'clock in
here and I was trying to reply all of
the emails and checking all the comments
on the YouTube and I noticed one very
interesting comment that says I suck at
programming what should I do to improve
now I have been teaching programming for
a lot of time in here I have been taking
offline boot camps online boot camps
teaching it some of the college's as it
gets faculty there for some of the
online seminars offline seminar so I do
know a thing or two about why do you
suck at programming and in this special
video I'm going to give you three
reasons why you suck at programming and
once you understand what are these
reasons you will be surely able to
figure out why you're bad at programming
and how you can improve on those areas
so let's get started now in this channel
we talk about programming web apps
mobile apps and pretty much everything
related to programming so in case you
are new here consider subscribing now
moving the head on to why people usually
suck at programming I have figured out
the three base and three major reasons
why people are bad in programming and
this will surely help you out let's move
on and the number one reason is lack of
good training now I can understand the
feeling of the frustration of the people
then they say hey I want to learn iOS
development but there is no good iOS
developer in my area who teaches how to
code in iOS same goes for the Android as
well people have asking me numerous of
the time that we want to learn Android
but there is no offline training center
nearby our area and that basically wraps
up that there are no good teachers who
can teach how to code that is very
common and I can understand your feeling
as well because you might be living in a
particular location and having a good
teacher as your particular area is not
at all a compulsion if you find that
that is too awesome but its rarity there
because let's just say a person is good
in doing something or the other thing
finding that person is also again a big
deal now luckily the programming world
and training and everything is moving
online and that is a very good thing now
you can learn from the best of the best
in the world and can test out how do
they teach how what is the teaching
mechanism are we having good interaction
with them or not and all these things
you can figure out through the online
now I'm not saying in here that online
is only the best thing everything has
its own pros and cons as well
no big deals here but having a good
training is the most essential part in
learning programming if your teacher is
able to explain everything every concept
in detail is able to connect to you then
only I would consider that training as
good but I have seen in a lot of
scenarios that what the teacher does is
write the code on blackboard or
whiteboard I consider that
first approach of teaching programming
if somebody is doing that you might want
to stop learning from them whether it's
a school college university some boot
camps or anything if somebody is
teaching you to write code on white
board or blackboard that's the worst
approach codes were always meant to be
done on those computers whether Mac
Windows or Linux but code needs to run
on the computer and that is the first
thing that you might be looking up but
again there are a lot of features that
need to be done in a good particular
training but that wraps up our first
thing find out a good training now you
can also supplement these trainings with
books or online tutorials and all of
these things but again I would like to
also expand this talk a little bit in
here now just like you I also like to
learn from the YouTube as well and in
fact I do learn quite a tons of things
from the YouTube but just learning from
the YouTube is not from an online course
has some of its big cons like for
example there is no structure
particularly good structure that gives
you a full curriculum to learn something
now YouTube has some awesome content but
the problem is a YouTube is everything
is scattered around yes there is an
option of playlists but people usually
don't upload everything in a series wise
and good approach on the YouTube but
again YouTube is a good platform to
learn around but only after once you
have learned and clear up the basics in
the structured approach then you can
move on to the YouTube in fact once I
did learned about the videography and
the handling cameras lenses DSLR I then
moved on and switched onto the YouTube
videos they are helping me but if I
would have been just watching the
YouTube videos probably I would have
taken a lot longer to learn so that
wraps up our point number one is making
good training now the reason number two
- such as programming okay let me just
that ok now that's good no no now the
reason number 2 - circuit programming is
not having enough exposure to the real
world challenges
aka projects now let me explain you how
the things works on now when I write the
code for just an example or
demonstration of a loop or a function I
will always write it flawlessly but the
same loop or same function that I will
be writing for
a project that I am approach approaching
to do or maybe some problem that I'm
specifically trying to solve I'll always
make mistake in those things and as a
student of a programmer it is very
important for you to understand that
programmers do make mistakes and how to
solve that mistake is one of the key
essential element of being a programmer
everybody knows how to write a code
especially not everybody but most of the
people know how to declare available
declare a function or loop but they
don't know basically how to use them or
how to debug them well it's a necessity
so I have seen a lot of offline
trainings that don't bother about the
projects or anything and this is the
most key element in here if you are not
able to understand where you are going
to apply those things after learning
learning that things doesn't really make
any sense for example you might be
learning C++ and if you are not creating
any good style project that solves some
real-world problems then obviously you
are not going to get being interested in
that programming language okay so this
doesn't means I'm I'm getting a harsh on
the C++ or anything it goes for
everything like JavaScript Python
anything just make sure you have an
inner enough understanding of the
project now this gives us a very very
interesting concept as well on point
number two just doing dummy projects who
won't be working you need to understand
the workflow of the project as well
which is very important now it's not
about just declaring or doing the thing
a workflow is something how you are
taking down as a step-by-step approach
of maybe inter inter linking the
database uploading some queries to the
database fetching some queries to the
database at voiced point we are trying
to do what which is very important so
make sure you understand the workflow of
the project base approach as well and do
in a amount of project as well and last
not the least is not pushing harder yes
this is the most solid thing that most
of the people are missing although I
would consider that this is only the 10%
of 15% responsible for why you suck at
programming but this is the most
important than 15% I have seen people
doing programming
doing project as well but still this
somehow I am not getting confidence in
doing the things and that makes it the
15% in here they are not trying to push
themselves harder pushing yourself
extreme or beyond the limit is the way
how you learn of the things if you are
not going to experiment all the things
if you'll fit if you're afraid to get
stale in here that what makes you suck
at programming now once you have taken
down a good training and good project
the next approach should be doing things
on your own maybe you want to design
something on your own maybe just redo
the projects but onto your own and one
important advice is ask little questions
to your instructors okay now I might
someone a little bit bad that I'm just
getting rid of my word but I'm not the
good program is somebody who can handle
its own problem now right now you're
into the training of mine or maybe
somebody else as well and you're just
answering or trying to put a question
there he is answering that's okay but in
the real world approach when you will be
joining some company or making your own
apps there will be a less amount of
people who can actually help you for
sure there will be code and Stack
Overflow but that would not be exact
code that you are looking for so solving
on your own problem means you need to
push harder until a unless you're going
to push yourself beyond limits spend
time with the problems and people get
just voted in one or two days people
spend time with their problems for weeks
or sometimes even months so don't get
disappointed and start pushing yourself
harder and I'll wrap up everything
really quickly in here because it's
awesome to wrap up the things the number
one thing by a circuit programming is
missing of good trainings the second is
missing the word flow approach of the
project and then the third but not the
least one is you are not pushing
yourself beyond the limits push yourself
a little bit harder and you will become
really awesome in programming
I could have presented all these topics
being KZ night stat in here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
