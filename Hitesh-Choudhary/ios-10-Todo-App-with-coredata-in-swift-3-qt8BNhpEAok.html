youtube channel
now this video is specially designed for
the YouTube because from the last iOS
movie I got a huge response various
number of views and I'm having adapt so
today this bearded guy is going to talk
about the cold data in the iOS
development now I can understand core
data has changed quite a lot and a lot
of experienced user are even looking up
into the documentation to figure out the
things and yes it is really that much
awkward out there but the good news is
that things have become much more great
with the code data now the new
programmers will be much more happier
that the core data is so simple out
there it's it's really easy
I couldn't imagine this type of code
data code that I might have written
previously out there so things are
really easy let's tackle that down so
what we're gonna do now again we are
going to build we are going to be
building a to-do app at this time it's
going to use a code data feature now
cool the to do apps nowadays is kind of
a hello world in the previous days of
programming because things are now
little bit complicated like angular or
maybe iOS or Android you don't get full
idea about the application until you do
a to-do app you get a Billy idea about
the hello world things out there yes we
could have done a core data hello world
but it it will not give you much things
out there so it's a good idea to have a
code data app kind of a to-do app you
will look around a couple of more
features as well so this is going to be
a long movie not much long but you can
notice down how much time it is out
there I have no idea how much longer
this movie is going to be so let's
create file new and the project so we
need a new project let me shift this guy
onto the recording screen it's going to
be a single view application obviously
next and what we should do let's call
this as core to do tada
okay to die is good but I'll go with the
to-do and rest of the things is going to
remain same make sure that you check
mark there use code data and let's just
place it anywhere it doesn't really
matter this is kind of a demo project
okay and it's doing a lot of things
waiting to repair please do so I would
like you to run on iPhone 7 actually
let's not go into the debate of that but
you can use any device no problem in
that so here's a remain storyboard let's
get a little bit of the room
I'm already shot of the room but I think
this is good and this looks okay okay
this is my view controller this is
having a viewcontroller.swift file as
well no big deal now first of all let's
create a navigation controller so editor
and make sure that this guy's selected
out there click on the view controller
then go to the editor embed in a
navigation view controller now a lot of
programmers might be saying why you
always do that you could have dragged a
new navigation controller could have
dragged and drop here and could have
clicked on a couple of next segues this
is far more efficient it do that it does
the job and it's much more efficient
it's my personal hobby so view
controller is good now select this view
controller I don't like this is space so
I always just it just scroll view
inserts just uncheck that this is this
is bad and looks good let's just select
this into a background color off let's
choose a background color maybe a little
bit like that this will look good okay
and I would like to run you we haven't
done anything but it's a good idea to
just run the app and see that white
screen out there it's good you know it
might be running somewhere so let me
just grab this guy and there we go this
grace actually looks good I'll make that
a note okay so what we should do first
of all we need a table view so we'll be
just presenting everything into the
table where is the table view this is
the table view and in the previous movie
we have also seen how the table view
goes on just select the table view and
pin it from everywhere without the
constraint so it's going to be 0 0 0 and
0 add 4 constraints and then we are
going to update the frames there we go
table view is done pretty simple now
we need one more screen so let's just
get one more screen view controller and
I would like to add a top button out
there that says plus and when you tap on
that button you will be taken down on to
a new screen where you can add your
tasks and a label that says is it
important or not and then just a button
that says add the task pretty simple yes
it is so now one tip to all of you
whenever you create a new controller
make sure that you immediately create a
new file for that cocoa touch class file
it's a good habit otherwise you will be
just trying to link your data to the
just view controller it will not make
sense it will it there is a huge chance
of making things in go into a mess just
like that so create file new and we're
going to create a new file it's going to
be cocoa touch class next and it's going
to be let's just call this add task VC
or view controller make sure that it's
the subclass of uiviewcontroller
language is swift next and yes please
create it for me and there are a lot of
functions out there we don't need
overrides we don't need these comments
let's just get rid of them and save that
main storyboard select this view
controller go to this newspaper or
identity inspector and this is going to
be a task now it's name is add tasks so
add task view controller now this view
controller is gonna expect the code to
be in the add task view controller now
although we are not following the Model
View controller things out there much
but still I would like to group the
things all together so this this is why
okay looks good now let's just select
this identity inspector I would like to
play around with the color I think this
is good this is good let's just add a
label out there let's just first of all
add a ball button ID them so let's just
search for the but and we're gonna get a
bar button item place it out there not
just the button the bar button item
you're looking for that and it's gonna
say at okay looks good now hold down
your control key
click and drag from the button to this
and click on the show so there we go we
have added a segue save that I think we
should run the app now it would be good
idea to run the app why not actually da
da da where is our app there it is looks
good the table view is looking good
let's just click on the ad and there we
go
new Segway looks good so let's just stop
that and we are making a good progress
I believe that ok let's just add a label
so let's just call the label you can add
more functions out there I just want to
be I just want to stick with a
simplicity out there and in fact labels
would not be a good idea let's just have
a text box so a text field would be good
so text field and let's just say this is
gonna be maybe 40 and 40 from left and
right 2 constraints and make that
horizontal in the container and we would
like it to be fixed from the top maybe
mm 20 how about that ad when constraints
and I think it looks good let's just
update the frames yep it looks good and
since I have given the two from the
sides it's gonna stick to that in the
landscape view as well it's gonna look
good believe me
and let's just give it a placeholder
text as well so it's gonna say enter
your did I did something now enter your
task and there we go looks good I think
this will look good in the center now we
need a switch to make sure that is it
important or not so let's just get a
switch out there maybe somewhere here
now control and drag this guy from here
to here we need press down a shift key
of course vertical spacing Center
horizontal and add these constraints
that's good now we need a button as well
so do search for the but again so let's
just search for the but and there we go
our button okay there we go
doesn't play look
good on in blue so we'll make it white
looks good now the button is gonna say
add task so there we go we are doing
pretty good let's just make it a little
bit bigger I think this will look good
and can I make it bold or not I think
this will just work like that so press
your ctrl key and let's just drag and
drop it here yes we need vertical
spacing and we need Center horizontal
add constraints and let's just update
the frames there we go there is our one
of the most beautiful app in the entire
Apple Store I know that's not true
what's in saying so where is a wrap
there we go click that looks good pretty
good pretty decent to me there we go app
task let's just stop that okay so now
this is good now it's time to talk
between you and me so let's just get
that so what we want to do next is a
kind of a data modelling now in this
case it's pretty simple but you need to
spend a little time on the data
modelling how you want your data to be
gone out there or going out from there
so what we want in this case we need of
course a code data so our data base is
going to be called as tasks maybe and
then we need a couple of things out
there like for example what is of a task
the name of the task and is it important
or not so here the data model is pretty
simple pretty obvious but you should
spend a little time on that so let's
just do that so first of all I would
like to how did this happen okay I have
no idea so let's just get there now
first of all let's go into the code data
this is the file which is automatically
being created and you might want to
click on that now let's add an entity
out there now in the iOS 10 specially
with the Xcode 8 things are much more
simpler now now you can just assume that
your entire database is like a class
that's that's it and let's add an entity
out there so let's add an entity
double-click to rename that I'll call
that as tasks now if you are not going
to make the task the first letter of the
the tea as caps it's gonna pop it up
like hey what are you doing come on make
it her caps versa that's you need to do
now let's add first attribute out there
attributes are like objects in the
classes so this is going to be named and
it's going to be of type mm string it's
good and let's add one more and this
time I'm going to check is it important
or not so I'll call it as is important
now most of my variable
I am PU or ta NT okay is important now
when I make these classes out there are
the boolean specially I like to name
them with is is important is true is
login is not login like that so this is
for personally for me that helps me to
just make sure that the values are true
boolean personal preference you know so
boolean would be good okay now a couple
of more things now notice down here it
says optional now from the database you
are getting you're going to get a value
optional you can uncheck that to save a
little bit time because we are pretty
sure we are going to write the code
based on the values optional or not so
it's completely to us
okay so we have unchecked these tools
and I think we are done with the code
data it's pretty simple now and one more
thing now select this task and make sure
that you produce a code gen of class
definition this is going to be
responsible for converting your entire
entity relationship and everything into
the almost like classes and you can work
pretty easily on them so make sure that
you do that the code gen is really
important okay what next what next we
can do we can handle the view controller
and we can handle the task view
controller as well or add tasks I'm like
to handle the add tasks first of all
because it's kind of a flow out there if
I'm not going to enter any kind of task
it's not going to pop up on the view
controller so it's a good idea to tackle
the add task for us so what we are going
to do we are going to take the task we
are going to take the is important thing
and simply just we'll be passing them
into the database and saving the
database of course so it's it's pretty
simple pretty obvious okay so
let's see how we can do that okay I
might make a couple of mistakes because
this is on the go recording but it's
gonna be fun it's gonna be fun believe
me so first of all this label and we are
going to call this as text weekly maybe
so let's call this as oops did I did
something make command-z please yep and
this is this looks good why it's making
a mess okay looks good
and let's just ctrl and drag this yep
this time it's good so add tasks and we
are going to call this as text field so
text field connect that and we need one
more that is going to be the switch so
it's gonna be a simple switch is
important switch so ctrl and drag this
guy and let's call it as is imp for is
important I know I'm not good at naming
but please excuse me for that and let's
just go there's no update frames out
there I would like to update the frames
here why is it making him okay update
frames looks good now so ctrl and drag
this add task and there we go this time
it's going to be in action and it's
going to be called as a button tabbed or
press whatever you like to call this I
would like to call it as tabbed
anything-anything okay I think the
connections are done and I think it's
good so let's just go here go into the
general view I think everyone can see
that let me make a little bit room out
there okay so now the strategy it's
going to be pretty simple now first of
all when you want to interact with the
database you have to create a context
now this context is going to take your
data to the database or is going to
fetch the data from the database to your
views or going to save that delete that
you know pretty much crud stuff so let's
go on to the app delegate file and show
you some of the stuff out there so this
is the code data stuff the code data
stack and the good news is this
persistent container now in the previous
day
is just kind of a reminder in the
previous days it used to be a couple of
tasks that you have to do in the iOS but
from the iOS 10 the things have changed
specially in the Xcode 8 that the
persistence container is going to be the
only object which is going to perform a
couple of tasks for you I'm not going to
go in depth of that task because it's
completely irrelevant now and we just
have to create a delegate that is going
to be passing I know this is really
weird stuff I'm talking yet let's go and
do that it's much more easier to explain
that things on the go so let's just
create first of all it's little tricky
to create that context so let me just do
that for you and we will understand
things so first of all right okay first
of all I need to build the application
because the code data that I have done
here is not updated and without the
suggestion you cannot code in code data
or maybe next entire hours you cannot
code so it's going to be a UI
application now this is going to have a
shared property out there and then you
have to say we are making you a delegate
so delegate and we have to pass it as
now as an exclamation as a simple AB
delegate so AB delegate okay so this is
my entire object and this object is
going to access the property here which
is this persistent container okay so
let's just do that but we have to do one
more thing we have to wrap this entire
thing into the pair of parentheses there
we go
now for this entire thing we're going to
see access the persistent container and
inside that there is a view context I
know this is a lot of stuff but believe
me this is the one line which you always
have to write when you're working with
the code data without even thinking just
always write that in the entire X iOS 10
just write that always okay since we
will be using that quite a lot let's
make it a context and let context equals
and this line so it's always going to be
with us okay that's one thing it's going
to give us an error that hey you are not
using it just replace it with an
underscore let's not worry about that
so now it's good now let's create a task
okay which is going to be off type of
coal data context entity or in short you
can say classes as well kind of classes
so let's just call this as tasks and I'm
writing the tasks in capital because I'm
referring to that entity in the code
data now open a pair of parentheses and
I'm looking for this context which says
anis managed object context not the
upper one this is guy okay and I'm gonna
say context there we go now it this is
the type context this is my variable
that I have declared or the constant
that have declared here so okay so now
we have an object which is referencing
to the entity out there obviously this
entity is going to have two things the
name and is important that the property
that we have declared so let's just call
this as task dot and you can say is
important and name is out there okay so
name is going to be there and the name
is going to be being filled by the
textbox that we have created so let's
just call this as text field what I have
written here the text field dot txt now
there is a problem we haven't checked
the a flat statement out there I don't
want to go into the optional chaining
right now I've created one more video
for that that is in the playlist in the
YouTube you can watch out that I know
this is a bad way of doing the things
but bear with me the video is already
going 20 minutes and it's going to take
30 40 minutes maybe so bear with me guys
this is a long video okay but in the
boot camps or in the video courses that
I do I make short videos and I split
them into various chunks but you know
sometimes I think these long videos are
appreciated by a couple of people so
task dot is important is going to be
filled by the state of the switch which
is is important dot is on so it's saying
is it on then true or false you know how
the typical boolean stuff goes on and
this is good this is good now all these
things are happening when the button is
being tabbed make sure that you do might
remember that okay now it's time to
simply save the data
to save the data it's really simple now
so what you have to do just copy this
entire thing where you have accessed the
persistent container till the entire
pair of parentheses and this is now save
the data to core data I'm not trying to
sing but bear with me and you have to
say simply dot save context there we go
you have saved everything into the
database it's pretty good now I want
simply that when somebody add the data
he should be popped back directly into
the table view so we can just pop the
navigation controller so let's just call
this navigation controller dot Pop view
controller and it's going to be true I'm
pretty sure there is something to pop so
there we go exclamation say that looks
good it's good idea to run their things
let's just run that and it's running
it's running it's running okay do
something okay here we go let's just
write something and let's just say
testing me
testing me it doesn't really make sense
so add the task we got part back we got
something into the database but we
haven't actually printed that out so no
big deal okay so I think this this stuff
is done now I know I have done a couple
of mistakes I'm not gonna rant about
that again and again I haven't checked
whether the text box is filled or empty
I could have actually grayed out the
button until somebody writes something
into that or could have done a flood
check but again I'm I'm missing out that
point deliberately because it's gonna
make things a little bit longer okay
there we go let's just get rid of this
to see did receive memory warning x' and
things like that
so let's go on to the main storyboard
now we haven't connected the things so
let's just connect them and let's just
select this view controller split the
screen make sure that says a view or not
it doesn't really say add task view
controller it should say that it should
say view controller okay there we go
looks good now first of all I have to
add a reference from the table view
so control and drag this guy and let's
just call this as table view and that
said we need only just a reference from
the table view so that we can reference
it later on so let's just click on the
view controller go into the general
settings looks good okay now let's do
the usual ritual stuff so table view dot
data source is going to be self and
table view dot delegate is also going to
be self so that later on we can
reference that and for sure we are going
to reference that in this movie now
let's add the two protocols out there so
it's going to be UI tableview datasource
yep datasource and comma UI table view
delegate so there we go
it's going to rent about the two
functions that you haven't added yet so
let's just add them so what are those
two functions the one is a is called as
number of rows in section this is the
one and the second one is cell for row
at so let's just call this cell for row
ad in fact I would like to add that at
the top so it doesn't it really makes
sense but it is not going to bother much
about the code code so cell for row at
this is the one okay so we can just
place them anywhere but what should I do
okay now I think this guy should go on
the top but again it doesn't really
matter much the first thing that I would
like to tell it is how many rows you
want to have that so for that let's
create a new area so let's just call
this as tasks this is going to be our
array and let's just make them I'm
pretty sure it's going to be an array of
type task which is our entity and it's
going to be empty at first okay make
sense and make sure you declare it
outside the viewdidload because we want
to be we want it to be accessible by
everyone so let's just call this as
return tasks dot count hmm make sense
make sense okay let's just add a couple
of room here
okay now let's do one thing so let's
sell is going to be equal to UI table
view cell okay and let's just return
this cell okay things are good now okay
so what we have to do now it's going to
be simple we want to fetch the data from
the database or the code data to the
table view that's it so let's just do
that how we can do that okay first of
all this is important okay so how we can
tackle that okay let's go here and try
to do that here so let's create a new
object out there so let's just call this
as let task this is declared inside the
table view function so it's unique so
let task is equal to the tasks and in
that task I'm going to call index Padro
so I know which row you are talking
about okay that's one thing now since I
have pointed out that particular object
from with the use of this task I can
actually access them so I can simply say
that my cell dot our text label okay
you're not suggesting me the text label
and why is that
okay it's not doing that so let me just
build that okay so let's just call this
at cell dot txt okay it's not suggesting
me because I have made a mistake here I
haven't actually added these parentheses
so command B build that again okay now
it's going to suggest me the things so
let's just try that so cell dot text
label dot text now this text is going to
be equal to the name that is the entity
of the attribute in the entity of the
database so let's just call this as task
dot name okay this is good
and what about is important we will
handle that maybe then and I would like
to add an exclamation out there as well
because I'm pretty sure it is there it
is there okay so let's just save that
it's not going to pop anything on the
screen yet because it's not done now
what we want to do now let me just run
this app for a minute
because I think something is going wrong
or maybe right let's just things will
show up in a moment so let's go there
code data where are you there you are
let's just add the things and we have
added previously one as well which is
not showing up in that because we
haven't fetched anything from the
database yet so let's just call this as
test to add the tasks nothing happens as
expected so we need to actually fetch
the data from the database so let's make
a new function for that let's call this
as simply the get data so let's just do
that I like to do it here so let's just
call this function ah get got data no
get data not fat ah come on get data and
it's not going to return anything it's
going to just fetch the data there we go
let me scroll it a bit on the top okay
okay what it's going to do first of all
will create a context now it's always a
good idea at the initial days to just
write these lines I could have just gone
and copied that from the add task view
controller dot Swift but I'll write it
just for you so how do we do that come
on repeat it with me so it's going to be
UI application and what you have to make
it as shared yes
oops not that shared and make it a
delegate okay and now let's just
typecast that as app delegate delegate
now wrap that into the pair of
parentheses and then you have to use
got persistent container and dot view
context see you remember that now and
let's make that as a context so let
context is equals to this guy looks good
looks good
okay now how do we get the data now
getting the data is pretty simple you
just have to pop or just fill that a
task array that we have created on the
top and just fetch it into the from the
database so it's really simple so let's
just call this as the tasks and let's
just fill that up with that how do we do
that so we simply say context dot fetch
and we have to simply say task this guy
because we are we are mentioning that
particular entity there can be many as
well and you have to simply say dot
fetch request there we go it's going to
pop an error in a minute there we go now
why is that error because when you do
these things it expects you to wrap that
up in to do try catch block out there so
no big deal so let's just try that so
how we can try that just write a try
here and then just wrap everything into
a do catch block you know the simple
stuff and there we go and wrap that up
did I did it right up there we go and
there after you have to write catch and
there we go we are going to write a line
in the catch block as well simply saying
print fetching oops fetching failed okay
for some reason maybe okay so this is
good now we have actually fetched the
data but we want the data to be appeared
as soon as the view table view appears
out there and there is a good function
built-in out there I would like to do
that in the just below the viewdidload
and it simply says view will appear so
let's just call this view will appear
there we go and here I want to do two
things okay
so there we go now the first thing that
I want to do is simply to bring the data
and just reload the things so the first
thing is get the data from go
old data and the second thing is reload
the table view okay looks good
so how do we get the data obviously we
have created a function for that so get
data is the function it's being called
how do we reload the data it's pretty
simple we can use the table view
reference that we have created and we
can simply say reload data pretty simple
stuff you know okay I think it's a good
idea how a good time to run the app
let's just try that and you know how
simple it is nowadays to just work out
with a code data it's pretty simple
obvious okay it's running it's running
somewhere it is here it is so we can see
testing me and testing - is there now
because it's in the code data let's add
that and let's call this as test three
and let's just add this and there we go
it popped up because when the view
actually appears it just runs to two
things the get data and the reload
function as well now don't just change
them because first it's going to load
the view and then get the data it's not
going to work everything has to be in
the procedure out there looks good okay
now let's just try something for this
important as what we have actually
missed that so it can be really simple
so let's just see let's add a smiley out
there so if now if the task is important
so what can I do
okay so let's just see that if task dot
is important then what I can do and in
the else case else I can just have this
and have this here and in fact this line
we can copy this no big deal and if the
task is important then let let's just
wrap this into this guy and this guy
obviously we have to make them into a
string because we are doing this guy
okay let's just add a smiley out there
so it's going to be controlled command
space
and what we can do we can add some
smiley out there I do love the Smiley's
actually so let's just say we want to
add hmm there's a lot of choices this
guy so that says that yes it's important
you have to do it very first and there
we go looks save and let's just run the
app we haven't done much change out
there but it's a good idea to run your
app randomly here and there so there we
go there we go everything is important
testing testing testing let's add one
thing that is not important
so let's just call this as test for not
important at task
there we go it's working now what I want
to do is I want to add the swipe to
delete the functionality right now it's
not having that and I'm feeling bad
about it so let's just do that
now here we are going to have a commit
editing style there we go this is one
I'm looking for and we have to do a
couple of things while deleting okay so
let's just do that first of all I would
like to make a context now this time I'm
not going to write that I'm going to
simply copy this and add a context here
now why we cannot use the upper context
yes you are right because it is defined
inside a function and that's why you
cannot use that context okay so you do
have a context that is good now let's
just say if editing style is actually
equal to dot delete then only we want to
run this code what we want to do okay so
let's just say we want to have a task
variable and a let task is equal to it's
going to be simply having tasks I
actually want to point or want to get
somehow the reference of that row on
which the swipe to delete is being
activated so it's a good idea to just
declare a new variable and we do have
some guy who who can do that who can
pass on the reference and that is you
know that index path and we have got
that of course we need to write row
there we go now we have a reference or
that
particular guy or that particular row on
which I want to do this delete action
okay important is how do we delete that
okay it's really simple you have to
simply say context dot delete now you
have to pass on an ns-managed object
which can be served by the task as well
there we go we have done that now just
the deleting is not going to solve the
problem because we have to save the
context as well just like what we have
done here so in the add view task we can
see that this is how we save the context
so let's just do that in the view
controller so I'll be I'll copy this
copy this and paste that here and we're
going to say save context okay save is
done no big deal okay but when we have
actually saved the context we want to
actually fetch the data again and we
want to reload the table so that so that
it just appears out there because the
view is not going to be loaded again
when we do the swiped action out there
okay so how we can do that it's really
simple we can just reload the data and
we can do something like this let's just
say tasks this guy and task is going to
simply say context dot fetch and it's
going to simply fetch from our task dot
fetch request okay this is good but
again this is going to pop it a try
catch air around things out there but
what I can do is simply can copy this
from somewhere which I where I've
already done this so there we go
okay there we go we can just copy this
entire thing and I can place this in
place of that okay this looks good now
regardless of anything when the delete
action is being done I just want to get
out here I think this is this guy is
from I have no idea where it is from so
I can just go out here and I can simply
say that table view should reload the
data is it good I think it's good so
let's just build that what is happening
here build succeed so what we are doing
here is simply we are looking for a
style
that is delete if somebody swipes we
have created a context we have reference
to the point or to the row where we want
to relate the things thankfully to the
index Padro which has done the things
for us then we want to just delete the
task and just for the user perspective
we want to delete that and update the
things as quickly as possible so what we
are doing is we are simply trying to
update the tasks the array in to simply
to fetch the new data out there and we
want to reload the data pretty simple
let's just run this will succeed always
like this will succeed you know and tada
come on you can do that come on load up
where are you running here we are okay
so I don't like this guy so let's just
swipe and delete this and there we go
it's gone
we haven't actually got the animation
but we can leave that some day for some
day let's just delete this there we go
let's just add this and I can simply say
not like that or maybe say mmm
done vid to-do app it's important yes
and the task and now I can say I've done
the to-do list app and I can swap that
and I can delete that that's good but
there is one problem and I would simply
say that all of you please try that now
if I just add the task it just adds it
now it's not there but let me see what
happens when I simply say hello there is
an empty row out there and this is the
row it's important that's why it's there
but if I just turn it off and just don't
write anything it's gonna simply just
have an empty row out there and if I
just now say tea and add the task there
we go an empty row because we haven't
actually checked the if let out there
and this is making a problem but again
no big deal we can solve that maybe
