with another video in this video I want
to talk about how many laptops are in
general how many computers I have used
so far now I have been using computers
for awhile now and I have used a lot of
them and for many purposes right from
the simple web development editing
simple HTML pages to some really
comprehensive things like installing
virtual machines network simulators
doing some fantastic stuff and a whole
lot more and how can we forget about
Xcode and Android emulators like Android
studio and everything so I have done a
pretty good job with the computers and
laptops so I will tell you exactly what
model of laptops I have used so far what
are my complaints what are my issues and
everything that you really want them I
received a very interesting email asking
me this question that hey tej you have
been a really good in programming and
doing a lot of jobs right from the pen
testing to web dev and Android studio
Xcode a whole lot so how many computers
you have used so far in life
and can you make a video on that so yes
I found that topic really interesting so
I'm making a video on that in this
entire video trust me this is going to
be a little longer video I'll walk you
through what I have used what was my
first computer looked like and how many
computers I have used so far and they
are there is a long list here so let's
get started with the first one
the very first computer that I got was a
desktop it was not a very powerful
machine and in fact I didn't learn much
on it because that was my very first
computer I played a lot of games on it
especially the basketball I was a big
fan of NBA basketball I played a lot on
it it was not a high-end machine just
like one gigs of ram and I had a
graphics card as well at that time I I
collected a lot of money for that
because I wanted that graphic card and
it was I think it was dual code or code
to do processor I don't remember exactly
and that was my very first machine I
learned how I can play music how I can
watch movies on it and how I can play
games on it and that's all about it now
where is that machine right now I
actually donated that machine to one of
the construction worker that came to my
house he he told me his story that how
he has studied hard and now he's leaving
the construction life and now he's a
teacher in a government school in his
area in a small village there so I got
really impressed and apart from paying
him for his wages for the construction
work i gifted him next job I told him
that hey it's not a very high end
machine but at least good for getting
started I got started with that machine
so you can use that he was really happy
having that machine so that machine is
gone and I cannot show you any photos or
hymn things for that so it it's gone
there now so that was my very first
machine completely happy even though it
was just a dual code or Core 2 Duo
processor with 1 gigs of RAM now our
phones have more RAM than that a desktop
but it was really amazing machine I
learned a lot specially playing the
music and watching movies was always fun
on that machine and of course it's kind
of a nostalgia with that machine I still
sometimes visit to that village and see
my desktop still doing some good work
helping people to learn something about
computers and that was that is what
makes me happy my second machine was a
Dell branded laptop I think the name of
the laptop was Dell studio 15 or
something the particular set or the
particular specification with that name
is now discontinued it's not there makes
me feel a little bit old but that was my
second computer a rather laptop it was a
pretty decent machine I think it was
with 2 gigs of ram or I think 4 gigs of
RAM don't remember exactly not a very
again high specific but wheat was again
having a graphic card I played a lot of
games on it and especially the era of
Call of Duty and everything but that was
my first laptop and I actually started
to learn about computing and everything
and one of that thing was pen testing so
I got involved in pen testing and
learning Linux over that laptop that
laptop was overtly overly used and I
faced a lot of heating issues with that
now was it a problem of the Dells I
would say no because that machine was
designed to be running Windows on it but
since I was learning
I did install a lot of operating system
on it and that included a backtrack
version three I guess or version two
again makes me feel old because the
backtrack operating system is now
discontinued and you don't see it
anywhere on the Internet the successor
you probably know that as the kali linux
but yes I'm that old and I used to have
backtracked version three or maybe two
so that was the very first operating
system that I install on my Dell a few
initial days I worked on the windows
learned about the web application
penetration testing and a lot of that in
the meantime I learned about
virtualization and installing a lot of
virtual machine on that as I was moving
into the pen testing domain I also
learned about the Linux a lot about the
Red Hat specific things and Ubuntu
specific things so I did install a lot
of Red Hat machine Fedora machines on on
the laptop it was getting formatted
almost every single week almost all of
my Sundays were going on for installing
and reinstalling this stuff finding out
the package looking up or the solution
for somehow I can run my Wi-Fi card or
the sound card just like that so that
machine it took a lot and by lot I mean
yes it took a lot of heavyweight dramas
there and eventually what it does since
I was installing Ubuntu and all those
machines the hardware was not that much
compatible and it gave me a lot of
heating issues so much of the heating
issues that some of the components got
fried due to extra heat and it got in a
really bad condition even I worked on it
so much that the mouse trackpad the
color of that was was totally gone from
there and still the machine is still
working I gifted it to one of my close
friend and he still uses it he doesn't
use it as a heavy user he just put a
windows on that but he just uses it for
active purpose and that it he doesn't
run it for over exhaustive things that I
have done with that laptop and finally I
left that computer as well but it was a
good machine having a good experience
with Linux and Windows back and forth
sometimes dual boot sometimes three
boots that machine was not meant to be
but really it was a good experience with
Dell 15 the only complaint is why so
much of the
it was such a nightmare to have that
kind of heat of it's such a good brand
of laptop my third machine that I used
and I still have got it is my HP laptop
I still have this laptop here with me
and it's working fine it's having an
Intel Core i3 with AMD graphics card I
believe it's the one gigs of graphic
card and I upgraded its RAM to eight
gigs because I don't like the slow
computers eight gigs of ram and of one
gigs of graphic card I think a hard left
is around 500 GB s or something doesn't
really care for that so this is my third
machine now by the time I bought this
machine I have actually given a lot of
seminars and workshops using this
machine but later on I got evolved and
got involved in a lot of situation where
I was installing it entire cloud stack
on this machine doing a lot of ns3 work
the network simulator and this machine
was not meant to take in that kind of
situation like installing like freeing
for virtual machine running them all the
same time this was not meant for it the
only issues that I faced with this
laptop particular I don't know what
brand it is it's just HP I don't
remember the exact model number or
something
the only issue that I got is its heating
issues being such a new laptop from
within a week or so it was giving me so
much of the heating issues I did got to
the HP Center did try to checked it out
and they say it's just like that the fan
rotating speed is quite anomalous
probably I'm editing a lot of videos on
it that's why it's doing it I have
really no idea why it's making so much
of the heat I was using a Adobe Premiere
Pro for editing a few of my videos but
again it was so much of the fan rotating
speed I didn't liked it that much so I
don't recommend this laptop for anybody
but still it's the decent machine for an
average user who just write web-based
codes and everything like that but again
the fan noise is such a such a crazy
thing it can drive you nuts any single
time so that's my third machine that I
used now in the mean time when I was
using this machine I thought that hey
let's give it a shot in iOS development
and everything so I bought my very first
Mac Mini so this is my
very first Mac Mini that I bought and
it's a really decent machine with such a
price point of the range Apple is giving
you such a huge thing inside the small
pack machine you can do all kinds of iOS
development on this machine decent it
was like having four gigs of RAM and a
pretty decent stuff like that on an
average not very high-end but good
enough to get started in iOS development
and once you get started in iOS
development every app gets a little bit
high or you start working as an
independent contractor it's a lot of
money so this machine can make a lot of
money because iOS development yes it
makes a lot of money and I won't lie on
that compared to Android Android is for
hitting the mass audience because most
of the paying audience is inside the
apple domains and most of the free users
are in the Android domain consider me it
wrong here but this is my experience
that I pays that Apple users don't think
much they just buy it like that and
Android users try to think a lot and
they buy less compared to the Apple user
call me wrong here but this is my
personal experience that I have faced
now this machine was quite good but in
the meantime I brothers say that hey I
want to get started in Apple and I want
to change my machine to Apple what do
you suggest I said you can take this
machine and I'm going to buy a new Mac
Mini I wanted the high-end version with
the fusion drive eight gigs of ram and
everything so this I hope you can see
this is now saying a web development
here and we just moved it like that so
this machine is now being used for web
development I bought another Mac Mini
for rest of my work I did spend a lot of
time with that I loved absolutely loved
the interface performing issues and
everything I was making videos like a
beach I was doing a lot of Xcode project
like a beach every single day and got no
complaint at all no heating issues no
crashes it just handles everything
nicely and smoothly but eventually I
realized that I have to travel and take
boot camps as well so I need a machine
that can run Xcode as well as I can do
all the stuff just like reliably I was
doing with this and that brings up my
next computer so this is my next
computer
a MacBook Pro and it comes with all the
ports that you see this is a little bit
rare to find nowadays but yes this is
this was my next machine I almost gave a
lot of bootcamps on this machine and I
absolutely loved it some peers - now the
performance of this machine is not what
I'm used to now because it's a little
bit slower machine
I cannot edit videos like in Final Cut
Pro and everything that I'm used to do
now but still this machine still can
take a lot that I'm giving to it and I'm
satisfied with this machine this is a
MacBook Pro I think late 2015 or
something like that but still I love
this machine and I think this is going
to laughs fighting a couple of more
years before I give it to somebody so
still this is one of my favorite machine
and this is my first MacBook that I
always wanted to get so I love this
machine now in the meantime I got a need
of another machine which can perform
decently well and there were some
interns that came around for writing
blogs and everything for one of the
clients so I did bought this machine
this is a Lenovo machine that I bought
this is not a powerful machine otherwise
how it looks like and I think this has
got really low thing it's got intel
pentium processor which is really really
old and I think it has got 4 gigs or 8
gigs of RAM didn't use this machine a
lot we're just having running in Ubuntu
now and there's some Word documents and
everything are being edited on it
nothing much extraordinary is being done
but this machine is just lying around
sometimes my dad loves to watch movies
or just likes to buffer on YouTube just
like that so this is still a machine in
my home so I would like to use it much
but it's still there now almost a year
back I bought this beast that you can
see here this is the top grade version
of IMAX the bigger one and I absolutely
love this beached
this beast just in the last 30 days or
so it has produced almost more than 100
videos to be precise I think more than
130 videos and processing that kind of
videos does require a really
machine also apart from that it has
handled Android studio nicely it has
handled Xcode simultaneously Adam and a
lot of other IDE else well this is one
of Abby's machine mine is installed with
22 gigs of RAM a fusion drive of 2
terabytes and decent graphic card as
well have phase no issues at all this is
kind of a machine that I love the only
problem that I faced with this machine
is in making the videos because that
resolution of this screen is 5 K YouTube
does support 4k and other platforms also
so I cannot make videos on this so I had
to buy this smaller machine here as well
I hope you can see that that's the
machine is HD so I record all of my data
my recording area and I drag and drop
everything there and record there so
that's my beast machine and recently I
bought another one so recently almost a
couple of days ago I bought this one
this is a very flaky flaky laptop I
don't really care what kind of model it
is it's a Lenovo machine and if I can
see its IdeaPad 310 now this is not a
paid promotion for anybody so recently I
bought another machine which is this one
this is a Lenovo this is the latest one
I have bought it like two or three days
ago or maybe a week I don't remember
exactly the day or date it's the lenovo
idea IdeaPad 310 now this is not a paid
promotion by anybody like Lenovo or Mac
or apples or just like that I'm just
sharing what machines I have used so far
and what I love about them but I don't
love about them so this is an idea pad
310 I don't really care if it's the
Lenovo machine after I just asked him
but hey I need to gig to Gig soft
graphic card eight gigs of ram almost
500 gigs off hardest there and I 5/7 gen
processor because I was more interested
in what inside this stuff rather than
what kind of standing they are covering
up so I don't really care what this is
having was a really good thing that I
liked about it let me first place it
back now
I like this machine I haven't used it
much but this is really a beast
it can handle Android studio a lot of
virtual machines on its own not having
any heating issues or anything like that
still I haven't tested it much but it's
the decent machine for running
windows and all of that I'm running a
latest version of Windows 10 on it I
don't use it much but yes it's the
decent machine so I know this is a long
long long video but these are just a few
overview of the computers and machine
that I've used so far still there is lot
more discus and lots more to talk about
but I think let's give it a break here
