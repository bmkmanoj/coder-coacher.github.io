with another video this is a different
setup because we are planning something
good for this channel and the basically
what I'm planning right now is to start
a lot of videos regarding programming
and especially the miniseries is like
designing a shopping cart website
designing an uber clone on android as
well as on iOS and stuff like that is
about to get started very soon
right now I'm a little bit busy with my
iOS app and stuff to be launched for
learned code online but it's almost
almost done and we're gonna get started
with DC's later on right now let's just
focus on nearly perfect a PHP MySQL
development set up for a web development
in 2017 and yes I'm aware of the
situation that a lot of you are facing a
little bit problem in setting up your
development environment for PHP MySQL
development stuff and also I have
written a nearly perfect there so that
other people cannot jump on me and can
say hey that was a click wait and you
got it ok so let's get started and let
me talk you through with what kind of
setup we are talking about for PHP MySQL
so obviously we need a server and we do
need my screen is by the way here this
is not an HD screen although it's an Mac
but not resolution anyways let's get
started and talk about what do we need
for PHP MySQL setup obviously we do need
a server and you can go with the Apache
or other things and we need PHP of
course we need MySQL and we need an
awesome text editor so I'm gonna get
started with that also I'm gonna give
you a lot of choices and we're gonna set
it up right now so first off my favorite
choice is zamp and zamp is actually
freely available and is a cross-platform
and I would recommend use damp but a lot
of people don't like zamp and I don't
know what the reason is it's available
for Windows Linux and Mac and if we are
going to be using and installing this
one but other options that you might be
looking up is actually vamp which is for
Windows it's windows apache mysql PHP
server and similarly for mac guys there
is a MAMP
which is for mac
man band man Pro you just need a map
okay so these are other options right
now we're gonna go with this zamp guy
and I have already downloaded it on my
desktop there and should be extracting
in a second there we go
verifying zamp VM host X just like that
it's available for both Mac and Windows
in the meantime it's installing and
stuff let's talk about it has installed
finishing there and I can just show you
there for Mac guys it's actually very
simple you just have to drag and drop it
into your application folder for Windows
guys you have to just go through with
regular stuff like click click Next I
agree yes ok you know that basic stuff
so I'm gonna just drag and drop it in my
application and for me that's that's it
and it's copying the stuff in the
meantime it just copy the stuff let me
show you what are the other things that
we are gonna need for basically most of
the stuff you are done now comes up the
text editor and what do I recommend now
first thing that I recommend is to have
a sublime text 3 or if you are a fan of
2 that's okay too we we won't be using
it much but I highly highly recommend
everybody to have this text writer if
you are calling yourself as a web
developer you will find you will be
finding yourself using it quite a lot
and quite often so make sure it's there
sublime text it's it's no exception it
should be there ok on your system and
the next one that we are going to be
using is gonna be Adam dot IO and just
to give you a quick update this is not a
click wait ok enough but Adam has
recently launched an Adam IDE so that
you can write your Java PHP c-sharp and
typescript code in Adam as an IDE
right now it's a text editor but it is
evolving as an IDE and just to give you
a brief idea about it let me open up
their blog and in the blog recently it
has been posted there we go introducing
Adam IDE and if you read this blog they
have collaborated with Facebook and have
got Adam ID for how c-sharp Java PHP we
are gonna make a video on
very soon so we're gonna work on it very
soon very soon right now don't need to
bother about it
so go ahead download the Mac an Adam
it's available again for cross-platform
and everything and also go ahead and
download the sublime text and make sure
the samp is there too
okay so I'm gonna minimize it for a
second okay and my zamp is there so let
me open up my launchpad and open up the
stamp let me open them on the other
screen okay
okay so it said verifying zamp
and I need to open it up okay taking a
little bit while now here are a couple
of changes that has being made in the
samp now it's kind of working on an IP
address you can map it to localhost as
well no big deal so let's start it first
of all and once you start the samp
itself then you need to start your
services as well
so it's taking a little bit while see
this yellow dot it needs to be turned
green green is good for go so this is
what we are gonna have right now okay
let me open up my browser in the
meantime okay there we go again sublime
text and Adam will do but again there
are some couple of good options
available and one of them is PHP strong
this is again it's PHP okay I wrote it
that's wrong PHP storm is amazing but
it's paid it's paid it's only available
for 30 days free trial and I have to say
these jet brain guys they make amazing
ideas honestly they are amazing they're
so there we go it's now green and if you
say go to application it's not gonna
work right now you have to switch on
services and we have to start services
for MySQL as well as Apache you don't
need Pro FTP D right now I think we're
just gonna start it anyway you can start
at all I could have done that anyways
let's go to general and go to my
application go to application okay and
if you see the space that means
everything is running but not everything
if you'll just switch on to this
PHP myadmin it's gonna say new Sam
security concept and it's it's not
amazing it's amazing security wise but
you have to do a little bit of
configuration in the file
HDTV DS - is zamp dot config and I'm
going to show you how you can do that I
have to fire up a finder I can close
this guy finder or your document viewer
whatever that is and you're gonna see a
device zamp they're too much of the
noise too much of the traffic here but
again in the Sam
there we go why is it saying like that
shouldn't be saying okay I can actually
unplug that okay there we go what you
have to do is open up your lamp and make
sure you go into the volumes and then
click on this mount what this mount will
do it will open up a new IP e ish thing
kind of a shared thing here just click
on that go into lamp and then there is a
path that you have to travel go into e
TC and then into extra and then you can
see this file which is HTTP D - zamp dot
conf it's a configuration file for zamp
I'm going to open that up you can open
in any editor even an atom I'm going to
choose other and I'm gonna open it up in
sublime text let's open it up okay there
we go my sublime text is here let me
bring it up there we go I hope you can
see that okay I hope everybody is able
to see it okay now what you have to do
is look at around line number 20 ish in
this case make sure you are looking for
this a /op slash lamp PHP mind for this
is the section there you should be
looking up it says require local you
have to delete it don't worry just
delete it all and then you have to say
granted and then you need to save this
and once you save this then you need to
restart your server so go ahead in the
general we're gonna stop this it's going
to also stop your services don't worry
and
you have to start it I think they should
have given and should have given us a
restart button there no worries no
complaints at all so let's just start it
wait for a few second till it turns
green you know Green is good
okay so expecting things to work up now
come on why it is so slow come on do it
come on okay so taking a little bit
while don't have to do in the meantime
don't have anything to do in the
meantime so there we go
it has launched and now we need to start
all the services see this time I did it
start off okay let's wait for it a
couple of more seconds there we go it's
done and now we are gonna go go to
application and now if I check my PHP my
admin should be working and there we go
nice and easy and let's take it to one
more step now and try to show you where
to put up your all of your files and
everything so we haven't mounted it
actually so go to volume and mount that
again okay and there we go into the
mount lamp and there we go htdocs in the
htdocs actually you keep all the things
which you need to develop for PHP and
things and index dot PHP you can just
delete all of them no big deal but I'm
gonna click on to a new folder and just
like always we are gonna name it at test
okay and let's fire up our atom as well
because we need to do a little bit
configuration in atom as well no big
deal you can just start using it
directly as well but I'm gonna show you
a couple of plugins that are helpful and
I recommend you to have them so that you
can just work on it okay there we go our
atom and first of all let's see how the
things are gonna work okay so I'm gonna
close all of this and I'm gonna save
this command s to save this and let's
find out our location to save it here
lamp and htdocs' inside the test and
we're gonna name this as index dot PHP
and that's it I'm gonna save this okay
and we're gonna write some PHP code not
much
awesome PHP code just basic echo of
hello world not big deal okay there we
go
so folder structure okay not now I don't
need get right now so let's just say
we're gonna write some PHP basic stuff
there we go and we're gonna go with echo
and let's just call this as hello world
I know this is not a readable font save
that and let me bring that up not a big
deal we're just getting started here so
there we go and gonna launch up my
browser there and just after the IP I'm
gonna write my folder name which is test
in this case there we go how the world
okay now it's time to show you around a
couple of important plugins that you
should be having it right now my atom
doesn't have it so we can install it on
the go
atom preferences for Windows guys it's
under the windows and preferences that's
it and I'm gonna click on install and
just like always I love the very first
plug-in which is Emmet I'm gonna show
you right now I'm not gonna install that
it's gonna consume a little bit time
there we go Emmet it's the essential
tool you should always have it and there
are a PHP a couple of recommended ones
that you should have one is PHP server
you can configure linter for PHP as well
but I think this language PHP is already
there that means you're gonna get syntax
highlighting and suggestions for all PHP
just right there but I would recommend
you to go with the autocomplete PHP as
well it it has worked really great for
me and I think you should go this is by
PKM Oh hahaha nicely in there you should
go ahead at least install that and there
is a PHP server as well
let me show you that PHP server come on
I am NOT able to find the PHP server
there we go it's there somewhere little
bit down PHP server and what happens
when you install the PHP server is
actually you can just right click on any
folder and you're gonna get option of
start PHP here so you don't need to put
all the files in htdocs' sometime maybe
are just doing some basic stuff of the
PHP you can directly just right click on
there let me show you how does that work
I'm gonna install that here we do have
time to install this one thing that I
don't like about the atom is it's it it
doesn't have any progress bar to show
you show me the progress of whether the
server is installing it's just stop
there or something like that so it's
amazing plugin i recommend it to go
ahead basically what it does it gives
you an option of right click and just an
option of start PHP here so that you can
start the PHP pretty much anywhere even
on the desktop
maybe on the desktop or C Drive or any
Drive basically ok and this is the
reason why I was not installing it in
front of you I have to do some kind of
trickery with the video editing because
it's not getting installed if I if I
just okay there we go finally it has
installed and if I just right-click and
there we go you can see the option PHP
server here this is the option that it
gives you so that you can start it onto
a c drive what do you drive or wherever
you like it ok so this was the quick
nearly perfect PHP setup a PHP MySQL
setup for web development and I highly
recommend you to try that out it's
pretty easy and you should be
comfortable now to go with your own PHP
code or PHP project that whatever you
are working on so that's it for this
video and I'll surely catch you up in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
