back with another video so what this
video is all about this video is about
solving the problems when you will
design iOS app and in fact why to go
just with the iOS apps when you'll
design Android apps iOS app windows apps
unity games writing a simple HTML code
you will fall into the problems bugs
will be there but it's our job as a
programmer to learn how we can solve
those problems and I got one very
interesting such situation like that
here so what we have as you can already
see Christian I hope you I'm not
trancing your name badly but I'll call
you Christian I hope that's okay so
Christian posted me that he is facing a
problem I asked him to push his code on
the github and I'll be downloading a
repo from the github and I'll be solving
your problem not only I'll be solving a
problem I'll show you that how the
process actually goes up and how we look
on to the online documentation and solve
these processes okay it sounds like a
plan
okay let me know in the comment
Christian from which country you are
it's always good to find that wherever
the students are learning okay so this
is the github URL and you can easily
download any github project just by
clicking here and I'll be downloading a
zip file I've already downloaded and
placed it on my desktop and this is
pretty simple stuff just download like a
zip file and there are a couple of
things here so let me just open this up
and there we go now although the project
was zipped pretty badly I would say I'm
not trying to be rude but the project
was packed not very good so but again we
got the project so I extracted this this
just got me a single file that was
picker view number two dot exe workspace
not of cause a big use i extracted this
one and I found this guy here the
project file and the project itself so
this is this one is good you only need
to push these two guys nothing else you
don't need to zip it the Xcode is gonna
the source tree is gonna do all the
things for you so one idea is don't just
zip out and just put everything the
files should have a good structure okay
I hope I'm not being very rude here I'm
just trying
make you a good programmer and that's my
job okay now let's just open this guy
and the problem that he was facing is
being written here as well picker view
displaying different data okay okay so
picker view is having a different data
so let's look at their storyboard
how does it look nice color I like that
I like it a lot when students use a lot
of different color instead of having
just white screen it's always good so
this is good there we go a picker view
is there and there is there we have a
single label this will be chosen so I
think there are a lot of Mountain View
these are just default ones let's look
at the app delegate now view controller
and there we go shooting checklist
camera modes exposure ISO shutter speed
oh my goodness you are a photographer
that's very nice aperture white balance
a lot of lot of terminologies are there
Lux good sounds good then we have got
picker view so nice the data source is
being injected as a protocol and
delegate is also included nice picker
view we have an outlet we have a text
that's nice now we have moved on we got
data source being referenced as a
datasource and delegate
that's lovely we got number of
components yeah
that's fine we just need one scroll we
can have multiples as well like the two
rows you might have seen that in and the
applications like where you can select
months and dates and years just like
that so in that case you need three
components in this case we just need one
okay that's good now how many rows you
want you have just mentioned contents
dot count and I guess contents is this
array that's lovely nice nicely defined
everything I'm really happy with this
code so far then we have got a method
and that method actually selects a row
with the help of row we are getting
contents array and it just prints it out
and we are just returning it and we are
setting the text label as my contents as
well okay I just run the project and see
what's going on wrong and where is my
simulator
okay there is my simulator it has
started to run come on load up okay
there we go shooting checklist okay this
is good camera mode
okay this shows aperture and this shows
exposure and it gives me a white balance
so we got a problem we are not getting
what we are selecting in the picker view
that is a big issue that is a big issue
so let me just figure it out how we can
solve that I'm gonna do live in front of
you so let's just define the problem
first of all in a nice word because in
able to solve your problem you should
phrase your problem in a nice word and
that is very important while searching
the problem on the Google so it says
picker view displaying different data
you have done a pretty good job because
you are saying picker viewed displaying
a different data that is exactly what
I'm looking for so what I'm gonna be
doing and there's going to be copy
pasting adding some key words small like
swift and iOS 10 in front of it so that
I'm getting better result and there we
go
we can get a lot of results out there
but the result that I would be looking
for is gonna be from the Stack Overflow
this is the holy grail for every
programmer so how do I get data and
let's just have a look and picker view
actually I would like to phrase it a
little bit more like not in general I
would like to figure it out and of more
practical and programmatic a key words
like picker view is selecting a wrong
row it's not displaying the different
data I would like to say picker view is
selecting a different row so picker we
are in fact I would like to say UI
picker view would be nice but I can just
select it later on picker view is
selecting a different row okay and I'll
add a keyword like Swift and I think
Swift is good okay let's just say you I
pick her view okay and it's say showing
you a picker view with selected row
let's just have a look how does it goes
and there we go it just gives you a lot
of information we can just look out for
anything else okay a lot of information
is there how to set a default value now
I'm not looking for a default value okay
this let's just
look at the first showing you a picker
view with selected row okay so okay okay
it's it's going good and I don't think
so it's it's really helping for us right
now so you have picker view selecting
different row okay what we can add extra
UI picker view is selecting different
row then selection or just like that
okay let's just have a look so okay I'm
not looking for the objective-c I'm
looking for the swift code although I
could have just solved it in a second I
know what the problem is but I'm trying
to show or figure it out the things that
I'm really looking for let's just drive
with another keywords so I would say UI
picker view let's just see how we can
figure it out here picker B is selecting
the wrong row let's just try to write
that wrong row okay and let's just look
at this okay so here we can see almost
same code all any not on a single given
instance you will find exactly the same
code but you have to figure it out how
you can compare your code out there okay
so let's just see the number of rows in
picker view is selected okay that's good
and it's exactly almost the same
situation that we are having okay nice
so how it solved the problem
I think you need to remove active quiz
place dot equals row okay from air code
and you have to add one more method that
is did selected row and pick your view
okay so there is a method did select row
that can help us to solve this problem
let's just try to have a look on that
okay so I'll just add this method out
there and let's just say did select row
and let's just change your label with
that row okay so use you called it label
okay that's good label dot text and I'm
gonna be just shifting it for a row I
know obviously it is going to just give
us a number zero one two based on the
array but I just want to test out the
things so let's just go ahead run
okay and what actually did select row is
doing your picker view is just selecting
the things once it's good but once you
want to update the things you have to
use the function did select row and it
just runs every single time you touch
the picker view so this method runs
every single time so that's why it's
gonna solve the problem okay so as I go
with the camera mode it gives us one
that is good because ours array starts
from zero so this looks like this is
solving our problem and we can see this
is this is working good although we are
getting the row like a Sunnyvale invite
and all these things but it's not making
sense right now let me just fix the code
quickly and I'll be saying something
like this like components component or
component component content okay
contents contents and let's just fix it
with the row I think this is gonna fix
the problem let's just check this out
okay it's running it's running come on
load up quickly okay there we go
shooting checklist exposure shutter
speed this is working nice this is
working nice so let's just analyze what
we learned and how we solve this problem
so first of all always go ahead don't be
shy and including the code or any other
method that is being recommended on the
stack overflow it's a kind community of
programmer they are always helping okay
now let's move on why it created a
problem for us because this till now the
code is really good till the line number
35 then now when you say the title for
row now this method is actually being
meant to just set the title of the road
this is this is not running again and
again if you want to just select the
rows again and again you need a method
that runs every single time you touch
the picker view and one of those method
is did select row because you are
selecting a row at that instance so once
you run that method it is going to run
on again again and that is why changing
the row title here actually makes much
more sense so I hope you got the things
I'm trying to help a lot of people to
get the iOS code as easily as possible
in case
you have any problem do post down in the
question answer section I'm really
prompt in every boot camp and I'm
spending a lot of time in the question
answer I hope you enjoyed that and for
till now I would expect to see a
screenshot of your app every single time
you do that I'm looking all of you till
then bye bye I see you are there in the
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
