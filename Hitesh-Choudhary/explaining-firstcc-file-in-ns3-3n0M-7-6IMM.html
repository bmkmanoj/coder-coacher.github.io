three video guide first of all I would
really like to thank all of you because
I didn't expect it this much of
expectation with the video series it was
really quite a overwhelming response and
thank you so much for that at first I
didn't even expect it that this videos
are going to have so much of hits and
people are going to communicate with me
so much of things okay so let's move on
with the series and I'm trying to put as
much as videos on the NS three as
possible let me first go onto the
full-screen mode and what we are going
to do in this movie is really a simple
stuff now we have installed the s3
configured it run the couple of
applications and done a pretty good
things so far now what we are going to
do we are going to learn how the
topologies works and how they can be
configured install or can create a new
topology or something like that for that
in order to do that first we need to
understand how the first dot CC file
works I receive a lot of questions about
the first dot CC file that I need to
create a topology with hundred nodes can
I change the nodes here in the file from
two 200 and can I do that like that now
all of these questions actually require
you to understand a few files and after
that you are not going to ask me these
kinds of questions which are really
impractical so first of all let me go
into the full screen mode and what I
have done I have written a few comments
here so that we can understand how the
first or CC file now every file when you
create a topology is being set into the
various phases first you have to choose
how many nodes you want to create then
you have to install a few things on the
nodes like you have to choose a channel
set the attributes of these channels and
then you have to say that on those
channel you have to install few devices
set few rules for those devices which
are the internet rules like protocols
and all of that and after that you can
do let's say server's client
communication and whatever you want to
do let's try to understand this first
dot CC and I'm not actually creating
this file I'm just trying to explain you
the original author as being mentioned
here so let me just minimize it for the
time
em being the first few lines here are
just the libraries or the header files
which are being imported and in the
Eclipse there is a shortcut you can
press ctrl shift + o and it will
automatically bring up the header files
as well as it will remove the file it if
they are not necessary
after that we are defining the namespace
here in this line now why we are
defining the namespace because there
might be a dozens of function with the
same name and if you call that this is
my name space industry then you don't
have to define the particular name every
time when you call out for a function or
maybe a class so make sure they did that
you define the namespace now let's come
to the main function now in the main
function these three lines are actually
being used to the logging of the
information now whenever you communicate
with a client server or any other
topologies like CSMA or anything the
logs are really important because logs
is for what we are doing the research
now there are a variety of types of logs
that you can have in this case it's info
but as I press control space you can see
we have got a level of all debug.error
functions - up to what extent you want
to take the log of the things you can
actually select that now in this case
it's just a simple information now once
you have got log enabled you can see we
are using log component enable that
enables our log and this first one is
the set resolution is actually the total
time your application is going to
consume and after that we are creating a
nodes here it is so it says take n
number of computer what I want to say
here is that first you have to define
how many nodes or how many computers you
want to utilize for your experiment in
this case we are connecting simple a
point-to-point communication which
requires obviously only two computers so
I am creating nodes using a class that
is node container class so I am creating
an object from node container class and
the object name is nodes and I am
creating I am using again a function or
simple you can say method of that is
create and I'm passing an argument of
two that
it creates a to notes for me okay so far
so good really easy and let's move on
now what we are doing next to that is we
are assigning what type of channel we
want to have now there are dozens of
channel like Wi-Fi CSMA or maybe
point-to-point Ethernet you can do a lot
of stuff with it
now I am using the point-to-point
particular channel and here it is the
class point-to-point helper which is
going to help me help me to create a
point-to-point communication channel now
you can set a variety of channel and
device attributes once we have the
channel now I am calling the object of
point-to-point and setting attribute of
set device attribute now set device
attribute again how I actually the
important question is how I'm actually
telling all of these which are the
classes and all of that there is a D
oxygen manual which we are going to talk
about in the later in the next movie
actually and that will help you to
understand what are the channels what
are the helper classes what are the
objects in them what are the parameters
you need to pass on how you can find out
and all of such things so no need to
worry about that right now our goal is
just to understand the first dot CC file
okay so we have created a channel for
communication and we are setting some
device attributes that is data rate
which is going to be 5 Mbps in this case
then we are setting some the some of the
properties to channel as well like what
is the delay rate or what has other
things like that
there are others as well let me just
show you if I just type
point to point and I set a dot you can
see there are lots of other things
Aska enable our skies and you can see it
tons of information aren't there there
are lots of installation nodes p2k app
set channel attributes device attributes
set queues and all of that so you can
also make sure that you take a
documentation look for that as well for
your experimentation purpose now once we
have got that channel now we need to
install a few containers onto that top
of the nodes so I am using again
net device container class and I'm
creating an object from it that is
devices now what I'm going to do I am
going to install the point-to-point
channel on to the top of that particular
devices so I am just saying what are my
devices the nodes actually so I'm using
point to point dot install on the top of
the nodes clear so far
okay now we have got devices we have got
our channel we have got our devices
already but we need to ask our devices
to follow some rules and what are the
rules on the internet are simply the
internet rules and for that there is a
class that is internet stack helper and
we are going to create a object stack
and we are going to install all the
internet protocols and all of that onto
the top of those devices once the
Internet protocols are being assigned
now let's now it's time to assign the IP
address so what we are going to do that
we are going to do simply ipv4 address
helper which is again a class we are
going to create an object from it class
that is addresses and we are going to
set the base IP address now again the
base IP address takes two argument one
is IP and another one is your subnet
mask now you can use other address
classes which one you want to specify of
course IP is really a essential thing in
order to communicate but you can use IP
version 6 address helper and any other
helper class for communication as well
okay so ipv4 net interface container is
now assigned to all of the devices which
we have created so far ok so far so good
we have got our devices channels
attributes and all of that up and
running but what we want to do actually
with these two nodes now we have created
two nodes important thing to know here
is that let me just show you here we
have created the two nodes and whenever
here are the two nodes and whenever you
want to access those nodes you can
actually access them using this method
that's nodes dot get one the first node
is actually the zero node and the second
node is actually the one node it simply
works simply on the error
array-based method where your first
element is indexed at zero okay so what
we are going to do then we are going to
tell that what type of server we want to
create because it's simply a
point-to-point protocol so we are going
to echo a client and echo a server and
we have got it
UDP echo server helper which is again a
class and it is going to call an object
we are going to create an object that is
echo server and we are going to assign
it up and the server is going to up and
running on the port number nine and when
I again run that and here we are going
to install the server apps onto the top
of node one which is actually you can
say simply the second node the server is
going to start and stop of course these
are the essential qualities of a server
it starts and it stops really simple
after that we have got a client so just
like UD be a cursor where we are
creating a UDP a client helper and the
client actually gets an interface of
gets an address of one and communicate
with port number nine you can apply
various attributes here what we have
done
echo clients and you can simply say here
are the attributes like set attributes
of maximum packet the packet size the
interval the delay where you want to
send the packets on all of that after
that what we are doing is simply
starting the client and stopping that
line you can see there is a small delay
the server starts at one second
but the client actually starts to send
request at two second and then client
sent the request till ten second and
after the ten seconds the server is
actually also being stopping so far so
good and finally at the bottom line you
can see there is a run simulation so we
are just calling the name class off
simulator that is simply having two
functions that are run and destroy so
far so good
I know that it was a pretty big file to
explain but it was not tough actually it
was just working on to a step-by-step
manner and once you have got the idea
clear onto your mind now when I run
again this let me just simply run this
again
and when I run this now you will be able
to actually understand what's happening
at the back end and what code you have
written how it is working and all of
these files
let me just wait for a second now I can
say the client is sending some requests
of 1 0 to 4 bytes to 10.1.1.1 ein ok so
this is now actually the thing which you
can actually change in all of these so
here is the IP address now this is the
base IP address onto top of the day the
base IP address on forward of that every
IP are going to be a sign and right now
our server is actually working on to the
echo server 9 but you can also change it
to let's say 19 I'm going to save it and
and when I change the things again
now of course previous time it was
running on the port 9 now it is going to
run on the port number 19 and oops
we got a few mistake we forgot to tell
the client that it is not running on the
nine it is on to the 19 so these are the
simple mistakes and once you know what
is actually running at the backend and
how the things work solving these errors
is not at all a problem now you can see
we are getting again the result the
first time it was not but second time it
is when the port number 19 that request
was sent and there is the reply was
being also received so play around with
this file and make sure that you have a
copy of this file don't mess around with
the additional file make a copy in the
scratch folder and run out that it's
really pretty simple and of course leave
down your comments below and I would
really I read all of them and it is
really quite a fun to have an
interaction with all of you guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
