with another video and in this video we
are just continuing this video is a part
two of our famous Q&amp;amp;A series in case you
don't know every single month we do a
Q&amp;amp;A session where we take fun questions
sometimes related to programming but
most of the time though and this is a
fun series we I love the cities so again
if you are just watching this video for
the first time go ahead check out the
part one of this although it's not
related but it's just one just watch
that now let's just come back and start
this sections Q&amp;amp;A again these questions
are super fun that I couldn't resist
myself in answering them so let's get
started question you know my
communication is not good will I be able
to enter into IT company yes you will be
there is like no big deal if you are
lagging up in the communication it's not
a big deal but you should really work
hard on their communication skills
because as soon as you will be entering
into the IT companies you'll you'll just
see that there are plethora of
opportunities waiting for you that
opportunities include going abroad maybe
dealing up with the clients directly
reaching to the top positions in the
company all of this really requires
communication skills because over the
time you will realize that after five
years or ten years in industry it's not
about writing the code at all it's most
over about managing the clients getting
the projects getting big deals and all
such things so yes if you want to
eventually grow in the IT company get
better in your communication skills as
well question those sir starting career
as a back-end developer is good option
yes of course it's good option amazing
option whether you want to start as a
front-end or back-end both are amazing
great for the backend you have variety
and in fact tons of feature you can
start with Jango nodejs php.net plethora
of options are there but what I believe
is certainly that there is abundance and
there is a huge demand of back-end
development but again make sure you pick
up a couple of databases not just one
you should be aware about MySQL is one
of them you cannot skip that if you want
to become a back-end developer
go ahead first of all get started with
MySQL no exception and then also take
some of the modern databases as well
maybe Marya DB or Postgres so try to get
a little bit hands dirty there as well
aha this is an interesting question
question number you get that do you
think blockchain technology will scale
enough to compete with traditional tech
obviously I am an optimistic person I
believe that yes this is going to happen
in the future
now blockchain technology most of the
people just know about blockchain is
just Bitcoin but blockchain is very on
that and I have seen a couple of
applications and implementation for sure
they are tough and when I say tough yes
actually they are tough to be
implemented as of now but probably this
is because we are so familiar with the
traditional tag that we don't go through
with these blockchain technology now I
have seen arum and Ephraim based some of
the applications being designed I have
talked to those programmers they were
amazingly insane skills that I have ever
seen in the programming but yes these
technologies are really awesome I don't
know about the performance and
scalability of these app because those
apps were like just toy apps they were
not being used by hundreds and thousands
of people but still I liked it and I'm
fully optimistic about the future tech
that yes blockchain is gonna be rockin
it's not just about the bitcoins but yes
there are plethora of implement
implementation especially in the web as
well that you can use these kinds of
tech I think this question is going to
give you a lot of answers about how much
you should be loving a programming
language or not why is Google
contradicting its own platform like
Android by focusing more on progressive
web apps and the advent of react native
do you think traditional Android
programming with Java will be obsolete
no I don't think so that the traditional
programming with Java is going anywhere
because Java is still so many places in
the industry that it's not going
anywhere office ly it's gonna take time
but obviously people are more leaning
towards the cut lane and react native
and xamarin and all these things and
especially the progressive web apps are
good things to implement now here comes
the interesting part of the question
which says why is Google contradicting
on its own platform
now when you want to do programming or
want to build app it's never ever about
loving a programming language you might
want to learn in Java you absolutely
love that that's okay that's it
you should not never ever love a
programming language up to certain
extent that you want to do everything in
that language no it's a bad idea
Google being a technology company which
knows like really he knows everything
Google people at Google are really
amazing so they know that if a
technology is there it was not meant to
be loved it was there just to finish up
a task and that said it's done it's gone
if there are better option in other
programming languages or other
frameworks or maybe other tech then
obviously everybody should go there so
my whole summary of this question is
never ever loved any one programming
language just look out what can be done
best in that programming language
example could be if you want to make end
royde app there are plethora of options
react native xamarin maybe with ionics
as well maybe progressive have apps
maybe you want to make an hybrid app the
goal here is what you really want to
create and what programming language or
what platform is going to be serving
your best if you love Java and your
programming language Java is not able to
serve they're just bits that it's not
your girlfriend that you cannot ditch
that go ahead leave that I would not
call this a question a statement because
this is amazing this says problem in
remembering the codes have to look into
the documentation quite frequently any
solution please this question is asked
by Animesh I would say nummies you are
doing an absolutely fantastic job if
you're referencing documentation again
and again this is the pure sign that you
are becoming a professional developer so
first of all congratulations on that now
again if you're looking back and forth
again in the documentation this is
completely okay we all do this and in
fact in the programming industry this is
called as a good habit eventually what
will happen is you will start
remembering a few lines of that and
after that few paragraphs of that and
you won't have to look into the
documentation as you'll be moving in the
projects but the thing is you are onto a
right track and it's completely okay to
look into documentation again and again
congratulation you are
to a path of becoming a professional
programmer a question by Muhammad Shaikh
and he says UI of learn code online
website is really awesome 5 out 5
whenever I visit LC it gives me a
pleasant to me thank you so much
will you please provide a search box in
the website it looks similar to painter
panda study a kind of a yes but it's
totally ok asking for features and
requests and even connecting me is
totally ok because nobody is perfect and
I'm always willing to learn from it and
asking for a search bar it's totally ok
for that probably we can implement that
very soon as of now search bar is
already there at courses dot learn code
online as well as on global dot learn
code online as well but surely a search
bar on to the front home page of the
learned code online website can also be
an awesome thing I'll surely look into
that but thank you so much for the
feedback
mr. surgeon says how do I get internship
in companies like Amazon I have done for
projects in web including one in react
and firebase and I have I have asked
these questions to many but never got
questions satisfying answer first of all
you are absolutely on a right track the
moment you have started your question
saying that yes I have done some
projects this would give a big thumbs up
because yes this is a good starting
point and you have created a few good
projects I would say you are onto a
right track the next step is to work out
on to your some skills known as aptitude
and reasoning as well yes these these
companies get so many of the requests of
these interns and all of that so
obviously they have some hurdles and
having your aptitude and all these
things solid is also a good idea now the
big mistake that a lot of people does is
they do the project and they don't know
how to apply or even where to apply
companies are not going to come to you
if you are just sitting at your home and
just staring at your emails sometimes
they do I have been approached quite a
number of times but that might not be
the case for you so go ahead on to their
official website maybe amazon.com dot in
and all these websites do have a section
where they say is couriers or hirings or
something like that so go ahead look out
there
they what are the available
opportunities that they are offering you
what are the ways by which you can apply
and what are the requirements they are
asking everything is mentioned usually
on their website so in case you haven't
just check that out go ahead first step
is that second thing is LinkedIn it is
an amazing platform for building up
links and getting recommendations as
well so try out to search for the
employees of the Amazon and try to just
chit chat with them people are really
friendly in the programming community so
try to have a chit chat and then simply
just try to recommend you for any
available positions of internship
another exciting example could be NOC
recom how I usually don't recommend such
websites but yes amazingly it's very
very popular among the industry a lot of
people hire from that and also I would
recommend angel list website as well
because it's really popular and a lot of
people just try to use that again I
would say that angel is not for getting
into Amazon angel list is mostly for
hiring getting hired at a startup based
thing kind of that so again your number
one thing is go onto website and look
for the carrier or hiring position there
and check out that also since these
companies do get a lot a lot of requests
so it don't just be disappointed if your
email is not getting replied or
something your job is to keep applying
and keep applying and keep applying okay
this question is like very popular on my
channel but I haven't addressed it
officially well tell us why most
programmer and tech enthusiasts love
grey t-shirt does it have something to
do with the wavelength of that
particular color that attracts people so
you have to hunter this question I would
say that the way you have asked this
question it is fantastic and the way you
people are getting creative I absolutely
love this funny as well as amazingly
creative but yes I'm not ditching the
question here yes I don't know why this
gray is like an awesome color probably
what I can say right now to you is this
is something which is really great I
love this color and in fact my life has
been changed quite a lot after just
sticking to one color
probably you can expect a video very
soon where I'll be discussing why I have
chosen this color the reason behind that
and how it has impacted my life what are
the advantages that I got what are the
disadvantages that I got so probably you
can expect a video very soon at my
channel a lot of people are from school
who watches this programming channel so
this question is addressed to all of you
sir one humble question for you please
answer I spent so much time to serve
Internet to learn tech stuff and do
programming learn new languages as well
as ethical hacking etc what I do realize
now that I am very weak at school study
now board exam is approaching and I
haven't studied enough to get good marks
what should i do please answer if you
read this now if you're asking these
questions I can understand you are in a
very serious situation you are not going
to get good marks in your board exam now
what I can recommend you is stop
watching all these YouTube videos stop
watching all this Facebook stuff and
even stop programming for a while you
are just in a school and you have plenty
of time to code and to design whatever
you want to design but once you have
actually failed in your school exams or
you have got bad grades it's gonna stick
forever to you so my advice to all those
people who are just young and are in
school
there is plenty of time don't just let
this programming stick too much into
your head
you have plenty of time in your future I
don't want you to regret later on that I
have got bad grades and that is why I'm
not able to get into Amazon or Google or
any such big companies this should not
be a hurdle I know this is like a big
thing for any youtuber to say stop
watching my channel but I would say this
yes please stop watching my channel
until and unless your board exams are
over
get good marks get good grades don't
look even at the programming the first
thing priority right now is board exam
life is all about balance and right now
your balance is too much outweighing on
programming so you have to balance it
and please study hard Pranjal wants all
of the BJP guys to switch on this
channel and try to give me threads
okay so Pranjal says
if you ever have a chance to meet
Narendra Modi what will you ask now
before even I make a statement what will
I ask I would like to say that I don't
have a strong belief in any of the
political leader whether he is narendra
modi or Rahul Gandhi or Donald Trump I
believe they all are just same they
underline the statement if you'll just
see their real faces I somehow believe
they all are same so it doesn't really
matter whom asking the question and in
fact if I would get a chance to ask a
question I would say a statement instead
of asking the question I would say mr.
Narendra Modi or respected mr. Narendra
Modi because there are a lot of people
who can just bash me for this so
respected mr. Narendra Modi this is a
question that I would like to ask you
and you don't have to even answer that
and the question is are you aware of the
situation of engineering colleges that
is happening right now in India that's
it you don't even have to answer this
and the final question is I'm gonna be
answering that in a single word and the
question is what will be good to learn
first front-end or back-end front-end if
you have enjoyed this video give it a
thumbs up if you have enjoyed it even
more to hit the subscribe button as well
if you haven't enjoyed this video it's
okay it's cool there are a lot of things
in the world that I don't like and
probably this is one of the video that
you don't like in the world still I
would say let's be friends programming
friends it's okay
and I'll surely catch you up in the next
video
