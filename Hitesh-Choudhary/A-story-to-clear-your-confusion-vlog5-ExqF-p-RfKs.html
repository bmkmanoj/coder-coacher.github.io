hope that day is really great for you
for me it's all about work today a lot
of work showed up today and I have to do
all of things by my own it's just one of
the downsides of being a one-man army
but I'm happy with that so I'll be
working all of the things and most of my
day is going to be on this disc but that
doesn't means the blood or the be log
that we had doing here is going to be
boring it's going to be a game
interesting but first I have to finish
up some work and maybe in the evening
time I'll hit the road again let me tell
you a very interesting story today this
will surely help you to achieve quite a
lot of things in life and choosing the
right ways so let's begin the story
there used to be a man he was a great
artist although he was learning as he
was in very visual days just a couple of
years but he was a great artist having a
great knowledge about color scales
sketchings and all of the things but he
was always keen about learning he wanted
to learn more he wanted to improve mood
so he decided that I'm going to be
painting a ball on the roadside on the
street side and he did that he did a
fairly good job one of his best work
ever and he decided that I know this
work can be improved a little bit so
what he did he decided that I'll be
painting a side black wall and he wrote
and note under the painting that
everything can be improved if you think
that there can be things that can be
improved in this painting please write
the note and your suggestions we are
open for criticism and he went for the
dinner and when the next day he came up
he saw that the entire board was full
and everybody was criticizing the
picture the painting that he made
everybody was saying hey this is not
correct your color situation is not good
this is not good this is not bad this is
right now and everybody was just
claiming none of the single person acts
we appreciated what he did so he thought
that I'm not at all good in painting
maybe I should decide for some different
carrier or something like that he went
to his guru and a state
I'm not making any good things here I'm
very depressed themselves so he said why
are you so you have such a bright and
talented student what makes you think
that you are not making good in these
painting stuff he narrated the entire
story that if this has happened and I
designed and this was one of my best
work and everybody was criticizing and
not at all good in that guru understand
that what actually is happening so he
said okay let's do another thing but
this time we'll do it little bit
different and you will see the
improvement just after that so they went
again the Guru deleted the entire
painting or you can say painted
whiteboards to it and everything and he
asked the designer again or the painter
again that hey to another painting and
don't do your best work just do it so it
is the same and while he was writing
another note that if you need some
criticism or you want some suggestions
please say us or something like that
he said don't write that note just write
the note that I'm saying so he said
write a note that stays here is the
paint here is the brush if you think
that painting can be improved a little
bit please do that and they went they
came back next day nobody actually
touched the brush and he thought that
hey painting is really good this time he
said no painting was actually bad from
the last one but the thought that you
put in the people's mind is little bit
different this time last time you asked
every person that hey what you what you
liked about the painting and what it
isn't liked it and can you can you tell
me something more about it everybody is
good about criticism without
understanding like when the nose banning
happened in India or the D monetization
everybody was giving advice everybody
instantly became the monetization expert
it happens when you show somebody your
app everybody is going to say like hey
this is bad this is bitch
big group but when you ask somebody that
hey can you write the code for it it's
not like that nobody will do that so
people are really great in criticizing
the things people are not in making the
things now this story can be taken on to
a wrong thing pretty easily but don't do
that let me explain it a little bit more
now taking advice is really helpful it's
really important but make sure you don't
take any random people's advice make
sure you take the advice from the
experts itself now if I'll be giving you
advice about your health your conditions
that would be really really not a good
thing I can share my experience for sure
but taking it twice about health issues
from me is not a good idea you can take
advice from me on the code issues
similarly take advice only from the
expert if you are going to take x/y
advice from any random third person on
the street that's not going to work out
that's not how the thing works so make
sure always in all ways you do remember
this a story this stories really helps
me every single time whenever I'm in the
confusion state I want to take some
advice I always go and look out for the
experts I don't take advice from the
random third party for sure I always
take notes of the people if they are
good or not but then I just cross check
and verify them with the experts I think
you should also have
you
