code online dot in and yes of course
you're youtuber friend and today we're
gonna talk about this Dom document
object model now yes I have seen a lot
of people getting confused with this
document object model but it's really a
fairly simple cancer so in this video
we're gonna understand what is of a Dom
and we'll play around a little bit with
JavaScript using the Dom so let's get
started here so the first thing is what
is this document object model and if I
need to understand it what I need to do
honestly nothing
so document is just like a file whenever
you say document you know that it's a
file it can be an excel file it can be
an HTML file it can be any file so
that's basically your document in the
context of Dom when we talk about it we
usually talk about HTML document here
okay it can be a little bit more than
that but right now let's just keep it
simple basics so that's your first part
document so what is the object in this
document object model object is anything
that you put inside this HTML document
so yes your HTML tag is an object your
body tag your title tag your head tag
probably your button tag your form tag
everything is an object and model is how
you lay out all of these structure just
to give you a quick example let me just
try to show you that if I'll delete all
of this let's just write a very simple
HTML structure without the document tag
okay so first of all what we do is we
use an HTML and there we go so this is
our first base tag that we are having
HTML what goes inside this HTML so we're
first model or first layer in the
hierarchy of this document object model
is our HTML okay inside the HTML we
usually have a tag that says head so
we're gonna have a head and the next
thing that we have after the head is
usually body so there we go we have a
body so now the html's direct first kind
of a you can say that for head this HTML
is a direct parent and for body also
this HTML is a direct parent now what we
do is usually we go inside this head tag
and we use something known as title tag
so there we go title and I'm gonna say
something here in the title so there we
go so what we are saying and if I ask
you a simple question is title at direct
parent our or is HTML the direct parent
of this title tag no it's not it's on to
the second level the first level is the
head the second level is of title
similarly in the body how the how your
document is going to be structured is
totally dependent how you are laying out
your structure of your HTML for example
if I just have an h1 tag and I put some
lorem words probably 10 there we go yes
it's this h1 this body is now like this
h1 is a direct child of this body tag
but on the other hand let me just go
ahead and toggle this soft wrap where is
it
okay can I found it probably not
I'll look out and later on right now
this hit enter there okay now what I
need to do is if I just go up here and I
add something like a lot of things are
like direct children of this body for
example h1 tags probably your div tags
your paragraph tags maybe but if I use
something like a form and in this form I
add a button and say like click me
something like this now you can see we
are getting into a little bit more
complex structure of the Dom the first
the first level we have this document
and after that we have HTML and after
the HTML we are having a body tag that
is a direct children of this HTML notice
we have two children of this HTML the
first one is head in the second one is
body and after the body we have a level
when we are having all these structures
being laid out like h1 tag paragraph tag
and form tag and after the form tag
there is a button so this is just your
Dom that's it that's pretty much it I
know a lot of people get confused in
what is the document object model and
stuff no you don't need to worry about
that's it how you're structuring your
web elements that's your document object
model okay now that we have done all
these stuffs let me hit a command Z a
couple of times so that we can have our
structure back and let me just have it
okay so now that our our script is
connected now the next question arises
is how we can have at how we can take
advantage of this document object model
that's a good question and let's learn a
few things in the document object
that are pretty useful for us so let me
just go ahead and do that so what we can
do here is we can start writing some of
the code for it so we're gonna have
console dot log and we're going to be
printing what we are having in this
actually document so if I just write
here document notice it's a kind of a
keyword stored keyword which you cannot
use so this object what does it contain
so let me just save that and we're gonna
go live so that we can see that and
obviously the I need to go into zero one
web basics and there may there is my
file okay now what I can do is I can
right click and click on inspect and
here I can see I have a console and
notice I do have a document in here so
this is the thing that I wanted to print
on the console and if I open this
document you can see we have got an
entire document being printed now notice
we have head tag
we have body tag all these things so
just like we have learned how the
objects work in JavaScript similarly if
we want certain particular element to be
printed this is a whole big gigantic
object it has a lot of properties some
of the properties are being seen in the
console some are not so we are gonna
learn how we can print that for example
I'm only interested in the head part of
it so what I can say is after the
document I can just put a dot and you
can see there there we have got a lot of
properties that we can access for
example I just want to access the head
property in it so I can just save it and
I'm gonna go back automatically eek I
need to reload that and there we go so
notice here I'll just clear the console
and hit the reload again and there we go
notice this time we have got only the
head part because we asked for it so
there we go our head tag okay that is
nice now just like we can access the
head obviously you might have guessed
that we can also access the body part I
can go back here clear my screen and hit
a reload and there we go this time we
have got the body part so yes this
document object model can be really
powerful on the live you can add a few
elements you can remove few elements you
can change the thing
inside these elements probably some text
in the paragraphs the possibilities are
endless so we're gonna go and learn few
of these things which can be a little
bit like helpful for us so we have
already seen that we have got head and
body but there are a few things which
are not so common like for example let
me just show you that I have got a few
of them in here so the first thing that
I would like to talk about is document
URI now I need to go in here and I have
to say document you are and let me just
check that again one more time from my
notes that what I am having here and
it's not it's document dot URL so what I
can say is I can just save this and I
can run this and clean that and run that
again so notice what you are able to see
is we are able to get the complete URL
of this document in this case it's
127.0.0.1 but we do have a basics here
so yeah that also is completely possible
that you can get an actual URL where
this web page is being served from this
document and there are a lot of such
hidden things in the document I highly
recommend to read the mdn documentation
it's very thorough and it's very amazing
let me show you a couple of more of them
like you can have document these are fun
stuff document title you can have that
as well and obviously I can just clean
that up and I can reload that and notice
it just says document because the title
is saying document if I change that here
and I can say something like this is no
not this is like LC or probably maybe I
can just go back here and notice this
time we were able to grab the title of
this page can we change this title yes
of course there are a lot of ways how we
can change that and do stuff that now we
are going to learn keep learning how we
can manipulate and can select them it's
not like just we always have to say
document at head and title all of that
you can do pretty advanced things with
that as well okay so I think that's a
pretty good introduction about how
document object model works
and what are the possibilities of it I
highly highly recommend all of you
because no book or any any video can
cover all of them so I'm gonna say just
use document J s mdn that's a really
good resource if you want to learn about
this document object model and let me
open that up and we can see we do have a
lot of properties like body character
set there's a lot of things that you can
have full screen enabled style sheet
sets timeline some of them are obsolete
so please don't go through with them but
definitely there is a lot that you can
learn and read about it the one that we
talked about is URL and let me just show
you that yes this is the one that we
talked about document URL would
similarly document the title documented
scripts there's a lot that you can find
out in fact document dot wit so what is
the current width of your element that
on which browser it is being rendered
you can find out that as well pretty
pretty heavy resource to go through with
that it's not like compulsory you have
to go through with all of them but at
least have a look it's gonna be much
more fun now in the upcoming videos we
are going to learn how we can
selectively select any particular
element based on their classes or their
IDs or their tags and can manipulate
them so that's it for this video and I'm
going to catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
