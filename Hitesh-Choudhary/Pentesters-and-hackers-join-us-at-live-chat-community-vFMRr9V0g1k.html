off this movie let me talk about who are
the people's I'm addressing here I'm
addressing just two kinds of people one
who are early birds in the information
security and the second guys
who are already a information security
researcher maybe bug bounty hunters and
people like that so first let's talk
about the Group one so you want to get
started in information security no I'm
not selling anything out there I'm just
trying to help you and you have a tons
of questions in mind how do they get
started what end of system I do need and
what certification should I pursue maybe
CAH or maybe offensive certification or
maybe USS CPE and they are tons of
others so you have tons of questions in
mind and nobody is there to answer
because let's say you have a question in
mind at around 2 p.m. or maybe 2 a.m.
and that depends because nobody is out
there to help you out there yes I know
there are lots of forums out there where
you can post questions and people reply
as you maybe within 48 hours or
something like that so we have tried to
solve this problem and by be means me
and a lot of my friends who are
moderating the community so what we have
done we have just tried to build the
community so you will see the lake out
here which is a community a live chat
community where a lots of people's are
joining with an overnight over hundred
people have joined in the community so
what they are going to be doing you can
ask any questions without worrying about
the bullies and the trolls so there is a
moderator community who will be keeping
things out of the community like the
trolls and moderators who always creates
the problems and nonsense out there so
we will be throwing them out of our
personal chat community you can ask all
the questions like what is about getting
into information security what kind of
jobs are out there and who are the
people who are working in information
security what it's like to be them and
what kind of certifications are good
what kind of certifications are bad and
there are tons of questions that you can
ask out there and any given time at
least there are five or ten peoples who
are online out there helping out you and
these are not just admins or anybody out
there there are just common people just
like you and me now let's come on to the
second group the people who are already
big into information security so you got
a big name out there everybody knows you
you are a very big researcher bug bounty
hunters we respect them and we would
like to invite you it's our pleasure to
invite you out there in our community
you can be simply moderated out there
just post me requests on my page about
yourself and I'll make you a moderator
if you are already information security
researcher or bug bounty hunter so I'll
make you a moderator then you can
actually moderate the community kicking
out the police and picking out the
trolls and helping other people out
there now the problem is you don't have
much time I know it's it's
understandable that you don't have much
time
but I'm not asking much out there I'm
just asking maybe half an hour a day
whenever you have time just login into
the community and just answer a couple
of questions or just say hello people

people have already joined in so you are
