Android training so we are onto our
Android emulator which is saying hello
world and this is the emulator you might
have already tried to explore if not
please do you need to explore yourself
into this world because I won't be able
to tell you about everything into the
Android it's very deep so make sure you
learn a habit of exploding the things
for example the buttons here are to
explode to rotate the things and if I
just rotate it sometime it doesn't
really fix itself automatically so you
need to do it a couple of times you have
got an option of camera volume rocker
that turn off off on bottom there and
just like that so right now I'll just
click on this red button that obviously
means to turn off the app and even
though the app is off your simulator is
going to consume a lot of memory because
it's a phone completely pulse legit
phone which is going and by the way if
you just drag it up the drawer there
you'll see the test app there with an
android icon that's the default icon
you'll see and later on we learn how we
can fix up with the customize icon and
even we will be designing a few icons
there so that sounds nice I'll just
click on this guy and I'll keep that
running in the background because I
don't have a shortage of the RAM memory
good ok now let me give you a quick tour
of the Android studio now Endor studio
is awesome there but you might
straightforwardly notice that in the
file which is inside the app in the Java
your main activity file of the Java is
written into a very short font and
perhaps you have guys like me who
doesn't like the small font so go ahead
into the Android studio or the
Preferences in the Android guys it might
be ended studio and preferences and
where you might want to go is simply
into the editor click on the colors and
fonts drag and drop it this little
triangle there and click on the font and
before you can change the font you have
to make a save as so I saved it as a
default copy click on that once and
thereafter you'll be able to change the
side now I have kept my size as 18 it
was 12 as the default which I didn't
liked it and I clicked on apply and okay
in that
why you are able to see them are quite
nicely there although I do prefer the
darker team but I think it's good for
now it looks good on the mobile devices
okay so this is the file where we will
be working quite a lot and Alex though
these Java files later on in fact I'll
brush up some of the Java basics as we
go right now you don't need to worry
about that now
one more file which we'll be seeing is
the main app activity underscore main
dot XML which is here and this is the
file where we'll be dragging and
dropping a lot of things now this area
is actually the resource Explorer where
you can explore files and folders and
stuff like that after that we have rock
pallet from where we can drag and drop
things like for example the textview is
already being drag-and-drop just right
drag and drop a few things here in the
component reels you'll see what your app
actually consists of buttons and texts
and whatnot so this is what we have it
has got two options the design and the
text we don't want to explode the text
as of now we want to explore the design
part as of now I know this screen is a
little bit shorter and the smaller I
need to take advantage of a lot of that
screen okay we are a little bit short on
the screen real estate there okay so
there we go
looks nice and we can see hello world
there now as I see hello world you won't
be seeing this kind of property Explorer
there yours might be looking more over
like this so you need to click on the
view all properties to explore more
properties there now let me give you a
couple of things there so that you can
motivate enjoy the stuff there now apart
from exploding these things I will just
leave that as to you simply to explore
because there is nothing much we will be
most of the time running this app using
this you can also go with a couple of
things like AVD manager says decays and
whatnot so you can click on that explore
a lot of things
download install a lot of stuff for you
to explore right now I will just select
on the hello world and by the way the
properties actually do change based on
what you are selecting like for example
for the progress bar there will be
different properties for the checkboxes
there will be different properties and
you got the point okay so I will select
this hello world there and you can see
it has got
Eydie layout width layout height text
and just like that now right now we are
just interested in the text because we
want to change that from hello world to
something like hello Android and we
won't be going into the IDs but let me
just tell you this is important because
you want to uniquely identify each and
every text because we have to write the
code for that right now we are not
assigning any particular ID because we
don't want two important options our
layout width you can match the pattern
there to explore it fully onto the width
size you can also match it fully onto
the length wise right now we don't want
to go simply on to the length wise we
want to go on to the width wise so text
is good now obviously you want to
explore all properties there because the
more you will explode into the property
areas the more it's going to be fun
Android for you otherwise you will be
just all the time searching for the
properties and these properties do have
another property to just shift
everything onto the top like for example
if you are using a layout margin alert
then it will be shifting the layout
margin on the top and usually they are
categorized onto the alphabetical order
but if you use something more often then
it will be just shifting that onto the
top so for example just explore this
layout margin and you can give layout
margins of let's just say 40 DP DP is a
unit you can also use px for pixels but
density pixel is much more good and you
have noticed already that 40 a DP margin
is being given to all of the sides there
and you can also go for the padding as
well and from all the sides you can give
legislate 30 a DP off there and we can
see now the box is big and I'll just
select that again and there we go we can
also give it some of the color like for
example look out for the background
property click on these three dots and
click on the color and I'll choose this
pinkish color I don't judge me on the
base of the color there I'm just using
random things there so this is how the
things are looking right now and this is
how they go
and we can see it looks okay decent not
not the best design artist there yet but
obviously we can do a lot of things
there now all I want to say is make sure
that you check out a lot of things here
and just explore there is a lot of
things you can spend at least a an hour
there to spend and to check out what
happens when you click on that what
happens when you click on that this just
like that so make sure you explode quite
a lot there now on a final note let's
just run this app again onto the same
device and see how it looks on that cute
pink the baby pink I guess so
let me explode that and there we go so
nice good changes that we have made I
know this is not the best work that we
have done together but definitely in the
future videos we are going to explore
quite a lot right now my advice would be
just to explore things here and make a
mess be a complete mess I also try to
drag and drop a few widgets onto the
screen like for example go ahead and
drag and drop this button area there and
just like that okay now if this is the
button area there we want to put it and
notice it just got shifted here later on
we'll have a full movie on how we can
explore the things right now you can see
it's making complete mess it's not
listening to me
but for sure in the future videos we
will explore how we can put things on to
a proper place how the alignments and
layouts works in the Android but for
sure that's going to be pure awesome
things here so with this I'll just
switch off this movie or I'll just say
bye bye for now
and I'll catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
