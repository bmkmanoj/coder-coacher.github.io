understanding of the fonts and some
understanding of the images it's a good
time I think it's a perfect time to move
into a project now obviously we cannot
do much with the projects right now
because we don't have any idea about the
buttons maybe the forms or anything but
of course we can design a coming soon
page and just like that so we're gonna
use an image for this this particular
project and you can use any project in
fact I highly recommend to use another
project and by the way there is gonna be
an assignment at the end of this project
as well so this is the image that I'm
using it's a Rolex image and by the way
this blue color in here is really really
impressive so we're gonna use this we
are also gonna use the google fonts
which I'll talk in a bit talk in a
moment how we can do that so let's just
go in here and let's open up a new add
some new window for the atom okay
because we want to close this guy okay
and now what we'll be doing is let's
open up a project add project folder yep
that's good and we're gonna go into the
desktop and this is gonna be inside the
bootstrap for projects and there we go
that's open up there now first of all I
want to create a new folder and we are
gonna call this as 0 1 and that is gonna
be watch okay or watch landing page okay
very descriptive 0 1 watch landing page
okay we can go with that now in here
I'll create a new folder or new file
basically and that's gonna be index dot
HTML that is good and since we don't
have anything much in fact I highly
recommend you to create a new folder CSS
and place everything inside the CSS
folder but I'm gonna just do it in here
because there is nothing much in here
and I would like to call this as style
dot CSS we're into a very basic level of
project in here ok that is good now
let's just throw up some boilerplate
code so again from the very first
project we have got a boilerplate code
in the Putra for that we have in here
save that
and we might want to run a simple server
there and there we go I think since we
have added the project folder this guy
that's why it's not working and I don't
want to type it again so I'll just add a
project folder again in here which is
this guy and open that up and I think we
can close this guy okay how we need to
close that ok remove project folder ok
there we go nice and good and easy and
now I can reload nope I cannot still and
stop this server start the server again
and there we go now we are good to go
ok so I need to first delete this guy
and show you few assets as well so let
me open up the bootstrap 4 and project
and landing page so we'll be throwing up
some images in here and let me show you
what are those images these are the
images will be working so one image is
exactly the same that we have seen up
the roll X image and actually I have
added a tint to that and I've named it
as test 1 dot PNG and this is what we
have I have added a mask of blue there
so that it looks very soothing in here
ok so I think you got that so this is
the assets although these assets should
be coming up in their own images folder
and this guy should go into the CSS but
we're on to bare minimum right now and
that would be almost overkill of these
things so let's just go in here ok so
first thing that we'll be doing will be
placing what are the text that we need
and I would like to place all of my text
into container now you might be yelling
at me that hey why this is always a
container container now I would say bear
with me because these container will be
explained to you later on for sure don't
worry now in the h1 tag I would like to
say that something like V are coming
with watches ok
and I think this looks ok and notice
this container is actually giving you
some padding from the left and the right
as well and notice it just makes things
looks
little bit decent okay now the first
thing that I would like to do in here is
fill up my entire page with an image and
the image that we'll be using is gonna
be the blue image okay so let's go in
here and we are gonna go into the style
now to get a background cover image we
have to
it's basically an easy process it's it's
not a big deal but I think some of you
might not be that familiar with the CSS
I'll assume that so I'll let's just
write that now what we want to do is we
want to select the body in the CSS first
of all and then I want to use a
background now what you want to do with
the background a lot of things that if
you want to do first of all we write a
hue RL maybe our images might be coming
up from a link maybe from a website
although it's not a good idea but maybe
so in this case first of all we're gonna
go with the test1 dot P and G now why
test one dot PNG because my image is
placed in the test1 dot PNG just this
folder only where the indexes in case my
files would be placed in the images
folder then I would be writing images
slash test1 dot PNG okay I hope you got
that concept okay now the next thing
that we'll be doing is I don't want my
images to be repeating okay so I'll add
no - repeat now I could have written a
separate background - repeat and say
no-repeat but it's much more easier to
write it in just one line now from top
and bottom I want it to be centered from
left and right I wanted to be Center and
I also want a fixed image there okay now
save that and notice we didn't got
anything and why is that let me just go
ahead and that is because we haven't
actually linked our CSS file in here
okay easy mistake okay let's just write
a link Colin CSS and we'll be
referencing to styled our CSS save that
and there we go now although this is
exactly what we want but it's not
looking much soother what happens if it
just covers entire page in here I know
this will look so much awesome now it's
pretty much easy but we cannot do it in
just one line we have
to use one more property and that is
background sighs so BG helps background
- sighs and it has a lot of options you
can see Auto contain cover and it gives
you some hints there as well cover value
for the background size property and
we're gonna use the cover save that and
notice this is already looking awesome
and the best part is it is responsive
okay so the image always just covers
everything no matter what happens
so looks so good with this black text is
it beautiful
not at all not at all so we're gonna
just go ahead and change a few things in
here so the first thing that I would
like to do is add a class to this now
this is not gonna be a bootstrap class
because I want to create my own class
this is a hero text they're kind of a
common terminology that everybody use
when there's a big text so this is going
to be a hero text there and we'll be
selecting the hero text in here in the
style dot CSS how can we do that dot
hero so there we go we have selected
that first of all the color is bothering
me a lot so I'm gonna be using FFF which
is white and there we go so this is our
one of the plugins that we have
installed in here packages that just
changes its okay so this is why it is
doing much better much better and we are
happy with that
now also I would like to give it a
margin of top to be 20% we're gonna work
as much as possible in the percentage
okay that that looks good not very happy
with that as of now and we're gonna have
a text aligned to Center okay how does
that work yep we are going much much
better there okay now what we can do we
can give it as font size as well to make
it a big guy font size to be let just
say almost 75 pixels that is too big but
hey that is good looking good so far
next thing that we're gonna do is give
him some letter spacing and I'm pretty
sure that's gonna look good
so we're gonna go with letter-spacing
and I want to shrink it a little bit so
I'm gonna be going with - point zero
five M's and there we go and you can see
that it shrinks a little bit and I think
that looks good
obviously you can just skip these two
last properties like line height and
letter spacing in case you are not too
much worried about the designing process
there but again it looks so good to me
okay
so this is all about our hero text but
this text is not looking very awesome
what I want to do is use a google font
there now how you use the Google font
now it's really simple go to fonts
goggle com it will give you a lot of
links in CSS there and the one that I'm
looking for in here I have actually
already selected it which is a revealer
and let me just show you where that is
and this is the revealer let me just
remove all of these things in here clear
wall okay so how you get the google
fonts is you want this guy just click on
this and there we go it is being
selected and first of all you link it in
your HTML so copy that go back in here
HTML make sure you link everything
before your custom CSS okay that's a
good practice otherwise we just want our
CSS to overwrite everything in there at
the top okay
that's step number one now step number
two is wherever you want this one to
apply
you just specify in the CSS maybe you
want to apply it all the body maybe just
a hero text wherever you want it I
wanted just in here okay so I'll go back
in here and see how does that look
we are coming with watches that looks
good now did you notice that this guy is
looking just bare minimum in the same
exact font I want you to be much bigger
then are simply my HTML there or h1 tag
how can I do that now in case you
remember we did or want learn one of the
classes that is display one time to use
that so we're gonna do a quick span
there and span is gonna have I need a
font wrap there and view soft wrap okay
that looks good
and
I can go it in have been a better okay I
need to expand and we are gonna use a
class there and we're gonna call this as
this play one okay and we're gonna place
this watches inside there cut that face
that there we go
okay now the watch is is bigger see we
have applied one thing what we have
learned in here okay so let's go back in
here what else we can do this looks this
looks pretty damn good okay and there
are a couple of things that I want to do
again in here but I think we are just
getting quite long in this video so this
is already looking better but I want one
image there as well at the center of
this watches so we'll look a couple of
ways by which we can Center the image
just below this guy so let's catch up in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
