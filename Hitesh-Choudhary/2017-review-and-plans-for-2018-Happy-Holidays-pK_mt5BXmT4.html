with another video in this video we're
gonna review the 2017 so yes it's almost
done 2017 is almost gone and this video
is in divided into three parts the first
part is going to be things that I am
proud on what I did in 2017 the second
one thinks that I actually do regret
what I did in 2017 and what are the
future plans for 2018 so let's get
started
let's start with a good thing so I did
really amazing this year and I have a
lot more to share in the section of what
are the things that I'm proud on in this
year as compared to the things that I am
regretting in this year so let's start
with the good things the things that I'm
proud on this year the first thing that
I would like to put at the very top what
I did in this year was he YouTube now
it's not about hitting the hundred
thousand subscribers and having a big
deal no that's a different thing yes I
am proud of that but that's a different
thing the thing that I am proud on is
the quality of audience that I have on
my channel now nowadays since Gio is in
our country it's not very hard to build
up an audience anybody who just shows up
YouTube every single day doing anything
can hit hundred thousand that's not a
big deal the big deal about this channel
is the quality of audience that I have
on this show they are really the
creamiest crowd of the tech that could
have possibly have at least in my
thoughts now yes there are variety of
text and obviously our tech genre is of
programming so yes definitely on this
channel people might be confused in
selecting C++ or Python or maybe Java
over JavaScript or whatever that is but
you know what these people are confused
because they need a rock-solid reason to
choose a programming language or to
choose a specific domain and people who
think about with logic is really hard to
find nowadays people just go and blindly
just trust anybody and anything but on
this channel people are logical they
think with the logic they just point out
even my mistakes with the logics and
that's a good thing
argue with me or just say bad things
about me but with the logic that
actually makes a lot of sense and I'm
really proud that this quality audience
that I have on this channel I'm really
feeling proud that I was able to hit the
exact target audience that I was looking
for on this channel everybody is talking
about programming maybe they sometimes
get emotional about Mac or Windows or
Linux or Windows that's okay that's
completely okay and I'm really happy
that we have got very selected audience
who are crazy about program
and can listen to me all day long
talking about programming that's the
kind of audience I always wanted even if
that's audience like hundred thousand
not a million I would be really happy
with that selected cream quality logical
people only four hundred thousand I'll
take that any single day and yes YouTube
is really the most amazing thing that I
did this year of course at the very
start of this year it was really time
consuming I was not able to deliver a
lot of crying clients project on time a
lot of things got suffered with that but
eventually I got really better with the
YouTube and I'm really happy with it now
the things are not taking that much time
but still I do take my time in cutting
the shot precising the get a best story
that I can have and obviously the color
correction and stuff
so yes YouTube is like at the number one
spot that I did the best thing in this
year the second most amazing thing that
I did was making a lot of videos and
some of you might be wondering hey you
already talked about the YouTube know my
dear friend I'm talking about making
videos the thing that you see on the
YouTube is just the tip of the iceberg
the video that I make actually goes a
lot of them on the learned code online
and lot of other websites as well so
what I have posted on YouTube is just
like the tip of the iceberg the actual
video some of them obviously are paid
content but that goes really a lot so I
have created tons of videos this year
some of them were actually being
completely sold to the corporates and to
some special universities that wanted
exclusive and only access to my video so
I have produced videos for them as well
it was really an amazing year where I
produced insane amount of videos that's
really amazing the third thing that I
would like to talk here is learn code
online dot in now learn code online dot
in started as a personal project and it
grood insanely now it's one of the
leading platform in India for the
technology and programming at affordable
rates yet high tech quality content this
is really something that started as a
personal project and how it's growing
quite a lot so I am really proud on this
at first it was just a website which a
lot of people trusted at that early
stage I'm really happy that you trusted
me at that
such early-stage but eventually we grew
up together and now learned code online
is an amazing website as well as an
Android app at first it was literally a
crappy app but then it grew like
professionally we worked really hard on
that and finally we are having an iOS
app so learn code online website Android
app and iOS app that's kind of a
one-stop solution I was able to build up
really an amazing thing and I'm really
proud on this project that we have taken
this project so far it yes did took a
lot of time that I could have given that
time to the clients and could have
learned a lot more what I'm learning
from the learned code online but yes it
was something that I always wanted to do
and I was able to do that now I would
like to thank a lot of startups for this
kind of project because the startup
really helped me in building these this
kind of personal project now one of that
is the payment solution now as you all
know the payment system the payment
gateway system is not the easiest thing
in India but due to the recent startups
I was able to just simplify that
solution now obviously I would like to
see the startups growing up in the
scalable market of providing the
bandwidth and the hosting as well
because right now AWS or Hamazon web
service is the only one and there is no
like mediator which can solve a lot of
issues for you so you have to mess
around directly and obviously things are
not easy with the government as well
what you see how the learn code online
80% 18% goes with the taxation and the
30 percent take is being cut by the
Google and Apple so having an app is the
thing so 18% for government and 30% for
that it doesn't really leave out a much
and then Amazon hosting so yes really
that's that's kind of a different story
another way but really regardless of
what a profit of whether or not property
whether it is going on I'm really happy
that we do have an amazing website learn
code online which was the project I
wanted to do it from a long time and
finally I'm having it I'm really proud
on this the fourth thing that I am
really small not big proud but small
kind of a personal thing I wanted to do
now this was a travel I always wanted to
do a travel to see pyramids and I
finally did it this year my visa was
denied a couple
times in the past probably due to some
countries issues and whatever the other
reason it always gives you crappy
reasons for denying the visa but finally
this year I got that and finally I was
able to travel to see the pyramids that
was like my childhood dream I was
successfully able to do that and I
absolutely enjoyed it and the fifth and
the final thing that I am proud on this
year was the continuity I was
continuously able to just defeat my
willpower and whatever you call that I
was able to be constant this year the
constant aim either wearing this gray
t-shirt throughout the year or being
constant in hitting the gym and swimming
every single day sometimes some weeks I
didn't even miss the Sunday's so I'm
really proud that I was able to take
care of my health
the willpower was pretty strong this
year I would not say that I was
throughout continuous for the entire
year for the gym and the swimming but
yes I did a fair amount of good job and
in fact the biggest tried that I made
was continuously for five months for
five months I was able to hit the gym
and swimming every single day can you
believe that even if I'm not in the in
the state right now if I'm in to some
other place I was able to hit gym for
that hotel maybe to go for a run or
whatever that is I did some activity
every single day so the longest was the
five months then I took like break for a
couple of days and that's it and I've
bent back so pretty good here but I
didn't miss even a single day for the
gray t-shirt throughout this entire year
it was gray gray and that's it and I'm
really proud of that I was able to made
that so that was all the cherry side now
let's go ahead and move on to the side
which I am not really proud on the bad
things or the things that I regret doing
this year and obviously the very first
thing that came to my mind was not able
to write the book I was offered to write
a book twice this year and I took both
of the offers and gave it a shot the
first one I immediately start because I
got a bigger offer and I wanted to work
for that client so I said no I would not
be able to give that much time to this
book the people were really nice to me
the publisher were really absolutely
nice for me
the second time I was offered the book I
tried this time and again I failed
miserably in that writing a book takes a
lot of time because first you have to
like do those things on to a computer
screen and then you have to figure out
how you did that
and then you have to write it in a book
of course when I'm writing the things or
doing the things on computer I can
actually record that and can do that but
once you have done that you have to
again go back and write that in the book
that consumes a lot of time and
obviously world is moving towards the
videos but whatever the excuse I'm
making here but honestly I do regret
that I was not able to write a book here
this year probably I'll try that maybe
sometimes later in life but yes that's
my biggest regret that I was not able to
finish that up let's see what we can do
in the future about writing this book
and all these stuff now although this
entire Years War was way more productive
I have even created games while I was
traveling and was in the plane and all
these things so yes I would call this
really productive here but there are
days when I was doing nothing and I
absolutely regret those days there were
days they were not huge in number but
there were some days which I can
absolutely point out where I was doing
nothing nothing at all they didn't even
turned on my computer I was just lying
in the bed feeling lethargically they're
just probably have replied a couple of
emails that said and when I come to
review my entire year I think sit down
and think about that that what I was
doing in those days I really regret that
I could have been little bit more
productive probably could have made like
three or four more videos in those days
or probably could have finished up the
clients project a little bit more
earlier but yes I absolutely regret
those days I was able to reduce down
those days quite a lot they were just
like 10 or 20 days in the entire year
but still those 10 days could have made
a lot of difference I'm really not proud
of these days why I was so lazy I feel
really so bad why I was lazy on those 10
days what I was doing what I was
thinking lying in the bed is not making
me any younger so I should have
be more productive on those days I
absolutely regret they probably I'll
take care of this in 2018 and will not
allow this to happen again
I would be working a little bit more
harder this year so that's my only
regret for this year yes obviously these
are very less because all the year long
I was busy so that makes a really
productive year this year okay it H that
was a good review that you try to do but
what is the plan for 2018 now yes there
are some plans that I can share with you
some of them I cannot the but the main
goal for 2018 is to produce more content
now in this year the focus was also in
making the content but yes a lot of time
was spent in making the learned code
online website and all these things and
now since everything is ready the goal
the very first focus is producing more
content and in that content I will be
focusing more on mobile apps as well as
machine learning now one of the project
that awesomely I enjoyed was making a
chatbot using machine learning and
integrating Facebook Graph API with that
I work for that client and absolutely
enjoyed it so I would like to focus more
on how people can get started in machine
learning and can implement that in
mobile apps and a lot about the mobile
apps because I know that the world is
leaning towards the machine learning
videos and mobile apps so it really
makes sense that I should be leaning
towards that as well so this year you'll
be seeing a lot of content related to
mobile apps machine learning and stuff
like that so that's gonna be the number
one focus this year too I want to do
something productive for myself as well
this is all what I'll be doing for you
but I really want something for myself
as well so I have decided that I'll be
focusing as a personal learning
enhancement I would be focusing on two
things the number one thing would be a
lot more learning about photo skills and
video skills so that I can improve and
can produce more awesome quality content
that is easy to watch fun to learn and
stuff like that and the second thing is
focusing more on designing I am getting
better in design and stuff but I want to
get to the next level and that obviously
includes
working on it every single day so I
would like to learn every single day on
design aspects user interface user
experience color theories and all these
stuff so I can produce better graphics
and all these stuff so that would be
personally going on for me as well as
photography as well and yes obviously
you'll be seeing much more active hi
page on YouTube in this coming up here
as well as I'll try my best that the
rigorous that I had this year of
spending those ten or twenty days just
like in the bed doesn't happen in 2018
it really doesn't feel good to me that I
was just laying around my bed for those
days I will try my best that somehow I'm
able to just utilize all of my 365 days
that are coming up in 2018 to be more
productive regardless or what the
problem are coming up or whatever that
is I really want to be much more
productive I want to push my lever push
myself to the next level to be more
productive so that's gonna be my number
one job this year yes there will be
travel there is going to be travel this
year as well I do have some destination
planned up and for my destination that I
pick up where I really wanted to go is
not a concrete jungle I don't want to
see those big malls and the high least
labelled layout city plans and all those
things in the modern era I am a guy who
likes to visit more over the cultural
side of a country if that country has it
so I always become the countries which
are more beautiful and are kind of in
nature food and have a great history
there that's the thing that I always
wanted to see say yes there are plants
and there will be surely some kind of
travel going on in those countries I
would be really happy and with that also
one thing that I can do this year that
would be really amazing is taking taking
time to meet more people yes there are
people who can point out to me and say
hey this you have been saying that you
will meet us and always your reply is
very soon but that soon doesn't come up
this year I'll try to meet as many
people as possibly I can I would be
accepting more invites from the
University so that I can meet you guys
directly at your universities as well as
for the event
centered every youtuber who has crossed
like hundred thousand kids and white or
on the TEDx and all these things I will
try this year that I take accept those
invitations I actually go there and meet
people so let's just see how successful
I get in meeting people this year so
obviously this is gonna be really
jam-packed and tough here but let's see
now one thing for you yes you thought
I'm gonna be missing you no not at all I
wanted to take some goals this year a
person without the goal is the worst
thing on the planet everybody should
have some goal and there should be some
point of time where you can analyze
yourself that how productive you were in
that goal and taking the goal is the
first step in the right direction so
what is your number one goal it should
not be that weighing that I'll be
programmer this year no this should not
be the goal the goal should be I will be
a master in PHP this year I will be a
master in mobile development this year I
will be a master of machine learning
this year whatever that your goal is I
want you to write that goal in that
comment section below I'll be checking
out all of these things I would be
really happy if you can make like two or
three atleast goals not more not big but
around three would be really okay also
in the comments section write down what
is the one big thing that you are proud
this year and one thing that you regret
this year so yes three tasks I have
given you in just one video but that's a
good start for a productive year so
please write down that in the comment
section below
now also there is a side announcement as
well that we will be getting back active
on the YouTube from the January so this
is the year time when I take some time
out of my life and just spend in
traveling and visiting friends and just
roaming around all over the globe or
maybe in India or some part like that so
this entire time from 15 December to 1st
of January or maybe 2nd of January or
just like that is all dedicated to
personal stuff I don't do any kind of
programming stuff I don't do any kind of
video making stuff for YouTube and all
these stuff this is all just traveling
and live a happy travel life for a
couple of days so yes we will get
active on YouTube from first or second
