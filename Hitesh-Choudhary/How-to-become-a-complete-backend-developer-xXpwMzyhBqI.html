about the modern web development talked
about the web development for big news
in 2017 you ask this you've got it
hi there this is the facia programming
friend and today's video we're going to
talk about the complete back-end
development in fact rather I would like
to say that this is going to be a guide
for complete model back-end development
in 2017 now obviously this video is
going to stand up in the future as well
because this is kind of a modern
approach and walking you through with
the back-end development now there are
two approaches that we are going to
follow up for the back-end development
the number one approach in which I'll
walk you through and I will just guide
you what are these things and what you
need to learn for the modern back-end
development how it goes how it starts
what are the technologies that you need
to learn at all these things the second
approach is rather far more convenient
in which I'll not only bakit so I'll
show you how exactly everything is being
done including the basics the
programming knowledge the projects and
everything in just one click and already
about everything so let's get started
with all of these things in this video
back into the Fed is really an awesome
thing and in fact I got started as a
back-end development to now it is really
opposed to journey journey that I'm
following up in here because usually
people get started with a front-end
development and after that they move on
into the backend but I actually started
the opposed it way and I got started
with a back-end it's really awesome now
I won't be telling you that hey just
learn the PHP and you will be done with
the backend development because of
course you are not here for that you
want much more detail explanation and of
course its 2017 learning just the PHP
won't do the job now of course I'm not
saying that PHP is completely old-school
but it's really really getting old there
now of course this other means it's not
going to do the job it can do just do
the job really perfectly and finally but
since you're a big nerd still in 2017
that let's guess you a question that
should I be getting started with the
modern technologies or really the
old-school the stable ones now I would
say go ahead get started with the modern
ones now switching from the modern ones
into the PHP is pretty fairly easy and
if you are looking for good a good
programming job in the backend area you
should be getting started with the
modern days technology okay so let's
first get started what is actually the
guide to get started in back-end
development in 2017 now I won't be
telling you learn Ruby I won't be
telling you learn Python I won't be
telling you learn asp.net or PHP I would
say you already know J's that it's okay
if you don't know JavaScript get started
with that and that's it now in the 2017
JavaScript is doing a lot more than it
was originally being designed for and it
is completely used in the printing side
and the backend side as well now when we
talk about the database technologies
there are three essential components are
not saying these are only three
essential components the three essential
components that every back-end system
should follow up now first two go
hand-in-hand and the last one again it's
important now the first one is are the
restrictive pages and the login system
now for any modern back-end development
developer or back and technology I
expect that this should be the bare
minimum basics the restrictions of some
pages which user can only see after
login and of course a login system is
also required now this login system can
be by a simply email and password or can
be followed up with a mixture of
technologies like login with Twitter
login with facebook login with Google
accounts and a lot more there so these
are two very essential that I look up if
you are becoming a back-end developer
these are the two very essential thing
that you must have now the third one
again it's important one is connectivity
with the database obviously you might
want to store a ton of the things in the
database for the persistent storage so
these are the bare minimum bare basics
that every back-end developer should
learn so going with further now
javascript was not actually being
designed in the first case to handle all
these things at server-side but now with
the recent if limitation of the
JavaScript for example react and no GS
no jokes it is completely able to do so
and for me if you ask me honestly there
I say that it doesn't make sense to
learn hundreds of programming language
to just do different kinds of jobs for
example for front-end it's a jquery
javascript for back and his PHP asp.net
Python Ruby it doesn't make sense to me
there should be lots more simplicity for
the programmer so that he can focus more
on designing the concept itself rather
focusing on learning the syntax and
everything and javascript is able to do
all of these things now for a modern
back-end developer I also expect that
these are the bare minimum basics but
apart from that I expect him to deal
with some kind of modern databases as
well now one of these things is MongoDB
now I'm not saying this is the only
guide here but this is rather more
popular and of course you should have
some basics of MySQL but if you don't
have that is also going to work ok as
well because we are talking about the
modern things in here and for a modern
back-end developer MongoDB is one other
thing that you should be looking up for
learning all these things now apart from
that since you might be learning or
getting a job into some high-end company
or high-end startup as well and think
this sort of used a lot of complete
online dedicated back-end services as
well one of the great name in such thing
is firebase now yes there are
competitions with the parts as well
which you can host on Amazon web servers
but let's talk about that in some other
video right now firebase is the most
popular thing in here so every back-end
developer is expected to have little bit
amount of knowledge how to deal us with
the database of the firebase how can how
he can store images and audio on the
firebase as well as to apply for the
login system as well now another
important aspect of modern era of kind
of a startup thing is oz0 as well
now all 0 is a service that simplifies
your login system logins with the Google
accounts firebase or integration with
the firebase or maybe accounts login
with the github Twitter Facebook Google
accounts and whatever you can think of
so these are few essential things that
you might want to learn up with that now
I know this was quite a lot of learning
things but back-end is not like that now
this was the approach number one now if
you remember that I talked about the two
approaches the one in which I just tell
you the things and you just got your own
things now the approach number two is
when I handle all of these things so
what I'm offering you is check out the
description below and I have something
awesome for you now you can get started
with in everything and anything that is
possible in the backend including the
firebase complete login system database
interactivity and everything in the most
modern era with react GS now I'm not
saying that you need to buy this course
I'm just saying check this out and in
case you like that then have some
interaction there at least check out
what are the projects that we are about
to build idiot there are n complete
projects that we will be building in
here now all you need to do is check out
the link ad in case you liked it you can
talk about this now on to a very sidebar
if you are living in India you might be
facing some problems in the payment
gateway there because it just accepts
credit cards but a lot of Indian
students are saying there are different
sources that you can ask me in the
emails as well and just have some
interaction with me on the email and
I'll definitely help you out with that
well now with this I would like to also
say that I'm looking and listening up to
each and every comment in the YouTube
section so make sure if you have some
question you post it down in the comment
section and I'll surely make up a video
on that I hope your programming friend
is helping you a lot in here and I
really expect that you hit the subscribe
button there hit the like button if you
think that this video was helpful
now I'll surely catch you up in the next
video and make sure that you put up some
comment there and ask for other
questions or just say thanks there I'll
catch you up there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
