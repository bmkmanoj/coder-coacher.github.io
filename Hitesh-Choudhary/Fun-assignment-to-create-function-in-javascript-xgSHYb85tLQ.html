welcome back again to the JavaScript
course I hope you're enjoying still have
subscribed my channel if not hey why are
you waiting for it go ahead subscribe
the channel and visit learn code online
now this video is just about the
challenge we're gonna quickly have a
challenge and we will be just writing
that no more learning yes of course
we'll be doing that in the future videos
but as of now we will be just learning
will be just refreshing whatever we have
learned in the past so let's get started
you will be creating a new file and in
the file you'll be creating a simple
function yes just that's a simple
function the role of the function is
simply to take two inputs your current
marks and your total marks as well it
should be able to calculate the
percentage and should be able to assign
you grade and the grades are really
simple usually what we do in the schools
like above 90 is gonna be a above 80
it's gonna be be about 70 it's gonna be
C and about 60 it's gonna be D and
probably if you wish you can have one
more like a as well above 50 and below
50 we're gonna just give an F for fail
simply like that in case you are
wondering where I'm getting these grades
here's a simple tip that I want to give
all of you a lot of people just directly
start writing the code in front of
computer sometimes you can get deviate
from your objective about what you want
to actually create so I always and
always keep myself busy with these to do
notes I always keep them in handy and
always a pen or maybe an apple pen or
something like that so that I can write
down my each and every objective what I
really want to create eventually every
big project is all about breaking down
into smaller projects and then further
smaller problems so that we can write it
so I hope you got it in case you haven't
that's the fun of videos go ahead
previous and watch those steps that I
mentioned and go ahead create that you
can pause the video right now and within
a few seconds I will be start writing
the code in here so I hope everybody
paused in the head just for a second and
now let's go ahead and create a simple
new function test okay so we're gonna be
going into this intermediate and let's
can call this a simple mmm this is going
to be a sine fun
'drj s because it's an assignment fun
there we go we have simple in here so
what will be writing is a simple
function so first of all let's create a
couple of like let's call this as get my
grade or something like that and that is
gonna be equal to function verified and
thesis and that's it now there are other
ways of writing the functions as well no
big deal we can surely do that now this
function is gonna be expecting two
things and this is your current marks
and your total marks there we go okay so
now that we have got two variables which
is gonna be passed up as soon as we will
be calling this function so let's go
ahead and first of all calculate the
percentage so let's my percent is gonna
be equal to so I hope everybody knows
how to calculate the percentage it's
really simple you have to first of all
get your current marks you have to
divide them by total marks and you have
to multiply everything by hundred there
we go so not at all a big deal the first
part was pretty easy and I believe the
second part is much more easier than
this so we're gonna be saying that we
need a grade to be assigned so let's
define a grade variable so let's call it
as my grade and we're gonna be
initializing it with nothing because I
don't want to make any assumption for
anybody that he's gonna get bad grade so
it's gonna be simply an empty and I will
be writing a lot of if-else statements
so that we can assign them a particular
we can change this variable by the way
and we will be finally at the end we'll
be returning the person and the grade so
as simple as it sounds
so we're gonna have an if statement and
if statement is gonna have a condition
if you remember what I say because I do
have written that here so we are gonna
be calculating you can either calculate
it based on marks but it's it makes much
more sense to calculate it based on
percentage I'm gonna be doing that so
probably I told you to do that based on
marks we had anyways it's all fun you
can do that again so we're gonna be
simply saying if the percentage is
greater than or maybe equal to ninety
percent which is just ninety so
gonna be moving inside that will be
changing the grade later grade letter
here so as I was saying my grade and
we're gonna be saying hey you got an A
grade okay so I hope everybody
understood till here and I am expecting
everybody did it so far now we can
simply write else and then we can use if
statements here conditions are going to
be almost same so we can just copy it
save some time copy that paste that here
and it's gonna just change like that
okay I think it's the simplest thing we
can have and then we'll be changing it
my grade actually changes out to be so
there we go we have a sign for the
greater than ninety we have got four
greater than eighty I told you yep it's
B and again we can have we can even copy
this and can paste that as many time as
you wish and this time if it is greater
than like 70 it was a pretty easy
assignment come on I hope everybody was
able to do it so 70 and then probably 60
this is gonna be like D now totally it's
dependent on you that how many grades
you want to assign or the question is
asking you to do so pretty simple and
don't forget to do one last thing which
is the final else Clause usually people
does the same mistake here in the else
clause we are just collecting like
everything which is lower than 60 so we
have to take care for that and nothing
much to do here we can simply assign a
regular grade here probably failed
didn't want to do that but still we got
that okay so this is the part where all
the function is done now the only thing
that is remaining is to return the two
things which is your percentage and
grade and shouldn't be a big deal so we
can simply return that in here so return
and we can either return it like that or
we can use these amazing things and we
can simply say your grade is and then
the fancy stuff of dollar these guys and
you can call this as my come on you can
copy this and paste that here and
percentage is and again use the fancy
stuff and did I call it my percent yep
and there we go so that's it that's
pretty much it and I think that our
function is completely ready I hope this
works want to make and again remember
programming can only be learned by doing
it so go ahead do that and now we have
to call this function so that shouldn't
be really tough so let your resolute is
gonna be equal to what will you call
that get my grade get my grade and it
requires two parameter to be passed on
notice current marks and total marks now
we can pass on the current marks and
although we have said like we haven't
taken any major that although no anybody
can pass on a string here as well we can
take measures to make sure that only
integers can be passed on but we will be
doing that later on probably not right
here but just to mention this point that
yes right now this is not a foolproof
function anybody can pass on nobody's
stopping them actually to passed on
something like ABC and there can be easy
measures to have that and can have like
problem two message or something like
that but as of now I am assuming
everything is good and probably we got
like 92 and that is gonna be coming up
from out of hundred so there we go and
let's just log our your result and
that's pretty much it let's just run
this and I'm hoping that I didn't made
any typos there so we're gonna be saying
simply node and assign fun Oh argyus
and your grade is a and percentage is 92
pretty good obviously and if I change it
to like 200 and save that and run that
again and I got drastically different
percentage because now it's 200 so yeah
and if I change it to something like
probably 150 not like that obviously I'm
gonna get failing that so there we go
61 point 3 3 now obviously if somebody
wants to take the things to the next
level I would highly recommend to create
this function in a such a way that only
and only numbers can be passed on there
are a couple of ways you can either
initialize these or can have a simple FL
check to
check that tie that is being passed on
is it integer or not otherwise you can
return a simple message saying hey you
only need to pass on integers there so
there are a lot of ways nothing to be
worried about right now at this point so
this is your first assignment proper
assignment that we have done in here now
will be further moving on to the further
topics and then again we'll be breaking
down these assignments once in a while
there so that's it for this video and
I'm gonna surely catch you up in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
