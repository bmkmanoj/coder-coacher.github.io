course with es6 built 10 projects the
only course you will need to master
react.js starting from react components
props to the high end level like login
system authentication using firebase
database web api and pretty much
anything you can imagine
my name is Satish and I have been
programming for last 10 years and over
the good part of last 5 years I have
been teaching in two boot camps and
online courses I know how to deliver a
topic in a fun and engaging manner with
hundreds of five-star reviews
I am back with another super solid
course this is one of the most
comprehensive course on react Cheers
after taking this course you will be
able to understand any kind of react GS
code and even you will be able to build
up any kind of bad project that you are
thinking of will start up by clearing of
the basics on react GS and as we further
move on with the project-based approach
we will learn how we can create
components in the react as well as do a
complete login system
authentication system dealing up with
the database as well as dealing up with
the Bev API is like reddit API is or the
github API if you have never heard about
the react rias don't worry we'll start
from the very basics of installing
everything required for the reactors and
then we'll further move on clearing up
the basics on the react GS like what is
component what are props
what are staged and further we'll move
on to create login system using firebase
arts zero handling the APS and anything
that you can imagine that can be
possibly done with the react.js the
ideal student for this course is someone
who knows HTML CSS and little bit of
JavaScript now you might be asking what
is that little bit of JavaScript now if
you are comfortable in writing functions
and loop in JavaScript you are ready to
rock and roll
react solves the big issue on the web
how many language do we need to learn to
create a web application and react gives
an answer just one JavaScript and you
will be handling everything through
JavaScript whether it's the backend or
different in one language for everything
don't forget to read the description
as I have mentioned all the 10 projects
that we'll be doing in the description
below
still confused watch out some of the
free previews and enjoy them I'll
definitely catch you up inside the
curves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
