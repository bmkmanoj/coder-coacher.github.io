subscribers after this video hey did
everyone they share back again with
another video now in this video I want
to talk about something serious now what
if you don't like programming is the
programming only thing in the world I
would like to discuss a very interesting
email that I have received today and
let's talk about this in this video in
this channel we talk about programming
web apps mobile apps and pretty much
everything related to technology think
if you are new here consider subscribing
now this channel rolls around
programming and technology so I receive
tons of emails every day and I pick up a
few of them which are very interesting
and try to answer them publicly here so
in today's email I have got something
interesting you can read that on the
screen I'll read that from my phone so
here is the email hello sir my name is
Submit I'm doing Bachelors of vocational
program in software development from IP
university ok the teaching methodology
of our college is not good now tell me
something new why I'm not surprised
we're also pursuing a BSC from IGN oh
you so the problem is I don't find
programming interesting I like teaching
physics and chemistry to students but
sometimes I like programming because of
its demand in today's world so I should
drop out programming or continue my BSC
so please help me I am very confused
what to do now the advice that I'm going
to give you in this video is going to be
little off from my channel because I'm a
programming biased person I love
programming I write code every single
day I'm very passionate about it and I
can do it whole day even on Sundays I do
it it's kind of a hobby for me but the
advice that I would give you today is
going to be something different now let
me tell you this that programming is not
the only thing in the world yes I know
I'm going to lose a few subscribers
after saying this that hey what this
guy's saying but yes that's the actual
truth the world needs more free people
needs a lot of carpenter it needs a lot
of plumber's it needs certainly it needs
a good teacher good lawyers and good
policeman's and all these things so I
would say programming is not the only
thing in the world but before you just
leave the programming I would say that
everything at the start is not so much
fun I didn't like the programming at all
at the first Vantage it's completely
okay to hate and last time when I
checked in the country we are allowed to
have a rope in Ian's we are allowed to
hate somebody we are allowed to love
somebody perhaps I think that's still
the case but let's leave that apart so
you have completely free to have your
opinion about programming if you don't
like it that's okay but being a biased
programmer
I'm completely oriented towards the
programming I would like to advise you
that hey stick for few more days and
maybe eventually you will like the
programming and stuff it's in the
starting days it's never a fun it's
actually paid in a but but again with
the time you will start loving the
programming but I'm not saying you
should stick with it if you have already
found out the passion about teaching
like you want to teach people about
physics and chemistry hey that's good
because you are already loving it you
like that and that is important in here
if you don't like your job pay just quit
it you will for sure do something in
life that would be much more meaningful
but if you love your job if you love
what you are doing then it's completely
a different game it's like you don't
need to take holidays you can just love
your job every single day
but am I the right person to ask this
thing yes I have tried to answer this
most honestly there but to be honest I
am very very biased about programming
and that is one of the reason I would
say stick with the programming just
since I'm saying just try to hear from a
random guy on the YouTube and stick with
it for a few more couple of days or
maybe a couple of months and if you're
saying that still hey I'm not made for
the programming it's completely ok I get
your point
some people like programming some people
don't like it just like let me tell you
one of the another interesting
experience that I had in the very early
days I was like a back-end programmer I
like to code in the scripting language I
like to design the database but for the
front-end it was like a nightmare for me
the reason being behind that I triggered
a fine I tried to find out what is the
reason behind that and the reason was I
was not at all good in graphics I was
not good in designing the buttons the
graphic images or whatever the images
are and that is why my front end looks
really dull so what I did I took a
couple of boot camps and learned about
the software's like sketch Photoshop
Illustrator and once I mastered that my
designing were good then my interest in
the front end became to a next level and
I picked up the pace from there and
presently I like the front end even more
compared to the back end I still do a
little bit back and stuff and all of
that but still my first of choice is
still at the front edge so what I'm
trying to say in here is stick with it
few more days maybe you will like the
programming it's fantastic thing but if
you think that it's the market demand
you want to do it for money of the fleet
that's one of the reason because
programmers earns quite a lot and there
is a lot of traveling we can do it it's
a fun job but again just doing it for
money is not going to get you stick for
a long time if you're not passionate
about it they just leave it we made good
teachers there who can teach us good
physics who can teach us good chemistry
so my advice would be stick with for a
few more months just for random guy
talking on the youtubes and then
completely move on if you don't like
after that I know this was complete
bizarre advice but I could have given
but at least I was trying to be honest
there okay with this I would say if you
are liking this channel if you are
enjoying this channel make sure you do
hit the subscribe button there we talk
about programming all the time in this
channel and in case you think that this
video can be helpful for somebody make
sure you share it on the social medias
as well and I'll surely catch you up in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
