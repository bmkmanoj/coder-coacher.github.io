the flex box training so we are going to
again continue our flex box training and
in this video we are going to talk about
the justify content property and this is
a little bit confusing property
especially for the new big mess in the
Flex box and especially especially the
point where they try to move from the
web to mobile and mobile to web because
this is a relative guy and a lot of
people don't understand that in a very
starting phase so let me just bring up
my folder there and we're going to copy
and paste that guy here and it's I think
I just pasted to the previously copied
gonna trash that copy and paste that yep
it's the same so let's call it as zero
two there we go and I'm going to open
this guy in my anthem I do have a lots
of other editors being installed but hey
this is good ok looks pretty good no big
deal so far and in fact I would like to
fire my package of atom server it's
going to fire up somewhere usually
always fired that side of the screen ok
let me bring up in the recording area so
there we go nothing big extraordinary
it's just usual stuff ok now let me just
press command shift D to duplicate a lot
of divisions in fact one more and we're
going to call this as one and let's
start here so two this is going to be
three and four and five let's just go
with the five this time okay so what is
this justified content and before even I
moved to the justify content let me also
mention that first of all we are
learning all the properties which are
applied to the outer container here now
these are items so we are going to learn
how we can apply the properties to
individual items as well but that's
going to come up later on for if we are
moving into a very good tool and that is
we have we are having here so the plan
is really simple first of all understand
all the properties which can be applied
directly to this container and then we
are going to focus how we can apply all
of these properties are later on so
let's talk about the justified content
okay so let's go into the Flex es
and there we go and we are going to have
a container container and if container
is selected and what we have to say is
you know that already we are going to
first say display flex and as soon as I
say display flex the default is zero so
the default display property is to just
go as Rho that is okay but I want to do
a couple of things extra here for a
little bit more clarity and that is
going to I'm going to apply border
properties let's just say one pixel
solid and black would be fine in this
case so that we can understand what is
our content area where our individual
element can go on and what we can do
with that okay now let's talk about our
property of the hero of this movie which
is going to be justified content okay
now the default justified content is
select start and you will notice it
doesn't make any difference because
obviously that's the default one and one
more thing interesting here is you can
see that it automatically gives you a
certain height and width for your
element now let me try something else
here if I just write a lot of ones there
and there we go
and save that now notice automatically
this guy is taking a little bit more
space compared to others and that is
actually the default property here but
again we will learn later on how we can
how we can define a specific property so
that it just it takes how much space we
want and these space division and all of
these things the good part of the Flex
box is it understands the ratios quite
good so you can say that hey this is
going to be my 100% ratio and I want to
give 2/3 to this guy and rest for all of
this so yes we can do that really
helpful in the mobile world but I can
understand it's a little bit confusing
right now so let's not get ahead of
ourselves and talk about that so I'm
going to keep it one there okay and
let's go back here so the default
property is flex start okay now we
previously read about the Flex direction
as well so I'm going to comment this out
for a moment and I'm going to show you a
difference here
so I'm going to say flex direction there
we go and as soon as I say I want to
roll reverse what happened what used to
happen is now the row is going to be
aligned in the reverse manner from one
to three but let's just say you don't
want to have that in that case the
lifesaver is just if I content you want
that content should be aligned to the
right side but not in the reverse order
so in that case this flex direction is
of no use so we are going to just delete
that and in that case and this guy is
useful in that case you have to say hey
I don't want my flex to get start from
the start I want to start from end okay
now notice that all content is aligned
to the right side but specifically the
order is super important here it just
says one two three four and five exactly
what a lot of you might be looking up
for okay that is good now
one thing that you can see that these
are all being squished up because this
is using the entire space being
available to it now if I just say that
the height of my container is going to
be legislate hundred viewport 100
viewport height what is going to happen
it's going to stretch all of this so
it's using all of the properties okay so
how this doesn't make any confusion for
you
I'm going to remove this because I think
we are happy with the default properties
what it's doing here okay so we learned
that we have to this two properties so
far justify content for flex start the
default one and the Flex end for the end
guide and this is a super super
confusing point for a lot of people okay
we have seen here that the justify
content always work on the access from
left to right okay that's good but what
happens what is important part is
justify on always and always work for
the main axis always listen to this it's
always work for main access okay now
what will happen then you will say
justify content and flex end it is going
to just push everything on to the end
right side onto a web device but what is
going to happen in the mobile device
especially in the react native the main
axis is not horizontal it's top to
bottom so that is why your flex
and actually brings everything
everybody's here at the bottom so make
sure you understand it's a relative term
when we are going to say justify content
it always works at the main access and
always remember what is your main access
in the web it's your left right in the
mobile it's top to bottom so why to rely
always on the main axis or something
always rely on the things which you
defines always mention your Flex
Direction your display flex and all
these things okay
so it's always a good advice to always
mention that if you want to have flex
direction just like that whatever you
like to mention just keep on mentioning
that so this is what happens in your
mobile device whether you mentioned this
can or not so my advice would be not
rely on the default things always just
mention whatever you want to have so in
this case if you want hey I want flex
direction to be draw always mention that
it's a good safety tip there okay so now
let's move ahead further so we have seen
the flag start flex and and yes you
guess that right there is a center as
well oops
come on and there we go Center which is
pretty beautiful
which just aligns the things at the
center again it doesn't work from top to
bottom from top to bottom we will talk
about later on about the align items and
things right now we are worried about
just one property which is justify
content so see how simple it is to
justify our Center is the things but
there are a few beautiful things as well
now it has two more properties the one
is space around which is really awesome
and we can see now all of these are
taking just equal space and the beauty
about this guy is in just one line what
you're doing is pretty amazing I'll just
add couple of most the command ship D
and I'm not going to change five year
just I wanted new elements so notice I
didn't have to do the math of spacing
and all these things between just
flexbox does it everything for me and
just gives me equal spacing between them
and I'm pretty happy but some of you
don't want this because it leaves a
space at the start and at the end as
well okay
yar which is being listening so your
wish is listened here by the Flex
so what it provides you is apart from
the space around we have space between
as well this is not so impressive at
first birthday sometime it's a need okay
now what it does it just gets you the
space so this much space is here for
this one and the left side of the two is
also having space so it just combines
into things here but it removes the left
side of the first element and the right
side or the last element so there you go
and what I like best part about is I can
just add my divisions without worrying
about how many elements should be there
in one row and all these things it's it
just works smooth and just like that and
I really love this property okay so I
hope like we quickly summarize what do
we have the first and foremost advices
that your justify content always work
with the main axis and for the web main
axis is left/right horizontal and for
the mobile it's from top to bottom and
then we have learned a lot of properties
about the justified content which was
flexed art flex and center space around
and space between and the most important
advice is always mention your flex
direction I know it's already there it's
by default but hey you always be you
should be double sure so make sure you
always define that okay pretty
interesting and pretty easy stuff with
the justified content here okay I'll
catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
