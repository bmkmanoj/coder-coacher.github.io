technical talks so this is not a movie
about technical talks this is the movie
saying just I'm back here on my channel
and I did a lot of setups out here so a
lot of construction to make the
Lightning perfect the sound perfect I
did tried a lot of setups none of them
actually work the sound was actually
very compromising in those videos so i
try to switch back onto my desk so i'm
back onto my desk where I like to work I
Pacey's my keyboards and everything out
there the speeds just like a home to me
so why the technical talks were missing
because i was traveling I like
travelling and I do travel a lot I was
in China mainly in Beijing and Shanghai
they're a great place to visit I visited
the Great Wall of China the forbidden
temples and the Temple of the heaven and
the forbidden palace and all of those
such things maybe I can talk about then
later on in some other cities but just
to make sure to give you a little hint
that I'll be much more frequent the
setup is not perfect the construction
that was going on at my home is almost
complete almost done nobody's going to
tamper around with my setup so this is
going to be a perfect setup to talk
about a lot of technical talks so we'll
be talking about a tons of things if you
want your topic to be covered on the
technical talks on my youtube channel
then for sure you can tweet about me and
you can drop a message or write on my
facebook wall at my page the links will
be for sure in the description but
that's all what I wanted to talk about
in this movie so the whole story is i'm
back and let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
