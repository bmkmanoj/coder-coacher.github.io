let's get started and move forward in a
with JavaScript series and in the
previous video we talked about what is
document object model I showed you some
of the reference for the API that you
can use for a document object model and
we learned that how we can access a few
elements not much just a few of them now
the big questions are still in front of
us which is first and foremost is where
should I include my JavaScript in my
HTML document this is a big question and
some people say that hey always keep
that in the end of the body because page
loads a little bit faster yes I have
seen those arguments and some says hey
load that in the head because it should
be the first thing that should load up
yes and technically both of them are
correct but both of them are wrong as
well so in this video we're gonna answer
this question that where we should keep
our JavaScript in our HTML and that's
gonna come up automatically through this
video and the big questions are how we
can access more elements in this
document object model how we can
manipulate them so this is the one we
will not be learning yet how we can
create those elements which we will be
doing later on right now we don't want
to do that surely it will come but right
now the goal is how we can manipulate
them how we can select them and where
should I keep my JavaScript file so as
of now I have kept my JavaScript file at
the bottom you can see that here pretty
big okay so the goal number one that we
are having is I want to select this
title tag and I want to change this from
LC or dashed line code on line dot this
learn code on line to simply I have
changed that's not very elaborative but
that's what I really want to do okay so
my javascript file is already attached
now how you can manipulate this is
totally dependent on what you are
getting back when you are calling
anything like when you call your title
tag you directly get your title tag but
this is not the case when you select
things with paragraph tag or h1 tag or
maybe something more so let me just get
you through that so first and foremost
what I would like to have is I would
like to just log what a what happens
when I say document dot title what is
the thing that I'm getting back from it
once I understand what is what is the
thing
I'm getting back then only I can move
forward so let's just save that go back
here and notice when I select document
dot title it automatically gives me the
text which is written inside the title
tag this can be different case with our
other selective methods okay so since
I'm getting directly this method I can
use my JavaScript directly here so what
I can say is something like this I can
simply say document dot title and that
is gonna be
I got changed there we go as simple as
it could be okay now as soon as my
javascript file is gonna be loaded its
gonna get changed so i have saved it and
there we go notice it says i got changed
when i hit reload it's gonna
automatically change because everything
is loading so fast on that okay that is
good so now the first problem is being
sold now let's create the second problem
and we are going to solve that so
instead of this h1 tag I'm gonna change
that to simply paragraph tag okay now
this is my first paragraph tag a really
blank tag and I'm gonna have one more
paragraph tag and this is gonna have an
ID this time and this is gonna be ID of
ID 1 probably like that and I'm gonna
say this this is P with ID so that we
can actually figure it out that this is
and we're gonna say this is regular P
tag ok so that we can actually identify
which one we are looking up for and
we're gonna have a duplicate of this and
instead of this class we are gonna say
the instead of the ID we're gonna say
class and we are gonna say class 1 just
like that and this P is with class okay
there we go
and also let's have a couple of
paragraph and we are gonna say this is
lower paragraph okay we have one more
just for fun stuff let's just have one
more and we're gonna say this is another
lower paragraph okay so now we have
pretty much almost all type of tags that
we usually face they are
being divided using IDs or without IDs
or classes or just like that so now we
are gonna learn how we can select them
and there are various ways I'm gonna
show you what I use most often and most
of the developers use but there are
other options as well so let us go on to
here now let's just see how we can
select them so first of all we're gonna
log that because it's much more easier
now the first thing that you will be
seeing quite a lot is document dot get
element now notice here there are a lot
of things here get element by ID get
element by class name get element by
name and of course tag name these are
the most famous ones which are being
used still I don't use any of them much
often because we have better options so
just to prove my point if you want to
select any element by ID if there are
multiple ones it's gonna get select them
so what you can do is you can just pass
on the ID so in this case the ID is let
me just show you that
and of course notice the element ID
needs to be passed on in a string format
that means whatever the ID is you need
to pass on in the codes so my ID that
I'm looking for is ID one so I'm going
to copy that go up here and paste that
ok now let us go back here and clean the
stuff and we're gonna hit a reload and
notice now it's returning me that exact
paragraph tag with the ID as ID one and
of course notice very good difference
here when I was selecting the title it
gave me the inner text of this title not
the title tags exactly but this guy is
returning me the paragraph tag so in
case you are wondering that I can just
say something like this copy that
and I can say something like this is
gonna be equal to something oops
something different this is not at all
possible and I can save that and can
show you that hey this is not because
previously we were getting exact same
thing or text which we wanted to change
but now that's not possible
this is not what we and I'll show you
how we can do that so similarly we have
learned that this is up here similarly
we have get element by ID I'm gonna just
locate that we have other options as
well which is we have seen get element
by ID
we have dot get element come on
get element by class name as well so
similarly just you have used ID you can
use the class name as well and notice
still you have to pass on in the string
and that's it so we have all these
stuffs that we have and we can use them
that is get element by ID get element by
class name but still I mentioned the
point that I don't use any of them
because we do have better options and
once we understand that particular
option we're going to learn how we can
manipulate these things so let me get
rid of that and let me show you a better
way of selecting any particular element
here so what is this way of selecting
the things so what I can do is I can
create a simple constant and I'm gonna
say my element and the way I like to
select the things is something using
this I'm gonna say document dot and my
favorite thing is query selector and you
can see there is query selector and
query selector all this is the one that
I use a lot so let's say first of all I
want to select query now in this query
selector you can see that we can just
directly put it any tag that we want we
can also put directly the classes and
ID's if we wish to so for example let's
just say I'm interested in selecting the
paragraph tag I can just simply say P
and that's it it's gonna select the
paragraph tag the only thing that you
need to worry about this query selected
is let me show you that it's actually
much more easier so we're gonna clean
that up hit a reload and come on
okay we are not getting anything here to
reload and there we go okay why it is
not selecting anything looks like I made
a mistake I forgot to console.log that
okay so we're gonna log that and I'm
gonna say my element save that and let's
just go back hit a reload and there we
go now notice it just selected this is
regular P tag so what we are seeing here
is there are many paragraph tags but
still we are getting one so they are
very eager to select whatever they are
gonna select the first thing it's gonna
just do that
but if you use something different which
is query selector all and you say I want
to select all the paragraph tag then
notice it gives you an array
let me just hit a reload to show you
that notice it gives you an entire array
in which the first element is having a
paragraph and we can see that we have
got second is paragraph ID done the
second one is class 1 then paragraph and
paragraph so what you can do let's just
say you are interested in only the first
one just we have the knowledge of array
I can just say 0 that is the first
element I am interested in and I can go
back and clean that hit reload and
notice this time I have got this
paragraph tag so this is the one thing
that you have to keep in mind query
selectors are amazing so what you can do
let's just say you are interested in
this ID which is ID 1 ok what you can do
in this case if you're interested in ID
just like you select the IDS in classes
in your CSS file you can use exact same
knowledge for example for the IDS we use
pound sign hash sign whatever you call
that we can just go ahead and do that
and if I hit simply a reload there there
we go we are we don't actually need to
say this is 0 in here because it's gonna
just get the one element so save that go
back and clean that hit a reload and
here we go of course we have got entire
list of it and the first object is
usually the one that we are looking at
force so we are gonna say get element by
ID I want to see the first element of it
go back again and hit a reload I know
there are a lot of things that I'm doing
hitting reload and stuff but where you
can also shift the time to be little bit
slower ok so the thing is done that we
are now able to select in case you are
wondering how to select classes that is
also pretty easy you can just select any
class just like you select the classes
in CSS exactly same yes so that is the
reason why I love this particular thing
and of course you can go back and clean
that hit a reload and you will notice
that now we have got a claw
okay so the problem is sold that we are
able to get that but I bump the mic okay
now let me give you the answer of the
question that where you should keep your
JavaScript file that's an interesting
question
in the next video we're gonna learn how
we can manipulate that so so far we have
seen that I'm keeping my JavaScript file
at the bottom and if I run this clean
that and run that my file is working I'm
able to select that particular element
using tag name class name or ID notice
what happens when I cut this out and I
moved it into head tag paste that save
that and I go back here clean the stuff
and hit a reload I'm not getting any
answer I'm getting an undefined can you
give me the reason why is that happening
I know many of you can but let me
explain that now I told you about
document object model now your document
is being laid out exactly in the format
how you're writing your code from top to
bottom now you said that first I want to
lay down my head element and inside that
use my JavaScript file and just use it
and then we are laying out our body this
happens insanely fast that your
JavaScript actually runs that and before
even your body tag is actually able to
fetch that on the web page your script
is already done that's it so that is why
you are getting undefined so the answer
to your question where you should keep
your javascript file is totally
dependent on how you want to use it now
in case you want to select anything
perform any kind of such stuff then
obviously it makes sense for me that I
should load it at the bottom but in case
your web page is dependent that there
are some script that needs to be load
first and based on that loading how your
web page should be structured then
obviously it makes sense to load it
before the page loads that is in your
head tag so there is no definite answer
here that where you should keep your
file at the head or at the bottom it's
totally dependent how you want to
perform again I repeat that if you want
that your web page requires some of the
structure maybe jQuery or some kind of
stuff then it makes sense to implement
them in the head
Tagg but if you're writing some custom
code that will be dependent on what is
existing on the webpage then you should
use that at the bottom
okay so Hana video is getting a little
bit longer in the next video we're gonna
learn how we can select the elements and
can edit them so let's keep the videos
short in the next video we're gonna do
that
so show some love by hitting that
subscribe and the like button and of
course it would be really amazing if you
can share these videos that's it and I'm
gonna catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
