welcome back out here so what we are
doing out here we are learning is
development especially on the iOS 10 so
if three and Xcode eight by the way
there is an update in the Xcode eight
but nothing that we cannot handle just a
minor bug issues and a couple of things
that are missing out there so we're
gonna talk about that but we are into
the section where we are trying to
tackle down the firebase out there now
believe me after completing this
particular app you will never ever face
any problem in the firebase you you will
not need any other courses or any other
tutorials you will be looking into the
documentation and will be solving your
problem by your own or by taking help on
the stack overflow that's promised out
there and we all know I always keep my
promises so what we're gonna do now
first first of all I'm gonna walk you
through with the app and you might be
seeing what this iPad is doing out there
because I'm gonna go and go through a
walkthrough out there and we'll be
designing an app first of all here and
we have already discussed how the app is
designed first of all it's always on a
piece of paper then it's into the sketch
or somewhat like Photoshop or other
softwares like that then we move it on
to the applications like envision try to
test it out how it looks on a real
device and then finally we move on to
the UI storyboard of the Xcode and then
finally write the code so this is always
and always a process for that whether
it's a viral app like Pokemon go or a
jpg app which doesn't even exist so it's
always the same process okay so it's
gonna be really fun let me walk you
through how complex this is a this app
is and believe me if you'll walk through
with me along with me code along with me
in for this app and once again code this
app without me now just by yourself you
will be completely master of the
firebase and Xcode development out there
okay so with this now let's go out there
so we have already designed a complex
system out there it's a complex login
system which requires a unique sign in
system out there and by the way the app
we are designing is for the change spawn
I was just thinking if there would be an
app for James Bond
how would it would be going out there
let's just say James won't approached me
I wish but how would that be going out
there how
could have designed the app or a for the
entire mi6 out there for James Bond so
this is gonna be fun and let's just go
through with that so first of all we
have already did this if you are not
into the course check out the
description so what we did out there we
we have gone ahead into the complex app
first of all here in this section out
there and we just gone through with two
buttons the signup and the login if the
user actually signs up we will make an
entry into the database or the firebase
email and password then the next the
user is a user will be able to choose a
unique username for it and then if he
taps on the next then he goes on to the
success screen okay this is the success
screen that we have here that's good and
let's just say user terminates the app
at this point at this point out there
and goes back then if he tries to sign
up again we will be prompting a user a
message that you are already signed in
so you must log in out there so we have
already done that and then the user
actually logs in then we have two ways
out there because user can be smart out
there users are pretty much smart always
and always smart out there so if there
is no username will be redirecting it to
this segue which is this guy the star
ones and will be saying that hey you
know what you have to choose a username
first and once the username is done then
only will allow it to the success screen
we have also talked a little bit about
the data models out there yes I haven't
talked about the MVC or the data models
out there yet but in this app I'm gonna
talk about talking about that now you
might be thinking why I haven't talked
about it because simply for the app that
we have designed so far it would be
really overkill to talk about the Model
View controller so yes model view
controller is a great way of kind of
arranging your apps it's always required
but if you're designing an app that just
uses a camera and using a model view
controller for that it would be really
overkill so I always say things are
great like stack views and constraints
but if you use it at a wrong time it
would be always in all ways
overkill so if you have just one or two
controllers there's no need for model
view controller out there but if your
app is little bit more complex always go
through with that it's always mandatory
okay then we moved on to the firebase
database like what could be the model
for my users and what could be my model
for the user name so you
sir there we did out there and for the
username weeded out that so that's
pretty much easy okay now I'll move on
to the second screen out there and we'll
first look out how we are going to
tackle this app app for the James Bond
I'm really excited for that okay
so I'm gonna be sick I'm gonna be simply
saying that hey you know what
this is gonna be my login screen and
this is gonna be my complete this
process that we have already done I
won't be repeating that process because
you know it would be a time waste for
you because you have already learned
that thing you can rewatch the movies
anytime and you can just reach onto this
success page anytime that you want okay
so I'll be just calling this as simply a
sign up sign up and in as well because
I'll be just having a simple one button
that will be able to sign up and sign in
the user up trying to reduce the
complexity of the app because it's
already a very complex app okay so this
is gonna be my first James Bond screen
out there I'll be writing James Bond for
that that's good okay now once we have
done that we would like to move on to
the next screen okay so this is gonna be
the screen where James Bond can actually
select the missions are there so let's
just say some higher authorities are
gonna send some missions to the James
Bond so let's just say this is gonna be
my screen out there this is gonna be the
top of that and I'll be having L LM
message that's gonna be leave mi6 out
there so this is gonna be the kind of a
logout out there or sign out out there
so this is gonna be the leave mi6 button
out there and then we have gonna be a
send mission as well because let's just
say James Bond is busy with some heavy
missions he needs some sidekicks and he
can just transfer some missions out
there as well so that's gonna be one he
can design his own mission and go can go
out there okay and this is gonna be a
simple table view so I'm gonna just
pretend that this is a simple table view
out there and this is gonna be have a
simple mission 1 mission 2 and mission 3
okay that's good now let's just say
James Bond has actually tapped on to the
sin
I'll be working for that so if he has
tabbed on the send mission then what he
what he'll be able to do is go out there
now at the top he will have a camera
button how to design a camera button
okay that's gonna look a little bit like
camera I know it's not a good drawing my
handwriting is pathetic but let's just
say you have to bear with me okay so
this is gonna be a camera button and
that we all all are aware of the camera
functionality we have taken that quite
in detail but by the way if you don't
like a camera button you can add some
audio button as well here and we have
already learned how we can add audio and
we can pass on the audio to the firebase
as well but right now let's just stick
to the basics and we are gonna have an
image button out there once he actually
does that we will have a small out there
base this is gonna be a secret or the
confidential photo so let's just say a
secret photo I have to delete that
that's not good
okay so this is gonna be a secret photo
this is gonna be a confidential document
about that and this is gonna be
supported by a description of the
mission out there so this is gonna be
the mission details so M deformation
detail I'm using a lot of shortcut but
believe me I'll remember all of them and
then there will be a button for simply
choose agent okay so there he can choose
the agents out there this is gonna be
really really fun because all the users
who will be signed up in this app will
be shown up so once he click on the
choose agent then we'll move on to the
next phase out there and here we will
have a simple table view let's just say
and here we'll have many agents who are
already signed up into the app so this
is going to be agent 1 and this is gonna
be let's just say agent 2 I know this is
a terrible handwriting but believe in me
I will walk you through with that into a
much much better situation I'm already
aware of that so that's good ok what
else we are gonna be doing let's just
say there is a mission out there and
this is gonna be a list for the James
Bond mission itself and then he selects
on one particular role I just say I'm
gonna be
collecting Rule three so when Z select
on the row three then we'll be moving on
to another screen out there and this is
gonna be the screen that looks like this
what will be there in this screen so
first of all there will be the secret
photo out there the SP which is being
selected by someone or may be sent by
sent to James one let's just say okay
and then we'll have a MD here which is
going to be a mission description so
that's gonna be a text out there then
we'll have a two buttons for the James
Bond that is accept the mission out
there and deny the mission out there a
MDM okay that's nice and that's gonna be
fun
now if the James Bond actually selects
he wants to deny the mission we have to
delete a lot of things out here so
delete photo text and pop back to the
main I'll call this as root view
controller so this is gonna be my route
and we have to actually pop to route
okay that's nice now if in case he
actually choose that he'll he's gonna do
this mission so we'll check on if he
taps on the accept mission then we'll
move back onto another screen and on
this screen you might have watched those
movies out there where anybody can
actually looks from the top of the view
from the satellite to the James Bond so
we are gonna get a location of our James
Bond so location of Bond okay and
whatever the location of the device is
will be actually zooming on to that
device and we'll be able to locate that
so a lot of things that we have to do I
know this is quite a complicated app if
we look through on to a complete
scenario but yes this is kind of a thing
which is common out there when the
designers are out there they design that
onto the glass out there and if you'll
work on to the companies out there this
is common scenario where everybody just
kind of a kind of a things which where
we discuss a lot of things and just get
onto that so I hope everything is clear
to you and we are going to be doing that
from the next move
and by the way if I want to show you one
more thing out there and that is I have
actually designed just one graphic for
that I was trying to design the things
out there and if you are already into
the course you know how to design these
by the way I'll be giving you this file
as well sketch file and this is gonna be
the secret a spy logo out there the text
field for the email and the password and
get action means he is gonna get some
action out there this is this is the
background which we'll be using for all
of our viewers out there I don't want to
make the complications with the graphics
we have already done quite a lot with
that in the section and by the way this
is this is a pattern out there it was a
simple text but I have actually
converted it into the paths out there
and I have edited a little bit onto the
s out there I didn't like the default s
so I have made it a little bit sharp out
there okay so I think this is a good
point to get started out there I'm
really hoping that you're gonna like
this app this is gonna be so much fun
and by the way if you have if you
haven't yet enrolled in the class it is
a fantastic class out there which this
is getting all five star reviews I'm
really excited for that and go ahead
there is a description there is a link
in the description which will give you a
highest amount of discount out there so
check out our there and in case you
haven't yet subscribed onto a youtube
channel go ahead do the SUBSCRIBE and
doing a lot of videos nowadays so videos
every single week and in fact at least
two videos so like the videos subscribe
the channel
and let's move on to the course and talk
about how we can tackle this app so
let's go there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
