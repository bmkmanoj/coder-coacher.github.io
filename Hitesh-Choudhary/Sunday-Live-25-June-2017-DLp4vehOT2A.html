time and we are doing again as Sunday
live I'm waiting for the people to show
up I am little late like five minutes
got busy with some stuff for the
upcoming course but still I'll be
waiting for the people to show up if you
have already been waiting sorry for the
delay but you can just say hello throw
up your likes make sure you don't get
shortened or the likes because like is
something that gets me going that gets
me that yes you are liking the videos
you are enjoying the content here so
make sure you do hit the like button and
hey everybody a lot of people just
showed up there almost 60 and that was
an instant so let's try to say hello a
few of them okay hey bunch ROG hey
Nikhil hey I use uh hey mister droupati
how are you hi from Southie hi from
India and a lot of people Rohan okay my
name is watch watch hut yogi okay so
that was her typical name for me okay so
let's get started you can ask a few
questions this this life is going to be
little bit shorter compared to the
previous one last time we did almost an
hour of the live content this time we
will be keeping it little bit short
because I have some work to do and
that's super important and what I'm
looking up forward is to roll out the
Android course and I am working on that
exactly same it's almost ready and you
should be able to get your early access
I think within Monday or Tuesday yep the
next day and I think for the public
everybody it will be rolling out maybe
on Wednesday or Thursday so yep that's
the next week everything will be coming
up in the next week so you can ask up
your questions please post video on
Android app development yet that's
exactly what I am talking about
we will be surely posting out
did he use any microsoft technology no I
am NOT a big fan of Microsoft
technologies they might be good like
dotnet and other stuff I am NOT a big
fan of Microsoft technologies I rather
like to work on bit more towards the
open source or if it is a closed source
I would like to go with the Android or
iOS or just like that not a big fan of
Microsoft technology and neither do I
recommend it to go for any people maybe
it might be super awesome in the world
but I don't I don't do that so how did
you like 1 + 5 ah it's a decent phone if
I'll compare to the pricing point it's
amazing because I know a lot of people
are comparing it with iPhone and all of
that when you're comparing it with
iPhone why don't you compare with the
pricings also so I found all the reasons
bizarre it's an awesome phone I would
surely look up to upgrade from my 1 plus
3d because I shoot a lot of videos on 1
plus CT and there are few things that I
need to know about 1 + 5 so I'm looking
forward for some reviews which can
actually actually talk about what is the
front camera quality right now I do have
720p one plus five can give me like one
zero in the front that would be awesome
next I'll be updating okay which
language to learn for full back and web
development hey Roman why don't you
check out my courses at complete
front-end development course at learned
code online dot in and there is also a
react GS course so you can use just
JavaScript for complete back-end and
front-end there is also a course on PHP
so check out that ok which is good book
for Python for reference ah I do
remember one book of fact publication
that I really liked I forgot the name
but I'll try that how do you use
recyclerview maybe maybe I'll post a
video on recycle early they are super
simple discard views and recycler views
they're pretty simple I'll probably post
a video on that which car you are
planning to buy I'm not planning to buy
any car but I do have a nice
okay car right now with me I rarely
drive that rarely but I do have a car I
post that on my facebook I usually so
yes I do have I'm not planning to
upgrade cars or bikes or anything
bootcamps best option after learning
syntax hey I do have a lot of boot camps
why don't you check out learn code
online okay have you ever tried code Jam
didn't got any time to try code jam or
and such things because usually I'm busy
with a client stuff so Congress the page
for getting 25k subscribers heavily hit
this 25k had no idea we did got hit 25k
that's surprised because a few days back
I just did a video on Twitter K that's
amazing thank you so much for reminding
me that is something amazing have you
made the Tic Tac Toe of course it's
there in the course it's completely
there in the Android development course
full tic-tac-toe game with custom
graphics and animation so it's already
there
okay so freelancing guide I'm planning
to have a host a couple of videos and
freelancing as well some basic web sites
on which you can register offer your
skills and may get some of the work so
yes that's in the plan okay with Android
course free no Android course will not
free because I also do have some bills
to pay I have internet bills I have my
livings I have food cost and if I am
working for something so I cannot offer
that for free sorry about that
what happened to the tic-tac-toe further
videos they are there in the course so
there we go make video on importance of
framework yeah that's that's actually an
important subject I should really focus
on making a couple of videos on
framework I love a couple of frameworks
so I can talk about them okay serve I
know Microsoft technologies please
explain ah
Microsoft is so much closed bounded that
it is a very narrow world and of course
one of the major problem with that is
whenever the upgrade is being there its
fully backward-compatible and also they
use a lot of licenses so because I'm on
the Mac I just buy a Mac I don't buy a
special maxi or license and like pages
or Word document or these license I
don't buy that because that comes up
with my Mac if I have to work on Windows
I have to buy Windows than their server
licenses Microsoft product licenses I
don't want to go with that line okay uh
what do you do for physical fitness okay
I do a lot for physical fitness because
I am one person who have faced such a
lot such a lot in my physical fitness I
was fat like 92 kgs almost and after
that I faced a lot of back pain issues
few month went onto the bed then to
operations so I do really take care of
my health now I do gym cycling and
swimming regularly so this is at least
what I do and it works it works
okay so there are a couple of questions
being dropped down on my personal
Facebook as well you hear always same
kind of t-shirt like Mark Zuckerberg no
it's not like he's a big guy I'm nowhere
near him definitely he is a person you
you can admire anytime he is really
hardworking but it's actually much more
easier for me to go with the green
approach I have to shoot a lot of videos
I don't have to worry about what I am
varying how am I looking on the camera
and just like that so one color actually
is life it actually makes life much more
simpler okay please tell one best gaming
laptop under a hundred thousand rupees
okay that's a big budget you can go for
there's the one from the Asus I actually
don't know the name of that laptop I
forgot that but there is one from Asus
Aidan bears are pretty good for gaming
laptops or in that amount of money you
can actually create a desktop so that
would be our
we want Android codes for free please
obviously you want that for free but who
will be paying for my bills here who
would be I have to stop making these
videos if I'll not make enough money I
have to stop making these videos these
camera gadgets
these are floating banned where these
doesn't come for free so obviously okay
okay full stack development no Deus
opinion no Jesus is the fantastic thing
you can learn and I'm a big fan of no
cheers but again there is one thing that
everybody should keep in mind that no
Deus is for big application if you just
want to have a one or two page website
for the contact form working and you are
using no GS at the back out back of this
probably the worst idea that would be
but if the application is gigantic you
feel that it's going to scale up quite
easily then no GS is one of the best
thing that you can apply a node.js Mongo
DB and front-end and maybe in bootstrap
is the finest choice for that okay I
cannot take facebook questions so if you
are posting any phase 4 questions I
wouldn't be checking them out yet this
is a face this is a YouTube light not
the Facebook okay please keep
inspiration due to my Institute is going
closed where I teach PHP I'm feeling
frustrated uh if you know PHP wire is so
frustrated you can always go for the
online jobs there plethora of people
required at the online websites where
you can offer your PHP things so go
ahead make some projects it's easy MC is
is good not I don't if you don't know I
don't ever give my thoughts on whether
you should go for BCA MCA and tag BTech
because that is something your personal
decision I don't interfere in that so I
rarely reply to the people about MCA or
B C or B Tech or CS or IT because it's
completely on to you and there will be
time and there will be situation in your
life
you'll be saying hey I shouldn't have
taken the CSC it's the hit age who told
us to take the CSE and now I am
regretting the decision or if I'll tell
you to go for the ITU we'll be saying
exact same thing for IIT so I don't want
to be that guy okay so MC good or not no
idea okay so we have we are getting is
MacBook Air good for development uh yep
it's awesome
but I would say if you are going for
MacBook Air probably get a little bit
more money and go for MacBook Pro it's
far more powerful machine and that's it
okay thanks a lot for your life and
cooperation I'm trying my best to make
sure you get all of the answers that
you're looking at for all the highs and
hellos that you want to say to me and
it's a live interactive thing it's a
little bit hard for me to get every
Sunday take some time regularly and meet
up the two other people from the life
YouTube but I'm trying my best to get
all of these okay and Swift vapor we'll
be talking very soon about the Swift
four and Swift vapor okay there are some
spammers also going getting involved in
here in the geeky talks okay okay so
let's pick up another question can you
work on a project together probably if
your project is interesting I'm getting
a little bit free time because my
Android course is almost complete and I
have to work on Swift now because Swift
is getting updates so my all of my
clients who whom apps I have been
working on needs an update so I have to
work on serve but I do have ok-ish free
time so surely we can work on a project
if you are interested okay uh I also
remember one thing that I wanted to
share that I was about to post some job
offerings a project based job offering
at freelancer website but I realized
that I would be doing that for all of my
students so I will be approaching a
couple of students through the mail so
that I can offer you some money for the
extra hand that you can
for me it would be a block-based job
pretty easy one and I would be offering
you money and a certificate as well so
yes of course money will be there no
problem so that's one update quick
update I wanted to give you so yes
definitely I will be offering a project
based job and if that goes well probably
in the future I will offer all of my
jobs to my students rather than going
for the freelance and online resources
so I think that would be good ok let's
take up more questions your extension
for Adam IDE um Emmett is one of them
there are a couple of color based
add-ons that I used for Adam JavaScript
and gsx in tech support because I do
code a lot in react so these are a
couple of them ok is there a performance
difference between react native app
versus native app the Java Kirkland are
Swift hey Sam that's a good question no
I didn't found much of the difference
between the react native because end of
the day it produces in native app there
is not much of the difference how old
are you you want to know that ok
what you have done to achieve this level
B Tech or BCA it doesn't really matter
what I have done B Tech or PC because
it's the programming it's the knowledge
that makes me at this position but just
to answer your question I have done my
graduation in engineering in electronics
in communication and my master's in
computer science I do have my doctorate
pending still I don't bother much about
that ok
project for last year graduation please
say the same thing never blame you if
that doesn't work ok uh hi Gannon um I
would suggest if you can make some
project using ns3 that would be really
awesome if you are into the IT I do have
a couple of free resources on my youtube
channel regarding ns3 if you are looking
for performance checking or something
like that or maybe you can create some
awesome tool for pen testing as well if
you are interested in Python or
something there plethora of tools
already in the
maybe you can modify a few of them or
maybe create a GUI I do have a github
project if you want to check that out
I forgot name of that but it's a yeah I
remember it's air ventures it's a
graphical GUI GUI for aircrack set of
tools in case you don't know what that
is nice background yeah I do have a nice
background that's the wallpaper I do
have a nice one here as well in case you
want to see that that's also wallpaper
that's that's also a wallpaper and
that's also wallpaper so yeah I do have
that okay let's go more questions your
snapchat Instagram account I know I'm
not active on snapchat because it's
really hard for me to maintain a lot of
social media but I do have Instagram
account it's with the name of hit h-01
for one I I only post onto the Instagram
when I'm abroad and traveling and
there's some good shots like some
wonders of the world like pyramids or
maybe Great Wall of China Eiffel Tower
Taj Mahal so rarely post on that but yes
make a video on handling REST API using
Swift like handling token authorization
using LM o v Alamo fire by the way is
super awesome and super easy to work
probably Alpo start ok I will join you
sir shortly yes offer me a yes offers
are going to come up but selectively ok
that's bootstrap need jQuery because for
project based react GS is bootstrap
recommended no you don't need a
bootstrap actually for some of the
element jQuery is required not for all
of them so here my portfolio I don't
need portfolio right now sometimes we
have project can you work for us for 4
rather that's what I do
surely that's that's what I do mainly I
work for the clients I work for the
project if it's a web-based project of
course I can deliver it really fast and
if it is app based then of course we can
surely talk about it after front-end
development if you have completed my
front-end developer
course I highly recommend to check out
my react.js course
okay so videos angular site automation
ah not very soon I'll be honest here not
very soon there are other things being
lined up so not very soon let's be
honest let's be transparent what's
what's the problem in that ok ok
your Instagram hey ok there is a lot of
mutant virus spamming here
ok how could we connect whatsapp or
other ways no I'm not available on
whatsapp I don't have time for that you
can always drop me an email at hit H at
the rate they showed recom or can ping
me at YouTube or Facebook that's where I
stay active a lot of people have been
saying I should be active on Twitter I'm
not I don't have any app for the Twitter
even in my phone I just post it to eat
whenever I'm uploading a video that's it
I'm not active on Twitter I don't have
time actually to manage all these social
media accounts it's really tough can you
help me to deploy a project on cloud
surely what's what you are making up
what kind of cloud you are using is that
I like an angular based project you are
using cloud 9 or something
okay now GS or PHP which one to learn
now I would say go for node.js if you
are getting started as a beginner so
congratulation on 25k yeah that's that's
a surprise I got just now with this life
I didn't think that we have cross 25k
subscribers 25k and enthusiastic people
who love to code who love programming
that's the Qi vent that's a big one for
me how react application are deployed on
server how it works what our pricing
hang Mayank
react application I need a different
kind of environment node environment
which are offered by a lot of
cloud-based platforms so it's a
different thing it's not going to be
your regular Apache server on which you
can host it the pricing is for the hero
KU if you are not aware of that Hiroko
is one of them which you would like to
host your react application the pricing
is not so big it's fairly affordable if
the
like off react kind of a thing it's
probably easy how to set up web server
at home why would you like to do that
it's really costly it requires a lot of
machines electricity costly hard-disk so
okay so let's go there best hacking
certification in India would not like to
answer that question
it creates always a lot of problems
because the community I'll talk about
the community of the programming versus
the community in hacking so there's a
lot of difference between the community
of the programmer guys and community of
the hackers guy I have found this this
is my personal experience I'll surely
share that in one other video just to
give you a hint programming community is
far more supportive okay let's go and
take a few more questions okay okay
there's a lot of going on okay check my
channel shortly I'll try that okay and
they are still using turbo C++ in my
college that that is something really
really bad turbo C that were first still
for C plus there's so much good editors
good ID being available it's almost
similar that you're learning Java and
you're writing all of your code in a
text pad or notepad really bizarre I
don't know why people do that okay when
you will launch your Android course that
is an amazing question the Android
course will get launched up probably on
Monday or Tuesday for the LC or
registered students exclusive access and
probably on Thursday it will be rolled
out for everybody to public okay so in
case you are else you a student learn
code online student already do keep an
eye on your email it will be launched
exclusive for here really give any
chance to work under you as an
internship for project ah shortly surely
that is also coming up because we do
need to redo need actually I do need to
require I delete a couple of us
to code few features in learn code
online so definitely I'll be looking for
that I do require a couple of people who
can write blog for me for monthly basis
so that is also going to come up as a
job offer in your email if you are
registered at learned code online so yes
there are plans so shortly I'll try that
okay how to start a software business
I'm not good in that web server site are
the future web PR sites probably no idea
about that okay what are the requirement
for jobs under you uh there are
different kinds of jobs and different
kinds of emails we'll be shooting out
like for example if I do need somebody
to design a web page or web site for me
I would be asking for all the students
who are entered and registered in
front-end development course rather than
asking them who are interested in the
Python one so there will be sorted there
will be different requirements for
different kind of job and surely that
I'll along I'll work on that okay let's
pick up another question how to start a
software business I don't know there is
no shortcut for learning because
absolutely absolutely right back on the
topic there is no shortcut how much cost
for Android affordable my all of my
courses are affordable so yes that's the
one goal I'm taking so that education
should be of highest top-notch quality
and should be affordable for everybody
okay no need to write your questions in
the caps because it it feels like
shouting shouting on me so don't do that
don't do that writing all the questions
in caps is no good idea okay have you
development I don't know what you want
to ask how much difference between Swift
3 and Swift 4 not much not much in fact
3 there is not much difference between 3
and 4 in fact the good thing that we
have seen in the Swift 2 are actually
back in Swift for one other example is
looping through the string array
previously in the circle
used to be good in swiftly they
introduced a new character count and all
these things they have completely
removed it now and now they are back
into the Swift force so it's more over
like a good things of the Swift two are
being taken back into the Swift four and
it's almost like Swift three so yes it's
almost like that our Indian education
teaches outdated technique which won't
work in future hey face con wits a
problem I can understand but there is
something that you also need to do to
get updated it's not like college is
going to do everything for you there are
a lot of websites online resources that
you have to look up so instead of
watching that game of Thrones ease and
you can actually learn something new
it's it's a hand-in-hand situation
sometimes it's a part of college
sometimes it's a fault on student side
sometime it's a fault on the teacher
side so it's a mix going on it's only
you who can get updated so check out
learned code online dot M for getting
updated about ok how to get your basic
HTML CSS in JavaScript website online
post it on a server I'll probably do a
video I'll probably do it ok Ruby on
Rails please tell now we are not going
to get started on our o'er yet we do
have other things ok cost for Android it
will come up it will come up why why
this so many spams going on ok a lot of
questions completed react course and
built my bookstore clone with firebase
how to move into app development react
native or Java and recent enough cold
Java
how to move into app development react
native or Java ah I would say if you are
already aware of the react it should
take just a week for you to get started
and react native but you should only go
into these kinds of app development if
you know AB development process from the
core so get started with a Java first ok
how to make progressive web apps
faced a lot of questions about
progressive web apps tutorials on larval
no that's not coming up very soon yes I
do have course on PHP but larval is
something that again
I won't be just posting larval tutorials
I will be posting like making ten apps
using larval or something and that
requires a lot of time so no okay let's
take a couple of more questions
how do an i how do I know if no js' is
for me you'll never know until and
unless you go with that so always give
it a shot give it a try it's easy okay
let's take a couple of more questions
how to make app that's I'm going to
teach in my Android course are they knee
are there any Nepalese students
enrolling in your course yes they are
many in fact I do have a student from
lot lot of countries probably I'll share
some of the data about the students that
are enrolled from different kinds of
countries different places in India how
much they are playing the video is the
data stats so yes there will be doing
will there any software tested course at
LC oh yes that is under a plan because
I'm trying to use some of the selenium
features for the testing but yes that is
under plan not anytime soon not at least
in this month okay opinion on ionic
framework it's good it's good that's my
opinion what is your dream I have lot
lot of dreams traveling is along one of
them building up this website learn code
online and making it successful is one
of them serving the students and
providing affordable quality education
is one of them
I do have lot of big goals as well that
are going really good so far so yes
there are a lot of I'm a person with
optimistic person with lot of dreams
rather than get failed
nobody's but a lot of them get
successful as well
okay I want to do internship what should
I do for it
learn Tech learn technology as much as
you can
okay so we have been almost 28 minutes
