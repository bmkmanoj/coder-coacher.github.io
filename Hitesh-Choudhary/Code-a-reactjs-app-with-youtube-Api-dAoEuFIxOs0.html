and we are live just wait a few seconds
and bear with me I set up a few things
so let me just quickly handle things
okay so I think now the audio should be
perfect and we are live
I think everybody can receive the feed
that I'm saying in here okay I'll just
close it down okay hey everybody just
say hi if you are there I know this is
not the best thing in here the quality
is not so awesome but we are going we
are doing something there okay just say
hello there and let me know if everybody
is ready to rock and roll with react
Cheers hey everybody hey I met hey hey
there gaming Mohan
Seth von Akash so hey everybody it's
being awesome that some of you are
already waiting I love that okay so some
of you might be experiencing a little
bit of the buffer there let me just go
on to someplace else so that let me know
if the things are good and just bit wait
with me bear with me for a few second I
need to add just a few things and pop
out chat that would be awesome
so chat is now there with us and I think
I need to put it there and yep I think I
can stop my buffering there and there we
go okay hey everybody hey everybody
quite a lot of people are joining in so
currently stares after is there tec-9
sonic Praveen hey everybody and good
evening to you all of you thank you so
much for taking some time and going out
in here to learn react you are true
learner guys so hey everybody and give
it a thumbs up and say can we proceed
right
yes there if we can proceed with
react.js react j/s okay so your core
data in table view video was awesome
thank you so much right now let's just
focus on react I hope I will learn
something new in every single day
don't worry about that with within here
you are definitely going to learn
something meaningful something awesome
okay so increase video quality and
surprisingly I cannot do much about the
video quality is there frame rates are
dropping quite a lot let me just see if
I can fix it okay just give me a second
there if I can live streaming with
that's such a condition there such a
slow internet I don't know it's
something okay and yep I can understand
the live streaming is not so good and
there is no other internet provider who
can give me fast internet there and so
yep there will be a little bit buffering
but everybody is saying yes so I think
we can now move on okay so let me
quickly give you a few introduction
about react Jes and okay I need to block
a few people as well so let me just and
let me remove this guy okay don't worry
okay and let's just write it okay so in
case some of you might be new here with
the react geez
let me just quickly introduce there and
directly from there we are gonna move in
to react GS code session okay so react
GS is a library or framework whatever
you like to call it is being developed
by the Facebook and okay what are the
prerequisite before learning react I
would say HTML CSS and basics of
JavaScript what basics you should be
able to write a function and a loop in
react in jeaious and I think you should
be ready to rock and roll there wouldn't
be much I will be explaining each and
every code that will be writing okay no
big deal there okay let's just go in
here and this is all about the reaction
case you want to know much much more
about it get started is the place where
you might want to go and there we all we
are not going to look much into the docs
in here because I'm quite quite friendly
with the react now and before there the
prerequisite that everybody should have
in case you have subscribed to my
mailing list I have already thrown up a
few emails in case you did subscribe
it's really late I throw it up the email
around 7 p.m. in case you subscribed
after that no problem in the upcoming
live code sessions you will be getting
all of these emails ok so the
requirement number one is you should
have no js' I do have my node.js there
and if I just open up a terminal there
and you need to basically have node and
NPM then the node NPM automatically
comes in so I can just give you a note
version this is the version on which I
am if you are on a backward version no
problem at all there won't be much
difference in here and NPM V to give NPM
version there we go no big deal so far
it's good now I also asked you to
install react so in case some of you are
already here they might be knowing how
to clear how to create a boilerplate
code all you have to do is these
commands NPM install - JEE create react
tab so basically what you are doing is
you are installing the react app there
globally and if you're in the windows
again you can do so and in the windows
make sure you open up the terminal by
administrator in the Mac make sure you
use sudo before this command ok and
after that you can run create react app
and you can simply say hello world so
hello world will be the name of your
project and let's create a very fresh
project so that a lot of you can follow
me up so I am on my desktop and I think
I should create a new folder there and
I'm k dir and let's call it live do a
quick LS let's go into live there okay
that's good I'm just creating a folder
no fancy stuff on this terminal there
okay and let's just simply create react
app and let's call it as YouTube because
we'll be fetching a lot of api's from
the YouTube there
okay and in the meantime it gets
installed there it's gonna take a little
bit of the time not much let me just
keep a popping of the questions in case
you want to ask other things as well you
can throw up the questions I'm ready to
have a talk with you and in case you are
following me up give me a follow there
so right follow in case you are doing
exactly the same in here and of course
the course this entire life will be
available to everybody to watch
afterwards as well no problem at all
okay and yep a lot of people are
watching and that is good thing as
surprisingly there are enough people who
wants to learn and that is good and some
of you might be experiencing buffering
as well and let me know now if the
quality is good okay it's fetching up
some data taking a little bit of the
time in case you want to ask anything
else about the react yes you can just
post all your questions and we are gonna
make an app let me in the mean time show
you what kind of app we are going to
build up okay it's not there let me open
up a new terminal there and no job would
be good okay so it's on my desktop
and let me just run the app don't worry
about the commands and everything we
will be working on the commands and
everything later on right now just I'm
showing you what kind of project that we
are building up okay there we go our
server loads up there
pretty easy no big deal there and don't
worry we'll walk walk you through with
everything in here okay so it's taking a
little bit of the time again Internet is
an issue and that is why I usually
record everything there okay so it's
good now this is the app that we will be
building up and basically there is
nothing much going on with the app it's
pretty easy as soon as you click on this
get YouTube videos it gets the YouTube
videos my last top 10 videos you don't
need to do anything manually it just
fetches out my last ten videos or from
my channel so that's what we'll be
building up in the mean way we will be
learning about the get the api's of the
YouTube and how to fetch in how to do
automatically and by the way we could
have done the same thing simply add the
reload of the page I'll talk about that
as one but that is good in here okay and
I would request all of you to keep the
topic of the discussion as react as we
are talking about the react there so
make sure you just keep the things with
the react okay and no need ask what is
react yes and what we can do with it
reacts yes is is a good tool to design
web apps and even mobile apps as well
you can design fast loading websites
with no load at all when the react
you can further move on to create ios
and android app with the reactor as well
no need to learn anything like Java or
Swift you can just code everything in
the react okay I'm not getting it can
you explain it a little bit more yes
surely I will explain let me know what
at what point you are stuck we haven't
started the project yet we are just
stuck there okay it's taking time and we
had just fetching the trajectories and
in here we haven't started anything in
here okay already passed on ten minutes
okay I would again request all of you to
just please keep discussion
okay so just wait for a few seconds
there it's okay I'm just reading out a
few comments by the way and there we go
and we are ready to rock and roll now so
everything is done we can just move into
the directory there and I can close this
guy we don't need it so let me just
close this we don't need extra terminal
and this is the project that we will be
building up I hope everybody now knows
where we are moving let's go in here so
let's just quickly do this come commands
there so we'll move on to YouTube and do
a quick LS
now it says NPM start now what it has
done with this create react app is it
has created some boilerplate code that
you can directly use and it was also
installed some of the scripts so that
you can run directly NPN start and can
go in there okay so let me just go into
this YouTube and now I'll just run NPM
start okay and there we go and this is
the boilerplate code that it gives up
don't worry it's getting reloaded so
this is the basic starting point of all
of our apps okay and I'll just close
down the server in a sec for a second
I'll run my atom there okay so let's
just go in here and this is the code
where we will be writing over all of our
code okay so I'll just minimize it there
a little bit and moving it aside there I
think this is all we need and let's just
run our terminal there and let's just
run this it's simply NPM start okay and
within a few seconds we'll be ready to
write some code there and there we go I
think it's ready yep looks like let's
just quickly do a reload no it's not
ready yet it will be ready in a second
no big deal there and there we go
now it's good happy and ready to rock
and roll
okay so we are ready to rock and roll
there so this is going on and now in the
meantime let me quickly explain you what
the structure of the react.js looks like
inside the public folder you get an
index dot HTML which most of the time
you don't touch you everything right
everything inside the SRC folder there
and mostly in the app dot GS now again a
lot of people like to just code a few
things in there separate components and
new folders we are not here to talk
about that how the MVC models and
everything should look like how the
component should be placed into a
separate folder but what we are going to
do let me increase are the things in
here and let me just close a few things
so that you can get better reception
there let me just try to work on there
and where is my software there we go
okay so there we go I'm trying to remove
myself from okay let me just remove
myself okay
I think the latency should be better now
you will be able to see the code better
there okay
ok so I think this is good and this
drill the streaming is lagging behind a
little bit ok so let's move on and try
to go in there and I think things should
be good now ok I don't know why this is
happening but we are not getting the
best streaming there ok let me know
everybody that how you are viewing
experiences right now I think you might
be seeing some delays there some
buffering there but I think it's it's ok
ok let's just go in there and let me
know again
is it okay
okay so can we move on and proceed there
okay so it is good somebody has replied
at least okay now let's go ahead and
create our first component now in case
if you are aware with the react there
there we go now we are going to create
our very first component there in case
you don't know what that is react
actually divides everything into
component in the pieces they're breaking
down so let's create our very first
component I'd like to get rid of this
paragraph we don't need it so how do we
create actually a component now
right-click on the source file and click
on the new file we want to create a new
file inside the SRC okay
and I'll call this as YouTube dot J's
now the convention here is to use a
capital letter there okay
this is how we do this stuff hit enter
and there we go so I know some of you
might be facing a little bit of the
issues with the streaming I know I this
is the only fastest internet I could get
in here if anybody can help me to get
more faster Internet in Jaipur I would
be thankful to him okay let me try to
adjust some settings there and I think
this is the best we can do there
I know streaming is really really bad
there a lot of frames are okay you
cannot read the stuff there okay and
okay so this is why it's getting a
little bit bad there let me try to write
a few things in here import react from
and we need one more actually react and
components
and there we go and how is it now can
you read the stuff
okay we are facing a lot of issues in
here with the streaming there okay so we
have created our component there and we
are just trying to go in here the
component is basically just a class that
we are going to have so there we go and
these are the few things that I have
stolen my snippets there you have to
write all of it like there is a class
and after the class there should be a
name that is going to be YouTube which
extends component and then we have a
method there render and which returns
just one element make sure you
understand that okay
so I think can we proceed everybody is
there telling here if you are falling
okay can't read the stuff okay now this
is bad okay looks like
okay let me know how the quality is
going on I can see that the livestream
are is having a big issues there and
it's not able to do any kind of stuff
there now it's visible but not in good
quality okay and I think it's not that
much working good because I'm actually
rendering everything in HD high quality
I always do everything in the high
quality but this is not working anyhow
yep it's really a bad streaming there
it's showing me health issues and really
I think with just 8 Mbps it's really
pathetic speed in here I'm not able to
okay so should I should I quit it in
here and post a video of this react
instead that would be good I think okay
or can we continue in here let me know
if we should continue or should I make a
video and post it there totally on you
if you'll ask me to continue in here
I'll just live is the best idea okay so
I think we should continue in here and
I'll post videos later on
okay so let's complete this app just
notifying but in the comment section
just post live just post something like
go live or go video so what's your
option should I go live or should I post
a video later on
okay it's working fine so a lot of thing
okay let's continue okay so let's go in
here and try to go there okay go life
everybody's inserted in life go live so
okay okay so what we are doing in here
let's go there oh yeah for sure I'll
upload the videos there as well no
problem at all go live okay everybody
everybody I got that let's go live okay
and let's go do it in here so what we
are doing in here let me increase the
font size in case that helps a little
bit so what we're trying to do in here
is create a component there and we have
created a component there and one thing
that you need to understand what the
react is you can only return one
component that's it there is no other
option like if you want to return a
component that says texture division or
maybe something else you cannot do so
you just need to return anything and one
of the trick or I would say one of the
way of handling the things in here is
you just create a big division and
return everything inside it and
basically the thing that you see in here
is not not the HTML it's actually GSX
that you might already be familiar some
of you it looks exactly just with there
so let's just go in here and do some
things okay now what we want to do in
here is we want to some say let's just
say hello there and there we go and we
want to import this into our app dot J's
so how do we do that how we import a
component there okay so we're gonna
simply say import and we're gonna name
it as header now make sure that you do
one thing in here that I forgot almost
forgot
is that you can do you have to do
actually you cannot do you have to
export that as well export default
header so whatever the name of your
class is not the header in this case
YouTube
so whatever your class name is you have
to export that as well so that you can
use it in some other class as well for
example in here I want to use it I'll
say import header from and then I'll say
pickups not the header why I'm writing
header again and again maybe I've worked
with some file just now from header and
you don't need to write GS and
everything it's automatically being good
in here so there we go this is good for
us right now
and how do we import component there so
we import a component simply by doing a
header and make sure it's a self-closing
tag okay without this it's not going to
be good and as soon as I save this it's
not the header why I'm writing header
again again I have no idea so just write
the YouTube whatever you are importing
save that and we are facing an error so
module header okay I have no idea why
I'm writing header and header again okay
and let's just save that and hit a quick
reload module YouTube not found how can
you do that and we are having a YouTube
here having issue there so there we go I
think it's good now and let us see if we
are getting it okay that is good let me
just copy and paste that if I'm making
some mistake there and there we go
and save that and I think my NPM is
running and it's not finding YouTube why
is it not finding YouTube
okay a lot of people are asking
questions we're able to be a good option
I think so if it here will be a good
option because things are going super
machine here it's not downloading any
file it's not doing any live-streaming
they're no good at all and what mistake
we are making in here okay let me just
import it where is a very YouTube
dodgiest file oops I forgot to write one
thing what am i doing that's latch there
okay now it's good it says hello there
so you saw so programming is all about
debugging your things and if you are not
good in debugging then it's not going to
happen you need to learn how to debug so
life coding is all about problems that
we have okay
yeah internet speed really broke the
momentum there Sharada it's really bad
and it's I don't like to just be on a
slow internet I'm not that much capable
yes you can make fully native apps with
react native no problem at all okay so I
think we can move on it's really
unbearable speed there totally
unbearable
okay so let me know it's it's completely
silent in here let me type in in here as
well I think we cannot go like this
let me know what are your thoughts I
think I would probably record this
record this on on a video that would be
better because right now it's not at all
working it's no good idea and people are
asking what language are you programming
okay for some people it's working and
let me know how the things are going on
should we move I think we should move on
and close this lie because it's not at
all working I cannot see a real-time
experience with a react there and I
thought it would be a good thing to just
a watch code and code along with me but
I think it's not working okay so
recording will be better and
thanks for joining in everyone and in
case those who are thinking what why I'm
not speaking anything it's because I'm
chatting in here as well okay I'm
stopping the streaming now and I'll post
videos now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
