we have been working quite a lot in the
just one file and obviously since the
text tags are over we can just move on
so I'll right-click on 0-2 and create a
new file and I'll call this as images
dot HTML there we go and I'll paste in
again my boilerplate code there and I'll
save this and I think we should have
some soft wrap going on okay now I know
for some of you it's a little bit harder
to see but trust me this is far more
easier than what we should be having
okay
because if I'll just use the full screen
browser there and we'll just show you
back and forth flipping it's not that
much fun it's not that much easy either
in that case okay so let's go into the
images and I might want to go into the
live server of images dot HTML okay and
there we go some boilerplate code and
instead of lorem ipsum I'm gonna say we
will be working with images here I think
that's good okay and there we go
looks good now from here we are gonna go
with the images and all of you know that
images are such a hard thing to get
because they use a lot of copyrights and
on the go I'll show you a lot of such
resources like they're so pixabay is one
resource there's a pixels as well we'll
talk about that later on so you can grab
there and I think these eggs will look
good for our example purpose and you can
see free for commercial use no
attribution required basically it just
says do whatever you want to do licensed
and you can get it in different
resolution and I think for our purpose a
smaller one would be okay
I'm gonna download that on my desktop
and I'll name that egg eggs dot jpg and
say that okay that is good now let's
open up our bootstrap for where are you
there we go
in the two I'll just place it in the
same folder okay so that I can just
reference it as egg start
htm' X dot jpg okay and if I go back in
here our X dot jpg is here okay so let's
go into the images and now we might want
to import the image in here
okay so how do we do that now let's
create a division of container there and
look out what the things goes right or
wrong whatever it is
okay so div dot container hit dot there
we go inside here we will be using an
image tag so IMG and there we go it's
asking me for a source and that source
is gonna be eggs I hope I use s there
jpg and save that and what happens okay
no big deal we got an image there and is
it responsive so if I go back in here it
just stays there and if I go shrink it
now it doesn't do anything it just gets
cropped there I don't want that
obviously that's not a good thing so
let's see if we can go with that and on
the altar I'll say eggs goes here
something like that
okay now what you can do yep you guess
that right you can add more classes to
your image tags so let's just use a
class there and what we'll be doing is
class gonna be now one great class that
has been assigned in here is IMG - fluid
and save that now let's just see what
magic it does to us now if I if I get
that it's okay if I shrink that notice
just by adding one class my image is
looking good now in fact we should do
one more thing in here we should grab
one more photo there by nah 1280 by 18
let's just give that a try and this is
gonna be my egg eggs - dot jpg okay and
I'll I can directly save that in the
bootstrap over - there we go
save that okay and let's just grab an
image tag again so this is gonna be IMG
source is gonna be eggs - dot jpg save
that how does that look there we go we
have got a big
big-big image there there we go pretty
big pretty damn solid so does it work in
all the images if I go ahead and just
use a class there is it so simple and
surprisingly it is that simple yep and
save that and notice now this image we
should have something inside and here
going on maybe maybe a breakpoint we can
adjust these things later on with the
CSS but I think right now it's just okay
maybe I can add some h1 there that would
be better h2 lorem 5 and there we go
save that and this looks better now so
just by adding one class it just fix up
everything now it's automatically doing
the things for us notice we haven't
assigned any width any height of the
class it just has things automatically
for me how cool is that okay now let's
just go in here and talk about a little
bit more things in here now obviously
you can give the height such as Auto and
some Vitt to the images some maybe
customize height of 200 by 200
all these things are just all these
things now there is a couple of more
classes that I would like to go in here
now you can use obviously you know that
you can use multiple classes like for
example there's a class known as I am G
- thumbnail and I save that and go back
in here notice a slight border has been
introduced I don't know maybe you can
see that so slight border is being
introduced in here and that is for the
thumbnail since we are not giving it
perfect height or width it just doing
everything on its own but obviously we
can do that we will be giving it for
sure
in the later on videos so this is what
you do now one more thing that you can
do in here is you can add more classes
like for example if I just say it
let's just do it in here we had doing a
lot of things in here or maybe this guy
let's just choose the another image
there and I can say rounded save that
and maybe maybe you might notice that
that we have got some rounded edges
there and if I remove this guy command X
save that
and if I just zoom it there now it has
got sharp edges hardly noticeable but
yep just to say that these things have
their own advantages sometimes so there
we go we have got an option of float
right so no need to write all those
messy CSS to just float your images to
the right you just use a built-in class
float - right and there we go it does it
and also takes care of the
responsiveness of the things in here as
well
okay now you can also use blocks and all
these things classes which will dot
which will thought about later on to
make sure that it's a block level
element now if you want your image to be
just at the damn center you can just use
an class of texture - Center let me just
show you notice it's going on here and
if I just use instead of float right I
can use text - Center save that notice
now it's in Center and it's going to
stay in the center there we go now
obviously we need to deal up a little
bit more CSS to make sure it works but
this was just a basic idea of yes images
are pretty cool to use and you can just
do a lot of things with the inbuilt
classes but one thing I would write I
like to recommend all of you in here
that whenever you use images don't just
rely on only the bootstrap classes
because yes they are there to help you
but images are notorious there they are
hugely hugely naughty and you have to
make sure that you deal up with them by
writing your custom styles that we will
be doing in the project in itself so now
that you have an idea of few texts and
few basic images I think it's a good
idea to have a coffee break so go ahead
get a coffee and I'll catch you up in
the next video
