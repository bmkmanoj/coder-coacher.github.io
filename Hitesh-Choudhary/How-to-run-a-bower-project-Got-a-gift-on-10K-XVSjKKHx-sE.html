youtube channel now I know this is a
very different set of that what we are
used to but sometime I have to move back
to my desk to talk and write code at the
same time and in fact this is the
original set of that fee got started in
here and then later on move on to the
camera and stuff okay so what I have for
you in this you might have already seen
the title we are gonna run a bower
project in here and let me tell you what
the story is recently I completed the
10k subs on the YouTube and it's really
overwhelming in here but again I liked
it quite a lot so one of my friend Ramon
asked me that hey can I work on your web
website I said hey I have no problem you
can work on anything it's completely on
you they said hey I got a free time and
I want to do a quick project so that I
can brush up my skills again he's by the
way a very very brilliant coder and
especially CSS part is remarkable so I'm
back to on the topic he say that I want
to work on your website and this is how
my current website looks like pretty
decent I don't maintain by the way my
website much I just keep it as a point
so that people can reach me out I'm
super active on email YouTube and
Facebook as well I don't maintain
Twitter I don't have much of the time to
just go around with everything okay and
looks like I'm again on to the world's
slowest internet possible there but
again coming back on to Romans github
account he said hey I have worked on to
your website it's almost complete and
you can check it out in here so he has
got a hit h website as a rapper there
and we are going to work on that and it
looks like my internet is dying somehow
maybe there is some uploading going on
and whenever there is an upload it just
sucks on the internet and that is the
reason why you see all of my videos all
of my videos by the way are shot in
extremely high quality and what you see
on the YouTube is just the 40% there so
let me look at how the things are okay
things are going good there let me just
quickly do a quick refresh there okay
looks good now let's go in here and as I
go in here I notice that there is a
power dot Jason I know a lot of you know
don't know what the Bower is and don't
know how to even run the projects of the
Bower so this is gonna be a new thing
that you're gonna learn today every day
learn new thing that's that's all about
it so it's on to the github that's good
thing and you can actually do a clone
there or you can just download the zip
I'm gonna download the zip for the
moment I have no plans to do a repo
there and I'll save this and this gets
downloaded somewhere on my desktop let's
just extract that and open it up where
are you there we go and this is how our
how our bower dot JSON files look like
and obviously this is not gonna run if
I'll just double-click on the index.html
this is how it's gonna look and I'm
pretty sure this is not how the project
is being made up I need to run it a
little bit different so in order to run
these kinds of Bower project what you
need to do is first of all you should
have a node with you notice a very good
module that you should have so install
install a node along with the node the
NPM also comes in okay so let me quickly
go ahead and we can minimize this
actually we don't need it now where is
the project where it could there we go
so it's it's the project let me open up
into the atom so where is my terminal
and I like to go with the terminal as of
now you can open up editor anywhere so
I'll go into the project it's on the
desktop and there we go
I'd like to run an atom I know this is a
small font nobody likes a small font and
we're gonna just open atom in here okay
come on Adam load up okay it's taking a
little bit while I don't know where it
opened up okay it opened up my on my
other screen there we go and there we go
this is how it looks like and obviously
this is our index.html and there we go
looks nice but we have got a bower dot
JSON which says that there are a couple
of node modules as repose there like
power component tests and all these
things so dependency is what we have got
is
strap found awesome and moment okay
that's nice so let's just see how we can
run that so again you have to go
terminal on that I know a lot of you
don't like to go into the terminal but
in this case we have to go there's no
other options much okay so once you have
installed the node whether you're on
Windows or maybe Mac you would be having
a command known as NPM okay and you can
check it out by doing a hyphen V there
it gives you a version if it throws back
any number we are ready to draw
rock and roll there and the first thing
that you need to do is install Bower I
know a lot of you might not be having
power and it's a good time to introduce
Bower okay I think so so let's just go
to the power and this is how it looks
like websites are made up of a lot of
things and that's true it manages a lot
of things for you like jQuery and github
package it does a lot of things and in
case you don't know how to install a
power there we go install - G power so
run this command NPM install a - G - G
simply means I want to install this
module globally so that I can run it in
any folder and simply say power that's
it and it's not gonna do anything
because Bower is already installed on my
system so that is why it's not gonna do
anything but I can do a quick LS that
means list all the directories and as as
I see Bower JSON then I can run a
command that says NPM install and by the
way this NPM install works almost
exactly the same and it says oops not
NPM install by the way I'm sorry for
that it's powered install I've been
working for a lot of NPM projects so
sometimes these things happens and there
we go now it's downloading a lot of
required dependencies for the power by
the way it's Bower install okay and as
we do quick Ellis we can see that a
bower components new directory has
appeared and previously it was not there
you can see there was no Bower I can now
go back to my atom can see that there is
a node module there
and we're looking for bower components
there we go so bootstrap found us on
jQuery movement everything is now loaded
up that is cool that is pretty cool okay
and now I can go and can start a live
server there and there we go so this is
how actually the web project looks like
see it's not easy to run even the
projects nowadays and you are just
worrying about HTML and CSS come on
there's a good time to learn and this is
one of the day when you start and learn
a new thing and one good thing that I
liked about this is my recent videos as
I click on this right now I think it's
not loading up let me just click on the
YouTube and somehow this is not loading
up and this is okay this should be
loading up I don't know why is it not
loading up first of all I need to go
back to my Chrome I don't like Mozilla
that much nowadays and there we go okay
reach me testimonials these are looking
good about me all of them are almost
having the same so the project is not
good one good thing that I'm not able to
figure it out okay now it has loaded it
took some time I think it's a
synchronous request that's why I took a
little bit time but let me show you in
the code part there I saw that on the
github that as I go into this GEOSS a
directory and look out for the main dot
G as you can see that it uses a channel
ID which is I guess my ID and it fetches
out all all of my YouTube videos and as
I upload all of these things it just
renders the video thumbnails so it's a
pretty good thing so as I upload more
videos it's automatically going to fetch
it and you can see there's some nice CSS
being rolled out as well and as I click
on this it just loads it in a model
window quite a decent project I would
say and what I'm planning to do now by
seeing this is that we're gonna do the
exact same project in our react as well
let's just see when we get time to
upload those projects so definitely very
soon we are going
to do exactly the same thing fetching
the fetching the YouTube videos on a
page using react that would be a pretty
cool project and a learning point for
you as well so this is all about it and
I think it's a pretty damn cool project
and as I reload that it does that all
the coding so that's that's basically
simple jQuery plugin but again it's
pretty damn solid project I'm really
liking it so there is a time dot cheers
oh my goodness that I don't work in
Tydeus I work mainly in JavaScript pure
JavaScript
maybe react and react native as well
okay so it looks pretty good and in case
you want to just have a look on the
project let me show you the github repo
again it's on the github.com slash ramon
cody ins slash it h - website so see
what we've learned so far we have
learned that how we can run install a
bower you learned about the NPM quickly
as well you also learn about writing the
websites and Bower not in detail that we
have just I looked at the project but I
would highly recommend to do some
projects okay the only thing that's
stopping you to do the project is just
you you can just take any any
inspiration there work for anything can
design a website web page any software
just give it to me I would love to
review it this is one of the greatest
and the solid work I have seen so far in
here and definitely we are going to do
exactly the same thing in the react
native just for fun purposes and thank
you Roman it it we it was it's been
really awesome to check out this project
and this is all about it in case you
like these videos make sure you share
them on social media and I'll definitely
catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
