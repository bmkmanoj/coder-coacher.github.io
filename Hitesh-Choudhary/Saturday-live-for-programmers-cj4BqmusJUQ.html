seconds
okay so looks like we are about to go
live

hey there everyone this year back again
with another Saturday life so in case
you don't know we go live every Saturday
to answer your question to say hello to
you and to meet are you amazing people
first
okay so we are live again sorry about
that I was connected to another Internet
my bad
completely yes I am two minutes late yes
we are back again
can you please hey say anathan hi from
Sri Lanka hi from India enjoying curses
@lc okay thank you so much again as you
all know live is resumed why we are
having such issues in the life there are
some issues going on but don't worry in
a minute it will settle down so first of
all please do tell me about the audio is
the audio better now I hope it is this
time audio is a little bit better I am
expecting Hey okay okay hey guys I love
from Pakistan hey love from Nagpur thank
you love from Rajasthan and you are at
mica in my state here I from Tamilnadu
hi Balu how are you hi guys is going on
what you are learning so today we don't
have much of a gender usually on the
Saturdays but today we are getting
started about the patience on
programming patience is the most
important thing any plan for an alcohol
yes I am having couple of plans for an
alcohol and visiting go at that time so
do tell me about the audio people how is
the audio today I hope it is better than
previous ever experience so and just to
give you a little bit interesting fact
which a lot of people don't know about
the live what you write in the chat
section is immediate it's like instant
but what you see on my video here is a
little bit delayed always so do wait
here okay so it looks like a lot of
people are watching it good do give it a
thumbs up and thank you so much so let's
talk about the agenda here which is
patience now okay audio is good audio is
good thank you so much awesome audio I
love that audio is great finally we have
made it like better audio good audio
okay so a nice studio thank you so much
so let's talk about the most important
part for the bigness which is patience I
receive every single day email about
angular react node
maybe Android or web and everything so
first thing that I would like to suggest
every
big nur and every developer is it takes
time it takes time whether you want to
learn like programming whether you want
to build something whether you want to
learn multiple things it's not like that
you'll be doing overnight it takes time
sometimes it takes months and that's the
reality to become a like decent
developer it usually takes about six
month and before six month you cannot do
much and this is the fact we cannot skip
the facts obviously you know that so be
patience first of all and make sure you
spend at least six month with whatever
the technology you want to go maybe you
want to develop a reactor obviously have
to learn HTML CSS a little bit about
bootstrap then react developing some
project so it takes some of the time
okay
although picking up some questions as
well have many doubts yes I know you
have lots of dived but I'll try to just
get it there hang out worse is what sir
okay good set up new microphone no noon
this is like the most favorite
microphone I have ever and I have
actually tweaked a little bit setting
off going streaming I talked about one
of my friend who happened to be a very
good life streamer in the United States
I talked to him he walked through with a
couple of settings with me because he
said you are already having couple of
expensive expensive mic so you can just
tweak them I learned from him and we got
better audio which is better react or
angular now here is a good question
react an angular and I see this quite a
lot so let me answer this now react an
angular both her amazing platforms okay
and you cannot just compare both of them
they are completely like for different
purposes first of all react react is a
smaller library as compared here and it
is like you can get started quickly with
react on the other hand this angular is
actually a little bit gigantic there are
a lot of rules a lot of things you learn
but of course applications are smooth
and awesome but again do make sure that
you understand es6 javascript +
typescript is required for angular
without that don't proceed but on the
other hand react is smaller
you just need JavaScript and that's it
so we can go with that okay
which is better now to react react is
just a view have you heard about MVC
Model View controller so Model View
controller in that you simply want to
have like view for the react but on the
other hand note is like back-end ok let
me turn off my phone silent okay let's
pick up more question hi from Andhra
Pradesh hey how are you how is it going
on a Java OOP
Java is object oriented so what to say
UNK it shout out my name hey young kid
how are you are you vegetarian yeah it
will work okay let's pick up mode
question it's actually going really fast
Qadir in development versus automation
testing automation testing is at least
go for selenium and appium at least this
is like the minimum basic if you want to
go into testing and want to just reach
to a certain height starting a basic
test cases and all these things are like
anybody can go through into that's why a
huge number of people are doing it but
if you want this go something into like
higher phase of that at least go with
selenium now it's totally on your choice
you want to go selenium with Java
selenium with C sharp or Python it's
totally on you usually people go with
Java and that's where industry is
looking forward but again these are
completely different development and
testing both are required both are
awesome so this is how it goes
okay respect from Istanbul thank you so
much your country is beautiful I I it
has in mind like to-do list I would I
will visit Istanbul I've wanted to visit
it last year but you know my Egypt visa
got there and I went there remember me
uh it's just going really fast ok scope
of Android now here is a point this
scope of everything and there is no
scope of anything this is the fact get
it there if scope of PHP or Android or
iOS it's all dependent on how good you
are in that I can still see that a lot
of people are good in PHP and are
earning like 80 to 90 thousand per month
of course in rupees but on the other
hand a PHP guy who has just learned the
PHP is not even getting at
it all depends on how good you are in
that and that is your scope how much
applications you have designed how much
projects you have done how much
experience you have god this is all
scope so don't ever ask about scope of
Python scope of Java scope of PHP scope
of a hindrance cope of iOS there's no
scope and there is all scope okay so
it's all dependent on what you are there
okay the educator serve will you answer
my question I'm here to answer your
questions guys it's just too many and
I'm trying to pick up a few of them so
there we go Jango versus Express versus
PHP Jahangir is super easy super dope
easy and in fact I would say that if we
were getting started for the backend
part Jango would be like really super
smooth if you know Python of course but
yes again a react is also good if you
want to go with the back end but Django
is like whole package take it and just
go just like that
where were you today I got late today
because I was watching Bishwas show I in
case some of you don't know Biswa was
here today at Chapel he was having a
show so I was watching his show but I
have to leave a little bit early because
you guys were waiting for me so it was a
good show so that's small perfect time
whose mood was off yeah we all go with
the phases of life it's sometime up
sometime down it's a life it's how it
goes so don't be sad be happy that you
have food you have a computer you have
internet a lot of people just don't have
it so be happy about it and enjoy the
life there's like nothing more to be
happy about you have a good life okay
how to learn react native I Ragavendra
Perl you can check out my react native
course at learn code online dot in so
you can go there Shubham say is nice
photos on Instagram I really want to
make a video about these Instagram and
Facebook and all of this I just wanted
to give you a heads up there are a lot
of fake accounts on my name please just
don't follow them I don't know what they
are doing but I don't know why I have so
many fake accounts I never shake it but
recently a lot of students are sending
me those photos and links that here is
your account I said no it's not my
account simply please do take care of
that
okay AWS ah yes yesterday I got some
credits from Amazon so that I can work
on AWS and all of that so very soon
Amazon things will be there on learn
code online there are some good updates
so we're gonna be talking about that
very soon I have now got the credits and
I will be just setting up the things
within a few days
did he watch the last Jedi was it
awesome yes of course I watched the last
you know it was Star Wars always it's
amazing it's awesome okay so so react
native on Android studio if it is for a
client I'll go for react native because
for clients it's not about a matter of
on which language you are working for
clients is all about finish our project
we want this thing to be done and it
should be working that's it and for
these things I prefer react native so as
of now I'm just kind of hosting a lot of
things and doing a lot of stuff on react
native so that's why I'm busy there a
little bit okay
DevOps I am about to make a few videos
on the DevOps it's it's not a new thing
first of all people have been dealing it
for quite a lot math is mandatory for
coding okay Roman soldier asked this
question amazing question let's talk
about this a little bit map yes it is
quite important and if you are into
basic programming like web and iOS and
Android it's not that much like you
should be good in your addition
subtraction multiplication maybe a
little bit of linear zebra algebra and
stuff but if you are thinking that I
should go into machine learning or
something and what kind of math you are
talking about let's just say main mode
median and your automatic mean and your
linear algebra these are like always
should be in hand okay I mean mode
automatic mean and all these stuff and
you should also be fully comfortable
about Fourier transform your Bayes
theorem your probability these are like
the basic one you'll need them in every
single line of almost every single line
of code so if you are thinking that
machine learning I'm gonna learn machine
learning because everybody is learning
it don't do that mistake and done to
that mistake you will regret yourself
quite a lot because you should be
habitual of seeing a lot of data trust
me a lot of data you should be
comfortable in staring a lot of excel
sheets a lot of MySQL data then only
just be comfortable with machine
learning I'm not trying to be scaring
you out but this is the truth machine
learning requires a ton in terms of math
main mode median is nothing if you are
afraid of that
don't do that even you should be able to
learn to solve these bias theorem and
all of these things they are used quite
a lot so do yourself a favor first of
all get polish to your map
and then only try to jump that and make
sure you're comfortable with numbers
you'll see you'll see them quite a lot
okay so there we go
let's pick up more questions for 23
people are watching it thumbs up guys
I'm really thankful to you that you came
to join here joining little late a hairy
ship Kumar finally you joined up glad
you're here
dotnet versus PHP okay let's break this
silence on dotnet let me talk about that
a little bit now I did learned a little
bit about the dotnet I don't have
practical experience that MIT but yes
during my college time I learned dotnet
a little bit I really enjoyed it much
and obviously to be honest I would say
that things a little bit tough in
the.net as compared to PHP or react or
node they're pretty much easy and you
are the whole sole responsible for doing
everything in the RIA in the.net it's
all dependent on the framework release
and all of these versions while on the
PHP and stuff I am dependent on that so
yes it's gonna be how to be consistent
in 2018 resolution looks like you're not
watching my videos regularly go ahead
watch the videos of almost like 27 days
ago and I have started something some
experiment on my facebook page so go
ahead join there and I'll be posting
your reminders every single day just a
fifth just a minute guys
love from Kolkata I am planning to
Kolkata very soon probably in Feb okay
how to do okay it's going really fast
there okay how to get it's it's really
going fast I need to water bottle here's
its it's an iced tea as you all know I'm
a big fan of iced tea
some people even do send me iced teas
real career I appreciate that so it's
it's like iced tea okay are you on
Instagram yes I am on Instagram it's hit
H zero one four one okay they should
make char ache okay okay so let's pick
up come to Coimbatore I will I will as
of now there are plans going on for
Kolkata for Goa for velour or Chennai
these are a couple of things
what are iced teas what are iced teas
what is iced tea go ahead haven't you be
having car iced tea does IIT or triple I
t matter now it depends a lot of people
like like no not everybody is iit and
our triple i t's yes they are good
institute for sure you'll get a lot of
opportunities there but it's not if you
haven't made it to iit that's not the
end of the life so you can do pretty
good in that without that as well
programming doesn't say that you should
be when you upload your project on a
google account or i guess i can't they
don't ask you for that if your iit or
not it should be good and that's it did
you know that the founder of another
whatsapp was i eighteen or not we don't
oh yeah okay so opinion about AI Sophia
I happen to attend one event obviously I
was live
Sophia was there at IIT Bombay tech fest
recently in case you don't know there is
a video clip uploaded by those guys on
YouTube as well go ahead check that out
also my professor friend was there so he
just went onto the Skype at that exact
time I attended that talk and it was
really impressive that what Sophia was
doing relying on the base of context
really really it just like that so
really I enjoyed that talk and I think
it's a great step
forward that robots are getting advanced
so I appreciate on that so Sofia is
doing a really good job that's are my
views okay computer programming is
important okay there are a lot of things
about competitive programming that you
should be should not be worried like
it's not the ultimate thing just do a
couple of computer programming and dad
said I don't personally believe that you
need to go like a lot of lot of
competitive programming you don't need
that what you need is projects
definitely you need project because the
challenges that are being thrown at you
while doing project are by far more
superior as compared to competitive
programming yes they are good for
beginners it's a good starting point but
again you know what these are just
competitions the situation that you're
gonna face in actual life and with
actual clients is nightmare literally
you will not be able to sleep because
that client is gonna say so much to you
so again go ahead do a lot of projects I
always try in my courses that I create a
lot of projects in all these things but
again even if you take don't take my
courses and all of that
do yourself a favor do a lot of project
from wherever you are learning that's
the most important part nitesh I love
you I love you too guys so this topic
for project in Android come on you have
learned Android and you don't have any
idea of what projects you should be
building just replicate anything
whatsapp viber snapchat tinder these are
our projects come on and add a little
bit of their little bit of take from
they had lot of concepts from here and
there and just create something of your
own if you don't have even creativity of
building up something what you are even
doing at programming creativity is
number one thing how you're even solving
problems love from much made zero one
four five high is zero one four five
thumbs up to you
okay so why it is so nice I'm not nice
I'm not nice I'm just being what I
really want to say if something is where
I'll just say F and if something is good
I'll say it's good so I'm just being
realistic here
I was the best washer this was amazing
amazing he's getting a little bit bald
from here I noticed it because I was
sitting at the very top there but sure
was amazing
he's amazing guy you know the way he
delivers the talk and everything
sometimes he gets a little bit offensive
there uses a lot of abusive words but
hey it's fine not fine on to like the
things that I like is like I don't like
much of the abusive content but yeah it
sometimes is good but the best was sure
he's not being mean to anybody
particular but in general so it's cool
how to get notified about your visits uh
I don't usually post them but you can
follow me up on Facebook that's the only
social media that I handle
it's a HIPAA chaudhary page so that's my
only way of socializing and I'm not
active on Twitter sometimes I do post on
Instagram but not much Facebook is my
way I post sometimes like two or three
times in a day on Facebook so that's why
okay
lots of love which is best testing tool
testing selenium happy 'm like nobody
can mess around with that these are like
the best 122 to 420 people live yes it's
like 450 plus people are what are you
doing I just saw a baseball shoe and I'm
talking live to you guys and there are a
couple of names to name Oh hit a
shout-out my name hey Cooney Mohit go
for you
a collab it suction computer guy hahaha
very soon okay collabs okay
let's talk about them a lot of questions
are coming up about their collabs now
it's not like I don't want to do collab
I really want to do collab but with the
like-minded people I I don't obviously
obviously I'm a very small youtuber I
won't be getting a chance to do a collab
with like a current and Viswa but even
though I get a chance that's not a
fruitful collaboration for my channel
okay my channel is more over oriented
towards programming and stuff so if
there is a youtuber who works and talks
about programming and stuff
I would love to collab with him but
apart from that so that is why I do like
I haven't done any any color have you
know that already so I want to do collab
with the like-minded people to people
who talk about something related to
computers moreover programming stuff I
would like to love to collab with them
even if you know some of these collab
the people who to which I can collab
just notify me personally on my Facebook
page I would love to approach these guys
and sit out and talk something
meaningful so that you can get benefit
from that that's the goal here the goal
is not to like increase the audience
already I'm having very very cream crowd
of the YouTube so I'm really happy with
the audience that I have but again
somebody who can talk about programming
and stuff so yes
okay so that was a hot mic collab thing
okay
tips for freelancing freelancing is
getting really filtered he reminded of
it right now on to especially the
freelancer website you cannot copy and
paste you get a lot of things here so
it's getting very filtered it's good
thing ah great t-shirt super yeah it's
always great inside SEO M it is very
useful thank you yes M it is useful I
use it every single day it's a very good
product for all those people who don't
know Emmitt M it is a way of writing
faster HTML and CSS you don't have to
write these boilerplate codes it's
really amazing and fast I do have a free
course on Emmett at learn code online
dot in because I believe that's an
essential skill everybody should have so
go ahead and check out that course it's
good cold outside it's freezing outside
but still I event for swimming for a
couple of days did invent it today but
yes tomorrow I will be again going to
swimming it's freezing outside and still
I'm doing swimming so sometimes it's
crazy at what age did you start
programming professionally
professionally I have been doing it for
like seven years almost now seven to
eight years but I have been doing
programming before that as well from the
very first day of the call at something
that impressed me quite a lot was the
first error in my C program and I was
like mad over it I wanted to just solve
it somehow it's been almost seven eight
years and from last five years I have
been dealing with big clients as well a
couple of big firms about medical that
we have handled here yes did you attend
CES no I didn't got invited there
neither I wanted to spend that much
money to travel for just CES I would
spend that kind of money to travel maybe
New Zealand but not on that okay so you
have completed front-end course will you
make any back-end usually I don't say
much out in front about the upcoming
courses I just like to just present the
course just like that BAM that's it
so I'll keep that as a secret you know
okay
scope of Python as I just mentioned
there is no scope of anything in their
scope of everything
okay so
okay lab with a clever programmer yes
because our countries are different so
maybe if I'll travel to his country I
will try to do that okay
uh are you a football fan no I'm not a
football fan much I'm a basketball
player so I'm a fan of basketball i
watch all the seasons of basketball
usually when I get time but I'm not a
football guy I'm more aware a basketball
guy okay projects in penetration testing
penetration testing is a domain which is
really tough to talk about not because
it's tough because the community usually
cut out on you quite a lot so that's why
I usually avoid the pain testing
community I prefer more over programmers
because I believe that a strong
programmer with some knowledge of pen
testing becomes really amazing I would
say yes there are a lot of pen testing
projects as well there's no shortage of
them okay so let's pick up more
questions okay
are you CSC in your CSC branch in your
BTech no I did my bachelor's of
engineering in electronics and
communication my master's was in
computer science and information
security and then doctorate as well in
case you haven't checked out my profile
go ahead check out my video there it's
good decent okay can we use node.js for
mobile app yes of course you can use
node.js Postgres s or even MySQL
PostgreSQL or maybe MySQL or maybe
SQLite for a mobile application there's
no big deal
degree matters no I haven't used
anywhere my degree that say this is my
degree give me a project no never
happened always I had to show my
projects I always had to show my skills
sometimes even interview Spore even
freelancing projects as well so I don't
think so I have ever used my degree but
of course somewhere in the background
degrees to help you to understand quite
a lot of stuff especially about data
structure and things so yeah I would say
it's equally important don't drop out
I'm always against the drop out why do
we keep those headphones now these
headphones are actually for monitoring
my own audio a lot of people just
confuses that these are these are
headphones actually monitor the audio so
that I am NOT
taking my sound I'm not just speaking
too much low or too much high only the
humming sound is actually a little bit
bothering but eventually get through it
so it's always monitoring that the audio
should be good a little bit freaky about
having best quality audio and best
quality video video sucks right now
it's a webcam so it's not that much good
but again audio is pretty awesome
audio so what food do you like I like a
lot of food so it's not I'm not picky
about food I always like to explore try
out different things
I prefer veg always veg is like my
favorite food so I was try that in India
you can find always veg food but if in
some foreign country which is not
available
I'm not gonna be sleeping hungry that's
the rule that I follow okay so I'm not
strictly a non-vegetarian but if I won't
be getting any food I won't be sleeping
hungry so that's that will I follow but
I prefer wedge so that's how I go with
my life new to your channel hey Garo
saying welcome to the amazing community
you'll find loving and awesome audience
if you have any question post down in
the comment section the community is so
kind that they will give you answers as
well okay so don't hesitate community is
awesome we are all programmers we are
all trying to learn from each other I
try to learn from you guys you try to
learn a little bit from me so that's how
thing goes on okay we are a kind people
here helping each other out which
company working at present okay probably
you'll get to know about it on Monday or
maybe Tuesday there there's a big thing
coming up on in the next week who are
your favorite youtubers that's an
interesting question I can actually
count endless name on that case the
unites that Peter McKellen and mkbhd
obviously unbox therapy I came from
India and there is a channel here I
forgot the name of that I probably need
to check out the list here but there are
a couple of Indian audio Indian people
who are amazing youtubers so I do watch
a lot of them I enjoy their content and
especially I'm a big fan of recently in
of
Peter mccannon he is just amazing I
talked to him once over the email
exchange a few words he's really
sometimes it applies but yeah really
III got a few stuff from him about
cameras and stuff few tips he gave to me
I really enjoy his work Peter McKennon
probably if I'll visit sometimes Canada
I'll try to meet him so is having a tech
blog beneficial obviously it's a very
beneficial I highly recommend you to
check out my blog as well it's at
learned code online dot and slash blog
or Purdue writes amazing blogs there so
definitely go ahead read out those blogs
they are good for you okay future okay
it's just going how to start learning
web development hey Kalidas you can
learn web development from learn code
online dot n there is a front-end
development course check that out it's
amazing what's your opinion on red head
certified I have good opinions about red
head certification start with the Linux
Linux is always gonna be helpful for you
so go ahead get started with Linux
basics and if you want to do
certification as well one thing it's
expensive but it's really good if you
are just going all legal base
don't try to opt out or cheat there a
lot of Institute's do cheat on reddit
examination that's a fact everybody
knows it they're gonna give you question
dumps and that is gonna get that
question which will come in the exam
somehow but again don't do that it's not
good try to pass it the hard way you
will enjoy that every single time in
your life ok how much cold in jaipur in
degrees i'm not sure about the degrees
but it would be like around let's just
check it how much temperature is the
hair in jaipur so let me just check that
out
temperature
in Jaipur so I can show you guys how is
the temperature going on
it looks like I'm connected on to some
bad Internet yeah I have installed a
couple of new Internet's here but it's
not working really great
type that again
come on show me a temperature
okay it's like 13 to 14 degrees right
now hey Dave age thank you so much for
the support really do appreciate I code
new website for an installation but I
don't have money for big server SMP
email service please give me solution if
you don't have that kind of money I
would recommend you to go with the
Hostgator it's really good but if your
application is like very bigger than
that Amazon AWS is free for one starting
year that could be a solution you can
also host on here oku there is a free
tier that they're there and if your
application grows up more than that it
would be really affordable for you
because you'll be making that kind of
money with that obviously I cannot just
share like these things on email but
again I do appreciate your helpful here
again go for Hiroko try that or try
Amazon AWS it's free for one year and
Hostgator is like if you are hosting
some blogs or something okay I hope I
have answered your question
okay so
from where did you learn iOS mostly
working on a project I was mentored by a
person named as Lakshmana he was working
on a US company and I worked under him I
learned a lot of stuff from him and
mostly was reading the documentation so
you don't learn much at after a certain
time you have to just dig into the
documentation okay
your opinion about CCNA again I have
good opinions about CCNA as well it's a
good starting / a good starting path
obviously it's not just as dynamic as
development sector but again we do need
a lot of CCNA guys you manage a lot of
networking for us so it I have good
words for CCNA but don't just stop on
CCNA go on to next levels as well will
you give us private tuitions hey Manish
as of now my private tuitions are only
booked for a certain university student
as well I'm already booked in there I
teach them one are almost on a weekly
basis like two or three hours on a total
week so yes I am busy with them as soon
as I finish up that my contract then
I'll be starting this thing same thing
on 101 personal trainings in India as
well very soon will you prefer
investment in Bitcoin okay I do have
bitcoins I won't lie to you on that and
I bought it I bought a couple of them
when they were like sold for five or six
dollars each I bought them and I sold
them I don't have much now I already
sold them because I don't trust on
bitcoins the only reason why I don't
trust them is because there is no
government interference in that and I
don't think government is ready to lose
their power over the money they don't
want to handle like the money power to
know normal people normal people like
you and me so that's why I don't think
there is a good future in Bitcoin but I
can be wrong so my reason is I'm not
gonna be investing in that anymore I'll
just leave that aside I'll be investing
in something like properties or maybe
behind a good server or investing in
hiring more people so that is what I
would be doing in a future not investing
on Bitcoin
good good to see you hey Kashyap how are
you what are the opportunities for
machine learning and who all can do
hugging and I had talked about machine
learning in the initial this live
session here again in order to get
started with machine learning first of
all make sure you are absolutely
comfortable with numbers a lot of
numbers a lot of excells sheet will be
thrown at you a lot of my SQL data will
be thrown at you and plus you'll be good
in math I'm not talking about the math
of addition subtraction multiplication
I'm talking on a starter point like
getting a mean mode median arithmetic
mean and all such stuff and then on top
of that this is the basic basic on top
of that you should be really amazing in
your base theorem in your folio
transform in your algebra these are like
the basics of machine learning you will
be training a lot of data as you'll be
designing a lot of noodle models so it's
not just about learning the tensor flow
and the scikit-learn it's lot more but
on the implementation level it's all
about just tensor flow in psych it you
want to design and develop something on
machine learning that's a whole new
story about mathematics a ton of
mathematics but on implementation side
you want to build a chat app or chat bot
or maybe you want to build an
application that can find out what
object it is it's all about just
application so in that case I could
learn tensorflow these are the things
that you should be going oh but again
these all require here these all require
Python as well so hey Dinesh how are you
thank you so much for the support mean
stack or lamp stack which is better
as of now let's talk all the things
about 2018 and a lot and let's talk
about brutally about it I would prefer
if you will give me a chance of starting
any project or working on a client or
working on my skill I would be choosing
mean stack right now and this is what I
will be choosing now the reason why I
would be choosing mean stack over a lamp
stack is simply because mean is
approaching towards future of obviously
lamp is right now here it has a solid
past but where things are oriented and
moving towards that is the thing I
should here you should invest your time
in so hey Dinesh go ahead get started
with mean stack I would also recommend
you to not just rely totally on angular
try out on this react as well because
mean and myrn stack are all going really
well
obviously note is there obviously you
should also try react react is awesome
so go ahead try that out I hope I have
answered your question in just one word
go for mean stack okay so thank you so
much for the support that you are giving
really it really matters a lot
uh okay good night hey missionary Hindi
thank you please don't repeat just say
watch later
I don't know what you're saying
so future of ceh in India I'm not in so
much favor of ceh you can say all bad
words about that but no I don't prefer
see eh as a good certification yes you
also need to have it if you want like
upgrade in the salary or you want to
just get in the eyes of hiring guys it's
really decent but I don't think CH is
worth investing that much money
okay so okay let off good a lot of
questions are coming up here tips for
big mare my number one tips on big nurse
would be if you lahaska me go ahead get
yourself internet connection which has a
download speed of five kbps and spend a
week with it you'll get patience because
big nurse are not having patience I'm
saying it based on the experience I have
seen and I have interacted with a lot of
them
I have patience my dear friend you are
not gonna be becoming an ex-hooker work
in just ten days
you spend time spend a year with the
technology spend five six months when it
make a lot of project so that's how you
become a programmer it's not an
overnight magic thing spend some time
with it initially you'll be struggling
with loops and functions then you'll be
struggling in making a project then
you'll be struggling in designing
something it's it's all apart so get
yourself some patience my dear friend
that's the advice I can I can say okay
how to find a job apply have a skill
stuff like that selvakumar says dude
what's your hobbies okay first of all
this YouTube stuff is my hobby okay hey
this is not my full-time job and neither
do am like to super crazy about it but
yes my number one hobby is to interact
with people find out new people who I
can address can learn from them can
share my experience and all these things
so yes there is my number one hobby like
it is playing basketball if I get some
time swimming is like I'm loving the
swimming part here swimming is also my
hobby staying fit and all these are my
hobby and of course I love to spend time
with my family and friends I do have to
idiot friends I usually hang around with
them you can find them on my Facebook
page as well they are usually always
with me
I spent time I like to spend time with
those two idiots so Allah I love them so
that's my hobbies
do you still code every single day every
single there is not even a single day
when I don't code even if I'm like not
in the mood to make videos and anything
I still do a little bit work that's how
I get better how do you introvert hmm I
don't think so I travel quite a lot I
stay out quite a lot so but yes I do
have limited friends so you can call
that I do have limited
friends I hang out with them mostly so

any meetups in future hi yes we are
having a meet-up in jaipur on 3rd fab
there is a conference going on so i'll
be available there in march
Albin Goa and in Vellore and in Chennai
maybe these are all meetups
oh this discuss something about business
and a list all I can say chummy is I
would be needing some of the business
analysts very soon the post will be
opened up very soon so yes I will be
hiring a few people so very people very

huge ok it's going really fast
ah what after basics of web develop it's
just gone else I'll see you back end
course please tell the time and it will
come it will come but as always I say I
don't like to release the time that when
this course will become just like react
native friend and course it just came
like that so I don't want to put much
pressure here can I be internet lco
Harry temple yes you can be internet lco
as of now we are having some big news
that we need to announce at LCL after
that we'll be hiring people will be
having interns will be having jobs
business analysts and all these yes
we'll be doing that
uh okay it's going really really fast
and I want to pick up a couple of
questions here career in Java and Python
yes of course there is opportunity
equally there in both there's not like
one dominating they're both equally
amazing and job actually depends on how
much you have spent the time with that
programming language how much projects
you have created just imagine this way
guys
I know a lot of people are worried about
job but trust me companies are looking
every single day for the people who can
work okay and for that I mean to say
that who can actually who knows actually
technology and can deliver something
everybody's in is in need of such kind
of people so focus on your projects
focus on what do you know what you learn
and then after go on hunt on a job okay
are you mad at adage no not at all
living my bachelor life amazing and
awesome and happily here so far okay
redhead versus CCNA if I had to pick up
personally one I would be picking a red
hat not because I don't like CCNA I love
that but if I had to pick it up
I would pick it up red hat I even picked
it up red out I have done I like two or
three four four certificates or three
four I don't know four or three
certificates in red hat already okay
ah yes I call the immediate friends but
I love them how much do you charge per
hour as a freelancer sorry can I tell
you I don't charge per hour my basis I
just totally code a project and that's
done this is your project this is your
requirement this is what you're gonna
get this is my price take it or leave it
that's what I do I am very lucky to be
in a position that I can say to all
those people that you know what this is
I'm gonna be charging okay
okay
there is a very interesting question by
money a very very important question can
I join you please please please by the
way which subject I am je see RCN I know
Java code well if you know just a
programming language it's no good for me
let's be honest and let's be brutal
about that if you know any programming
language basic it's of no good at all
you should be good in programming and it
should have created some projects I
recently posted a weak job that was
really good paying job in Python but
again nobody applied for it can you
believe that I posted a job a week job
easy-peasy job in Python I posted that
hey just link me your github account in
the comment section below and the
recruiter will automatically contacting
you on the email so you just have to
paste your email and your github link in
the comment and to my surprise not even
a single comment there was a job and you
didn't took took it so what can I say
there is already job opportunity there
and you're not taking it how do we
inspire yourself have you ever checked
my comments section have you ever
checked how many likes I get on the
videos have you ever checked how many
minutes people watch my content I am
addressing millions of people every
single month
like this is if that's not inspiration I
don't know what it is
like I'm able to interact with so many
people I'm changing life of so many
people just by saying that hey code and
code every single day and these people
are getting job of their dream and they
are able to live a better life I don't
know what that is
if that's not inspiration for for me
Plus on top of that I'm getting a really
good payment from my clients I'm working
for them I'm writing code for that I
really want to grow up as writing code
in my life I'm doing it all it's like a
dream all for me and I don't know if
that's not like inspiration what else it
is yes I'm really too much pumped up
about it
