code online dot in visit our website or
download our apps hey did everyone hit a
sheer back again with another video and
in this video we are talking about one
single character which came from the
southern part of the country and just
duped the total entire ecosystem of the
Apple this is a kind of a big news
internationally and everybody is just
crazy about it getting crazy but there
is a lot that we can learn both for the
tech side of the people and for the non
tech side of the people so let's get
started
I love Christian mind the broken eyes I
know my
in case you are living under a rock let
me just get you an update that there was
one single character which came from the
southern part of the country and I
believe I'm not pretty sure about it I
believe that character is from Andhra
Pradesh and which means sign I'm not
sure a lot of my audience is from the
southern part of the country so please
notify me in the comment section below
what exactly is the character and what
exactly it means and to be honest for
most of the programmers these all
characters in the programming language
and all the local languages in fact are
just unicode characters and we have to
support that whenever we design
application all of that but the single
character when you send it onto an
iPhone or maybe an iPad it just crashes
it and I saw that on my iPad as well if
you want a mode like a detailed
practical thing about it go watch the
unbox therapy video he did a great job
uncle Liu did a great job there so go
ahead watch that if you want to have a
practical aspect of that but let's talk
about why these things happen and what
we can learn here which is the most
important part here now for most of the
programming language these characters
from the local language are just unicode
characters so we have to support them
sometimes there are exceptions for them
and we have to handle the exception so
it was a simple case of miss handling
the exception there and yes any
programmer can tell that that it was not
handled and that caused the crash of the
programs and that was it but there is a
lot that we can learn first let me
address about the non tech people who
don't know what the programming is and
just gives the contract basis to other
programmers and all these stuffs let me
focus to you guys now through this
channel I want to say this that hey we
programmers make mistake but these are
not deliberately we try to make sure we
give our best to the programs and make
sure these crashes and all these things
don't happen but of course there are
always exceptions and we are also humans
so errors are gonna be there not this
time but always in the future as well
but we try our best so next time when
you give up your project to any
freelancer or maybe to your programmer
who is working under you make sure you
don't just yell at him because he's
working his job he's not watching porn
on his computer
he's trying to fix these problems but
these problems take some time to get
fixed obviously we are trying our best
to get in faced with that but obviously
we are doing our job and don't yell at
them so this is for all the non tech
people who just kind of outsource the
project or hire programmers now coming
back onto the tech side of people first
of all about the big nurse
hey big nurse of the programmers look at
this incident some of the finest brains
on the planet are working in Apple
ecosystem and yet these things happen
this reminds you that whatever the app
you are building or whatever the website
or the project you are building and if
it is not working properly hey there is
hope because if those people who are
amazing programmers world's finest mind
can make these mistakes so we can also
you can also so don't be disheartened if
your app is not getting installed you're
getting crashes you are not able to for
him that karma that is bothering you or
maybe you are not able to install
Android studio you are having a Gradle
sync problem all of these problems are
ok in fact to be honestly if you ask me
that what is programming and a big nurse
will say it is about to build the things
but honestly when you move ahead into
the programming domain you will realize
that it's not only about the building
things most of the time it's all about
fixing the stuff so whatever the problem
you are facing it's ok if those giants
can make these problems we can also and
just be ok with it
just don't be disheartened because your
programming is having some errors all
the programs have error as long as you
are building something creating
something it will get improved over time
so my goal here is what I want to say
you here is my messages first of all
don't be disheartened because your
problems are not getting solved easily
Hey look at those people at the Apple's
their problem is not getting solved
easily as well so we are big nurse it's
totally fine
the second thing is make sure you
release out version 1 and we have seen
it again and again that even Apple rolls
out the version to get improvement and
all these things so whatever you are
building at least you have something so
be proud on that as I have seen it
numerous times on this channel that
having your first project is important
maybe your friend is going to dishearten
you saying that hey this is not a good
stuff
is all bad but hey look Apple is
offering obviously having some of the
bad stuff as well so it's programming
it's not just about building this stuff
it's about solving the problems maybe
writing some documentation for that as
well so programming is a lot more deep
subject and concept in itself so my
views are my advice to all the
programmers who are in the beginning
phase is look at the Apple if they can
make a mistake we can also just don't
stop there okay keep going keep coding
and keep writing amazing codes that's it
