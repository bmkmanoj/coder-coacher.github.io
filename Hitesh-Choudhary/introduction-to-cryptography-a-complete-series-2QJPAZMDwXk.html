and the reason behind creating this
series is first of all it's a great
topic yet there is no some such
rock-solid contents over the Internet
there are some great contents in the
text format but all of them scattered
around some topic about this I'm talking
about the section ace I'm talking about
the section B but not all over the
contents there are some good video video
tutorials that I found around but those
video tutorials again are scattered
around some of them having annoying
background musics and some of them are
really good once but they starts from
the level 10 from the very first video
now cryptography is such an interesting
topic that you should learn and if you
are jumping into the information
security world this is kind of a
compulsory topic as I feel and you know
it's kind of a very awkward situation
when you say some someone - like that
that hey I know more about the things
about SQL injection exploit writing
Metasploit and all such things and when
the person asks you hey what is RSA
algorithm or a Triple DES and you just
stumble out and say hey what's that
actually means
so cryptography this entire city is
going to give you a firm base so that
you can grab all the technical terms
like encryption decryption protocol
designing and like that I'll be starting
from the very scratch with no
prerequisite and I'll be talking from
the very layman perspective and later on
we'll move on to the extreme topics like
RSA Triple DES and all such protocols
and further I'll move ahead with the
topics like what were the mistakes being
done in some protocols which were broken
and how you can design secure protocols
and also stop aquila covered in the
cryptography this is the first time that
I am releasing the my video tutorials
before the completion of the entire
series and the reason behind is so that
you can also follow me up during the CDs
and can master the topic along with me I
am expecting this series to be quite
long so
I think it will take around three months
to get completed and I'll make sure that
you understand each and every bit about
the cryptography videos will be just
like as high resolution and with high
sound quality so that you can enjoy them
quite a lot so I'll make sure that
cryptography remains fun to you and you
learned quite a lot in the series so
let's get started
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
