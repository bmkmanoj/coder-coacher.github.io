learned code online dot n and in this
video we're gonna talk about something
more in the GS series so so far we have
seen that we can select any element
whether that's a PE tag or h1 tag or h2
tag whatever that might be now in this
case we're gonna take things further one
more step and we're gonna learn how we
can write a custom script that can help
us to identify the events on a web page
so obviously the first question is what
are these events the events can be
anything starting from a click of a
mouse maybe that's a left click maybe
that's a right click maybe that's a
double click or maybe you are putting
over the mouse maybe you're scrolling of
a page and just to give you one simple
example you might bean on to some kind
of a blog website any blog by the way
and when you just be there on the blog
and try to scroll after just few seconds
a pop-up box appears saying that hey
would you like to submit your email
address there so this is all can be done
using JavaScript and it's pretty easy to
do so so in order to perform these kinds
of things let's learn how we can do that
by first going into this index.html and
we're gonna create something for which
we can actually learn about these events
and of course what can be better than
having a simple button so let's just
have a button and we're gonna say click
me so this is gonna be really an ugly
button that we can have and there we go
click me so there we go right now when
we click on this button nothing happens
because we didn't tied it up to anything
so now what is our goal is to write a
simple JavaScript which can detect for
this button now so far we have been
detecting the peas in air all these tags
now we won't we also want to attach a
listener to this so that whenever
somebody can click on it we can do
something and that something can be
anything so let's just go into our
JavaScript and write code for that now
to your surprise writing a code for this
is actually really really simple let me
show you that so it's really simple
first of all we're gonna say document
dot and my favorite we're gonna use this
query selector and in the query selector
obviously you can pass on any classes or
your IDs in this case I do know that I
do have just one button on my page so
that's why I'm saying but
otherwise he usually buttons have some
classes or IDs and based on that
selecting is much more easier so now
this is being selected now what we can
do is we can tie it up to something
known as add event listener now this
event listener is really powerful and
we're going to look up later on that how
we can utilize that and this is a pair
of parentheses and what it expects you
to pass on first of all event now this
event can be anything notice the vs code
is helping me that what kind of event
you are looking for and maybe it can be
anything like clique which we will be
using it can be copy it can be drag it
can be drop it can be key down key press
key up load Mouse down mouse leave yes I
know this is like really a long list
mouse wheel and feel free to use any one
of them and as soon as your gonna be
triggering that event you can do the
things that you like now in my case I am
just looking for a simple click so there
we go
now the second parameter that it is
expecting is a simple function it can be
a callback so you can either use your a
fat arrow function I'm really sorry some
people really hate when I say fat arrow
function but it's just an arrow function
or you can use your regular functions as
well by typing simply function but since
now we do have a knowledge of these
arrow functions we are gonna use that so
this is our arrow functions pair of
parentheses and there we go so this is
what I was looking for okay now what you
really want to do as soon as this is
going to happen I just want to do a
console log so I'm gonna say something
like this button was pressed really
simple lines so let me just save that
let's go back in here on our browser
right click inspect element make sure
you are on to console and we're gonna
click on this and notice button was
pressed now if we're gonna press it
multiple times it just adds a stack on
to it and you can see the number there
okay that is pretty cool but that's not
something what we are expecting to do
now what you can do here is when you
pass this pair of parentheses here this
function this function actually is able
to tie up to an event so you'll be
seeing this event return now although
you can call the
anything event II or maybe my event
whatever you like I usually like to call
that as event or simply eat now
what we can do is first and foremost we
would like to see what this event is now
this event is a gigantic object let me
show you that so we're gonna have an
event let's just go back and at this
time we're gonna hit clean that up and
as soon as I click on this now notice we
got a mouse event here and notice there
are so many options here so whatever the
event you're gonna be tying it up you
can see that we have variety of options
on that probably you're tying it up to
not click maybe key press or something
then obviously you can you will have all
these options here so we can see we do
have a lot of options and a couple of
them which I really wanted to show you
is not able to find it just right now
but I'm pretty sure they are there so we
can see the target is button and I'm not
able to figure it out so there we go
there's the target and in the target you
can see further we do have a lot of
options and one of them is let me show
you a little bit down at the bottom we
do have this text contact option here
now this is a really gigantic list it's
really a waste of time to figure it out
things in here I will rather like to
show you the documentation part instead
of this so let's go back on to this and
what we can do is this event notice we
had a target so what we can do now is I
can just delete that and I can say you
know what in the event as I click a dot
notice we do have a lot of options but
one that I'm looking for is target and
in the target we do have other a variety
of options but the one that I'm looking
for is text content and I want to change
this contact and I'm gonna say I was
clicked so what we are expecting in this
case in this scenario is when somebody
is clicking on the button we will be
finding that button and will be adding
an event listener on to that and when
somebody performs this event in our case
it is a click we will be running this
function and since this function is
capable of an event we are going to be
looking up for target and text content
means the button text and it will be
changed to I was collect so instead of
click me
we'll be saying I was clicked let's see
that in action and you will go on here
and now we can quickly hit a reload and
we can say click me and notice it just
got changed
I was collect this was really a bear
ball an example but this can be taken to
a variety of next level probably you
want to run a music on the click of
button or probably you want to a shrink
a page maybe expand the page or there
are endless possibilities that you can
do so I think that's enough and that's
it for this video you have now learned
one more skill about how you can do some
stuff and I'm gonna surely catch you up
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
