code online dot n and in case you're
watching this video series haven't yet
subscribe to my youtube channel you
should definitely check out my youtube
channel it's an amazing stuff now moving
forward we are gonna be talking more
about the JavaScript and especially
we're gonna be touching the topic of
numbers the numbers hold a very specific
value in pretty much every programming
language because what you'll be doing
basically is either drill down to the
numbers and you have to perform a tons
of operation on that regardless whether
that's a score addition maybe that's a
user number of time logged in or maybe
your API is data or whatever that is
numbers are pretty much important so
let's just create a new file here and
we're gonna be calling at this file as
simply celcius dot J's now the reason
why I'm calling it as Celsius GS is
because we will be creating a simple
program which I discuss in pretty much
every course that I make whether that's
an Android or iOS it's kind of a
must-have everywhere
ok so first let's talk about numbers so
for example we are having a number which
is gonna be school and this is code is
let's just say we are starting a user
school with hundred now later on the
user decided our user jumped a few
obstacles and have updated the score to
like probably 130 that's also valid we
have already learned that once we
declared a variable we can just change
it like that now also we do have some
bonus so obviously it makes sense to
have a bonus in constant so Const bonus
and that bonus is off let's just say 50
points ok now we want to do some kind of
stuff with that so you might want to
calculate the things so let's just call
this as for final score and there we go
so final score is calculated usually
with something like this cool plus and
bonus so there we go
bonus okay that is absolutely fine no
big deal at all and we can have a
console dot log and we can simply say
hey I want to print my final score so
there we go it will be printed no doubt
at all let's bring up this guy
we can clear the screen and we can
simply call the node and Celsius oops
Celsius GS by the way I'm using the tab
to autofill these things it's pretty
easy for me to hit the tab and just
automatically complete that it entered
there we go so this is how it is being
calculated no big deal but legislate for
the final score do you want to do some
more things here probably you want to
multiply by something or some ratios you
want to calculate you just don't want to
give exact things as a final score maybe
there's an algorithm that you want to
set so what you can do is you can do
something like this this is being added
by it and that everything must be
multiplied by some factor probably 0.8
let's just say you multiply it by 0.8 so
all these operations that you're
thinking in your mind like your addition
subtraction multiplication division all
of these are actually inbuilt in
JavaScript and you don't have to do
anything it can just do everything just
like that so there we go
save that and now if you're gonna run
this exact same file notice you get 144
so this probably may confuse is they use
it a little bit and usually it's higher
than a 1 so 1.8 so user usually gets
confused at hey I scored this one and
probably bonus was this and then some
points more got added because you played
the game and I got a little bit higher
score
so in that case usually this is what we
do when we are designing any game or
anything like that so let's makes user a
little bit more happier ok and since we
have a constant 1.8 here constant factor
it makes our life easier to have it all
the same for the same users ok so there
we go now moving on to some more points
let me also be aware you that there is a
situation where most of the programmer
hates but initially in the school
everybody teaches like that but in the
real world example everybody hates that
so let's just say we have a complex here
available and you were asked that hey
you know what we need to add 4 plus 4
and then it should be multiplied by
probably 5 something like that and we
want to print the console log here so I
have just press command shift e to
duplicate that you can write the entire
line and you can just print your complex
here ok now what is going to happen here
and this
is probably the worst code that you can
ever write let me just show you the
reason behind that so if you run that
notice here it comes up as a 24 and it's
pretty easy so first of all this
operation was performed 5 x 4 20 and
then added 4 this is okay and this is
like the basic stuff but sometimes
things can get a little bit more crazy
maybe you want to divide it by 2 and
something like that now all these things
look absolutely amazing on papers but
not in the real world code you may get
some of the probably equation and
examples in the Universities that hey
give me the solution what is going to be
but in the real-world example if you're
gonna be doing something like that
probably your senior may get really
really angry on you so please don't do
that
now what is the alternative for that now
alternative in the programming world or
for writing best practices of the code
is wrap everything inside the pair of
parentheses as in order the operation
you want it to be performed let's just
say you want to perform this guy first
so what you have to do is you have to
wrap this around in the in the brackets
here so there we go by the way I just
selected that and press command and the
bracket so that it wraps around
automatically and then maybe you want to
perform your 5 and 4 of that so select
that and then we want to perform it so
I'm just pressing shift and 9 so there
we go now it is being performed and then
you probably want to divide the whole
thing as a 2 so it makes much more sense
in this manner probably you can just
wrap it again inside the codes but it's
not needed so I'm gonna not doing doing
that so this is actually a better code
here user can easily understand that hey
it's an inside bracket so this is going
to perform first and then it's going to
perform - and then the whole result is
gonna be divided by 2 so make sure in a
real world programming you never do a
long string of these operations
back-to-back being performed you always
use pair of parentheses to make your
code clear you will get always extra
points in your interviews or your
whiteboard interviews when you write
clear code it's not about to confuse or
to challenge anybody
it's the code is meant for solving a
problem and just by using a line of just
simply these operations you're making
things complex don't do that
okay so there we go now it's much more
easier to decide what is going to come
and there we go without a big deal it
just comes up like first of all this
operation was performed and then
multiplied by like that so four plus
four is eight and then eight is being
multiplied by five and then it is being
divided by two so there we go
pretty easy stuff and probably you might
want to wrap that around inside one more
so that is also fine no big deal here
and there we go still gonna get same
results so no big deal okay so this is
all good now we have learned that we
have all the operations like division
multiplication addition probably more as
well as we'll be working on that we may
find a little bit more as well but all
the basics one you can find them here
now here is a quick assignment for all
of you
there is also an operator known as
modulus operator you need to read a
little bit about it on the web Stack
Overflow wherever that is and let me
know what this operator does so this is
a simple assignment for you now what
we're gonna be doing is first of all let
me just comment that whether we just
press command + / to comment them it's a
pretty neat trick you can just select
the line that you want to comment and
just press command + / / to comment them
or uncomment them it's a pretty easy
stuff okay so there we go now let's
design a simple program or a simple
solution for a problem that I am facing
now my friends are usually usually talks
about the temperature in Fahrenheit and
it's really tricky for me to just get
the temperature in Fahrenheit I'm used
to with the Celsius in my country
Celsius is pretty dominant and we use
Celsius so just we need to create a
simple program which can convert any
temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
okay so how we can proceed with that
so steps can be really really simple
first of all we need to take the
temperature input which is obviously is
gonna be in Fahrenheit so we're gonna be
saying simply let tamp in Fahrenheit
something like that
foreign height there we go
or you can write fully as temperature in
Fahrenheit that's also good so let's
just say
we are getting 32 here that's fine and
now we need to do calculations so do
calculation I have absolutely no idea
what is the formula or how I need to do
calculation for that all I know is I
need to store that in a variable so I'm
gonna store that into Celsius Celsius
and I have absolutely no idea how to
perform later on so what I can do is I
can quickly go on Google and find out
the formula for converting a temperature
from Fahrenheit to Celsius and I can do
that quickly so I'm gonna go on to
Google and Google is always a good
friend so I'm gonna say something like
Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion formula
there we go and I think if I'll go
inside this link it can give me if not
Google is filled up with the links and I
can always find them all so let's just
go here and let's just find the exact
formula
I think I'm not able to find it here
let's just go back look for another
website rapid tables there we go there
is a formula so notice the formula is
right now into converting that Celsius
into the Celsius so this is what we are
expecting to do first of all this is
Fahrenheit so obviously I can see that I
have to subtract 32 from it and then
multiply it by five by nine okay so that
makes sense and I can do it notice they
have already given you these pair of
parentheses so that operations can
perform rightly really nice and they
have also given you these things so
pretty easy or if you want a division
that can be 9 by 5 which it's basically
the same thing that you're trying to
trick you in the math so there we go now
have got the formula which is TF at 32 5
by 9 I can copy that go back to my code
editor and can place that here and there
we go I'm gonna just put a comment there
so that it doesn't really bother me so
what I have to do is take my temperature
which is temperature in Fahrenheit and I
have 2 minus 32 from it and now I can
just select all of it and press my shift
in 9 to wrap the
in the semi car in the in the pair of
parentheses and then simply I can simply
say multiplied denoted by Asterix shift
plus eight and I can simply say 5
divided by 9 there we go so I was able
to convert my temperature in Fahrenheit
into Celsius pretty easily
and now I can simply say console console
dot log and here I can simply say
Celsius
okay so there we go nice and easy stuff
so let's just save that and see how much
programming we have learned and there we
go zero which is absolutely great if you
want to have like little bit more like I
just used it 32 for zero that's nice but
let's try it on 50 which is 10 degree
are really cold but I'm gonna try
something which is right now here which
is around like it's around 43 I feel but
let's just go for 100 fahrenheit how
much it goes with that so let's just say
it is now hundred and let's just see
what it does for us and there we go
exact precise decision now obviously we
do have libraries in which we can
actually reduce down these Precision's
and all that but that's gonna come up
later on obviously for sure but right
now this is pretty good what we have
learned so congratulation within a few
videos you have learned that how we can
create a simple application in here now
the rest of the stuff that we have to
learn obviously it's gonna come is take
the input from the user probably from a
web interface or anything like that and
you can create a simple application
which can convert temperature into
Fahrenheit or Celsius within a click
that's it so that's the power of
programming obviously we are gonna be
learning a lot more than this but I
think this is a pretty basic start on
numbers and Celsius conversion and
variable so I hope you are enjoying this
