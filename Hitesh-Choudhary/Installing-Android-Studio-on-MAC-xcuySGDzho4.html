Android training now we are directly
jumping into the meat part of the code
and obviously the very first step is to
install the Android studio now in case
you don't know what the Android studio
is it's a platform or rather I would say
an IDE integrated developer environment
where you will write all of your code
and we'll run all of your code now
before we begin and install this let me
just talk quickly about three important
points that you should always keep in
mind now first of all Android
development and learning other
programming language is slightly
different because you might be coming up
from the background where you might have
learned about C C++ or maybe Java but
that's officially not required for this
course we will cover up all the Java
requirements in in the training itself
but you need to understand that writing
codes for that language and writing code
for Android is little bit different in
point of memory usage because in those
languages you just write a simple
program that uses memories and just KB's
or to the max a few megabytes but when
you write the code for Android studio
and develop it for an Android platform
it uses a gigabytes of the RAM so that's
important feature that you need to
understand
so obviously the very first link that
you need to go and you will be visiting
quite a lot during the end dry during
the entire Android development cycle is
going to be developer.android.com so
make sure you bookmark it it's going to
be the important link which will be
visiting quite a lot and one of that
link is delivered android comm slash
studio and what we want here is the
Android studio which is a free IDE which
we'll be using throughout this course
okay now before you begin with this
training let's clear up a few things and
move back a little bit down and talk
about the system requirement so you
might be on a Windows you might be on a
Mac or might be on a Linux it doesn't
really matter Android development is
completely independent of that platform
but what you need to take care is about
the RAM usage so as I was mentioning
that when you write a code for C or C++
it's just a few
cavies of the memory that's being
utilized but when you write the code for
Android your entire Android OS is being
lost so that means you are running your
entire program on a simulated mobile
phone which consumes a lot of memory so
make sure that your system should have
at least three gigabytes of RAM but I
don't recommend three gigabytes see it
is really a painful job to develop an
Android app on just the feet gigabytes
of the RAM so eight gigabytes would be
that I would be recommending and at
least should have four gigabytes of RAM
now if your system don't come up with
that make sure you do upgrade you can
surely work with that low kind of a ram
but things will be painfully slow and
it's not going to be fun so that's for
the windows for the Mac guys again it's
almost the same its minimum on the three
side I don't recommend I recommend at
least four gigabytes of the RAM and if
you have eight gigabytes of the RAM
that's going to be awesome so that is
the minimum requirement I'm pretty sure
everyone would be having at least two
gigabytes of the disk space free with
them and that schools there now
obviously in this I am having a Mac so I
would be downloading the Mac version of
the end of studio now it's going to
detect automatically for you that
whether you need a Mac one or the
Windows one so I have already downloaded
this guy which is a little bit of a
heavy in the size for 34.8 one actually
and as soon as you download it you will
be redirected to this page which is an
installed or HTML page it guides you
quite a bit about what is installation
process they do have a nice video but I
don't think you think that you'll be
needing that and you can change it for
the Windows version as well and it shows
you the entire process for Windows as
well ok so right now I do have a dmg
file which is for my Mac for the Windows
File you will be having a dot exe which
is pretty easy to install click Next yes
I agree to agree and just install in the
default location for me on the Mac it
just a matter of dragging and dropping
it into the Applications folder and it's
going to start the process in a second
and there we go so this is how we
install the things on a Mac
pretty cool and pretty easy now it's
almost exactly the same for the windows
as well but you have to click a couple
of more buttons and there we go now one
more thing that I would like to show you
is that right now if I open up my
terminal there we go and I ask for Java
dash V and it says hey the Java JDK is
not installed on your system and that is
the one thing that I wanted to discuss
here that I don't have Java yet on my
system and I don't need to install it
because JDK or the Android studio
actually comes up with the JDK directly
there so I don't need to be worried much
about that and I'm going to launch my G
Android studio there and in a minute
there we go it says hey do you want to
open it for sure I want to open it and
it's taking a couple of seconds no
worries there and it will show you this
screen so I don't have any previous
version of the studio on this system so
I'll be just using this if you are
already a developer there and you have
some settings that you want to import
you can choose this option but for most
of you this is going to be this option
so click on OK and there we go now let
me just move it to the other screen and
there we go
so a set of reserved is there and I'm
going to click on the next and I'm going
to go with the standard for most of you
it's always be standard click on the
next and now it's going to download a
few things on my system which is 8 and
24 and you can see a lot of things are
downloaded the one which we are mostly
interested is make sure that you
download disk at Intel x86 emulator
accelerator which is in hack sim
installer now this is very important and
for the Windows guys especially that you
download and checkmark this because you
want to install this separately it's not
installed directly onto your system make
sure that you have this file ok so I'm
going to click on directly on to the
finish and now it's going to download a
few things now I can click on the show
details to make sure I understand what's
downloading and it's not and with the
power of magic video editing I'll just
fast forward the things
you
now in my computer it's automatically
asking that hey it won't install the
accent this might not be the case in
case of Windows so you definitely need
to go into the Program Files need to
install that separately but right now
it's a good case for me so I'll just
enter my password and we'll allow it now
as soon as it download everything and
everything is ready it's going to show
you up the screen and we are ready to go
now we will move on after this screen in
the later on videos now make sure that
you reach up till the screen and I will
catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
