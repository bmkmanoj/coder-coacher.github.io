less than two week so it was a very very
busy schedule and we are going up really

planned up here and more focus no need
to be given to the YouTube channel more
awesome stuff is going to come up and
amazing amazing things are going up

I can see

okay
it seems to look bad I just fix that up
okay so yeah so I'm good power consumer
haha that looks nice there so we are
gonna get started here very soon you can
start asking your questions we are gonna
spend a little bit time here
it's been long it's been long that I
haven't talked to you on these Sunday
lives so it's always amazing lot of
questions are flooding up let's start
taking questions now the nice say is how
are you I'm absolutely fine a little bit
tired because I have I travel so much
it's still like a jetlag thing so that's
why we are gonna say let's ask answer a
question there's a good one here from
Raj brothers what would you suggest to a
fresh graduate student having some kind
of little experience in trying to decide
New Zealand or Australia or Canada or
Europe I would say Canada would be good
for IT people because yes there are
equal opportunities in New Zealand and
Australia but they are not very heavy
opportunities there are not very extreme
opportunities in New Zealand and
Australia as of now yes there are good
startups and all these coming up in the
New Zealand in Australia but for IT
industry Europe is growing really well
and it's a nice continent you will enjoy
there quite a lot of course US is there
but I prefer you know all the days okay
can I use firebase with PHP yes of
course you can use firebase with PHP
there are little bit here in there that
you have to manage but yes of course
it's completely doable
there's completely awesome can I have
can you give some ideas for some Android
apps I worked on some basic app if you
have worked on already on basic I have
tried to make clones clones is always
always a good thing in Android making
clone of uber snapchat Twitter or maybe
Instagram YouTube even s these are
always good
go ahead get started best colleges in
India to study game development I am Not
sure that there is any college in India
that specifies or gives you a degree
virtualization and game development I
don't think so
that it's it is there but I'm not sure
I'm not aware of that if you know any of
that I would really like to know and get
get in touch with those guys Oishi
Schneider says house Chennai Chennai is
amazing I really wanted to spend a
little bit more time in Chennai I made
really good friends there and one thing
that I've always loved about the Chennai
is their hospitality and how much
respect they give to other people I
absolutely love the way that how they
how they treated me over there it was an
overwhelming feeling and I absolutely
love that the one thing that I loved at
Chennai especially the dosa the dosa
that is here in the northern part of the
country is nowhere near what actually
the dosa is in Chennai
I loved it very much there okay I'm
working as a Java developer from last
one year I'm following you from a while
the thing is I'm not satisfied with my
job and salary or anything I want to
quit please suggest something if you are
already working in a Java juggs now
there you can always switch into Android
it's so easy you're already aware of the
Java it would be pretty easy for you to
switch into the Android of course the
next thing that comes up to you which
would be really easy for you to switch
would be selenium and happy a kind of a
testing thing so I think you should
definitely learned it for your
experience if you are already working as
a 1 year as a programmer in Java I think
within like 2 months you can be good
pretty good in Android and within like
month or month and a half you can be
really good in selenium so choose
whatever you want in these two options
okay let's pick up there's a good
question from Rajesh here he says why
don't you upload something about asp.net
or any Microsoft technologies the point
is on this channel I really like to
upload on the things on which already I
am having some kind of experience even
the little experience or
a little mastery kind of thing but with
the Microsoft technologies I did learn
asp.net in my college times but didn't
created any kind of a big scale project
in that not even a project with like a
thousand users not even like that
so that's why I don't talk much about
the asp.net because it has changed quite
a lot from where I learned it and right
now I'm not having any mastery in that
that's why asp.net is not there yes in
the future videos you will see videos on
xamarin because I once worked on a
project on Sam rain not much heavily
onto the Sam rain but it's gonna
can you come to a small level Institute
for a session yes we wait there is no
such thing as a small college or big
College it's totally okay but the only
thing that I look forward when any
college is inviting me because obviously
when I come or visit to any college it's
a lot of time that I am consuming there
and time is the most valuable thing if
you have already watched my videos I
consider the top a time as my top
variety but still the only thing that I
asked for the college is to bear my air
travel as well as my stay I usually
prefer to come on in the morning to the
college and leave by the evening because
it saves me a little bit time but of
course coming to a college bearing my
own expenses and own travel doesn't
really make sense
I have other works to do so only thing
that I asked from the college's is you
have to manage my travel I'm not going
to manage it on my own
apart from that a small college or big
college doesn't really matter you can
invite me at the any college I would be
really happy to visit there ok you are
my inspiration thank you so much thank
you so much ok is it real Java is going
to end because of Cortland no it's it's
not like that no J's came out and PHP
didn't die there but still a lot of
people are switching MJ it doesn't means
PHP is dying similar situation is there
are not going to be dying because of the
cutlet you know and better options to
prepare just the Android app so it's not
like that job
in India that's the tough questions
there is no such thing as bad or
anything
hello only like
and that we connect come on into that
don't do this to me
okay we are connected back we are
connected back okay I think the lagging
will be stopping now I was trying out on
to a different connection but looks like
it didn't worked out well I'm back onto
my regular connection things will be
good within a few seconds give it a time
okay so I was talking about progressive
web apps yes definitely progressive web
app one video is coming up on the
YouTube channel talking about all
progressive web apps how it is being
done how we can test an app whether it's
a progressive or not and that's what we
are
it's almost left for editing purpose I
think it will be uploaded by tomorrow
let's just see that are you app
developer yes I design apps and websites
as well sometimes I work on a more big
projects as well so yes I do that in
case you want to know about me what I do
you can visit learn code online but in
Rho G com it will give you more idea if
you don't know how what I do and what I
like to do how much money do you make in
a month
enough to live a happy life travel to
some countries like in a year or so and
drive my nice Harley Davidson that's
that's what I make not much but enough
please fix the time for Sunday life I'm
trying my best to fix the sunday ly but
these travels and so much of the work is
actually and not allowing me to fix the
Sunday live I would really like to have
a Sunday time fixed up and meet more
people than what we are meeting right
now because the crowd is screwing so
much at this channel I would love to
meet all of you
but right now YouTube videos the clients
that I already have for my living the
courses that we are pushing upon learned
code online and learn code online is
coming up as a big project so I have to
focus that on as well it's it's so much
that is going on so that's why okay any
node.js offline bootcamp is organized in
Jaipur right now I'm not organizing any
offline boot camps in country talking
about effort it's not in jail but it's
not even in the country yet so I would
say
is join the online boot camps which are
available that learn code online dot in
as of now maybe later on we will do that
giveaway result
yes giveaway result will be coming up I
think today or tomorrow wherever at that
time is it will be on time you will be
getting emails in your inbox in case you
are selected there and I will be waiting
for your reply for 24 hours in case that
24 hours are gone and you haven't
replied I'll pass that opportunity to
somebody else okay do you have any apps
hosted on Play Store right now just one
learn code online dot in I did had many
apps and they are all on the github or
from other accounts of the clients
accounts I just like to push that which
makes money and our fruitful I don't
push apps like games and stuff which
doesn't really make much money for me at
least so right now just one app learned
code online dot and check that out if
you are interested in that okay Android
app development laptop under 50k I've
already made a video on the best laptop
go ahead on my channel and look out for
the best laptop for programming it's
already there and I have mentioned a few
links there as well okay okay let's pick
up more questions it's good to be to be
talking to you all of the guys some
people are asking for my contact number
no I don't have I don't like to have a
contact number in public okay when I
come from Chennai thank you so much Alan
Raj I absolutely loved in Chennai I
would really like to come back again to
that place or Chennai Bangalore these
are like amazing places I always love to
visit them okay hey it's good to see you
here I was waiting for your Sunday life
thank you so much I'll try my best very
soon to fix up a specific time for
Sunday live but it's so tough for me to
manage all these things I didn't them
say it's hey tej how are you I'm good
I'm good so fine how are you mister
please post down in the comments below
his MacBook II ain't good for
programming absolutely no problem at all
some of my friends are doing full scale
app development
on macbook air no problem at all I like
you I like you to come with rock and
loved to come with rock and I have
visited it once it's absolute beauty to
be there I would really like to come
there completed your Android course from
lco fibrous section was awesome
thank you so much more courses are going
to come up on Android very soon specific
courses on designing the apps and
everything so much meat to be done are
you do live performance performance but
you feedback performance I don't dance
at the stages what do you mean by that
just getting there okay is Python best
for automation there's no such thing as
best or worst if it serves your ever
purpose then it's good
NIC tube okay that's a nice logo that
you are designed for NIC tube really
really nice there I like Technic tube
thumbs up for that sir how can I start
my own software startup to learn to
design software for people already or
either design your own product okay
let's pick up more questions how to
implement machine learning in Android
there are some modules and library for
Android that are coming up very soon on
a full scale for Android as well I will
notify you that on my channel very soon
as soon as they come up how to be
successful as you while working at home
haha I would say start learning the more
technologies you will have it would be
more easier for you to get successful
because let's say a client came up to
you and he asked that hey I won't design
a website for this and you said okay I'm
gonna do it and then they say say my
website is growing I need a more
back-end solution for that can you do
that and when you say yes it's more
money that's coming up and then the
client says hey I really want you to
design an Android and iOS app for this
so it's a whole package that you can
to just one client and you can aren't
pretty good there so learn as much as
technologies as possible that is going
to help you to learn quite a lot so
Prasad says sir you are like mentor for
me thank you so much I'm really so happy
that I am able to motivate a lot of
people through my channel to promote
programming and coding I never say that
always learn from learn code online or
from my channel as well I always say
that explore more options as as long as
you can so yes definitely when you buy
from third code online or watch this
channel videos it really helps but all
I'm saying is keep learning from
wherever the sources are whoever the
instructor has respect those instructor
and keep learning keep exploring your
options the whole motive of this channel
is to promote programming to give people
actually the things which are fun and
fun and enjoyable in programming and I'm
really happy that I'm able to serve this
purpose then we are moving towards the
hundred thousand subscriber which in
itself is a big mark in the YouTube
community that yes the channel is
growing and it's just it's just one of
the many milestones that we are gonna
hit up so we are looking forward for
this kind of things we all are going to
hit it very soon okay let's pick up more
questions how to get more downloads on
Android app it's not a trick that you
can do for getting more downloads if
your app is good it serves something
it's amazing game or it's just kind of a
utility app or something like that it
will automatically get downloads but you
can share it on social media I can write
a blog on that medium a blog and medium
would be really really nice boost if you
can do that so definitely how do you get
started with g-shock I would be talking
about G sock and everything in Google
developer conference I have a couple of
invites for from Google developer
conference I would be talking about them
at that conferences so if you are in
nearby Punjab I am very soon coming to
Punjab as well so if you are nearby
there definitely do
say hello to me if you
Punjabi yeah okay
machine learning or data analysis I
would say data analysis could have been
really better in India machine learning
there are not amazing and huge
opportunities as of now it will be shown
there in future but as of now data
analysts are really skyrocketing in all
over the country
okay can I post my story website on star
student in November or December anytime
anytime I just shoot the email issue and
I would be really happy to read your
static stories but the most important
part is not the story story should have
a happy ending and what the happy ending
is here is a project something that you
have came up so make sure you post the
project first and then the story later
on the second part of the email this is
most important in order to get featured
at the star student section of them how
is firebase frequently used in today's
industry ah quite a lot startup are
using it like anything later on you will
be moving on to different database
RapidEye or maybe back and less or
something but it's almost same reading
documentation and stuff have you visited
to Nagpur no I haven't ever been to not
pull I guess I guess so I have no idea
but I think as long as I remember I have
never been to knock word course on react
yes it's already there at learn code
online course on react yes including ten
apps ten projects that you'll be
creating in react yes and of course some
basics of cognitive is already included
there so I hope it answers your
questions ok I want to be independent as
all-rounder all-rounder give me tips bro
learn a lot of programming languages and
then he'll be only able to do it all
around kind of things ok a lot of
questions coming up job job okay
somebody is spamming there yeah somebody
with the name of account roshni
are is spamming so don't believe on
these guys who says money money money
and you'll be able to make thousand
dollars in a month oh no this doesn't
happen when are you coming to Pakistan
and now as of now I do have a plan to us
and if you visit like Pakistan just
before the u.s. they makes a lot of
trouble so that's why I have a cancel my
trip I have a lot of invitation from
Pakistan a lot of people just are
reading from my courses learning from
them I absolutely would like to visit
maybe someday I'm not sure but as of now
since because of the US plan I have
actually delayed it otherwise it's gonna
be a little bit trouble for me and the
bees and stuff so sorry about that
ok so I US development - hail ice
developer course for iOS 11 is already
available at learn code online hey young
kids same answer to you as well it's
already available in learn code online
mine says we're in Punjab exact place I
am Not sure I can tell you about the
exact place right now I think it would
be in a nearby chill endure or Peguero
I'm not sure exactly because I haven't
got that detailed yet but all these
details as soon as they come to me I
will be posting them on my Facebook page
I cannot see the lights rising up now so
hey people if you are still with me -
hit that like button I really want to
see that number going up can you please

come on yep I can see that now going up
really nice thank you
where do you live I am right now in
Jaipur home sweet home
when are you visiting Bangladesh they've
got an invite from Bangladesh as of now
so no no future plan of visiting the
Bangladesh as of now okay
let's ask let's answer some of the more
questions how much money you make in
YouTube
ahaha I cannot tell you exactly her that
how much I'm making in that but yes of
course
I can say that it's not in three digits
of course in the US dollar it's not in
three digit it's more than that it's
pretty good pretty good
happy with that even in the month on a
monthly scale it it allows me to travel
again there a little bit it's not like
huge is coming from the YouTube it's not
like that but it's it's pretty decent I
won't lie on that it's pretty decent
it's not that bad where do you live I
live in the beautiful city of Jaipur in
Rajasthan it's an amazing place nice
clean little bit oldest kind of city
less populated nice people here so I
love the city yepper okay let's pick up
how much you spend in development field
how much you spend you are talking about
time or money because in the money part
I've spent a lot and the time part yes
again I have spent a lot machine
learning will replace our development
job within a next year just to give you
a little bit context onto that a
driverless car are also coming up so do
you really think that the driverless car
are going to replace all the drivers job
with the next five years or ten years
answer this first yourself no this is
not like that anybody is going to
replace the programs job or something
like that at least for near five or ten
years and instead of just getting
worried about that don't do that because
even if your job is getting replaced or
something you should be onto the same
page where other people's are everybody
needs programmer don't don't be
misguided there okay thank you so much
for answering thank you thank you so
much I really appreciate that
how you can make your video background
sometime it's like green screen you can
see that behind me but most of the time
it's not most of the time I use my
cameras and DSLR and just my room so
that's how I make my backgrounds okay is
AWS right path variety yes of course
Amazon Web Services if you want to get a
mastery in that it's always good always
good a lot of people use that so
definitely give away results yes very
soon I'm gonna pose that
actually came back from a lot of travel
I got little bit tired and definitely
from I guess today or tomorrow we'll be
announcing the results of giveaway
very soon very soon okay how long do you
work a day I haven't calculated that but
usually I get up around like six o'clock
in the morning then half an hour of
exercise when out of swimming then
planning and detail and I sleep around
like 12 o'clock or one o'clock in the
night so I haven't actually calculated
much of that but there's a lot of my
time
anchors in working and all that stuff
when Jaipur meter
Jeremy it appear I have to plan the
jabber meter but I don't think so I have
no idea how many people are interested
in having a Jaipur meet-up I'll post the
status on my wall on my Facebook page
and I'll see how many people are
interested if at least we are getting
like 10 people or so we can definitely
plan that out surely so you live in
India yes I prefer to stay most of the
time in India but yes I do have some
residents in some stays in Paris as well
I love to go there and stay there for a
while I do have my friends in some good
part of Australia as well and they are
programming friends so definitely I
sometimes go there as well okay okay
let's pick up more question MacBook Air
vs. MacBook Pro versus iMac if budget is
not an issue I would go for iMac in fact
I do have an eye back here if you can
see that there we go it's turned off I
haven't turned it on yet but it is not
an issue I would go for a Mac iMac if
budget is little bit down go for a
MacBook Pro and if budget is really
really tight go for macbook air ok any
study material available to LC oh haha
do hit at courses dot learn code online
dot in amazing steady with it it's it's
a website full of study material I don't
know why you actually asked that we're
not able to find courses or apps or
anything like that
so definitely look around are more on
the website it's it's full of you are
like mentors thank you so much I really
love to have
all of your questions cloud computing
courses I know as of now cloud computing
is not yet land we are looking forward a
lot of things need to come up sorry I'm
here why are you so sorry hush were
there no need to be sorry
must answer if I learned Python will I
be able to adapt to other programming
languages to note I don't even have
programming background yes of course
once you switch in any language whether
it's a Python whether it's Java or
whether C because the flu is always the
same in all programming language all
programming language have loops all
programming language have variables all
of them are having if an else condition
all of them are having functions most of
them are having classes as well so it
will surely help you if you'll just
start with any language okay
higher studies of this menu can do it
flip a coin and can go with that both of
them are amazing so flip a coin and
decide if you can do that okay name a
harsh word insane is your name my name
is Leticia Fred camera is good yes this
is front camera from 1+5 and there is
that review coming up on one plus five
very soon
I don't do reviews much of the time but
yeah this time I decided to have one so
definitely it's gonna come up please
reply Android course or Java bootcamp in
case you are absolutely not aware with
the Java I would recommend to start with
Java bootcamp if you are already
familiar with the things like if-else
and loops and classes in Java that a key
jump onto Android course okay so IT
sector will fall down at 2020 I don't
think so you are already talking on
YouTube which is an IT sector you are
working on a mobile which is Android
which is also an IT sector all if a TVs
are into IT sector they are all smart
TVs your cars are smart TV you use uber
you order food online from foodpanda or
Zomato you give ratings on Zermatt
can you even expect it's gonna fall down
don't think so it's gonna happen very
soon you order everything from Amazon so
for these kinds of job people do need
people who know programming okay let's
pick up more questions it's masters
really worth it it's good if you are
doing it like with full honesty it's
it's really good there yes of course mr.
Hart says how come ID is gonna be away
now everything is ID yes of course it's
unavoidable power that human race has
actually adopted they have moved into i2
and there is no going back it's gonna be
like that
okay how to be billing error as soon as
I am a billionaire I'll surely shear
I'll surely share with that for
$1,000,000 I can share now because I
have actually heard that much and
throughout in life that as of now but
for a billion I haven't reached there
okay okay so somebody says shall I
follow some bleep my theory for
motivation surely I'm not aware about I
have seen his couple of videos on
YouTube they are pretty good they ever
you get the motivation you don't need to
follow constantly to anybody to me or to
Cindy for anybody once you get the
motivation start working on it
just watching like tons of videos and
motivations are not gonna do anything
productive once you've got motivation
from anybody or from anywhere that's it
start working on something I need to
just a day and night keep watching those
videos of motivation they're not gonna
do anything like that no it's not like
that I'm against and they've my video of
me or anybody else the whole goal of
motivation somebody is to get you
started and working on some project and
as soon as as long as you are done with
that I think the purpose is solved okay
is math concept is important for deep
learning yes and you absolutely need to
be amazing
good in math for machine learning as
well as in deep learning these are the
couple of domains in the IT industry
which requires you to have amazing
knowledge of math including all those
like Fourier transform Bayes theorem and
all those amazing a probability stuff
that you might have studied in your 12th
standard it requires a high knowledge of
that genius book in the next giveaway I
do already have a JavaScript course so
you can check that out but yes more
books will be coming up in the future
giveaway kind of thing okay more
questions let's pick them up ah
which is your favorite series favorite
series I have many favorite series
all-time favorite is friends I do love
to watch them and apart from friends
recently I like scorpion that was really
a good series the prison break is one of
my favorite series of all time I loved
it
there are many others as well okay let's
pick up more question with react GS
Redux or flux Redux Redux okay more
questions are you good at machine
machine language machine language okay
which one is that machine language not
to troll anybody here okay so somebody
talked a little bit about Spanish I
don't know where it went
what press it is not coming regularly
yes it's a side series on YouTube the
main series is actually usually on learn
code online yes it will be coming up I
am having so much of the travel you
can't even imagine that we're definitely
where did you learn programming did you
also paid for courses or free from
Google no I did paid heavily on a lot of
courses and offline in online buying
books I I spent a lot of money that and
I'm glad I did that otherwise it would
have taken a lot more to learn
programming as well as the video stuff

like to pay high - happy Sunday thank
you so much happy Sunday to you company
as well

bootstrap it's a exactly original
bootstrap one-twentieth like from me

somebody is enjoying the content that
I'm producing there and yes now we are a
family almost a family of 100k
subscribers we are moving to final that
10k slot where we have movie yes more
videos will be coming up that means I
have more responsibilities on this
channel and I would be producing more
content I would get more much more
serious
I'll try there to be there 250 like
thank you sir mr. Kumar there how do you
get your first freelancing order based
on projects everybody will ask you that
hey show us some of your project and
then only will be giving us so prepared
a lot of projects ok what am i doing
right now I'm preparing some of the
projects in Java so that I can share in
Java boot camps I cannot share more
information about it but yes I am
preparing some Java projects so that I
can share you with that in Java boot
camp it will be coming up just to give
you some inside hints these are some
awesome games 100k only 10 days left sir
I am looking forward 100k that's a big
number we are gonna hit that very soon
hey Nitish Kumar please don't ask these
kinds of questions on public platform
it's not good
come on how can you ask these kinds of
questions
okay so let's pick up more question I
like Prison Break - ah we share same
interest it's amazing CDs and you know
the tattoo stuff is there
the prison break as well so I loved it I
loved these tattoos as well
Vanek oh thank you how to learn multiple
programming language at once I got
confused with syntax when I switched
back and forth between languages I would
say at the first beginning few days once
you have completed like 10 or 12
projects stick with only human language
at that moment of time eventually when
you'll be moving on to more projects and
more languages it would be much more
easier but before that
no no it's not no no it's completely and
no no until unless you have it ten or
twelve projects today what is the next
big technology I think right now we are
into the video ages at least if you ask
me for the education purposes right now
it's hitting big onto the videos the
future will be online boot camps I have
hosted couple of boot camps online in
the past as well I think in the future
the online boot camps are going to be a
big thing in the education industry at
least why Redux Redux is actually much
more awesome than flux or anything that
you see the one thing that I like the
concept about the Redux is its store and
store manager their amazing concept and
when this then the project actually
scales up quite a lot react and redux
actually syncs up quite easily and quite
nicely I do have a video on redux I'm
not sure if you have watched it or not
that's a very basic video explaining the
code inside details about pee ducts
so go ahead watch that it's it's amazing
and when your app actually scales up
Redux is actually much more better some
tips on that go come on just it just
keeps on going like that
can we directly start with html5 without
learning HTML html5 is just like an
additional layer on HTML there are just
some more tags that you need to learn
about in html5 so I would say start with
basic HTML it would be really good but
of course you can start directly with
html5 but I would say start with HTML it
would give you some more basic ground to
cover up it is say my name your name is
not there it just say
crazy coder a one zero one zero one hey
that's your name
okay mobile or web I would say if there
is a complete beginner I would say start
with web because with the web you get a
lot of details about CSS how things look
good the buttons and the craft work and
all these amazing details but yes
anybody can start directly with mobile
as well okay I'm watching Harry Potter
pipe part 5 you watch sir yes I have
watched all parts of Harry Potter most
of them I watched on Amazon I missed a
lot of them and a couple of them I
watched on airplane because there was a
long flight and I had nothing to do
except watching that movie so idea
poster in mycologist ki t Jaipur it's
really a pleasure for me thank you so
much I'm really happy that you catch up
there so yes offline team is working
really nice thank you so much for if you
are seeing all this poster so I think
they are just click a photo and post it
on my Facebook I would be really happy
to see that ok ok
but MacBook Air 45 km is on sale that's
a very good deal very good deal
congratulations pH for your new Apple
device MacBook Air
it's amazing you love that how can i
publish my app in play store take a
license $30 or $25 I'm not sure about it
just like $25 $30 pack your code and
just publish it it's not a big deal
probably I'll make a video on that as
well let's pick up more question is data
structure so much important yes of
course data structure is very very
important whether you're learning C C++
Java Python whatever the language is
data structure is important ok do you
know Hindi language yes of course I do
know Hindi language I can speak it very
fluently no problem there but since a
lot of my crowd is from southern part of
the country and from abroad as well
they prefer me to speak in English just
those a big community who asked me to
just start this everything in channel in
English that's what that's why I
actually always speak in English at
least in in the YouTube stuff okay why
did you stop pen testing no it's not
starved it's it's not at all starved
it's it's there and more courses are
coming up on that okay data mining or AI
I would say data mining because data
mining is another word or an old word
for machine learning so I would say data
mining how to build dynamic website you
can use PHP or node.js for that okay I
have five MacBook Pro for 200k okay
that's I don't know why you paid to pick
a for a MacBook but that's okay if you
have already got it then all I can say
is congratulation
what is Redax it's not raining it's
Redux it's an advanced part of
programming I don't think so you are
ready for that right now
so start with JavaScript I would say to
you okay how much shopping good for
clothing I'm not here to advise you
shopping stuff there are lots of other
good channel who are doing really good
in advising you to buy phones or
clothing so I think you should watch
them fish are you a real person or a VR
bot I have to think about it what do you
think we need to cut my secret that I am
a VR bot why don't you introduce more
free courses we are looking forward for
more free courses as soon as we get some
people who can work for us for free we
will be introducing free courses as of
now things are getting costly here
because all the things that you see here
cameras and Macs and all these internet
bills do cost us a little bit so that's
why we are charging a little bit price
to maintain and keep running all these
costs but again if we can hire some
people who can work for free for us more
free courses will
coming up very soon okay let's pick up
more questions okay what do you think
about Bucky Roberts he has an amazing
channel on YouTube Bucky Roberts but all
I can say his videos are a little bit
like basics onto stuff not on to it was
detailed like making a project and stuff
all he tell is introducing of basic
stuff on to that and again our videos
are not that much polished it goes for
big-name I'm not saying it's bad but yes
I would say more polishing could have
been done there I'm not criticizing
anybody I'm just saying what I think
what's what is your apps name my half
name is on the Android Play Store is
learned code online you'll see in there
my command 8 invisible I guess hey -

able to understand it there okay so I
think we can end up this because

they are going very slowly so you can
hit the like button I need to go back to
