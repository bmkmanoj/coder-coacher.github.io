I'm back again with another video so
what we'll be doing today so as you know
I've started a sketch mini-series on the
YouTube and we're gonna learn a lot of
things about the sketch by doing some of
the projects and basically I'm a
developer and from last 8 or 9 months
since I bought the sketch I'm doing all
of my design works by my own and I do
need two icons for the next project and
that's one gun one is gonna be simply
the Settings icon that I don't want to
borrow from anywhere I just want to
create my own and I need a computer I
can as well so we'll be designing both
of them here in this movie in case you
don't have a sketch you can download a
trial version for them and we are going
to be working on it and let's just start
it out here and file and we are gonna
create a new Finder window now I'm not
looking for the finder window I'm
looking for the sketch come on
sketch there we go new document yes
there we go nice let's move on to the
full-screen mode and by the way I have
included a link in the description for
the entire sketch course it's actually a
iOS course and I have included a full
two or three hours of the content from
the basics to designing full-fledged
screens mobile screens and something and
I have included that entire course with
my iOS course so in case you want to
learn the sketch you can just go through
with that section I could have made that
a separate course but I think it's good
to come along with a iOS course okay
so let's create an artboard and I'm
gonna go with the YouTube size we don't
need anything big so it's a thumbnail
size I have actually kept it as pre
settings in my sketch now let's go that
and designing the apps or the settings
icon is one of the easiest thing that
you can do in this sketch so let's just
try that I'm gonna press o for the oval
and there are not much of the shortcuts
in the sketch just like the Photoshop
they are just some of them and
eventually by learning you you realize a
lot of them so I'm gonna go with let's
just say I'll press my shift key and
shift is always to get a square or a
circle from the oval and just like that
so I'm gonna go for this much big and I
think 220 by 220 looks
good there we go I don't like the
boarders and I'm gonna fill it with
something different color I think
yep that's that's gonna work for me a
sharp read settings I can now not that's
not good I'll go for something greenish
yeah that's that's much better
and now I'm gonna press R to get a
rectangle and I'm gonna get a rectangle
just like that and I think this is
enough this is there we go
and this looks good this looks good
pretty good to me
let's just zoom there now it's look good
and I like to remove the borders and one
more thing I would like to do is double
click on this guy and I would like to
expand the topmost part here and here as
well a little bit so that it looks a
little bit like the Settings icon and
yet that that is good actually you can
any you can double click anywhere and
can move into the vector mode and can
change the settings off anything so and
I'm gonna fill it with a little bit
different color of the green I think
this this would look also good just
exactly the same color now I would like
to select this click on the rotate
copies now in case your rotate copy is
not there right click there customize
the toolbar and there are a lot of
things here just search and look for the
rotate copies there we go drag and drop
it here and that's it that's pretty much
it pretty simple thing you know and how
many now we are gonna use the rotate
copies so we'll be rotating this
rectangle and making this making copies
of it and I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8
copies would be good so I'm gonna write
7 here so that it says you will have 8
layers in total and there we go looks
nice
not much but I'm gonna drag and drop
this and there we go and I think it
looks good yep there we go I can have
these I can select both of them press
shift and and I'm gonna drag it a little
bit and I think this looks good I can
work with that okay and I'm gonna select
both of these guys and I'm how about
clicking on the Union
yep that's a combine shape now now the
beauty of the combined shape is I can
give some shadows in that so I'm gonna
give it some shadows like that and I
would like to enter one more point there
this could be a little bit sharper
shadow just like that so that it gives a
shiny tinge and this guy is again gonna
be a little bit darker and the topmost
guy is gonna be just like the dark okay
it looks looks like a shiny shadow to me
and I'm gonna press command one and
there we go now we're setting Seiken
looks pretty good pretty damn good and
not one thing that you need to
understand while designing the sketch
you don't ever do this when you have
combined shape and these things if
you'll drag it drop this in this case
it's working good but sometimes these
things doesn't really scale up just like
that
it is working because we have clicked on
the union otherwise one of the great
ways select this and use the scaling
option so you want to scale it a little
bit like I want it to be 75% so there we
go now it's it's looking much good I
know the color scheme is not what you
might be thinking but it's actually good
for my project that has a greenish color
scheme so this is the setting I can we
have just created in in a part time
around two minutes or so and now let's
create one more icon that I need and
it's a computer icon so we are going to
work on that so how we are gonna do with
the computer I can so that's gonna be a
little bit tricky but let's just do that
so I'm gonna put our and in case you
have played with the paint in the early
days it's gonna be pretty simple so
we're gonna have a just two rectangle
just like that and I'm gonna make a
rounded corners of that because rounded
corners do look cool so there we go
and I think this is gonna look cool for
20 yep that's that's nice let's remove
the border I don't like the borders in
that and this is cool so far now the
next thing that we need here is let's
just adjust the colors first of all so
I'm gonna go again with a greenish tinge
this is not the green I'm looking for
let's just say I'm gonna go with this
one okay that's nice now I need another
rectangle here and let's just say our
four rectangle
and I'm gonna go and not the rectangle
let's just go for an L for the line I'm
gonna go for the line press the shift
key and it's gonna make a good line
there and let's just increase the
thickness of this line and we're gonna
adjust the things in a minute I'm gonna
go with a whitish line there we go looks
nice and there we go
selected that let's just zoom it vein
and I think it can go one pixel there
and we you don't have to worry much
about it okay looks good let's just go
back there and now I need ovals so Oh
for the oil and I'm gonna press option
and shift this time and I'm gonna get an
oval there we go look looks great 28 by
28 no borders color is gonna be the
white okay and you might be looking
there where we are going with this
computer I can this is good and now
let's go for the are a rectangle we need
a rectangle and I think this rectangle
is gonna go I think this this is enough
let's remove the borders and there we go
looks nice already and that's just Joe
meter there I'm going to double click to
move into the vector mode and I want to
do a couple of things here and I just
want to put a point there and I want to
move it a little bit just like that
and there we go I would like to move
this and scale this a little bit
according to that and there we go just
that much and I think we can have one
more point there to don't to make it
look good and yep that's looking nice
you can see we are moving moving and we
are happy with that let's just go with L
for one more line and there we go nice
and subtle and I think we can just go a
little bit we can actually mark points
from here but I think it's we are not
going into that much of the depth as of
now and I'm gonna go with that and just
to shine it a little bit I'm gonna go
with a shade an tinge of the green maybe
we can just put everything into the
green how about that how does that look
and I don't think so it looks good and I
think I'm gonna go with this shade this
looks nice and I'm gonna go for the
black this guy not the full dark black
but a little bit shade of that yep that
looks good to me let's just see what we
have done in couple of minutes and you
know what I would like to shift it just
there and yep I'm gonna go it a little
bit top and yep that is a computer icon
but I'm not completely happy with this
computer I can yet it looks like a
computer but I'm gonna add a couple of
more flavors or tinge to it so let's
just go that and I'm gonna go with the L
and I'm gonna go with some lines here so
there we go line and I'm gonna put you
there shift key and there we go let's
just select this line and increase the
thickness a little bit and I think the
color can be white nope it should be
just like that yep a tinge of the red
and gray and we need to duplicate that
so command C command V and now we can
drag it a little bit and command C
command V and there we go and I'm gonna
just change it like that we need to make
them all in the one line and this guy
will be going there and I think now it's
looking good and you know what I'm not
happy with the thickness of this I'll
make it just like that seven now we have
and see how quickly we have done all of
these things this is why I love the
sketch although if you are a coder
designer or anything it makes you I know
these icons not are not the best in the
world but I just came up with a quick
with my creativity on the go I didn't
thought much about it I was just
creating this with the video on the go
and I came up with a computer icon which
is my own nobody's gonna yell at me for
the copyrights and such stuff I don't
have to buy anything and I'm creating my
own stuff that is so much cool and
nowadays you can just create such icons
and put them into iOS apps they are
allowing the stickers and everything so
it's the whole mind of the creativity
lying in front of you and I'll be
creating all of these icons whenever I
I'll need that I can I'll make a video
of that so that we can have some more
videos on such good stuff okay
I hope you liked it and one more thing
that we would like to do now is select
all of these guys and command G to group
them and command R to rename it and I'll
call it as computer and there we go and
I can select that and command G to group
it why am i grouping it I'll show you in
a second and command R to call it as
settings there we go now the benefit of
grouping all these things in one I can
select this one and I can make it
exportable click on that and I can
export it in pretty much any size and
export computer and it's gonna export on
my desktop save that and there we go now
we have a desktop settings I can let me
show you how does that look and there we
go it has actually mixed with the
background off of this guy but again
it's nice to have this we can change it
anytime you might be seeing a little bit
bar there and in case not let me zoom it
you can see there it is there but the
background of the preview is grayish as
well so that's why we are not seeing it
but again within just a second we have
created an icon we have exported that
and we have learned the cool stuffs
about the sketch how about that so in
