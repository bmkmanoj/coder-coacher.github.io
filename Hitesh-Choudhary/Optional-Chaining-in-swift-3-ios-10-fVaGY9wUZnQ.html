here so you might have noticed I'm
working on iOS quite a day quite
nowadays and a lot of people are asking
me question on the iOS dating from the
boot camps and from some of the
teammates as well so and one of the most
thing that you might have also noticed
is the change in the YouTube scenario I
used to work on the cameras and back
lights and everything but I think this
is much more fast and quicker for me
saves a lot of time so without wasting
any more time let's get back on to
today's topic so a lot of people dropped
me in the comments and in the mail that
they want to learn about the optionals
in the Swift and yes I do agree it's a
little bit confusing at the first but
it's really the marvelous thing that
Swift could have introduced now why is
the optional chaining what is the
optional chaining the optional is in
fact and the forced unwrapping of course
so we're going to talk about all of them
so let's get started so where's my Xcode
I need to find that and we're gonna
create a new playground
let's move it here on the screen my
playground I think I would like to
change it to my optionals there we go
and platform
no worries about aureus or anything and
let's just create that okay looks good
looks good pretty good actually
okay so there we go and we got a valve
our sports drawstring and if I just get
STR is it going to take time or is it
going to just spring printed command Z
and it's taking time because we have
import UI kit we don't need it we may
need it later run but not right now
so what is this optional chaining okay
now let's try to understand the scenario
now let's say I'm working on an app and
that app takes an input let's just say a
simple to-do list it's always a great
example to work out with so let's just
say it's a simple to-do list and when
you tap on a table view you are taken to
a new segue or new screen and in that
screen you got a simple text field and a
button so you enter some text into the
text field and you just press the button
and you just save everything into the
table view
said really simple what could have gone
wrong in that easy scenario a lot of
things maybe the user is not filling
anything and just pressing the tab Add
button what in that case your app is
shortly going to crash in the swift if
you have not taken care that what
happens when the user is not filling
anything or maybe you have disabled the
button until anyone just write something
into it but let's just say somebody has
just clicked on that made the button
activated and then it's it's gone so
nothing is there so in order to get rid
of these kinds of problem Sifton is
swift has introduced a great option out
there known as optional so optional can
be an INT can be optional classes can be
optional double can be optional
even the boolean's can be optional so
anything can be optional so how does it
look so let's just see how we can work
out with that so if I delete this let's
just say I have a token let's just say
call a token and that token is of type
int and I assign a value of 4 to it no
big deal it's good and if I just get a
value of token it gives me a value of
token no big deal but I can actually
make it an optional by putting a
question mark out there now question
mark simply stands for this value is
optional out there means it simply says
it can be there or it cannot be there
it's going to be an optional so let's
just say right now the value is 4 so
that's what giving us the 4 if I just
remove this now notice what happens it
just says nil because there can be two
possibilities the value can be nil value
can have some or the variable can have a
nil or can have a value as simple as it
sounds now let me just show you one more
thing let's just use a print statement
out there and let's just call this token
now when I print this notice it says me
nil but we can do one more thing let's
just assign a value 5 here and I need to
make a space looks good looks good now
notice when I say it's print and give it
a 5 it says hey it's
not just int it's an optional int so it
will produce an optional int as well and
notice here it says that it's an
optional five okay now how could you
have actually gone ahead and taken care
of this optional one way which is bad
way very bad actually is just the force
unwrapping now force and wrapping is
done by an exclamation sign it simply
says I am pretty sure the value is going
to be there don't you care about
anything it's really a bad situation now
although it has solved our problem but
it's a bad idea very bad in fact any
medium-level I use developer would say
this is a bad way this is how you write
the bad code okay so how we can deal up
with that so let's just comment this out
of command data out and we want to
handle that now we can handle that in a
multiple ways so let's just say one of
them is like something like this now I'm
saying if token is not equals to nil
then you simply just print out and
simply say is let's just say token but
again it's going to give us an option
but now here we can say an exclamation
now we are pretty sure that the value is
not nil the value is there so this code
is not going to broke any time soon and
even if I just delete this value now
this doesn't any break anything but let
me just comment this for a moment and
bring that bad code again and notice
it's going to give us an adder which is
kind of a freezing of an app in fact bad
code so we are forcing it to unwrap the
value and the value is not there so this
is a bad idea okay but this time we are
checking it strictly that if the value
is not nil then only do the Force
unwrapping so this is a good idea this
is a good code but we have a much better
solution out there which is already
given so let's just run out with that
now this is known as some kind of
optional chaining and what you do is you
simply get a constant and you simply say
if let now simply just get
a new token let's just call it as new
token and I'm just going to assign it
token and then I'm gonna say print new
token so why so much things out there is
being going on now this code is known as
optional chaining now you're assigning a
new constant a new constant is going to
have a value of choken now this code is
only going to run if there is a value in
your token or in this case your optional
and if there is there will be no value
if there is nail out there it's not
going to work as simple as it sounds and
if I give it a value of maybe five
that's wrong yes this is good so if I
give that notice both of our codes are
working so this can work but you will
see rarely this nobody use that because
there is an optional chaining out there
so this is a good code and this is a bad
code for some wrapping try to just say
that whenever you are getting an
optional just force and wrapping is the
least or the last option that I'll
choose but I would always like to go
with a flat yes there are situations
where you need to do some kind of force
and wrapping without checking if let a
great example would be when you get a
navigation controller out there and you
want to pop back one state one stage
back onto the navigation controller
remember what you write you write a pop
of view controller so in that case you
are getting an optional but you force
and wrap that no problem in that because
we are pretty sure we can go one step
back okay so that's one thing now again
let me move into a little bit deep out
there in the class as an object-oriented
and talk a little bit more about in case
you are done or happy with that just
tons of the videos on the YouTube you
can get rid of that now but let's go
into one more step deep so let's define
a class and I'm going to be using a
typical documentation example don't yell
at me on that so let's just have a class
and let's just call this a class person
there we go so it's a pretty good class
personal and let's define a property out
there and uncle it as raised for
residents and this is of type res and
which is an optional now where is this
rest coming from
is going to come from a new class I'm
going to define it in a moment so class
let's call this as R s and inside that
we are going to define one more property
and I'm going to call it as number of
rooms and it's going to have a value of
five that's a pretty good obvious
example but there is a lot of thing that
is happening out here now do notice when
I do something like this
let's just say I'm declaring a man and
man is going to be a an object of type
person so there we go
person looks good now a ton of thing can
go wrong here what it can be now you are
declaring an object of this class which
is having a property of res and res is
again dependent on number of rooms so if
you want to get access of number of
rooms you might be thinking hey I can
easily get that value by five no problem
at all but there are a lot of things
that can go wrong let me just show you
one of them so let's just say let's
trigger a runtime error first of all so
let's just say I'm just getting a room
count and that is going to come up from
each level of hierarchy of the classes
so how we can do that so let's just say
man is going to first access the rez
that is there there we go and now it's
going to access a club a property out
there that says number of rooms notice a
question mark has been given and it's
going to create a lot of problems now a
lot of you what they will try to do is
simply force unwrapping simply say hey
I'm pretty sure number of rooms is there
and I'm gonna say like this and boom you
got an error out there this is what it
goes wrong so sometimes classes returns
you in optional and classes are
dependent on furthermore classes and
things can go wrong now always and
always a good idea whenever even
whenever you see this question mark if
that is the best thing that can get you
out of the situation so what we can do
here I can simply say if let
room count and then I'm gonna do
something like this and then moving out
there in the if block and I can simply
print let's just say now let's just get
a room count so let's just say room
count okay now do notice that this code
actually doesn't run but it doesn't fail
it even I either failing is the worst
case scenario and we have just got rid
of the situation although this is being
defined but this is creating a problem
so now if that actually solves a problem
and saves us from the crash out there
now we could have done a tons of things
to get rid of this problem
in fact we could have just created an
object of man let me just duplicate that
or we could have just changed its the
class res there we go and we could have
actually run that easily out there
obviously we don't need this now and man
is gonna directly have a number of rooms
oops did I did us something bad here yep
I did something mistake and what I can
do is let's get rid of this now let's
just say man dot number of rooms and
there we go we are still getting a
problem let's just fix that what is the
problem
initializer for a conditional binding
must have an optional type not int okay
I'm getting because option chaining is
actually being relied this kind of
things relied on a lot of things so let
me get rid of this fix that there we go
and let's fix this okay nothing's that
good okay now this is a good way because
this time the object is being created
directly from the res class but if your
object is from the person class it has
to go in the F and let okay now let's
summarize the things because I know some
things might have gone beyond your head
but let's just try that
whenever you see a question mark that is
an optional whenever you see an
exclamation that is force unwrapping
optional simply says you can have a
value or may not the force and wrapping
says
I'm pretty sure there is a value just do
what I'm saying I'm really not worried
about the crashes not the errors they're
easier value just go ahead and do that
this can be little bit tricky situation
so always try to get an F let which is
known as optional chaining scenario I've
also given you a detail example about
the classes that one class is just plain
old simple class but it can be dependent
on other classes which may be optional
and can get us in the trouble so this is
pretty good and I think pretty detailed
in the optional scenario pretty happy
yes we are so let's go that and in case
you like subscribe to the channel and
don't forget to like the videos and
comment down in the bell of which more
videos should I create in details or I
should make an app or should I explain
core data whatever you would like I will
do that as you say bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
