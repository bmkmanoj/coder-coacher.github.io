JavaScript course and let's review first
of all what we have learned so far now
so far the journey has been amazing and
let me just remind you quickly that now
we are able to figure out how we can
select any element which is like peeta
egg or etch tag or something like that
also we have seen that how we can add a
listener onto some events like click of
a button double click or stuff like that
and also we have seen that how we can
take down all these elements and even
can change them now it's time to move
further and first and foremost I would
like to mention this ad event listener
documentation so I'm gonna go on to
Google and I'm gonna say event listener
in JavaScript and of course MDN amazing
resource so we're gonna go do that type
to there okay so let's go here and this
API is really powerful and all you need
to do is you don't need to read all of
it because now you understand it all you
have to do is keep an eye on the
left-hand side here and we can see we
have all these events like double-click
and input key down key press key yep so
I would recommend you highly that you at
least ever have it have a look on this
one yes finally I got it so at least
have a looked at what are these events
and just click on any one of them so
that you can see how these can be used
for example if you're looking for a key
press or key app or key down something
like that if you'll click on that it
gives you information that key down
event is fired when a key is pressed
down notice there a couple of events
linked to it when the keys pressed down
key is being get up and all these things
so you can have it and this is just you
have to say in the strings key press and
then you can just tie up simply an event
listener onto that on kid event simply a
function onto that okay so this is all
good now let's move on to one step
further and now we're gonna walk through
with the forms okay and so far let's
just go ahead and get a form on our
index so click is okay and now what we
want to do just after this paragraph I
want to have a form or a simple input so
I'm gonna say input and there we go
it's a input of type text which is
totally fine we're not worried much
about the name
of now ID we can call it as my form we
can use it to track down this particular
input there can be many input inside of
a page and also I would like to have a
placeholder and I'm gonna say search
here something like that so when I visit
my web page when I do so notice we have
a simple form or an input which says
search here and we want to track down
what are the values inside it as the
user is typing that and also we want to
do something when it is being clicked
and we'll move on to there later on so
right now we want to do something like
which is there on Google of course we
will not be doing exactly like this one
like when I search anything for Google
for example like this and notice Google
is fetching all the values from the
database and based on that it's giving
all these things so somehow this Google
form or this input is able to track down
each and every word that I'm writing in
here okay so we want to do something
like that
okay so let's see how we can do that
okay so first and foremost we need to
track down this form which should be
really easy I'm gonna put a comment
there track input form and track okay
come on track in foot form okay so how
we can track that it should be really
really simple it should be really simple
by saying document dot my favorite query
selector and in this query selector I
would like to put it exactly the ID
which I am looking for my form usually
all the elements are being tried using
these IDs or classes and since it's an
ID I would use a pound sign if it would
be a class I would be using a dot sign
just like in CSS so there we go now I
have selected that and I also know that
I can use an add eventlistener method
but the question is what is this event
when I'm typing on the keyboard of
course we have seen the key press and
key pairs down and all of that now one
of the event which we can use is a
change now in order to have this we need
to go into the documentation and look
for the change event so let's just go
there and I hope it is somewhere there I
think let's just
so let's just see when we can find out
this change and if we can find out okay
little bit hard to find out but let me
just walk you through with the example
directly instead of digging up into
documentation again and once we have
this change of this event listener the
second parameter that it's looking a for
is a callback function of course we can
use our arrow functions or just a simple
function in case you want to use that
and there we go
arrows and there we go so now we are
into this arrow function and I can just
close it down so that we can have it
okay now all we want to do is we simply
want to log the information from this
now obviously whenever we have this
function it has an access to this event
and we have seen previously this event
is a gigantic object which has a lot of
things one of them is event dot target
and dot value now this value actually
holds up the value whatever you are
typing into this form okay so what we
can do is we can go back onto this I can
open up my terminal console clear that
up and notice when I'm typing something
and I'm writing here and I just click
outside then it tracks that so this is
looking at for the change here now I
think this is not serving me the purpose
that I'm looking up for a couple of more
values that you can use instead of the
change is one of them is input look up
as soon as user is getting an input so
I'm gonna clean that up and I can simply
say a B C so this is something which is
being used at the Google and if you dig
down this is exactly what is being used
obviously instead of just targeting that
on to console dot log they are using it
to fetch it onto database and getting
back a query every single time and
showing you some of the most common
results okay so this is how it being it
is being used I spell too many O's in
the Google there we go okay so now that
we have knowledge that how we can target
all these things as well as on the
buttons can we write a simple fun
example code yes we surely should be
writing that so let me just clean all of
that and we're going to design a simple
application inside this
particular element here so what we want
to do here is we want to simply create a
validation form which is being used by
the same exact input and will be also
using this button as well and what we
want to do is somehow restrict the input
that it should only accept the values
between 1 to 20 so that is really a fun
assignment ok and yes we can surely do
that with our existing skills and the
skill that we have learned in this
section so let's go on to this file here
and what I really want to do is create a
new file so I'm gonna be creating a new
file I'm gonna be calling it as
validation dot Jes so that we can have
the stuff in the latest file and instead
of this my script or jeaious I would
like to link that up which is validation
jeaious
rest of the file is totally ok for you
so that you can utilize it later on
right now let's just go ahead and have
it now first thing that I always always
recommend to everybody is to just pop an
alert I know this is annoying but always
make sure that you properly have
connected file video or existing
document and yes finally we have even
the simplest change I always like to do
this whether that's an advanced project
or the smaller one these mistakes are
horrible and we should always avoid them
ok so what we can do here is we can
simply write a function which can do all
such things now there are a variety of
ways how which you can select that and
all of that for this particular case we
actually do need to do that much of this
stuff now this button can have a variety
of attributes that you can pass on one
of them is on click there we go and in
this on click you can pass on any
function that you can write ok and I'm
gonna call this as my validation and
this is a function so that it needs to
be passed on like that ok now these
things how you pass on on clicks
actually changes quite a lot based on
how you're working this is simple
webpage that's fine
in the react and angular in view this
change is drastically everywhere ok
now what is going to do it's going to
look for this my validation function
into this validation file so let's just
go ahead and
sign this function it should be really
really simple so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna say hey this is your
function and the function obviously
should have a name obviously the
function name is gonna be my validation
and there we go and we have to write a
body for this function okay now notice
I'm just writing a function definition
I'm not calling it because the call is
being made by this on click okay I hope
you got that
pretty simple stuff so now this is my
validation and I need a couple of
variables here so I'm gonna call this
simply first of all let and the first
thing that I want to do is find out the
value from this form okay so we're gonna
call this as let my value is gonna be
equal to again simple easy stuff
document dot query selector and I want
to select based on this ID so copy that
go back onto validation and paste that
of course make sure it's an inside a
string and the next thing previously we
were actually finding it based on things
all that stuff but let me tell you there
is a better way of doing it it's not
like I have told you that query selector
is my favorite stuff so you should
always go that we can do that surely no
problem in that but this situation can
be taken down by one of the more easier
way let me show you what is that what I
can do is instead of doing this query
selector remember in one of the video I
told you about get element by ID yes
this makes much more sense here so I'm
gonna just simply say and all of that
and I can simply say dot value and there
we go that's it we have done it we have
stored whatever the value is gonna be
typed inside that and we have stored
that in here okay now here's a quick
assignment make sure you create a
variable my value and use the query
selector to find out the value you can
always reference to this file and store
that into that one can you do that let
me know in the comment section this is
going to be a simple assignment okay so
now that I have a variable which says my
value and has a value from the input
form now the next thing that I want to
do is I want to check if the number is
between 1 and 20 so what I can do is I
can use in
if and else block and I can first and
foremost check for is the value and
number or not we haven't discussed that
much about it but there is an option
which says is NaN and this is actually
to check out whether the things is not a
number or not okay something like that
so we're gonna say and notice it returns
a boolean value that indicates whether a
value is reserved a valine an not n
number so you really want to check that
if it is getting an odd number or
something like that so we're gonna check
for my value there we go okay now we
want to do a couple of things okay
now we are gonna say something like this
let me write the logic first because
it's a little bit hard some time to
write and explain at the same time so
you want to check if my value is
actually less than one and also I want
to check with our condition if my value
is greater than twenty in all of these
cases I simply want to say this is not a
valid input now notice here if I if I
just use any alphabet I want to say hey
this is not valid if I'm using less than
any number I want to say hey this is
also not valid and if I want to say hey
if it is greater than 20 I also want to
say this is not a valid thing so what I
can do is I can simply this time I'm
gonna be simply logging it to console
and I'll give you a simple assignment to
change one of the paragraph to the text
of it okay I hope everybody can do that
and I'm gonna say not a valid input okay
so there we go and in the else case what
we're gonna do is we are gonna log
simply saying this is cool
something like that this input is okay
and don't worry if I have used the
double quotes or single quotes somewhere
I usually prefer the single curves but
somehow I have used double quotes okay
so there we go now let's just save this
and we're gonna set a save on to this
and let's go back here
clean the console and we're gonna tie it
up so as soon as I say a and hit on
click me notice it says my validation is
defined so we haven't defined the my
validation here so let's just see what
we have mistake looks like a simple typo
somewhere so we have this my validation
okay I think it was caps save that and
instead I would like to copy this and
paste that so that we don't have that
kind of error again go back here clean
the screen and let's just say I type a
and click me and it says not a valid
input
I should write not better okay what
happens if I write to zero there and hit
click me not a valid input again we can
see two there and what happens if I
write 30 there and say click me it says
know how to valid input what about 15 or
14 maybe and it says this input is okay
okay so there we go we have quickly
designed a simple application that can
check for validation now here comes your
assignment okay now what I want to do is
somehow select these elements probably
this last paragraph or maybe a paragraph
with some ID okay let's make it simple
select this one the ID one and go ahead
and change this input this inner content
of this paragraph tag with whatever the
console.log that we have printed okay
there should be a simple assignment and
I think everybody should be able to do
it so that's it for this video and I'm
going to catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
