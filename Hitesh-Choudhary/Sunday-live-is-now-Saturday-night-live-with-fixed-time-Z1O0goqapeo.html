again with another video and in this
video we're gonna talk about something
amazing something awesome that happened
in the last year Sunday lives so I have
an amazing update amazing news regarding
Sunday life let's get started before I
talk about this amazing exciting news
about the sunday life let me walk you
through for all those people who are
fairly new to this channel now in the
last year 2017 I started a thing known
as Sunday life where I will come up on
to live on YouTube and you can ask
questions directly to me it was not well
executed in 2017 but in 2018 I do have
better plans for that now I do
understand that in 2017 it was Sunday
live and there was no time fixed for
Sunday live I just popped up showed up
at Sunday any given random time and not
a lot of people could have been
benefitted with that I really do
understand that it was a tough situation
now during the mid of the 2017 it went
so well but during the end or end ish of
2017
I couldn't kept it up because it was so
much pressure from the clients and you
know YouTube doesn't give you that much
of money so that you can just give all
of the time to YouTube but again
regardless of that the client actually
pressurized quite a lot to me that hey
can you focus a little bit more on the
word and I did that and eventually I had
to kill the sunday life it was going
pretty good like a Superman and suddenly
just just just kill that like that and I
didn't liked it but really to be honest
I wanted to always start it back and
what's a good point in starting it at
the very first of the new year so I
thought why not to relaunch this Sunday
life concept and I thought why don't you
get better that fix up a time show up
every single day or whenever the live is
at the perfect time given time and
really it is so hard to just fix a
particular time with your families with
your friends client work a lot of job
profiles and all these stuff that is
going on a lot of is going on so but
regardless of that I think I'm gonna do
this this year so instead of
it is moving on to Saturday and this is
going to be a Saturday night light
so every Saturday at 10 o clock in the
night 10:00 p.m. according to Indian
Standard Time and it is a little bit
flexible like it's not hard rockin 10:00
but of course it's gonna be billet
between 10:00 and 11:00 always I'll try
my best to be showing up at every single
Saturday at 10 o'clock now some of you
might be wondering hey Tish sunday was
so good why you have chosen this
Saturday and I'll give you a couple of
reasons for that the biggest reason why
I didn't choose the Sunday live and
chose the Saturday Night Live instead of
that was the personal preference and yes
I know you don't want to hear about it
but yes this is the reason now on
usually the Sunday my friends usually
show up at my home and we have some
plans and I don't want to be that guy
who just gives excuses every single
Sunday that hey I'm somewhere outside
couldn't made it or just the connection
is bad and all of that I want to be at
my office this awesome office and with
good decent internet connection and want
to show up every single day so Saturday
was the thing that I thought that this
can be really pretty good
the reason number two was Monday offices
and colleges if I would be keeping up
sunday lives at late night Sunday's like
at 11 o'clock or something it would be
really bad for the people who have to go
to offices on Monday and college
students we have to show up on Mondays
early morning lectures and all of that
so I thought why not to go with The
Saturdays I think it is pretty good but
yes there is a couple of drawbacks with
the Saturday a lot of people like to do
parties on Saturday but yes I do admit
that a lot of coders and people like you
and me doesn't like to go out in the
saturday nights and all of that but
still sometimes we go and need not to
worry about because on the next Saturday
allocate show up on the Saturday Night
Live so the whole story short is the
Sunday lives are coming back and now
they are called as Saturday Night Live
and just to give you a little bit idea
about what we'll be doing in those
Saturday night life is talking the stuff
if I look back at 2017 I can realize
that I have helped so many people just
by replying in
email answering a simple question so
many of you were able to launch your
Android apps your iOS app an awesome
website or maybe getting started with
Python or any other programming language
somehow I have helped a lot of you
getting started through my courses or
through my words or just sharing an
advice that I happen to know sometimes
so this all have helped quite a lot to
the student and I want to carry that
further on to the next level and this is
all with the lives that I come up also
recently Facebook contacted me that hey
we're launching something like YouTube
each thing on Facebook so here is our
awesome app specially for creators and
you can use that you can go live with
the Facebook and life is so amazing and
so impactful you should be doing that I
I took their advice and implemented that
on YouTube so instead of going on the
Facebook I would be doing these lives on
YouTube because I found that YouTube is
much more a little bit more creative as
compared to the Facebook and my audience
is on YouTube so i prefer youtube also
one more thing here that if you're
thinking that in these Saturday nights
live I'm gonna open up my editor will be
coding up something on Android iOS or
web this usually doesn't happen but
sometimes may happen usually the chances
are it's not going to happen because I
have realized that going on live with
the coding and all things requires and
really really good internet connection
and I don't have that I should be in
Bangalore or maybe in some European
countries to have that kind of leverage
the place where I live is not so
advanced with internet connections so it
really doesn't happen much often I
prefer going on videos so that you have
uninterrupted session going on so yes
expect them to be a little lower but all
of your problems your questions you can
just ask I don't know each and
everything about every technology but if
I have some experience with little bit
experience with any of that I'll try to
answer that but again please do expect
that I don't know each and everything I
just try my best to search for that ask
me the friends and can show up with some
knowledge about it but hey I'm not a god
I don't know each and every stuff I just
try my best to deliver
I know foo so how you can participate in
those Saturday Night Lights you don't
have to do anything just subscribe to
the channel and show about Saturday at
10:00 p.m. according to Indian Standard
Time and that's it and yes again one
more thing you should be doing is
checking out my Facebook page because
all the information sometimes things
doesn't go just like you have planned
and things may go sideways and for all
those sideways information
I choose Facebook page for providing all
those information so go ahead and join
up my Facebook page as well so that I
can pass on some information to you
that's it it's so simple to join me on
the Saturday Night Live if you think
that these Saturday Night Live's are
super helpful for you go ahead and put
that in the comment section below I read
all of them and also if you think that
these lives should get much more a
little bit more popular do share them on
Facebook as well as on the Twitter and
just tell your friends at college or
maybe at office that hey there is life
going on and we should attend that
that's it oh yes one more thing if you
haven't yet subscribed to my channel
what are you waiting for let's get
started jump on to the channel and we're
gonna do something awesome in this year
2018 is gonna be amazing
subscribe to the channel and I'll catch
