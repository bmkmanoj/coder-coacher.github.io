again with another video in this video
we are featuring an app an app made by a
student the let's talk about what's so
special about this app and what you can
learn from the student who made this app
last time when I did a featuring app
video I got approached by almost 20 to
30 people who have made the app and
thought that this is a channel where I
feature a lot of app and their feature
and probably I can do that for them if
the app is really good but honestly all
of those apps were really crap and they
were basically the companies who were
ready to pay me to feature their app and
if their app would have been good I
probably could have thought about that
but all of the apps were not so good so
I said hey I'm not I'm not able to do a
video for you because I don't think so
your app will be helpful and useful and
what they were offering me was just
money which with the God's grace I'm not
in such a big need as of right now
because what they can pay me is probably
just enough for this length or probably
not enough to buy even a more one more
lens for these kinds of videos coming
back onto the topic we are featuring a
very awesome app in this video now if
you're thinking this app does a whole
lot of things like social media and all
of that
no but the story behind this app is
going to motivate you so stay tuned
let's talk about it
so this is a basic calculator app now I
know a lot of you thinking hey what's so
special about the calculator and
probably there is not so special about
the calculator app it's a bare minimum
basic app which when you Topps taps on a
button adds a number or do simple
arithmetic operation like addition
multiplication division and so forth and
so on what else this user has this
creator of this app has done is adding a
toast message here and there where the
features are missing and has also done
one great thing is addition of matrix
now in case you do remember you have
played quite a lot with the matrix in
all of the programming languages like C
C++ or maybe in Java as well where you
add or multiply these matrixes do you
remember them 3 by 3 matrix and 4 by 4
matrixes and all such awesome things now
what's so interesting about this app
although the functionality is almost
okay I will not call it a basic childís
it's okay a little bit complicated
complications are there for example
moving on intents and all these things
but what I want to say here is is this
guy is motivational because here you can
see that a lot of us and probably you as
well have written probably various
number of times these kinds of matrix
code in the C programming language but
what this student has done here is he
said no I'm not going to keep all of
that code in my file in my laptop I will
take that code and will show to the
users that what I can do I will take
this code and we'll make an app from it
and we'll reach out to the user so that
at least somebody can use it or if
nobody can use it I can check my Android
app on my phone now these kinds of
students are stubborn they cannot take
no and probably they are the best kind
of student because they cannot take note
they are always going to say no matter
what time does it take no matter what
effort does it take I'm going to finish
this up and I'm going to reach to the
end of this project and so it's done by
this student now some of you might be
thinking that hey you might have taught
this in your course and no I don't teach
a calculator app in my course in my
course I teach about the things like
how you can lay out an awesome layout
thing so that they stay intact I teach
about how the button works how the toast
message are are being played how you can
move on from one screen to another
screen how you can pass data from one
screen to another screen no calculator
app at all and probably no course or no
book in the world can can teach you to
make exactly same app what you are
looking up for so what you have to do is
learn those basic bare minimum code
concept of the topic and have to apply
it on your own probably and I'm pretty
sure you will be facing tons of problems
with that and that's okay but what makes
you a better programmer is the thing
that you are not going to take no you're
going to say that hey I'm going to reach
to the end of this goal and I'll make
sure my app reaches to the App Store now
there is cost something to this student
yes of course it costs because when you
pee ready put your app on to the Android
store it does charge you $30 at the
beginning so yes he did made an
investment but is this investment worth
it
yes definitely now a lot of you might be
wondering what is useful of these kinds
of app if I put this on the App Store
these apps are really helpful because a
lot of us are looking up for the jobs
maybe freelancing or getting hired by a
company now few student what they try to
do is look out for the agencies and
Training Institute we just say we
provide assistance in getting hired now
what they usually do is they teach you
how to make good resumes and probably
will recommend you to some companies but
what this student is going to do this is
something amazing he is just going to
write when the companies will say that
hey do you know Android instead of
providing a certificate and relying
basically and coldly on certificate he
will say yes I know it and here's the
link of my app that is on the App Store
so I know how to do how to design an app
as well as I know the struggle to make
sure that your app reaches to the Google
Play Store so if I'm guided by your
senior developers I can assist in your
company in making an awesome product on
which you are already working and we all
know everybody needs these kinds of
people who are really project oriented
who know their stuff instead of relying
on
just a bare minimum certificate yes
definitely you can get hired based on
the certificates as well but end of the
day it's the project it's the code that
you will be writing it's the work that
is on the topmost shelf in every company
so this is student did sent me a mail
early in the morning and said hey I'm
really inspired by a videos and your
videos really helped me to stuck on one
app and make sure that it reaches to the
Google Play Store it would be really
helpful if you can feature this app on
your channel again there is no money
involved in this case this is an
inspiration that I wanted to share with
you if you have made such kind of
awesome app and you have been learning
something from this channel or maybe
from learned code online make sure your
product reaches to me I check out all of
those products and again I cannot
feature all of the products on my
channel otherwise it will become just a
products featuring channel but I try my
best
if there is an inspirational story
behind some of the project if there is
something that's worth sharing I
definitely like to share that on my
channel without any charge now I know
you are also having an awesome app idea
and you want to build that up but you
are probably looking up I'll start it
maybe tomorrow or I'll start it maybe
from Monday or maybe I'll think about it
after finishing up my games of thrones
episode now there is nothing wrong in
watching that series but why are you
just keep thinking about it why don't
you just say I will do it today so take
out your laptop install Android studio
or maybe a text editor if you want to
make a website make sure you start it
right now if you want to make an app
make sure you start it right now let me
know in the comment section below if you
have something in mind that you are
looking up to create in the future or if
you are interested in learning Android
or web application and why you do why do
you really want to learn it I'll be
looking up in the comment section and if
you think that this video was awesome
give it a thumbs up and I'll come up
with more awesome videos at this channel
I'll surely catch you up in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
