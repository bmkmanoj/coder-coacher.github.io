with another video in this video I want
to talk about something specific to the
technical part and specially the coding
part that is MVC Model View controller
and I can understand I can understand
your feeling that you might have watched
a thousands of video might have read a
lot of books about the design pattern
and still you are confused about what is
MVC or Model View controller now I have
also seen those videos and I just cannot
digest the thing that why do people are
just making a presentation and that
whole circle thing and just goes like
that and puts out some of the definition
and nobody understands that now what is
the point of putting a definition from
the book just in front of the people and
people don't get the concept in itself
so in this video I will try my best to
make sure that you understand the
concept of Model View controller as
easily as it is possible now before we
move ahead and talk about what actually
is Model View controller let me let me
walk you through that what basically the
concept is now this is not a new concept
first of all and it is a thing that you
see in your daily life as well I'll
prove that in example just in a moment
and also this is not specific to one
programming language it is a way of how
you organize your code it is not like a
specific thing for Ruby or PHP or for
Java or for Swift it's just a way of how
you organize your code and trust me you
also see this kind of pattern every
single day in your life and I can do a
little bit better job in explaining what
model-view-controller is so let's try
that
so yes you have seen
model-view-controller probably a
hundreds of time in your day-to-day life
now let me try to explain what the
model-view-controller is and where you
see in your daily life so let's just see
that this is you now you go to a
restaurant and let's just assume this
white entire animation kind of thing is
a restaurant and you move on to a
restaurant now what you do at a
restaurant you don't just go to the
kitchen and make a food by yourself
you can do that at your home so what you
wait you just go there and you wait for
a waiter to come on now waiter comes to
you and you just order the food to the
waiter now waiter is not aware who you
are or what you want to have it just
gets that from you now whenever you sell
the waiter that yes I want this the
waiter just gets the order and now
waiter moves to the kitchen now in the
kitchen waiter is not going to prepare
your food the food is prepared by the
cook so let's bring up the cook
now waiter will tell that the cook hey
this is a guy out there and he wants
this kind of food and now cook is the
guy we're going to prepare the food for
you but cook did not prepare the food
magically he needs some ingredients to
cook the food he'll open up the fridge
and we'll put out something legitly you
order an omelet so he'll get the egg
sugar and whatever it needs so let's
bring our fridge as well so now the
fridge is there and cook will cook the
food now cook will finally hand over the
food to the waiter
and probably the cook might hand over a
couple of other foods as well like maybe
a glass of soda or maybe my favorite icy
or omelette that you have ordered now
it's the job of the waiter to move those
food outside the kitchen
now waiter is actually aware that what
kind of foods need to be served to you
and how it should be served so waiters
comes back to you and order and your
order is now served so you might be
wondering hey what this tool is all
about and probably you might have
anything guess that but this is all of
your model-view-controller
let me show you how that works on so
this you guys is actually have you this
waiter guy is actually the controller
and yes you get that right this hood guy
is model in itself and if you haven't
guessed that yes the fridge guy is
actually the data so how about that this
is a cool example and this is kind of a
thing you see every day you have been
going to restaurant every day and they
are following a model-view-controller
objectives throughout the year so this
is basically your model-view-controller
now I can understand you have gone
through with that restaurant example
pretty easily and nicely now you want to
understand how this is applied in the
code now first of all a lot of people
believe that model-view-controller is a
thing for only dotnet or maybe only for
Ruby or maybe hungry for PHP but it's
not it's the design pattern it's the way
how you arrange your code and it's going
to be possible in everywhere you might
want to write an application and PHP
Swift java.net Ruby Python you can just
arrange your code like that now the
whole advantage of this approach is you
can write dumb code and the more the
code is going to be dumb it's going to
be more beneficial what I mean by that
now all I'm trying to say is we are
trying to reduce the dependency of each
code and this file in this file from
each other we want that if some data is
being passed on this file it just it
just process this data it shouldn't be
worried about from where this data is
coming up ROM or there shouldn't be any
dependencies between these codes it just
needs the data fetching the data and
that's it in our example we can see that
our cook is not actually worried about
who is ordering the food is it a male or
female is it a kid or maybe a grandpa he
doesn't really care he just gets the
order and cooks the food and that is
actually a dumb way of separating the
people each other
now this is a basic example and you will
see this kind of thing quite a lot in my
boot camps where I teach iOS or Android
or wherever I does that I always
recommend to use the
model-view-controller approach but let
me give you also an example that this
kind of approach although is good in
most places but in some places it can be
opposite of that like for example if
there is a store which just sells the
popsicles or ice creams it would be
really bad approach if we use
model-view-controller there because
there is just one job to do just bring
up the ice cream from the fridge and
serve it that's it if you use it if you
will use the model-view-controller
approach there it would be overused and
overkill of the resources so at some
point of that time model-view-controller
is not a good approach but in most of
the cases where application is pretty
humongous pretty big then it's a good
idea to use the model-view-controller
approach now although we are not going
into the in depth of what this model
what is new what is controller because
if I will be taking an example
specifically for Android it would be
really not a good thing for iOS if I
will be taking an example directly from
iOS it would not be a good approach for
Android so all I'm doing here is trying
to generalize the thing as much as
possible now one thing I would like to
mention that a lot of people
misunderstood the thing that your model
is not the data again I repeat your
model is not the data the data is
completely separate it needs to be
cooked up so that is what the cook is
doing in our example and in the real
life example your data would be
something fetching up from an API
request or maybe from the firebase or
wherever you guys fetching your data and
your models should be the guy who should
cook up these data should process the
data and finally controller should be
responsible from taking the data
filtering the request and let us say you
have asked for a result of maybe top 10
wonders of the world and there can be
hundreds or hundreds of such wonders of
the world now you are looking only for
the ancient wonder of the world so it's
the job of controller to filter out the
data and just produce that on to the
view and the job of the view is simply
to arrange those data which is being
passed on from the
controller and that's it so this is a
general approach that I tried to show
you in this example and I think this is
going to be one of the best movie on
model-view-controller approach now I
think I think that this video has
cleared a lot of the concept about
models air controller just want to
summarize a game thing this is not a
specific approach for dotnet or PHP or
Java or Swift it's the generalized way
of writing the code it's a generalized
way to separate the data dependencies
and again Model View controller is not
always the good approach in most of the
cases it is but for the small-scale
application it can be sometimes overcook
thing okay
so with this this was the whole idea
about the Model View controller and in
