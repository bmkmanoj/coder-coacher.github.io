three video guide now we are trying to
put up as many videos as possible and in
this video we are going to talk about
the installation of NS 3 now again I
would recommend all of you to go through
with the wiki of the installation of the
industry that is on the NS n amo RG
website and that's really the ideal
website to find any of the problem now
believe me when you start with
installation it's not one of the easiest
tasks to go on with that but if you'll
watch this video I'll make sure that
everything goes smooth and Glide
now what you need to do first of all is
you need to take a look at this command
now at first this command might look a
bit intimidating but it's really not
that much typical it's really simple now
what you will do what we have to do
first of all in order to install and
it's three years we need to install a
couple of sub dependencies and libraries
on which this package is going to build
up smoothly and a lot of Linux user will
not agree with this list because they'll
say that I can work on with dentistry
with much less libraries but that is not
going to happen so first of all there
are lots of people help me first of all
Jean from the Washington University
helped me to figure out what are these
libraries I contacted him through a
research paper and he was really kind
enough to reply me so we figured out a
lot of libraries that are necessary now
a lot of Linux user will disagree from
this list and there is a reason behind
that since you are already a Linux user
Ubuntu user from maybe a couple of month
or more and you have tried to install a
couple of live files like VLC or maybe
Chrome Firefox or such like that so
these files never get installed alone
they also take some dependencies in
libraries and there are high chances
that some of the files from this command
might have actually already being
downloaded onto your system that's the
only reason otherwise you are always
going to require these libraries to
install at least the 3.20 version of NS
tree so that's all about don't just
worried about this command I will try to
make sure that this command is present
at the disk
so that you can simply copy paste this
command on to your Ubuntu but before
that we need to figure out a couple of
things let's try to move on to our
Ubuntu screen so that we can install
this so here we are on to our Ubuntu
screen and first of all what I'll do
I'll move on to my desktop and make sure
that the desktop is in the Cape's
the DS in the Cape's once you are on the
desktop the very first thing is not to
paste the copy paste that script what
you have to do you have to first do a
sudo apt-get update that's the really
really essential thing if your systems
and repositories are not updated you
will not be able to install all of the
libraries from that particular command
so first thing is really to update your
system once you have got updated with
your system what are the next thing that
you need to do the next thing is to
simply copy paste that particular
command now what you have to do you have
to simply copy paste that particular
command and I guess that command should
be in my system somewhere and let me
just check here it is so here is that
command which is on to our system I'll
make sure that this command is out here
now here is again a reminder all of
these libraries combinely
takes in size of around 800 or maybe 900
MB so make sure that you are patient
enough to make sure that these all files
get downloaded onto your system if you
are on a pretty average internet speed
of around maybe 800 kbps or 1 Mbps then
it will take around 2 hours or so ok so
after that once you have installed all
of these libraries then the next step
comes up is to download this an s3
all-in-one package you can simply
download it from their website or you
can get W get anyhow you have to get the
package of tar dot B zip which is an
archive and it's just like a simple
WinRAR here we use the visit too ok so
the next step is to unzip the package so
I'll just use a tar - I'll just use xvf
and then the package name that is NS
all-in-one I'll make sure that
extract properly let's just wait for a
few seconds it's going to take just a
couple of moments to extract all of the
files now the reason why it comes into a
tarball is because of the size if you'll
check out the size of this ns3 folder
it's around 90 MB and the B zip package
is only of 22 or 23 MB so that makes it
really good once you are on to that
folder what you have to do first of all
travel into the ns3 all-in-one dot
package okay one more thing that I'm
missing out here is you should also have
installed a snap tix so what you have to
do sudo apt let me just move on here
sudo apt-get install snapped ik now this
is really one of the charm to use with
the synaptics you should have the
synaptic with you because there are some
libraries which you may need to have
installed with this once you will run
this command it will install the
synaptic for you once the synaptic is
out here you can simply run this command
sudo snapped ik and some time it froms
for a password as well give it the
password and here you can simply type
and install all the packages but again
it's really attired some work so make
sure that you run the command to do all
of the stuff ok all the things so far so
good let's do a quick Alice here is a
bill dot py file which you can simply
run and enable all of the files and all
of these things so before we run all of
such things we make sure that our
examples and test files are enabled to
being build up and in order to do that
there are two requirement one you should
be aware of the command second you
should have a lot of patience so let's
just run this this is build dot py after
that you have to just give - - enable
and you have to enable first of all the
examples so it will compile all of the
examples and I also want to enable the
tests so I'll just write enable tests
that's it you have to run these commands
and make sure you have run the
command the big command that I've shown
you because without that your package
will all do compiled but all the
packages are not going to be compiled so
if you are going to run your very first
script it will prompt your lots of error
and if all the things are compiled
properly then everything should work
really really fine and you can see there
is so far so good all greens working
very fine and you can see all of the
libraries are founding some are still
not found and I'll make sure that I'll
work out on it but will be able to do
all of our stuff with that and now it's
entering into the compilation mode and
you can see here it's compiling 40 out
of 2308 scripts so it is going to work
on for each and every script so make
sure that you keep waiting here until
it's done and we'll check out the next
video for what to do next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
