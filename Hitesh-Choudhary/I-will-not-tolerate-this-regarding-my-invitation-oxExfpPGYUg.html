throat and a bad voice I'm actually not
in a position to record the videos I'm
suffering from a little bit cold a
little bit fever and bad throat but
still I'm up here to address this issue
because there is something which
happened today and it's completely wrong
and this is not gonna be tolerated
anytime in the future as well as now and
forget about the intro line or the
videos where I just roll out the intro
video or to subscribe but let's just
leave that aside for for a minute and
let's address this issue this is
something which is never going to be
tolerated and in the future as well the
strict actions will be taken up okay
against the people who are going to
commit this so in order to explain the
situation I might be wrong here I'm not
saying that I'm perfectly right here I
might be wrong judge me there I leave
this on to you but let me explain you
the situation and scenario of it habits
happen today so as you all know I love
to meet people who are YouTube
subscribers or are just in general
students or programming I always love to
meet them in reality at their tech fest
or maybe developer conference or all of
this and due to that reason I always
accept the invitation of going to those
universities and I actually love meeting
people just there so a lot of people has
sent me invitation a few of them I have
accepted of course I cannot accept all
of them because going out is kind of a
loss for me because I can just sit here
can do my client work record more videos
record more courses but still I take
time and visit a few universities the
reason being I loved that now in the
same situation out of those several
emails I picked up by universities
randomly and I was in the middle of the
talk with one universities I'm gonna not
name the universities as well as the
student here but what this student did
was really bad I didn't expected this to
happen
so I accepted one of that invitation and
we were planning to go at that
University as a guest for my talk it and
the student actually told me that he
wants my talk to be around one hour or
so
and discuss more about programming and
stuff I said okay and we were about to
be discussed on react native there so
and just like always I asked University
to sponsor my travel as well as stay
expenses I usually prefer to just land
there on the early morning and just
leave the place by the night I usually
don't prefer to stay there but again
sometimes things are not that much good
and we have to stay so we were in the
middle of this discussion about
sponsoring my travel and everything and
he said ok it will be done by
universities and everything so it was
going really cool but today in the
morning one of the faculty member from
the university mailed me directly and
told me that hey we are ready to pay you
for your fees but I cannot get the
reason that why are you insisting of the
cash payment I have no idea why you
really want to get the cash and that to
be delivered to the student directly but
if you can accept the cheque that would
be really good now here is the
surprising thing I never charge any fees
for visiting those universities I just
take my travel expenses and maybe
accommodation that's it I have never
charged even a single rupees I have
visited universities in Europe as well a
lot of universities including IITs and
NIT s and quite a lot of them and I have
never charged a single rupees unless and
unless it's a paid workshop that I used
to do a very back like 5 or 6 years ago
but in the recent couple of years I have
never charged a single rupee and I was
really surprised that hey I never asked
for any kind of money for from your
University is apart from travel expenses
so might be that student is looking up
for my travel expenses he said the
faculty from the University says no we
are already sponsoring your tickets your
air flights as well as your
accommodation on top of that you asked
us 20,000 rupees I said no I didn't
charge if I had to charge what I would
be I would be charging you just twenty
thousand rupees for coming to your event
and then he said ok there is something
going on wrong we need to talk on the
call I said yes this needs to be
addressed so we discussed on the call
and I found out that this student
without telling me was taking twenty
thousand rupee
from the universities on my name and
what he told the university guys that
these all celebrities and youtubers they
always take some money and in order to
avoid taxes they just take the cash and
this is really painful and hurtful for
me that somebody is doing such things on
my name this is really bad
so the university said that we are gonna
take strict action against this student
because he tried to fooled us especially
on the monetary matter so probably here
gonna get rusticated here now again I
jumped back into the situation and I
said no this is a too much harsh action
take whatever the action of course I'm
in a not no position to just say you
that do this or do that but yes I'd say
that don't rusticate him just teach him
a good lesson but investigation is such
a big step don't do that
you might spoil his entire career or
anything then the faculty member to just
get a confession out of the student he
hit took the student on to a conference
call and what he said to me was really
really more painful to me here he told
me that hey capiche you look really nice
and kind full on YouTube videos but you
are not even slightly like that you
could have told the university that yes
I need 20 thousand rupees and you could
have given that amount to me now this is
doing an entire massacre on my life and
my life may get over due to this
incident you are nowhere like what you
have been seeing on videos and
everything this was even more painful to
me that instead of realizing his mistake
I'm not saying I'm right here I may be
wrong here I'm nobody to judge there but
this is such a painful incident that
really this need to be addressed somehow
and in order to take precaution of such
things I have actually uploaded on my
website learn code online a direct way
to invite me and I have clearly
mentioned that I don't take any face
it's clearly mentioned there and from
now onwards I will be taking extra care
so that these things really don't get
confused here and and nobody can
actually take such kind of advantage on
my name I usually don't take out these
such kind of issues publicly here but I
was left with no choice and I had to
made it public I'm right now in a no
position to record videos and I'm
suffering from a fever
the throat is completely itchy and bad
but I couldn't stop myself because this
this needs to be directly put up on to
the web so that everybody can see this
and can learn from him or maybe from me
if I'm wrong here but yes I kind of
didn't liked it it's it's painful I'm
little bit angry as well but this is
something and after student told me
these words I completely say to the
universities that hey I'm in a no
position to say you or to take a side of
anybody just do whatever you like
and I'm also cancelling my visit to that
University I really don't want to go
there in the future I may think about it
I'm not pretty sure but this is what
happened and I have no words to explain
that what the situation is the entire
day was being consumed in this nightmare
kind of situation at once the
universities were thinking that hey I am
the one who is just making a mess here
but eventually they found out that
somebody else was culprit here again I I
have no no words about it I really don't
want you to comment or say anything
about this sure if you have some words
share with me share your feelings
whatever you have but this video is not
about sharing or liking or to just hit
subscribe or anything this issue was
there
I have interested publicly and for sure
please just be careful don't do these
kinds of things at least with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
