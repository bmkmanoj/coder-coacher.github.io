react.js training now for all those
people who are already into the course
this is a fun section we are going to
design a single app YouTube app in just
one video I know the video is going to
be a little bit long but we will do it
in just one video now for all those
people who are watching this in YouTube
there is a separate course going on with
a full-fledged ten apps along with the
react basic so go ahead check that out
link is in the description but coming
back on to the point before I move on
there are a couple of points in here
number one point I tried to make this
app alive on the YouTube but streaming
was really bad so I'm uploading a video
for that and this is just a fun app okay
point number two this is going to be a
no editing nugget shot because I'm just
going to be walking you with the
experience of how the programmer phase
errors problems try to debug them in all
of these things okay now a lot of people
are going to complain that why why were
you not prepared in advance and all
these things let me tell you a fact that
when we write the code it's okay to have
problem that's not end of the world
problems will be there what makes you a
programmer is how you are able to handle
that and solve that problem okay so
let's go in here this is our very first
boilerplate code which we have generated
so many times in case you are not aware
of it it's just a the installation part
in here install a node module and NPM
install - G create react app by the way
in case you are new in here make sure
that you install it with the
administrative permissions on Windows
and sudo permissions on a Mac okay and
this command will be installed and
generate a project hello world just like
that I have created YouTube it just
gives you a boilerplate code which looks
like this then you can run on the
terminal
NPM start after going into the folder
and there we go we are ready okay basics
done now let's go in here
now let's delete this guy and we will be
creating a new folder in here new file
basically that will be called as YouTube
dot J s again it's in a convention to
use the uppercase letter there okay and
let's just quickly have import of the
act and we need component as well and
that all will be coming up from Viet
good so far
okay and in case you might have already
installed a snippet that I've given in
the course then things should be breezed
by you so you can simply say our comm
there it's not like that our comm and
there you go you have got a class
boilerplate code there and the next
thing that we'll be doing is meaning our
class which will be calling it as
YouTube it's the convention not
compulsory to just name the class
exactly there but it's good that you
follow up this convention and I'll be
saying I am from YouTube it'll be the
fun way okay and now our job is to
import this file into AB dot yes okay so
how do we do that it's pretty simple you
just call it as import and what you want
to import is YouTube and that will be
coming up from YouTube ok and don't
forget to use a dot slash there
semicolon would be nice as well there we
go and now in order to get this
component what we have to do is call the
component ok you must be proving that by
now so there we go YouTube make sure
it's a self closing tag now by the way
what you are seeing in here is GFX it
might look like an HTML basically it's
HTML but you know technically it's gsx
ok and we should be seeing the stuff on
a react and I made a typo there I made a
typo and it's not form
it's from ok and by the way I forgot to
export the class as well this things
happens no big deal and that's going to
be oops default come on right up to
default YouTube and things should be
good and it says I am from YouTube ok so
quickly we have created a component and
we have called it in here I would call
it a good progress so far let's now move
it ahead and talk about more things ok
now next thing that I want you to do is
go on to YouTube and the search for a
very tough name which is really hard to
spell but this is it
okay and go ahead use any of the video
like for example this is the lie search
and I tried there but again let's just
go and use something like hmm what
should we like to use this cat video is
nice and lovely we are going to use this
okay and I'm going to pause this before
I speak loudly in there and what we want
in here from here is share and embed and
we want this iframe there okay so that
basically what we are trying to do in
this app is we want to make an automated
generated app that fetches the
API of the YouTube and brings up
everything from the YouTube on our page
we will be displaying the top 10 latest
upload on our page we don't need to do
anything manually it is automatically
going to fetch whatever the latest is
being uploaded on our web page okay and
I'll give you few assignments as well so
let's go in here and in my YouTube in
this division
I wanted this iframe to be there save
that and this should be seeing a little
promo there good not bad I would say but
there are a couple of problems and you
might haven't noticed that that's okay
it's completely okay to ignore them at
first now right-click and go on to the
inspect and look into the console you
can see 2 warnings are there now what
are these warnings here let me just show
you it's always good to read the
warnings make sure you read it properly
it says did you mean frameborder did you
mean allow full screen so what it's
saying is that the tags that are using
frameborder and allow screen since it's
not hTML is JSX it has got a little bit
different syntax to be in border is
capital and allow full and screen so f
and s are used in caps save that and
let's clear the console hit the reload
and things are good now a pretty common
mistake and pretty common error to just
just escape there I'll just break the
line with frameborder and allow screen
so that it's it's on just one line it's
not one big line going till hand they're
good we are happy so far by the way I'm
not
as much happy hit the CSS in here I know
we shouldn't be focusing on CSS in here
but hey I cannot be here with this CSS
in here so I would be throwing up some
CSS not much don't worry
and let's use some colors so we will be
using flat UI color calm one of my
favorite website and let's just use this
blue okay we won't be wasting much time
in here so background color would be
this guy save that how does that look
better much much much better I would
call that and the let's give this
division a couple of things and change
that I would like to give this division
a class name this YouTube guy this
division and make sure you also
understand that it's not just the class
there in the CSS class is reserved
keyword so we need to go to the class
name and there we go class name I'll
call this as YouTube division YouTube
class okay let's go into app dot CSS and
define a few rules for YouTube class
okay what we should have now first of
all we should have some border
I think border will be nice let's have
two pixel green i know green is not a
good word i should be using some
hexadecimal but bear with me okay now
let's go ahead and green and that would
be dashed okay
pretty simple border and can you reload
that and it's barely visible if i make
it red will it be visible and the screen
testing it's hard to see these these
models let me make it three pixel and I
think this should be visible not the
best color on the world but since I'm in
here I can choose up some color okay I
think midnight blue would be good let's
just make sure we have some good colors
there better better much better don't
you think so let's add a few things as
well more and let's add a margin of I
think it's already centered but we don't
need margin zero and auto we don't need
it we can work that
I would like to add a margin top there
and 20 pixels would be good I think look
look there we go and yep we are ready to
rock and roll with this guy so our CSS
part is good now what I want you to do
is add a button now obviously I know you
might want to just generate all these
YouTube videos as soon as the component
loads up we will talk about the
lifecycle method maybe some other day in
case you're in case you're in the course
I will give you as an assignment because
you have already studied the component
lifecycle okay it's nothing much just
moving all the files into component did
mount or component will know whatever
you like okay so let's just do one more
thing in here now in the YouTube we want
a button there so where should be this
button be going okay that's that's the
question that's a good question actually
and I think we can just move this button
just there so let's just have a button
close this button and we even say
something like a yet YouTube videos get
YouTube videos save that how does it
look really really bad no big deal and
what I would like to do in here is keep
this button at the top so I would be
adding a new division there just for the
styling purposes no big deal and
division there and that and move this
button at the top there and there we go
now it looks good let's just do a few
properties on the button as well I know
we shouldn't be focusing much number CSS
this is not a CSS class but again with
some of the things it's okay
okay so let's just call the transom
button and what we should do on the
button first of all there should be some
margin and let's just not left margin
come on margin from all the sides should
be 10 pixels how that stuff works pretty
not so good recently okay we should have
some internal padding so that the bottom
looks bigger and padding would be 10 6
220 pixel I think they should be good
let's increase the font size as well 220
pixel just randomly thinking not
thinking much there okay and background
color should be let's just choose let's
just use some good colors okay
and I think this carrot will look good
and there we go save that how does that
look decent decently okay
we won't be focusing let's let's just
not do much in here so now things are
good now what we want to do now comes
the fetching part I know this is a long
video but bear with me so now what we
want to do is mess around with the API
is in here okay so this is the API that
we are working in here let me zoom there
a little bit it's developer google.com
slash YouTube / v3 slash Doc's slash
search I know that's a big one but
that's what we have going back in here
you would also need a API key as well
which you can get by signing up there I
will be giving you my key there
don't just misuse that that just for the
testing purposes and get your own keys
okay and this is kind of an object you
will be receiving in here by the way
there are a lot of other options in here
we are going into the search and
overview this is the object we are
looking for okay you can work on to a
lot of things and if I go in here this
is the entire URL that you get in here
and we'll be breaking down this URL in
here so they just copy this and by the
way I'll be I'll be posting down this
project on to the github as well so that
it becomes good for you now let's just
go back in here and try to break down at
this URL okay so let's just paste that
and paste that I know that's that's a
big massive URL okay so notice closely
there is an API key there which goes
from here to here so this is our API key
notice we do have a channel ID as well I
have already placed my channel ID you
can get any channel ID in here
and then it says and part snippet and I
D order so all these are variables that
you can set up right now we don't need
to and it says max result equals 10 so
we will be breaking it down into a
constants and variables so that if we
want to change out anything we can just
quickly do that or maybe want to add
more components who are responsible for
loading legislate 5 videos 10 videos you
can just give it a counter there okay so
first of all let's break down with API
so this is my API so API would be let's
just cut it down so this make sure you
don't just cut it there it's complete
API and I think it's still a ok and yep
let's just cut that out and paste it in
here ok and next thing that we'll be
doing is channel ID so const channel ID
and I think channel ID this this is good
again we will be making a string out of
that channel ID goes from here till the
end ok let's just cut that out and there
we go channel ID now the last part that
we need is how many results you need ok
so we're going to have cost result and
that should be 10 and we are looking for
this guy max result in here ok 10 now
let's just try to make our own URL there
and we will be making this URL so you'll
love this thing so this is going to be
our final URL and how we are going to
make this is with the backticks
ok and these are template string also
known as template string but these are
much I think it's better way of doing
the things so let's just select this
from the key equals cut that out and
paste it in here now in order when you
want to add some variables or constant
all you have to do is use a dollar sign
and then a pair of parentheses and
inside that you can write API so
basically it's like copy and pasting
this thing in here ok after that we have
got an channel ID equals let's just cut
that
and paste that again and again we need
to insert it available as a dollar and
this guy looks good now let's just copy
channel ID copy that and paste that
you're available okay that is good and
finally the last part this is again
everything is a string till equal cut
that and what we will be doing is paste
that again now again we need to insert a
variable so dollar sign and there we go
and we are looking this time for result
so copy that and let's just paste it
down there I know this is a little bit
off the process not the easiest one but
yes this is a good process now what you
can do you can bring down a channel ID
from the user and can set it into a
variable later on you can just get
instead of ten result the 120 mm get
that so this is a good idea to have that
now also what I'll be doing I'll be
giving you this link again we have just
deleted that and paste that and comment
that when I'm doing it because maybe you
want to do repeat this want to repeat
this process again okay so that is why
I'm giving it this is good now let's
just see if our things are working good
there okay so we'll be doing is let's
just console.log this so I'll go in here
and inside the rendering I want to log
this final URL and save that go back in
here react app let's just see if this
URL that we have made is correct or not
and in the console looks okay if I click
on that it opens up and gives me the
things again so it's always good to
check out things constantly so that
later on you don't have to spend time in
debugging I'll come in that out I don't
like much of the console logs there but
it's okay so now that our URL is good
now what we want to do next step would
be now your URL is completely breaker
and broken down into the things now what
you want to do is fetch the things
from the internet and again this is a
jason in case you didn't get how the
things are looking let me just copy
everything from here and there are a lot
of editors one of my favorite one is
just json editor online in which i can
paste these all things and can click on
this button and it gives me so you can
see in this jason in here is we got an
object inside the object we have got lot
of other options so in the page info not
in the page info in the items we are
getting ten arrays there and inside the
array we are getting ID inside the heidi
we are getting a video ID and this is
the unique ID that we are looking for
when you watch a video this is the
unique ID that we are looking for and
then we'll be creating an URL from it
and we'll be replacing it with this
iframe i know a lot of things we have to
do but let's not get ahead of ourselves
one thing at a time okay so what would
be next step I think the next step would
be to create a constructor that would be
good approach there because then the
things will be coming up from the web
api we don't have any methods such to
just verify how let me just put it in
this way first let me just try to do a
constructor so what I'm saying in here
is this dot state in the react the one
good way of handling the promises or you
don't know when the things are going to
come up from the web it may take up ten
seconds or maybe five second or fraction
of second so one good way of doing is
this is update the state whenever the
data is being coming up and later on do
everything from the state okay so in the
state what we'll be doing is legit
called if as a result YT because it's
coming from YouTube and that is going to
be an array okay if we will need more
variable that's what we have but what I
want to do in here is when the data
comes from a JSON request I want to
store all of that array inside in here
or in fact maybe maybe I'll compose an
entire link and we'll store that into
this Eddie
we may need couple of more variables but
I'm not pretty sure let's not get ahead
of ourself
okay so the problem one problem is
solved where we are going to keep our
data now how we are going to get the
data that is interesting
we could have loaded up things we could
have called a function from component
will mount but I'll give you that as an
assignment right now I want to run a
click method on the button okay so it's
going to say on click and when on click
is being done I'm going to say this dot
clicked if I can type that properly and
next thing that we always like to do in
this case we can just keep it by calling
dot bind in here but I think one good
way of doing this is inside the
constructor so according to the recent
guidelines it's being this is the step
that you always have to do you have to
bind it with this okay that is good now
it's going to throw up an error let me
just show you what the error is and the
react app this is better
the error is shouting because we don't
have any method in here that says click
so let's create one clicked and there we
go and we're going to just log in simply
like clicked save that and let's just
see in the console log if we can grab
that console it's having a problem okay
final URL sign but never used we'll use
it don't worry buddy and it says clicked
okay we are we are making a progress
there I know this is being 21 minutes
but we are making a progress good
progress there okay now let's just try
to write things now let me show you how
you can fetch the data from API now
there are a couple of ways there is one
Axios and X cos come on guy exhales in
react there we go
NPM so this is actually a good way of
handling the ATIS you can just simply
install the Axios and then simply can
import it just like we have imported the
YouTube excuse get and then you can
handle the promise dot then and dot
catch
then says good things comes in here Top
Cat says bad thing goes in here but
there is another way and that is
actually H react GS Docs and it's
actually inside the networking I think
it's inside the react native they have
mentioned it a giant in the react native
in the networking box yep in the network
there we go you might be thinking that
this is a react native code but it works
really great in in this guys so this is
the function that you have to work on
that you get a fetch there then you
simply say dot response there dot jason
then he said dot then respond station
and there you go that's it so why don't
we do one thing we just copy everything
from fetch to this guy and let's just
modify it according to over need okay
make sense and let's just go in here and
paste that everything okay now inside
the fetch we don't want to fetch
anything movies from the Jason so I'll
get rid of this guy we need you and we
are going to use final URL okay that's
good now final the URL response is going
to be responsible Jason this line needs
to be there this is kind of a promise
you are handling and now let's just
remove this line we don't need to return
anything as of now I just log what we
are getting in response Jason I think
this is a good point to test out the
things yep because we are making a call
there okay
and this looks ok let's just see if we
can make some progress and open up our
inspect and come to log and as I click
on this guy there we go
pretty good just in one flow and I know
this is bad something surprising I don't
expect my code to run at the first time
ok there we go we get an entire object
there and I think if I can zoom it out a
little bit and then in the items we get
these kinds of arrays and all of these
things now next goal is inside the items
we want to get into the ID we want to
get video ID
so this is the next stuff okay let's
just do one step at a time so we have
console.log there and this is good so
far
okay now instead of console logging
these things what I would like to do in
is comment this guy and I would be
storing the result into result whitey
state there and again whenever you need
to store anything into the state
variable you don't just do a style YT
equals you do this dot set state very
important okay so we are going to create
a constant there and I'll name it as a
result YT kind of a convention you can
name it anything and we're going to call
response jason dot item okay items by
the way in case you forgot that it's
items let me just show you here there is
the adjacent there we go it's actually
items okay make sure you get that one
mistake and can lead you with a headache
so for two or three us and in the items
since it's an array I would like to use
the map not a empty and map is
responsible for looping through the
things okay
so we're going to do an object there and
this object is not just like that what
we want to do is let's just see if we
can go into each so this is this map is
going to rotate through the entire array
and now this object I can go into each
individual array it will handle things
for me and I can go for dot ID what is
next part I forgot that inside the items
we have to go in each array and go into
ID and we have to get this video ID okay
dot video I guess I was capital yep I
was in the caps ID okay looks good so
far and we want to store this state into
this entire thing into our constructor
this dog state okay so we are going to
save this dot set state okay looks good
and we are going to say result YT now by
the way this is a shorthand in the es6
you could have also done this like this
but i'll just go with a shorter this is
shorter this is cleaner okay now this is
good and also I would like to show
what's there in the result YT so I'll
simply call a log beer and I will be
calling this dot state dot result YT
okay let's see where we are going
it's okay to test out the things quite
often and let us inspect that and go
into log hit this guy okay so we can see
that this time and we are logging we are
getting an array there this array is
having all the IDS there okay and there
we go and in fact we did one mistake
that we are logging it in here we should
be logging it somewhere else
so that we can see actually what's
coming up and let's just cut that from
him here and let's just call this in
here rendering save that and as we login
notice it's an empty right now as I
click on this now it gets filled up so
this is good now it's filling up okay
that critic so you can see automatically
it calls up two times one as soon as the
component loads up and one when the
state is being changed it's a good thing
for us okay making good progress there
but I want to do it one more step ahead
because obviously I can see this ID
where this ID is actually going in the
meantime this ID will go in here in our
this guy so this is what we have to
replace and it would be much better if I
just create the entire link in here and
store that into the array I think that
would be a smarter move but again you
can later on replace that with a
variable just with the ID but I would
like to go with this way okay so on
you have to do okay how we are going to
move that is copied this from embedded
copy that and we are obviously storing
the things into this array with the
single fat arrow function and I'd like
to put a double quotes there paste that
in here add a plus okay
so all I'm doing is not just during the
last ID I'm moving I'm making entire
link with just formatting there and then
storing that let's just save that and
quickly show you that previously it was
this guy and now as I get youtube notice
I'm having a big array there with the
links being made up okay
very quickly we have made up a link and
I think it's good progress okay so now
things are in our final this dot state
and we need to somehow call these things
okay so again map function is going to
be useful for us because it's an array
and we are going to do of the things
like that and I think rest of the code
looks good so far and now let's just see
where we want to do the things I think
we should be doing the things in this
guy okay in order to do these things you
have to use curly braces okay now after
the curly braces we are going to say
this dot state to access the state and
we are going to use result YT so now we
are accessing the era's result YT good
let's just use a map not E&amp;amp;P come on and
again this rotates through the entire
array and you can use two things in here
the one is going to be the links let me
use this guy because these let me just
show you you can use one variable as
well but bear with me just for a second
and there we go now what I am trying to
do in here is that already you can get
everything from the link just like we
have got everything from the object but
there is one more variable that you need
to pass on there there is the eye and
this eye holds the unique index value of
that array and kind of a react just
complains when you don't provide this as
a
value okay let me just don't get ahead
of ourselves we will talk about that
later on okay and now let's just log if
we can log the links okay link and there
we go
and will it be working and will it be
working no because we are not calling it
in here
okay that is good that is okay and what
I want to do is now this is good this is
fine I want to create a variable there
and what we can do is let's just call
this s war frame okay call it anything
and inside this okay what I want to do
okay now it would be good if I just move
this because otherwise everything will
merge out in just one division so let me
move this off my code outside this
division now it's better and now this
frame will have an iframe so I'll cut
this out oops command Z I need all of it
and in fact I can just remove these line
breaks that I've made their frame border
is good I wanted all of this in one line
and there we go looks good now I can
just cut that out and can assign it to
my variable now only thing that I'll be
doing in here oops
and let me just
let me just cut that out as well I know
there is a little bit formatting going
on but be here with me so all I want to
do is now I do have an access of this
link so I'll be replacing this SRC guy
with my available link okay so how I can
do that is really simple I have to
delete this and I have to use curly
braces and I have to call it link okay
looks good so far and now what I want to
do is I want to get this YouTube
Division as well so I'll cut this out so
in every loop I am producing a new
division now okay I hope you get that
pretty easy cut that it's all about
formatting there so what I'm doing
whenever the loop just generates there
I'm I'm generating a new division there
I could have generated just a frame
frame frame there but it would be inside
a giant division and they would be messy
and clumsy NIT when I create an entire
division since the division is a block
level element and it's going to be
simply doing a block block block there
okay so I'm throwing out a frame there
now the only thing that I have to do and
a lot of people just mess around with
there let me just do this error first of
all because I know a lot of you might be
spending a lot of time in here with this
error and you might be thinking hey
frame is now ready all you have to do is
use this guy and simply say this dot
frame so we are just printing out our
variable and since our variable is
holding everything it should be working
now let me show you a quick magic there
and by the way the thing I was talking
about it complains in here as you reload
a lot of complaints are there that frame
is assigned but values never used and
expected to return a value and function
all this let me just show you what it
means and first of all it's inside where
should I put it inside the frame
actually this is the guy key I was
talking about just kind of a formatting
that you have to do this I needs to go
in here otherwise it just shouts okay
and you can see as you click on the get
YouTube nothing happens in here although
your things are loading up your links
are displayed with nothing is this is
because this map function needs to
return something okay
now here we are not returning anything
because we don't need to we just want to
set the state and that's it we have done
otherwise most of the time when you want
to throw it as some values you need to
use return so use return and just throw
it back
save that ok let's just see get YouTube
videos and there we go other videos are
popping up ok we do have some problems
and eachother fan arrays in a traitor
should have a unique key c'mon I have
give you a unique key what we want and
in Div YouTube okay you want that into
the diff I think so let's just cut that
out and paste it inside the division you
want a division you get it in division
and let's clear that if it is happy
looks happy looks happy and there we go
let's just have a final look I know this
is being all over a 30 minute video but
hey we are making a progress and we have
we have created a pretty damn cool app
and there we go now if I reload and this
guy doesn't do anything when I click on
that it runs my function there and call
up the latest 10 videos in here now let
me show you why we have done an extra
step in the URL let's just say you you
said hey I don't need 10 10 is too big I
just need five you can just call it a 5
there you just click there and you get
only 5 videos ok so that's an advantage
maybe later on you want that I want to
create another component from which I
can get the value that how many videos
user need there and I want to assign a
value there and obviously now the
control is in the users hand and he can
actually decide whether he wants to go
you want some another channel ID there
go ahead put their channel ID I would
recommend my channel ID by the way but
again if you need any other channel ID
you can just go in there you want let us
say 20 hi no problem at all it's going
to fetch you too many videos within no
time and there we go there we go a lot
of videos nice awesome videos that
teaches you a lot very active on your
YouTube guys ok
and I think this is it for this and
obviously we can move it ahead but let
me give you a few assignments as well
whether are you you are on the YouTube
or maybe inside the course wherever you
are I would love to give you assignment
and please let me show me what you have
got in the assignment okay now your job
is really simple so far we have been
running this entire code with a click of
a button now I want you to modify this
entire project in somehow and manner
that we don't need to click any values
as soon as the component loads up on the
screen these all values should be
fetched up ok hint you will need a
component life cycle method ok and just
remove this button we want everything to
be automatic that's assignment number
one now assignment number two is really
simple as well now as soon as you do
this once the component load is the
second assignment is make a input tag in
here which should have numeric values
user can just click click click and can
increase the values and based on what
the current value is these values should
be load up now again you need to change
the states and everything based on what
the value is you will be doing something
on value change in these things I know
you can do this if you have been into
the course and you have completed that
and reach to this project I am pretty
sure everybody will be able to that
within a brief this shouldn't be a tough
job for you so this is our cool app in
the react.js that we have built up of
course I'll be pushing up this code on
to the github you'll find a link in the
description if are you on the YouTube if
you are in the code get access to the
official ripple on the github you can
just download it and that's it for this
video thank you for staying for 40
minutes in case you think that this
video is awesome and it can be helpful
for somebody don't forget to share about
it subscribe to the channel as well and
keep enjoying the cursive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
