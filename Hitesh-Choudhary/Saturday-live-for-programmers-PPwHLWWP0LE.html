you
hey there everyone and welcome back to
another Saturday live a life for
programmers by a programmer and we are
just trying to chitchat and maybe I can
help you in solving some of your
problems and stuff so welcome back again
another Saturday life hey Aaron
hey mallesh hey J Bhattacharya hazed
sort of Jane hey Raghu Rajan imma kill I
was going on hey Manish Chaudhary Ram
ROM thank you so much for your love and
we are sharp ten o'clock yes sometimes
I'm a little bit like sharp on time not
always but there we go hey hello
everyone hello everyone and today's
agenda is we're gonna talk something
about Python a little bit about that so
that we can talk about it okay so all
the people who absolutely love Python
today we're talking about it okay so yes
in case all of you don't know about it I
have just rolled out literally just
rolled out a simple course on back-end
development using Django now back-end
development is vast it's really really
kind of a big thing that I cannot cover
up just in in one course or something so
yes I have rolled out a course on
back-end development using Django this
is a full fun course now the goal that
I've set for me for this course is to
make sure that back-end development
becomes fun and easy easy was the main
goal here because you know as instructor
it's my goal that I should deliver the
topic in the easiest possible manner and
that's what I have done in the back-end
course you'll feel that it was so easy
anybody can do that something like that
and that's my goal so yes Django is
finally here and we are gonna work on
that now I have created a couple of
variety of things on that now again just
to remind you we haven't focused much on
the front-end part in the Django because
it's already there in the core so we
haven't talked much on it but still
there are eight projects in that so
there is no PowerPoint presentation at
all in the course everything is like
coldly done
we are gonna fire up our code editor and
we're gonna talk about it so that's what
I wanted to share with all of you I'm
little bit tired because this month I
have worked like extraordinarily hard
but that's it so shout out my name hey
Mohamed Mojtaba I hope I pronounced that
correctly because any names are so hard
even including my name but I've tried so
Python PHP or Python for web development
ah you can try both both are amazing but
I somehow feel that in the Python corner
you feel really easy there so hey Jan
Kearney yogi you have completed your
Python 53% that's really Rock Elsie
Roxie yes thank you so much all he or
love say my name uncle Sharma hey there
we go proper desi says hey hey to you
what to choose when sqli or no SQLite
database now it depends on situation how
much traffic or how many queries you're
gonna be firing up so obviously you can
choose any one of them there is no such
big deal world of cricket Bobby my name
hey Bobby how are you Bobby remember
from Supernatural the guy Bobby one of
my favorite character from there okay so
I know Java not Python I wish angular
course come soon hey garden augur
angular is also amazing tag but I when I
was working on the courses out I chose
either angular or react
I chose react so as of now we are
working on react so that's smart what my
favorite is as of now charlie
it's Jango easier than mine skill cause
I know MySQL Jango is far more easier
than MySQL trust me there you won't even
have to write any queries or something
Jango writes it automatically for you
just create your models and that's it I
think now yes I could have chosen for
the backend like node maybe PHP or
something but I asked a question to
myself that if I could go back into time
and could suggest me a framework to
learn for the very first in the backend
part what that would be so without any
thought Jango came up and that's what I
feel that if anybody is getting started
in back-end development
Jango is the easiest thing to just mark
on and if you are planning to make a
simple blog or some
on your own it's just like freakingly
easy hits it's that easy in the Jenga so
yes you'll pretty sure I'm pretty sure
you're gonna enjoy that course and of
course it's on to a sale just like you
know me it's affordable for everybody
just cost you just a t-shirt maybe and
you can learn from it then you can
become complete full stack developer can
earn a lot more with this course what
you are paying for that it's a good
investment and just like this price I
would say yeah you can enjoy that okay
so let's focus a little bit on two
questions so pseudo gem install
cocoapods so you are working on iOS
that's awesome keep working it there
it's also good best course bro I hate
PHP yeah I know a lot of people do hate
PHP but trust me you're gonna love
Django it's like it's amazingly simple
the first time we're gonna see that how
the admin interface work in the even the
January will be just movie it's just
that simple it's like that shout my name
hey ivy join us how are you hope you're
good so pronounce my name hey Rahul I
could well how is it going on Rails is
most awesome yes rail and Jaguar kind of
a competitors both both are amazingly
absolutely simple so it's just like if
you are already working on Ruby on Rails
then you don't need to take django
course but if you want to increase your
knowledge or something that surely you
can take but I highly recommend the big
nuts to start with Django it's much more
easier oh the mobile number login work
with OTP on mobile I have already talked
about that in fact I have showed you
that how it works in one of the app that
we built up in my remember the Android
course in which we build up a chat app
there is one app in which we tried all
of the logins Facebook Twitter this
mobile number login and all of that so
maybe you want to check that out okay
can Mac Mini is good for bigness yes
absolutely it is in fact it was my very
first machine when I started working on
on this my kiss okay so this was my very
first machine when I started working on
the iOS project so yes it's absolutely
good machine okay Chad boy say something
a Chad boys chat BOTS okay Chad bot I'll
talk about that probably in one of the
separate videos I do put a chat bot on
my Facebook page once and I posted a
video Honda had it flooded like anything
and I had to close it down because
server was like doing anything
how is lco do cheap hell CEO is pretty
affordable in the courses because it's
not about making money on they'll see
I'm making money from my other clients
and resources this is something which is
fun to me and this is what I have been
when you're coming to kolkata in case
you don't know or you haven't checked on
my facebook page i'm coming to kolkata
on 13th of february just before
valentine in st. Saviour's autonomous
College in Kolkata so
so let's just pick up its Django as
powerful as PHP and no D yes of course
it's equally powerful because you can
use all the models and all the database
it's compatible with almost all database
but yes whether you build your app and
node or PHP or Django it's almost same a
lot of apps are already there on Django
your qualification enough I do have
enough background on my qualifications
as well don't worry
ok there's somebody who's asking for a
money somewhere ok what's your thought
about earn money app like pea TM cache I
don't have good thoughts about it
because I don't think I don't believe
that earning cash back is a solid income
to earn money you have to work hard
that's not something you can do using
just a cash back or something so I don't
recommend just get involved in a
business of getting cash back or
something please don't do that
make yourself good work hard and learn
something whether that's a designing or
maybe programming so don't take these
shortcuts of earning money why cash back
that's that's absolutely ridiculous ok
so something about react so let's talk
about react reacting this amazing
platform and in fact kind of a framework
it's not exactly a framework it's kind
of amazing thing react is if you talk
about the model-view-controller it is
just a view standalone view in there
that is I'm talking about react not
react native and once you understand the
things in the react like what is props
water state how to mutate that state and
all of that it actually becomes super
easier to control everything in react
and once you understand the reactors
it's very easy to move into react native
so that you can build your native ios
and android apps so that's why i'm a big
fan of react and i love it i have work
on it every single day so there we go ok
if you put a lot of Smiley's
automatically the question actually gets
spammed by faith by youtube not by me so
please don't do that just put a couple
of Smiley's that's it not much okay so
i'm not feeling really good today
because i am little bit tired
I rolled out a course just now work for
a client finished that also and I think
I'm gonna get ill a little bit
it's feeling sometimes you know when you
get a feeling that you are about to fell
ill maybe fever maybe cold and it's it's
almost there not yet but it's almost
there that's kind of a feeling I'm
getting so maybe I'll get a little bit
ill it's like that feeling not good but
yeah how many programming languages you
know I know programming and that's it I
don't care about languages because at
the end of the day it's all about loops
functions and classes so I don't really
care much about it in just a week I can
get ready in most of the programming
language even if I don't know the
language probably in a week or two week
I can get ready of that that's the first
thing that I learned in my job that
regardless of whatever skills you have
you have to get ready in other
programming languages as well my name
Rahul Agarwal I already told your shout
out he heard name there which companies
will hire web designers all the
companies need web designers if there's
a stable web site companies is doing any
kind of online business so yeah oh for
your speedy recovery be fit and fine
yeah
I will surely your love is always with
me but you know it's getting cold in
Jaipur and I absolutely like idiots I
went for swimming and I think probably
that that hit me a little bit yeah so
yeah it's it's getting a feeling like
you mean them I'm about to get something
like uh hunter cold or maybe a fever so
yeah you know sometimes it happens so
don't worry I'll get back so make a
video on blockchain yes I am planning to
make video tell me about selenium
selenium is absolutely rocking I would
suggest you to go for selenium vid Java
do you more than two lakhs per month
yeah kind of a well that's not a
question you should be asking but yeah
kind of depends on months it's not like
I do have a stable job and work on that
sometimes I even make lot more than that
but yeah I just forget about that
question you didn't read my email my
email right now is saying more than 200
unread emails I'm trying to get back on
that but it's like I'm getting a lot of
love I do love it absolutely with yeah
it's getting big how much you scored in
your class well enough to get good
college even my I Triple E previously it
used to be a I Triple E exam I don't
know if does if does that happens right
now or not
not I scored like four thousand and
eight hundred or four thousand five
hundred something ranked in a I Triple E
and pretty good decent decent ranked not
like amazingly sharp but it was okay I
didn't prepared for any IIT ease or
anything like that but still I'd I go at
IIT Bombay regularly to give lectures
there so yeah it's going good
my email is very important you can shoot
me that again and probably I can read
that on the top yeah sometimes you know
email get buttered down I try my best to
read that but actually Facebook is the
fastest way to reach me out if you have
any things so why do you charge money if
you do it for free no I'm not doing it
for free who told you that I'm doing it
for free I don't do that for free my
content is absolutely like top-notch I
spend a lot of time I spend money in
these gears to make proper quality
content and that is why my content is
not free and never will be so everybody
makes money it's not like you can just
work without money there is always some
angle I don't like that angles I like to
straightforwardly charge for what I'm
doing obviously you'll be learning these
skills you are not gonna be working for
free you'll be working for your clients
you'll be charging those clients you'll
be working on a company you'll be
charging that company for your time that
you spending with that companies
obviously you are not doing it for free
I'm not doing it for free let's just be
on to this reality ground let's not just
make it complicated you're learning all
these programming language to live a
better life that's the fact and better
life means having good amount of money
some maybe travels you can afford all of
that so that ginseng says how are your
parents
they're amazing always supportive all
the crazy ideas that I had they have
been always supportive so let me also
show you a couple of things probably you
some of you might be interested in that
I have got something here on my desk if
you guys are ready to see what is there
on my desk please post yes there is
something interesting on my desk you
want to see that tell me in the comment
section post down yes yes yes yes yes
and I'm gonna show you what is something
interesting on my desk today come on
guys you can type out yes yeah you want
to see that yeah
yes yes I see I want to see a lot of yes
can you see this what is there on my
desk right now okay so okay there are so
many years going on so can you see that
guess it what this guy is this is
something really amazing that is I have
got from YouTube okay yep yep yep it is
exactly thank you so much a lot of
congratulation there so yes it is there
yep yep yep yep it's it's exactly what
you are thinking and yes I haven't
posted it on anywhere Facebook or
anything I actually wanted it to be in
front of you so that you know what this
live actually feels me that I'm talking
right now directly to you and that's why
I haven't posted any picture on Facebook
or anything because I wanted to have it

special for me it's really extremely
shiny I hope I don't drop it
there we go yeah so see that I hope I
hope it's you can see that there we go
so yeah it is here probably now I can
force some photos and stuff like that
kind of unboxing it's not an unboxing
it's just you yeah kind of unboxing it
just he opens the box and that's it
yeah it's all because of the consistency
and your love that you have supported
this channel because so far on the
YouTube there is not like much big
channel which are working on programming
as well as on the stuff that I do so
it's kind of a unique channel for me
it's a tech channel on top of that it's
a programming channel on top of that
it's a guidance channel so it's kind of
a mix going on in here
so yeah congratulation I really accept
full heartedly that it's all your love
guys I don't know what is so special
about this channel that I have got such
an amazing audience that no other
youtuber I can proudly say this no other
single youtuber has got such meaningful
audience on his channel that I have got
and I'm absolutely proud on this because
all the people on my channel are
something like they are logical and
that's really I want to say so yeah

using my photo on their thumbnail this
is something that I haven't seen or
experienced so far this is really love
so okay now start a video yeah we are
gonna start a video actually I'm
one thing for you on the Python that's
about Python web scraping so that I can
tell you a little bit more about the web
scraping and stuff so definitely that
video is about to get edited and then
uploaded on YouTube it's not like I just
uploaded videos like anything I just
always like to edit polish and precise
content on there not on there just like
live stuff but yes very soon you're
gonna see videos and fight in usage and
variety of things so that is that is
already recorded but need to be edited
so
become to become a developer after
school there is no such story here I
wanted to be I got interested in
computers I love programming I felt that
I belong to this community and I just
I'm here right now
no this is all so do you read books or
so many so many books I have all the
time my Kindle being bugged I have like
Kindle in my app in my phone and I just
read that quite a lot physical books I
have recently I have actually kind of a
decrease down the physical book purchase
thing but still I do purchase I recently
actually bought one it just arrived
today from Amazon and I'm reading that
it's a nice book I'll surely share my
experience so yes I do read a ton of
book I'm kind of addicted to books oh
yes today no notification from YouTube
sad heed of guys come on fix that Hey
Bhuvan Adhikari says visit Nepal this
year I probably can visit Nepal as well
but right now I have applied a couple of
visas let's just see how many visas I
get accepted for that yes is reactive
programming language no react is not a
programming language it's a JavaScript
and react is like you code in JavaScript
and through react you can make Android
apps iOS app and web app basically from
react is just web from react native its
Android and iOS so yeah I hope you get
that watch Silicon Valley know that not
that much time I have free just some
good books motivational book if you want
some of the books suggestion I can
surely give you from my Kindle which I
finished like in the last month so
surely I can give you some suggestions
there okay and I think one of the book
that you should read is Dave Crenshaw I
love this author he makes a lot of books
on time management and well fit my
all-time favorite is the myth of
multitasking that is really a great book
by him and then there is again a book
invaluable again by Dave Crenshaw it is
really a good book
and then there is book which I was
reading I didn't liked it that much but
still some valuable stuff is there it's
by an Indian author weapon Kumar its
introduction to data mining it's really
good book but not that much information
I was expecting of course I think all of
you might have read a book by Robert T
kiosk E which is Rich Dad Poor Dad
really an amazing book you should read
that and there are a couple of others
okay and
okay I hope I
I think I can only share this much of
the book and yeah these are the other
books of which I haven't read so if I
haven't read it how can I tell you about
these books so others yes this book is
also good it says finish give yourself
the gift of done which is again let me
tell you the author about that I haven't
fully completed this book but based on
like 60% of the content I love it
absolutely it's by Jon Acuff it's finish
give yourself the gift of done amazing
book the way the author has done
everything it's like amazing which phone
you are using I'm using 1 + 5 t waiting
for the 1 + 6 to arrive so these are the
few books that I have read remember me
sir Ave wake
khushboo Modi with a call Krish be Moody
it's confusing sir I'm using 1 + 5 y
today else your home drop-down option
isn't working it's your home drop-down
option is not working how is that even
possible let me check that out stuff
happen automatically on the website it
is working and checked it out on
incognito oh it's it's working probably
you might want to refresh your browser
why did you reapplied at the last video
ok actually a student one of the
students requested and made a valuable
point there pointed out a mistake in
that video that hey there is one point
which is not so good in that video I
appreciate that that if you have found
out my mistake I honestly appreciate
that and I'll kind of a give you full
respect there that yes it is my mistake
so I made that video private I added the
video some section needs to be deleted
and I deleted that section and I
reapplied at that is it a loss of money
yes of course my monetization for that
video got completely crashed but I don't
really care about those couple of
dollars what's more important me for me
is somebody made a valuable point there
and pointed out a really sharp mistake I
appreciate that this will not happen in
the future but right now I have dropped
that video and re-uploaded that because
for me apart from the dollar your advice
and your feedback is much more valuable
for me so I cannot tell you exact what
point is because it's it would be like
making no sense because that mistake
will be out there and the boy didn't
wanted me to put that mistake so that's
why I deleted that video and the video
got reuploaded so yeah
let's pick up more questions maybe
couple of more because I have to go and
maybe I have to take some rest not
feeling really good okay
exams are there okay some people that
might be having their exam Alika back
over here holy I think Holies on first
or second
I don't remember maybe second or third
yeah I'm not sure
so Linux okay it's it's just going
pretty pretty like suddenly it has got
like a rocket there Reed what's my name
hey Syd heart
sure sure koala I hope and didn't
butcher your name
do you know machine learning in fact
right now I am working on machine
learning I have to read quite a lot on
it it's not like that I know everything
about it but yes I'm working on the
project on the I on this machine
learning and I'm learning for that okay
so I think that's all what we can do
right now honestly guys I'm not feeling
really that good I honestly need to take
some rest I usually don't take rest it's
it's being like quite a long time that I
have taken like full nap or something
probably today it's the day I need that
I'm not really feeling well I think I
should go take some medicine and just
sleep down today at least so thank you
so much for joining up guys and it's the
final bye bye again thank you so much
and we'll surely talk to you again we'll
be back you'll see very soon the whole
energy at the equation and everything
back I think I'm gonna get a fever a
little bit like that okay
that's it guys keep coding keep
programming and regardless of what
happens we have to be consistent because
it's all about making things better for
ourselves so keep coding keep enjoying
and keep learning read a lot by a lot of
courses buy a lot of books you read them
all of them don't just be a guy who just
keeps them in their hard drive read a
lot and learn a lot okay so that's it
bye bye enjoy your weekend and happy
