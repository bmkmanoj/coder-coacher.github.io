another Saturday live alive for
programmers where you try to ask your
question I try to answer them as closely
as I possible again I'm not a master of
everything but I try to make sure that
you get best possible help and again
just like always we do always Saturday
live at 10 o'clock
according to Indian Standard Time and
that's consistent so far so cheers with
iced tea awesome weather is here so hey
Rohan hey pretty hey Miki Sonali
Mohammed hey master CH ER Rucker hello
hello hello hello everybody how's it
going on how is the weather in your
country so I hope you are doing pretty
good and you're coding every single day
it's working good great here
Selam sir Salam to you as well okay so
welcome back again to another Saturday
live we're gonna talk about something
special here we're going to talk about
today about agenda is desktop based
applications so I thought we'll make
these talks as little bit more
productive by introducing new technology
so that I can talk on to something and
all of that which car you like I already
own a Honda City which I love absolutely
and that's my car okay now before we
proceed here let me also tell you that
today was a conference day which was not
really good had some issues but again
regardless of that whatever happened
here first of all I'm not happy with the
conference that happened today it was
really about experience but I would like
to mention for the people who came from
intercity especially Vivek Modi god of
Naga and there are a couple of new
Himanshu these are all the people who
came from different cities to attend my
talk and couldn't just attend regardless
of who screwed up I am sorry for that
because I don't know whatever that is
but I think you guys are coming up from
different city just to listen to me just
to meet me and I was not able to serve
you properly
I believe somehow it was my fault so
again didn't matter who screwed up take
my apology hear that I'm completely
sorry for that but thank you so much you
have traveled come here to meet me we
had a good chitchat but again that's it
okay so let's again come back onto our
very exciting so hey Grover I'm a big
nerd I started with Python hit open
that's a good choice Python is amazing
so good luck this is a pretty good and
beautiful choice
okay so shaumbra that says what actually
happened I don't think so it's a good
idea to share much of the things but I
was invited for a talk and firstly they
say that you have to cut short your talk
for 30 minutes and then I was allowed to
talk for like five or eight minutes on
the stage and that's it they behind have
said can you do it tomorrow and I said
no I'm not free tomorrow so okay so it
was really a bad experience that if
you're inviting somebody to
talk and people are coming there to
listen to him and then you're saying no
youyou should not talk it's really bad
hey Mohammad mujtaba love from Karnataka
love you guys
so take my name hey uh Poudre Saxena how
are you how is it going on I bro how
much hours do you sleep very less you
can tell it by these guys dark circles
okay let's start with you so sir what
will what will we do after learning C++
you can make amazing unity games go
ahead with that okay
let's talk about today's agenda is about
a little bit about the desktop app so
how you can make desktop apps now there
are variety of ways of making the
desktop application and now again
desktop applications are rising quite a
lot recently I have seen increase in
demand on the freelancing website about
these desktop apps so all those people
who are okay there is a shout out here
hey they just love your videos would
like to know which video editing
software lens and mics you are using hey
I'm each TV thank you so much for asking
this question I can answer you that
pretty quickly if I can move my bottles
and stuff here
so this is the beast that I'm using for
recording the stuff this is what i'm
using i'm using still my 70d I do have
my a TD as well
I didn't liked it much so I came back
onto my 70d I use a couple of lenses
this one is Sigma 18 to 35 which is
pretty expensive lens it cost around a
70 thousand or something I do have
another this lens as well sometimes I
use it this is really amazing 70 to 200
lens and if you can buy 50mm as well
that would be good or video editing
software I use Final Cut Pro with a few
plugins that I purchased from some of
the amazing YouTube stars as well one of
them is Piotr mccannon so that's why my
edits are amazing I try to learn from
some of the freelancer as well and music
is always completely different I spent a
little bit time to make sure you get
that like 2 seconds of the clips and
then after that a little bit more than
that so this all is whole and expedience
and I try to give that best experience
to you so that you can have it ok so
let's talk about the desktop X desktop
apps again desktop apps can be designed
majorly by two ways as of now yes there
are others as well one is Java and
another one is JavaScript so all those
people who have been mailing me hey we
want to make desktop acts I would
recommend you to check out electron jas
okay in case you don't even if you are
not aware of that or you are not
interested in that I highly recommend
you to at least check out website good
knowledge good stuff is always amazing
ok so go ahead and just check out
electrons yes I recently build up a toy
app it was just a weather application in
electrons yes it was so fun installation
was a little bit hard at the first time
I would I would not lie on that it was
pretty good so go ahead check out
electron dirtiest as well I liked it it
is easier in electron Jia's as compared
to the java application java application
are pretty fun i would recommend to use
some kind of scene builders okay so go
ahead use some scene builders as well
let's pick up some more questions as
well because there are a lot of them
coming
the boy says how to get internship love
your skills thank you so much the boy
let's talk about internship as well
now obviously internships are not gonna
lend up on your email automatically you
have to apply rigorously for that but
before you do that pick up your domain
pick up where you want to do internship
whether it's an Information Security
whether it's a front-end development
backend design pour database modeling UI
UX whatever that is just pick up the
domain then create an amazing portfolio
because a lot of people are competing
for that internship and then decide like
five or six companies which actually are
working on that scale okay and then try
to apply and reapply and reapply all
those industries and also catch them on
the Django or not the Django on a
LinkedIn and these all social media
networks and all of that follow up a
video exact and precise resume a resume
a means your project work don't send
them tenth mark see mark she twelve mark
she'd nobody cares about that okay so
this is how you usually get internship
again be good internship is not about
you learn something their internship is
all about you'll be polishing your
skills there so again go ahead and
polish first of all make your skills
because you can only polish them in
internship don't expect that people will
be teaching you an internship that
doesn't happen okay pretty good which is
your favorite language a service on each
ray I don't have any favorite language
not at all not even JavaScript not even
Swift I love the work if the work is
amazing I love that language if that app
can be designed best in Java I would
absolutely love that if that application
can be designed in Swift I would love to
do that so I don't have any language
languages are just like tool just like I
don't really care about much this of the
camera because this is like nothing for
me
if this goes I can buy a new one similar
way I don't really care about what are
these languages on all that and neither
you should be never married with a
language it is bad always try to flip
into languages at least what I believe
okay when you completed your life would
you help me I texted you on the fav FB
page there is one Roger haters one I'll
try to be there because you know stuff
is getting busy probably I'll try new
design t-shirt no it's it's same I do
have like full sleeves and half sleeves
great t-shirts from the same brand I
like this and it's still the same from
last like two years no one and a half
year almost
this is how it's going on Wasim Butler
say sir cheers Cheers
so clear Sri namaste is how are you
collecting information for your videos
before I make any videos the number of a
thing in my mind is what kind of value
I'm adding because information is
already on there web things that I teach
like API is and talk about bitcoins
they're already there now I try to make
sure that I need to read some blog and
then I just put it in a creative way so
that user can understand that and on top
of that I try to sprinkle my touch on to
it whether it becomes easier to
understand so that's what I try to do i
don't really just mug the things and
just say it in front of you i try to add
my touch add my logics and my flavor to
that so that it becomes good and yes
always all videos are predetermined it's
nothing like I'm just sitting in the
camera and just talking to you
everything is written precise not
perfectly returned but yes there is
always a theme that I want to follow
there is always precise knowledge that I
want to give so this is how it works
there's a lot of process that I do I
like to add things not just a mug the
things and up colleges already doing a
great job in mugging the things and all
that okay so please make a video and
bursting the most programming myths yes
I have already written that and I'm
working on that I'm trying to figure out
through the questions and all of that
I'll surely make a video on bursting out
the programming myth here okay so this
is how we're going to go it's black what
is black no I don't think so there is
anything black here
can we develop software for windows and
linen and Mac in Linux of course you can
I think electrons yes would be really
awesome if you want to have that so
let's pick up questions from where you
learn frameworks sir hi Gaurav Nagar I
love to learn directly from documents
here because usually when I'm working on
something it's actually fresh and new
usually I am known when the things are
actually out in the market I'm the first
one or maybe among the first one who
have presented their courses and
returned some article on that for
example when the iOS 10 came I was one
of the first one to release out the
course when I guess all these Kames up
at the very first end I'm the first one
to just make the courses swift for a
swift one is also was there and I made
the course so reading from the direct
documentation something that I have to
do I don't like it much but there is no
other choice now there is no book there
is no videos on the internet and if
you'll notice one of my to-do list video
on the iOS was the first one on the
internet to be there so I don't have
much option to read from like if I'm
learning any framework I have to go into
documentation I have to create project I
have to mess it around
try to figure out things make a mess in
the code just be frustrated and that's
how I learned and then I try to break
that into separate easier parts so that
you people can also understand so
there's a lot of things going on Akshay
Akshay Chaudhary says which books you
read sir I have a lot of books and I
like to read them on my Kindle today
also in the conference I thought that
some of the talks were not like I didn't
wanted to listen to them so I was
sitting around and reading my Kindle at
that time also I do have a few books
here in the Kindle I can recommend you
and
the right the first one that I'm reading
right now is the focused business by
Dave Crenshaw and there's another one by
again by Dave Crenshaw I love the Dave
Crenshaw books they're pretty awesome
it's invaluable so these are the one I'm
reading right now and then there are a
couple of others as well I don't know as
I should name them probably or not
okay and then there is one
it goes there's a book on tensorflow by
Tom hope that also I'm reading it's
pretty good this is for a client project
works so tensorflow by Tom Hope is a lot
of one book that I'm reading pretty good
books so far I'm enjoying them so these
are the ones please make a video on
t-shirt business your speaking style is
awesome I love it thank you so much for
hem on and probably very soon I'll make
a video on my t-shirt there's a lot of
demand coming up for that so yeah how to
get idea for an app a current if if you
are not having any idea for the first of
all that's a sad news because there's
plenty of things that you can be
creative but again if you're not getting
an idea don't worry just open up your
mobile phone and try to create clone of
the very first three apps that you see
maybe Instagram Facebook goober tinder
or maybe you are there so go ahead and
get that okay so Shubham rotary says
that bloody notification of YouTube is
not coming I agree with you there
Shaboom I totally agree with you this
notification thing is not working for
most of my audience
I you say is a I am I used back here to
another great video which language
should I learn after Python for machine
learning Lisa just may need to language
you don't need another language first of
all let's just be honest here first of
all what you need to do is now just
explore a little bit maps like maybe
bias theorem and then try to learn a
little bit more about the psyche it and
scikit-learn library and then you can
search on the tensor flow again all of
them are available in Python so you
don't need to learn any other language
just go ahead directly talk about the
side and scikit-learn on how to
implement that that's like the basic
start and directly get started with the
you have done in of basic so let's just
be honest you don't need any other
language okay so this is what you can
expect it this channel pretty chill out
relax and talking about the stuff which
most people don't talk okay
also also here today's experience is not
so good hey Shivam yeah it was not so
good but again the why should we worry
too much about it I'm really worried
about that people who came couldn't
listen to me I came there I prepared the
stuff to wanted to do live coding in
front of them I actually prepared a
simple tool in in Python to be designed
to extract all the links from the
webpage and test them for SQLite 1
durability
I wanted to design that in front of
there it was a pretty quick tool but
yeah well just leave that it's it's gone
ok ok
which idea I should use for a desktop
application which is connected to
database and hardware your end hardware
is actually pretty tricky one but if
you're building up your desktop
application in Java
I think IntelliJ is the most rock-solid
thing and if you are building it on
JavaScript I think Adam or sublime text
I prefer Adam but sublime text is also
pretty cool honestly sublime text right
now is little bit faster than autumn
Adam may be a little bit more faster so
sublime text is talking here as of now
but still I am a fan of Adam so I use
that do you use Jade I don't use Jade
much I like to use mustache Jade is also
good but Jade is little bit confusing
don't you think and mustache is actually
a little bit easier for templating but
again Jade is cool too there's not much
difference in the Jade in mustache I use
mustache most oftenly
okay how can I improve algorithm hey
Zane shady I have tried to explain a lot
of algorithms and code building logics
for those algorithms in my Java bootcamp
maybe that's a good start for you I like
your confidence and hairstyle
to be honest my hair style is something
that even I don't care these are just
messing around all the other times if
they grow up quite long so then I put a
cap and that's how things goes
so please answer my DM question on
Instagram okay
hey guys if you haven't yet followed me
up Instagram go ahead follow this up at
a page zero one fold one I repeat that
again hit H should make char ache okay
that was fun
so so should I learn Android because
everyone says it's outdated after react
native game no it's not like if the new
technology has came the previous one got
completely out no it's not still if you
want to learn like native Android app
using Java or Kotlin maybe it's
completely rock-solid still and I don't
think so it's going anywhere
it's all about business what do I say
about it like what kind of things are
suiting for your business like for
example a client is there and for his
particular business building up native
application is not good at that point of
time react native would be rocking for
him but in case there is a client for
him react native doesn't really make
sense and he needs an application
directly in Java so give him a java
application so nothing is going outdated
nothing is going anywhere all of them
are working side by side all rocking
really great now it's something like you
have more options to explore when you
are making an app for particular thing
so that's how it just works nothing is
going anywhere okay so okay
let's pick up more questions how many
great t-shirts do you have I haven't
given a count to that but probably I
would have like 13 heart and I would
have including the full sleeves and the
half one as well so maybe 10 or 13 okay
it's going really quick now let's how do
I get notification for your streaming
hey Prashant I stream every single
Saturday at 10 p.m. and also the best
way to get all the updates is my
Facebook page I'm super active on
Facebook I love Facebook not on Twitter
today is for trolling I'm not one to
much though
ah there's a really good question by
yesh Shan day and he says its react
native build adapts can compete with
Java I would say yes totally because if
you look at the inside hood about the
react native it's just an API directly
talking to your native apps so yes your
react native apps can actually compete
directly back-to-back with apps build in
Swift as well as in Java so there is no
such lag and stuff if there would be
performance issues don't you think that
Facebook is a really big company to not
to use react native they handle so much
of the traffic there they know actually
what they are building and what they are
doing so you can rely on that ok
more question sir do you like them
editor in Linux no and hard that much I
don't use them there's no like code
completion supporting them so that's why
I don't use it much so yeah
hello sir give me some tips for
first-year CSE student I have already
registered in Python course at LC oh hey
Hritik Kumar there are a couple of good
interesting updates coming up about all
the Python students who are there at LC
Oh
so stay tuned at my Facebook page there
is updates
I don't reveal these updates really
often once I'm done then I only publish
them so yes stay tuned there are good
things coming up
okay let's pick up or at tyro okay it's
just gone I'm working become for
becoming a freelancer web developer my
journey started enjoying it hey Gaara
thank you so much for joining up yes
already have got started and I will make
sure that I get you more help in
becoming a freelancer at atleast at web
development stay tuned
probably in the next week the big news
is coming up for helping more of you
guys call out my name Nikhil T say
Charlotte for Nikhil t say sir okay is
it important to learn PHP frameworks hey
next gen X I believe that yes over some
time it will become necessary for you to
learn frameworks as well because you
know what after sometime it becomes like
PHP becomes like too easy for for all
the developers like things like login
system database connection these are all
like me know it but it's taking too much
of the time and framework tries to cut
short that time so frameworks are easy
and yes it's a good idea to invest time
in framework no no tough thing there
okay Master Tech says can you remember
me yes yes I remember you buddy
okay
questions and I can lay back a little
bit there okay so good laptop for CSE
students hey go ahead get a MacBook and
just chill out for the rest of your life
but again if you want something more I
have released a blog at learn code
online dot in flash blog search for
laptop under 50 K there's a pretty good
list that I've compiled but again I
would recommend you to go ahead buy a
Mac and just forget about everything oh
yeah I know it's it's a little bit
expensive side but even the MacBook Air
is far more better bit better than the
rest of the laptops but again I'm not
selling laptops here totally your
decision
so Django or flask a man who go for
django Django is actually far more
better than the flask plus is easy but
yeah it's it's awesome so Django go for
Django what was your first job very
worked after completing your college I
am hammered by the way okay hi I am hot
my first job honestly was I got hired as
a penetration tester that was my first
job I got hired as a penetration tester
trainer then I moved into penetration
tester analyst and then my job was to
prepare reports and submit that and I
left that I've also worked for an SEO
company as well for a little bit while
that's why I know a few stuff of FCP SEO
as well and then I worked also worked in
a couple of startup where I had wrote a
lot of a lot of reg X and Python as well
so yeah and then also each client work
is really good what is method overriding
hey I've already discuss method
overriding and all these stuff okay
there's a good question Jake Paul or
Logan Paul please reply now okay let me
talk about them Jake Paul and Logan Paul
especially the Logan Paul it has it has
given me a good kind of a lesson in life
that no matter how big you are how good
you are you will screw up you will screw
up one time in life and at that point of
time crowd will just go crazy about
you'll get a lot of hatred on the
internet and internet hatred is like if
you get like one people hatred in a
life its multiplied by thousand time on
the internet and people who have
absolutely no idea will also give you
hatred and everybody does that it's like
no big deal
Logan Paul did it he did it really bad
thing but again everybody everybody
really screw up one time but I believe I
will also do this maybe sometimes in the
life so it makes me a little bit worried
that what will happen when I'll screw up
because everybody does you will also do
that when you'll be working in a job or
something so be prepared for that people
are gonna be coming after you as well
for me as well that's the lesson
everybody can take from Logan Paul okay
let's pick up angularjs or react.js
hey proper day C go for react yes it's
much more easier angular this little bit
tough but it's a 1/1 short solution but
again I'll have react okay oh let's pick
up more questions what more can we do
with Python you can do crazy stuff with
Python building web apps go for Django
flask building desktop application go
for TK inter want to build like machine
learning and all these stuff so it's
pretty worst and really great language
not for apps and all these stuff but
still a great one react native versus a
marine which is better if you are
already into the dotnet Cole framework
ish thing go for xamarin no need to jump
into react but if you are a web
developer that means you already know
about JavaScript then go for react
speaking about cloud computing you know
what I really want to talk about cloud
computing because I build up a cloud
during my Master's it was using five
computers do you remember the Australian
based cloud company we used that stack
here probably will we'll talk about that
okay you can map MacBook Air handle
heavy softwares if you're talking heavy
about Final Cut Pro absolutely not but
if you are talking heavy about like web
dev software and maybe a little bit
about Android studio and stuff it surely
can okay how are you motivated all the
days it's me it's like me even small
stuff doesn't really just get here so I
just wash it off I'm like this all I'm
worried about is if my day is productive
or not today it was not but you know
what nothing is there that the cool iced
tea cannot fix so yeah I'm like that
I'll stay like this
okay but when Linux and Windows we
development your videos are great know
that you have some fans from Brazil as
well hey Arthur I have fans from Brazil
as well even I have some registered
student as well from Brazil and some of
them are taking my personal boot camps
one on one online boot camps as well so
yes I do have I do know people from
Brazil as well
coming back on to your question Linux or
Windows I would say if somebody would
have given me like Mac Windows and Linux
I would choose Mac if somebody would
have given me option Windows and Linux I
would be choosing Windows the reason is
when I want to have a development I just
want to open up my laptop and it should
work I should not be worried about
updates and patching the stuff and
compatibility issue because I'm already
learning web development I don't want to
deviate my vision with by another
installs and updates I want to be
focused I want to be productive and to
be honest Linux is great by the way it's
amazing but sometimes there are package
updates there are not exact software
available I want to just install the
stuff and make it work so in that case I
would be choosing Windows so there you
go you got your answer and thank you so
much from India as well and I know
people from the Brazil also love this
channel in fact a lot of program will
love this channel ok so let's pick up
more question
suffering hard in learning jsn e-tip
Jesus is actually a little bit trickier
at the first but all I can say is stay
there you're gonna love this absolutely
and try to create few projects in that
because unless and until you're creating
projects and applying that it's
absolutely hard to learn it but again
stay there you are gonna enjoy every
single moment of the JavaScript journey
so programming is stuff let's just agree
on that it's not that much easy but it's
having amazing life so stay there stay
there you will love it
okay so let's pick up more questions
okay why Redux is so complicated oh my
goodness yes Redux is hard my dear
friend to char and I agree there Redux
is hard in fact I made a video on the
Redux I get so many emails that yes you
explained it nicely and probably I'll
make a part two of that Redux video as
well but yes Redux is hard and there is
no like like explanation for that that
why it is so hard it is hard let's just
agree there okay and all those people
who are worrying about the JavaScript or
maybe Python you haven't seen Redux guys
it's complex okay
so why javascript has too much framework
than other language because it's popular
my dear friend it's rocking every single
place love it or hate it it's rocking so
that's why so many framework
I am from Nepal and I want to learn
JavaScript to start how to learn it if
you are from Nepal go to global dot
learn code online dot in go there and
you can learn from there okay
find a perfect real-time project you
don't find it you make it okay
so knowledge in they say is
programming logics there is no way to
improve programming logics let's just be
honest you improve your programming
logics why project and you learned that
on the go if you'll sit just like there
and we'll try to just memorize the
things for palindrome
maybe reverse number or maybe some
recursive things it'll just be keep
sitting there forever and you probably
already are so let's build up something
and eventually things will get cleared
up the more projects you'll be handling
the more it will get clearer but sitting
just behind and applying bubble sort and
merge sort and heap sort is not taking
you anywhere so take it from me and just
start building something these things
like bubble sort and everything will
automatically get clear as you'll be
dealing up with more complexity of the
project so move into projects what are
you waiting for
lack of just a is back-end web
development we will answer that not yet
very soon ok respond is good to learn
Python where is it going questions are
like is it beer
if it would why would you mind that I'm
talking in all my senses even if it
would have been why does it really
matter a lot
okay
so difference between react.js
is completely different no js' actually
runs on to server side and this is
really on the server but the react is
like fronting component and in a Model
View controller if you've heard about
that Model View controller it's the view
thing they react they're completely
different it's kind of a front in and
back in okay almost though let's pick up
more questions make a video on postman
app for web api that is actually a good
suggestion thank you so much thank you I
will try to make that okay should I buy
a MacBook Air or Mac Mini to get started
in iOS development right now the Mac ear
is so much powerful now I started it on
a Mac Mini so again in the Mac Mini as
well
Xcode does really no problem at all so
by the 8gb one and I think you should be
good with the Mac Mini it would be
cheaper as well and later on if you
decide that hey I'm a SAP things are
working great for me and surely you can
invest in MacBook Pro or maybe an iMac
or something so start with the cheaper
one which is Mac Mini I think that
should be really more than enough for
you
okay so
react or angle I've already talked about
what's up dude it's good here dude how
are you I hope you are doing pretty good
as well okay where can I find projects
and machine learning there are not many
in there are not many people don't like
to share these projects as of now on the
open source or github because they are
not pretty sure about it what they are
building up as of now and most of them
are very secretive kind of project so
there is not much abundance of them
learning xamarin is good for future yes
of course it is no problem at all
so it doesn't mean that I am not working
on the tech it's a bad tag no it's not
it's really awesome so is everything is
awesome as well
okay semantic UI versus bootstrap I
could read that that question actually
needs a separate video that's a far more
elaborate oh do you know marvadi a
hybrid super yes I know I know it pretty
well not like amazing expert but I know
okay any plan for meetup in Delhi hey
Robin I haven't been invited by any
college as of now from Delhi and I'm
looking forward that should I be
attending more talks or not because
sometime experiences are not good so I'm
looking and reevaluating should I be
going into more colleges or should I
restrictive with that and should be
doing my work more often I'll think
about us that whether I'll be joining
joining up more meetups and colleges or
not I have to rethink it obviously okay
that's coffee
and that that's a nicety come on guys
even if you think that's a beer that's
fine too
I don't judge you based on what you
drink or what you eat or what
programming language do you code and
neither you should be judging anybody of
what he's drinking or what he is eating
so that's a good thing about programming
chill out little lot of pen icons are
coming up I don't know why ROM ROM pie
up Kobe ROM ROM you're really good
you're really good thank you so much
offline boot camp I want hi Shiva as of
now I am not getting involved in offline
ones I'm too busy for them so Gotham
ready says we are just asking sir what
you are asking I probably have missed it
which company do you work learn code
online in corporation
okay do you play games which one I
haven't started still playing games on
my new built-up PC but yes I love to
play the old-school game still all of
Duty part 1 and I don't I don't like it
that much Prince of Persia is my
favorite total overdose rock-solid game
I still love it probably I'll stream one
day of playing the total overdose
I love that game okay how much data
structure should be no should should
have fresher should know uh
decent at least if you're going for a
planning in big companies like tinder or
maybe LinkedIn Microsoft or maybe others
as well if you're looking for that
obviously a little bit like more than a
little bit data structure is required
and this is like how it works
let's pick up
and you skipped mine comment half
reading okay it's is it good to learn
Python yes of course it's good to learn
Python why are you so worried just keep
learning it make sure you build up
something gate as well okay so for
Android equals Java or cotton start with
Java and then go into Kotlin it's
actually easier path but again there is
no such thing as like
okay so
why react sir react is actually smaller
library the smaller the library it's
easier to implement less reading and
more work on the implementation part so
that's why waiting for you in Kolkata
yes I am coming to Kolkata on 13th of
February there is an amazing coding
event that they are hosting it's
remarkable marvelous if you happen to be
in Kolkata then please please do try to
attend that event it will improve your
coding skills it will brush up your
skills and you can meet me up there as
well sir okay go ahead and check that
out I'll post a link on my Facebook page
as well hit a Chaudhary page is my
Facebook page and I'll post that again I
will be available in West Bengal on 13th
of February in sin saviors college more
details coming up sir
Bhopal as of now no plans are there for
poeple come to Nasik Kanpur okay a lot
of can rights are coming up but I'm not
sure whether I'll be taking many of them
or not especially after today's incident
I'll be restrictive restricting my
meetups and my events surely and say my
name just go on and I think it was happy
now that it's regular degree must okay
it is okay are you coming to Gujarat no
as of now not okay so it's going really
fast it's really hard to see come to
Bangalore I am coming to Bangalore
probably on 28 27 maybe so I think my
questions are going a pre pretty like
ask me there have you been to Def Con
yeah I have been it's amazing so SQL
versus mario TBH i think you want to say
MySQL vs Mario DB if that is my skill is
still rock-solid but again mario TBH i
wanted to go for Postgres if we are
talking about something building up
already you just like casually talking
like programming friends okay come to
Pakistan there are visa issues in
Pakistan because you know the country
that I live in the country that you live
in are not the same like you and me
because we both think that we are
programming buddies but the countries my
countries rubber governed by some
politicians in your country is governed
by some politicians so there are a lot
of issues for me to get a visa and then
get back a visa for Europe and US and
all of that so I hope you don't mind
that just talking honestly here what is
actually the issues rokku
rahul KSA's it ho3 what happened today
what happened today is gone my dear
friend and it's gone let's not talk over
I know what about it it's God dude Osama
awesome is awful
easm is awful okay yes they have can you
suggest me cool be gone no hey Sam it's
tough and it's gonna remain like that so
yeah don't talk bad about Pakistan no
I'm not talking bad about Pakistan or
Afghanistan even I do have a lot of
students watching on my channel from
Pakistan I'm not against by anybody I'm
just saying that I do have visa issues
for coming because previously also I've
been invited to a couple of universities
in Pakistan and I couldn't attend up and
then I gave the Skype talk there it's
not like I do I do hate any particular
country I don't even I love all of you
guys you are all programmers to me
nothing else all and even if I'll say if
you just completely will remove your
last name that is even doesn't really
matter to me all I matter is you are
interested in programming that's it even
if you don't like me that's completely
okay as long as you are doing some
programming and making an impact in the
programming community that I'm trying to
start something here that people love
programming that's all you don't even
have to like me that's okay
okay oh said what after Android I would
say Abby shake stay there stay there in
the Android for at least more six month
and build something great and send me a
link of that okay then move on from
there
so okay a lot of questions are coming up
sir
I make is better or a gaming PC is
better for programming
I would prefer iMac for programming and
video editing and all those stuff so I'm
a big fan of iMac in fact I do all of my
streaming and everything all work on an
iMac I also have to keep this a smaller
screen as well so that I can just record
some videos I can talk to you guys like
this my 5k resolution is so hard to
streams so that's why I don't do that
okay so I think that is enough for today
we have talked for almost 45 minutes and
I have finished up a glass of iced tea
okay iced tea is done and so
also done for this live session again I
hope I I was able to help you out with
some things you guys came up I'm really
happy and so proud that community of
this programming is expanding again just
for the gist of this video check out
electron dot GS even if you don't like
it go ahead and check on electron dot
J's also check out the scene welder for
Java as well not sponsored by anybody of
course check out the scene builder it
will help you to prepare quick scenes or
quick visual interface for java
application building for desktop
application so that's my tip for you and
good night everyone
and keep enjoying keep coding keep
programming you're making an amazing
community without hate just pure love
for programming that's it
keep coding every single day there is no
match when you do the things every
single day so that's it
and I'll be saying about a lot of you
here but I'm a grudge big about Raj the
seventeen million by by George he chose
goodnight
