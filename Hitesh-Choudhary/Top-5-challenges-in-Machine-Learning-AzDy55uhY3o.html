with another video and in this video
we're gonna be talking about top five
challenges that you're gonna be facing
when you're working as a profile of
machine learning or data scientist now
these are not the challenges that you
are going to be facing while learning
the machine learning because that part
is already sorted out why am i course
and obviously there are much more
resources as compared to the previous
days if I just tell you a simple example
of the previous days even the installing
of the tensorflow was not at all
possible on Windows machine but that
that days are those days are completely
gone so let's talk about what are the
top five challenges that are still there
in machine learning and I am looking
forward for the positive response from
the community that eventually they're
going to be solved so let's talk about
them
so the challenge number one is the data
now this is not at all the challenge for
the big companies like Facebook Google
Amazon and yes you know all about the
Facebook thing which is going on right
now so data for these big companies is
not at all a challenge but for a big nur
even at the learning phase getting up
all this data is really a big issue you
don't find such of the big high amount
of data and again the authenticity and
how much data is relevant is again a big
issue now any company who is getting
started or for a start-up bringing up
that data is really crucial because the
more you're gonna be having the data
more you can train your model properly
and can predict the results on the test
data so that your model can actually
work really good on the real data so
that's one big issue now I know this
issue personally because when I was
preparing this entire bootcamp for
machine learning and data science I I
needed a lot of data I guess websites
like Kegel and all these helps but
sometimes you have to even cook up your
own data so that you can present the
model and can make sure that people
understand what you really want to talk
talk about there but again the big issue
is that companies some companies do have
data and due to the privacy issues and
all these other legal issues they cannot
share this data directly to other people
but yes this data is helping all those
companies to be stand in the front line
and leaving all the computers behind and
just learn everything on their own this
is good for them as a business
perspective but this is not good for the
communities so yes we need more data in
the world as an open source so that we
can more try to more understand what are
the things and try to implement more
algorithms on them and can predict good
results so data is number one challenge
the second big challenge as a profile
when you work on a data scientist or a
machine learning expert is unclear
question now sometimes we do have data
we have mechanism to understand that
data but sometimes the questions are so
vague and so unclear that it's really
hard to understand that what things we
should apply to them how we should plot
a graph to them now this
not I can understand some of you might
not be relating to here but all those
people who are working actually into the
domain of data science might might be
getting with me that yes sometimes the
question is to wake from a company and
they just want the result but data
science doesn't work like that it's more
over of a curve that can give you good
hints about taking measurable actions
but again this is not at all like it's
it's a common myth that gets all around
in the companies that you can get exact
results no data science to works on a
little bit different it doesn't gives
you exact result it gives you a pattern
on which you can act and can improve the
result it's not it's not like a magic
that is going to happen overnight so
sometimes the question is really vague
and it creates a lot of problem for the
data scientist to just do anything with
that the third challenge can be little
bit personal for me because when I
worked with a couple of clients it
actually something which I faced
probably it's just me or probably might
be others as well and that is unclear
representation of the data now let's
just say we have a data we have applied
certain algorithms today at data we have
done all the cleaning process then
applied some algorithms on to that and
now we want that data to be shown to a
higher authorities and obviously we
cannot just throw the data in front of
them we need to plot some kind of graphs
with them and yes we do have libraries
like matplotlib and Seabourn which does
really a good job but sometimes it's so
hard to find out that which graph is
going to be suiting for that data and
even selecting all those following all
those principles which are there in
amazing books and all those blogs even
after that the data sometime is so
unclear for the representation purposes
so I personally believe that even with
the libraries like matplotlib and
Seabourn are there but still there is a
lot of room to make sure that there are
good amount of libraries which can make
this process easier and can have can
give us some more opportunities to have
data which we can present and in a
better manner so I hope you are trying
to understand what I'm saying here is
there is more room for libraries which
can make our life easier I am a big fan
of Seabourn library because compared to
matplotlib it's so much easier to
understand and for the teaching purposes
it's amazing but again there is a room
much more so that we can have better
representation of the data the fourth
problem that I felt with this machine
learning and data science is the
computational resources now I'm not
talking about like a few hundred
thousand lines of data I'm talking about
millions and millions of lines of data
now when you compute these kinds of
things on any machine and if it is like
reinforcement learning you have to again
and again and again compute that kind of
data
now computing that kind of data could be
a little bit expensive and can be much
more expensive now we do have libraries
like tensorflow which can work on CPU or
GPU as well but you know you know the
insight fact that GPUs are not at all
cheap they are really expensive and even
if you want to do that kind of
computation on the cloud it's really
really expensive so yes it's a hardware
issue nobody can actually do much about
it but I'm kind of predicting that
eventually with the future as other
things are going to progress these
computational resources are gonna get
cheap and is gonna be affordable for
everyone but as of now one of the
biggest challenges is the resources are
pretty expensive I'm not talking about
the small scale stuff that everybody
does I'm talking about the big scale
stuff like probably making an AI for a
game that can beat the game actually
this kind of resource and computational
requires a lot of resources so I'm
pretty sure that in the future things
are gonna change a lot and this is the
one thing that I am personally looking
forward that companies can come up and
can provide like a cheaper GPUs or maybe
a cloud would be my personal choice
that's something like I can just make an
account on a website and can use their
resources to compute any data at a cheap
price that would be amazing
fifth and the biggest challenge that
everybody face regardless they are big
nerd or an expert which is like really
the big one the selection of algorithm
now a lot of you might be thinking hey
with the expertise it just automatically
comes which algorithm to choose for
which data but it's not because data is
such in a huge quantity and some time
it's such an unclear data that selection
of algorithm is one of the most crucial
decision because it's gonna flow up the
entire flow for the next couple of
months or maybe the entire product line
but
selection of algorithm is not so easier
now if it is like something like
regressor or classification algorithm
that's okay everybody can does that like
whether I have to select a regresar
algorithm or a classifier algorithm but
inside the classifier and regressor we
have a lot of options that we can go
through and selecting that one
particular algorithm there is no such
rule that you have to always go through
with that it's it's a science and the
reason we call it as a data science
because science needs to research and we
need to explore all things all the time
and that brings us to this very big
problem which is selection of algorithm
I'm pretty sure as we are going to be
working in the future with more data as
more blocks will be published more books
will be published and probably in the
future we might have certain set of
rules like if these rules apply to this
data then you can select this algorithm
or not but again that's just a
prediction and that just a good feeling
that I'm getting about this but again as
of now is the selection of algorithm is
a pretty big decision so that is why I
say to everybody who is getting started
in data science and machine learning is
try to understand these algorithms as
much as possible not from the coding
perspective but also from the
mathematical perspective as well they
are pretty easy to understand but once
you understand you can actually figure
it out that yes this algorithm is good
for my data or not so these are my
personal five challenges list that I
think is good for everybody to know
about now in case you're facing
challenges in learning data science and
