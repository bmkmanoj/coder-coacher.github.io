flex box training now in this video we
are going to talk about the opposite of
what we talked in the previous movie in
the previous video we talked about the
justify content which works alongside
with the main axis now it happened to be
that the main axis works in a horizontal
manner in the web if if our main axis
would have been working from top to
bottom then the justify content works
from top to bottom ok so this is a
really tricky situation in the Flex box
but that's how it was designed okay now
so in this video we are going to talk
about the a line item which works on the
perpendicular of the main axis also
known as other axis or whatever you call
that you get the idea and the one unform
Allah noun sment here and that a lot of
people ask me about this wallpaper they
wanted it this is the customized
wallpaper so I can just give it to you
you can just download it from it a
shorter comm slash flex box I did
uploaded it there I know some of you
might be thinking hey what is that what
was that yes some of people just asked
too much time so take what's weird in
the kind of in this wallpaper I can
surely give it to you no problem at all
ok and we are going to be working in 0 3
I have copied and pasted from our start
folder and in the start folder this is 0
3 and this is how it looks like so we
are going to again start from the bare
minimum basics there so again let's have
a div and that is going to have 1 so
command shift D that is going to be 2
and this is going to be 3 this is going
to be 4 5 and maybe one more 6 maybe one
more ok 7 that's it that's it I promise
ok so this is how our properties looks
like we have been aware of it and we
have been also aware that if I just
select my container there and just give
it a display of Flex everything just
aligns here and we have also studied
about the justified content so justify
content like Center just works like that
ok so it just works from left to right
what about if we want some more control
over top
to bottom in that case the align item
comes into the role now as soon as I'll
just use the align item nothing will
happen and that's a classic mistake
everybody does that that's why I am also
going to do it first so as soon as I say
a line item and I just do a center here
and you might be expecting that it
should get center of the page I know a
lot of you expected that but this is not
happening so can you guess what is the
reason here now this is a classic
mistake of not determining your
container height and width okay in order
to explain that a little bit more I
would like to add a property of border
here and border is going to be let's
just say 1 pixel solid and black ok now
what is happening you expected that it
will just jump down to the center of the
page but your page is not having that
height you only have to you only have
this much of the space to work on with
and this is a very classic mistake every
beginner makes it and there is no issue
with that it's ok everybody learns with
the mistake so how you can expect this
align item to work in order to have an
align item we have to have some kind of
space from top to bottom as well in this
case let me just give it a height of you
can also get a height of 100 viewport
height but that is going to be too much
for this example and now it jumps to the
center but I'm going to get a little bit
which is good for our educational videos
purposes and I'm going to get 500 pixel
so that I can see everything here also
I'm going to leave this border on so
that you can see what is happening in
fact I will make it a little bit darker
for 3 pixels so that you can see nicely
and clearly here what is happening ok
now let's talk about the align items and
what offer what it offers to us and the
first and the foremost property is the
flex start and as soon as I do that it's
going to just mix it up and it's going
to just flex start to the top here now
don't get confused with the justify
because we are applying two properties
here ok the justify content center
brings it to the center otherwise this
guy is just push
into its top okay and there is also
which is flex end and if I save that it
just brings everything at the bottom
here okay again you should be aware of
what is your container height to play on
wit because we are talking about top to
bottom and we have already seen the
center here so there we go
and you might be asking what are other
properties being offered by it now
luckily for us it also offered five
properties and most of the Flex Bock
item uses the five property five value
kind of thing so flex start flex and
center what else we do have a stretch
property as well which is quite useful
in some cases stretch here and it just
stretches the element from top to bottom
just like what you expected sometime
it's really really helpful based on what
you want to achieve video target and
again sometime it's helpful and there is
one more and in order this and display
and explain that I have to actually get
something inside this so here I would
like to have an h1 tag and that a CH one
will have seven and now what is going to
happen this seven is going to be a big
guy and rest of the guys are going to be
little bit smaller so let's go to the
Flex box and that property is known as
baseline and as soon as I hit the
baseline what is going to happen now
you'll notice here that the baseline of
this seven six five all of them are just
lined up regardless of it is too much
tall on takes too much space from the
top or bottom wherever it does you can
expand that to a little bit more but
it's going to always keep in to the
baseline height and again a classic
mistake let me also tell you that that
I'm going to say people expect this but
there's a little bit trickier let me
show you that and what for that I'm
going to select the h1 and I'm going to
give it a font size off let's just say
30 pixels which is really insane but let
me show you here come on did I say that
or let's just give it a 50 pixel which
is going to be really really big okay
now this is
this looks like a really big is it
getting selected or not let me just try
to give it a color and we're going to
get a color of black okay yep it is
getting selected now although it's not
getting much bigger here but what you
will notice that now it's still this is
going to line up and this is one of the
beauty about the flex lock that once you
are using the Flex box everything just
stays there and no matter what the size
is what the other properties you are
defining and are you putting extra CSS
or word on top of that so that's that's
the power of the CR this flex box and I
always recommend to just align
everything using the Flex box okay
because what flex box gives you is the
power of aligning element so just keep
everything inside the divisions and then
just align all of your division on the
page however you want to have and then
start adding element inside it like h1
tags and images and all of that because
flexbox will just keep it there keep it
there and that's super important okay so
this was pretty interesting video on now
you have the idea about the two
properties the justified content and
align items again these are both
container level properties we haven't
yet applied any rule to the inside or
the child elements we are going to cover
them up but first let's cover up all the
container level properties</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
