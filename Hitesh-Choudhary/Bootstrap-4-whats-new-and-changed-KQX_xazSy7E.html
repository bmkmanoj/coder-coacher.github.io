back again with another video in this
video I would like to talk about the
bootstrap phone so everybody is excited
that we are moving from bootstrap 3 to
bootstrap 4 and we already know that
bootstrap 3 was a big hit big success
every developer loves that so a lot of
new features are coming up with the
bootstrap 4 and this is the only movie
that you need to watch to find out about
all those changes that are going to
happen in the bootstrap 4 so let's get
started so the bootstrap 3 has been
already a favorite for a lot of
developers who want to design their
website which is very much responsive on
the mobile interface as well as onto the
large screen large screen sizes as well
so first of all I'll be talking about
the rapid changes that is going to
affect quite a lot when you will be
migrating your websites from bootstrap 3
to bootstrap 4 and these are pretty good
and drastic changes so let's get started
with that and there is no such
particular list or order in which I'm
talking about but yes these changes will
happen so first of all the bootstrap 4
is dropping the support for Internet
Explorer 8 now if you are just like me
who never ever cares about the internet
explorer then it's okay but in case you
had a developer who has to design a lot
of things formally in a company and has
to worry about the Internet Explorer 8
as well then it's going to be a lot of
issues because now Internet Explorer 8
support is completely dropped from the
bootstrap phone so that's gonna be news
number 1
now after that bootstrap is dropping the
support for the glyph accounts the glyph
icons as well and in fact if you are a
seasonal developer or even if you are
little bit into the development you know
that bootstrap glyphicon icons are not
that much great and in fact that has
been overtaken by the font awesome so
everybody use the font awesome anyways
so it's always a good idea to drop the
Caliph account support and that is
another suspense there now another
interesting thing about the bootstrap is
now they are supporting the cards which
is a good CSS thing and I don't want to
go into much depth of that but the good
news is they are now supporting the
cards but this also means that they are
dropping this
four panels and thumbs and the wells as
well so do take care if you have
designed a lot of thumbs and wells in
your previous coded web site and you are
migrating they are no longer supported
and you have to code them by your own in
the CSS one thing that has bug - almost
every developer in their career is some
of the styles that are applied by the
browser itself so whether we design a
normal HTML CSS ID or use a framework
like bootstrap we always face this
problem that browser tries to depend
apply all its default stylings to our
web pages and we have to include a lot
of long list that normalize or reboot
all those CSS so the good thing is
bootstrap code is including the reboot
dot CSS which will work as a normalized
CSS or basically what it will it is
going to do is simply it's going to
normalize everything in the browser so
the browser default sizes are completely
gone and that's one less thing that I
have to be worried about now also there
are a few subtle changes in the tables
and the forms but they are not gigantic
changes yes they are for sure the
changes but I won't call them it a much
of the thing that you need to be worried
about just a few names of the classes
and some subtle changes are there so yes
do watch out for them if you are just
trying to migrate your website from
three to four now another interesting
thing that is happening back end in the
bootstrap that you will really like is
now bootstrap is migrating from last to
SAS and to be honest SAS is much more
great and much more powerful I believe
that in the near future a lot of things
that we do in the SAS like declaring the
variables and all these stuffs will be
migrating towards the basic CSS in the
future just like html5 is far more
better than the HTML for obviously I
would like to see these changes in the
CSS normalized normal form of the CSS as
well but for now CSS is getting updated
quite a lot in the bootstrap so we are
migrating from less to s CSS which is a
good news in case you are getting
worried about the 12 column grid size so
don't worry about that 12 column grid
size is not going anywhere it's going to
stick there and
actually that's the base foundation of
the bootstrap and changing them quite a
lot is gonna be moving the users on to
other frameworks like foundation and
everything but they have done a pretty
nice job in keeping the the 12 column
grid as it is now also they are playing
quite a lot about the smallest size out
there like 768 pixels and everything and
changing them sometimes to 544 pixels
sometimes 540 pixels but I believe that
is going to be much more stable as we
roll out as the bootstrap guys roll out
more alphas and betas but again as of
now I can expect a new size a new
smaller size is coming up but I cannot
be much sure about it because they there
has been some subtle things in the betas
as I was analyzing but again for sure we
can expect a much smaller screen size so
far we have been doing this with the
spatial media queries but I think
bootstrap is now trying to support that
as well
the final upgrade that I would like to
talk about in the bootstrap 4 is my
favorite one and is navigation bar now I
always hated the navigation bar in the
bootstrap 3 because it was overly cooked
there were so many inclusion of the
classes and the changing of the styles
and the CSS and the links was so much
pain because I think somehow it could
have been done a lot better
and the same thing has been done in the
bootstrap for now it's much more better
much more great and easy to start that
that's the most important thing that I
would like to see there it should be
easy to restyle the things obviously
nobody is going to use the default
navigation bar of the bootstrap
everybody changes it according to the
theme of the website or their personal
style so this has been changed quite a
lot and yes there are some here and
there changes as well obviously I cannot
discuss all of those changes in just one
movie but for sure I'll be uploading
more movies about what are the changes
and what are the classes that has been
changed and a lot of stuff like that so
I hope you have enjoyed the movie so far
and in case you have enjoyed make sure
you do hit the subscribe button I'll
come back with more movies in the
meantime share this movie with someone
who can get benefit with us I'll catch
you up
next movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
