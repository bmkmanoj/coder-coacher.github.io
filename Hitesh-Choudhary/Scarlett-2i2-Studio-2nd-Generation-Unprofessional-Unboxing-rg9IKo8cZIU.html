with another video and in this video
we're gonna be doing an unprofessional
unboxing so if you have been following
along in this channel you know sometimes
I do unprofessional unboxings not very
often just sometimes although I do get a
lot of stuff from Amazon I should be
doing that more often I buy a lot of
gadgets but from now onwards I have
decided that I'll be doing sometimes
these fun unprofessional unboxings so
the first thing is what do you need for
an unboxing now just like Jerry Riggs
everything says the glass is a glass it
can break similarly we need a knife a
knife is a knife and it can cut so when
kitchen knife will surely work what is
the next thing that we need to do an
unboxing of course a box there we go
delivered from Amazon so let's do an
unprofessional unboxing and first find
out a best place to make sure that your
knife goes up usually I'm gonna go
roughly like that without even worried
about is it going to work or not and
that's how everybody does unboxing come
on get out
surprise surprise
it's a double unboxing I didn't expected
that there are a lot of scenes on this
box looks like a nuclear weapon is being
delivered
and this is the third box that we're
gonna do an unboxing come on this is
like unboxing inside an unboxing inside
an unboxing it reminds me of a movie can
you comment down below which movie is
that
finally unboxed a box and there we go
who cares about this and there we go
this is what we are having a scarlet
machine so let's try to open that up
probably we don't need a knife this time
there we go
and ladies and gentlemen this is the
main product that we are talking about
in here so can you go outside let's talk
about this guy
I'm very just going to open up
whose so this is your Focusrite machine
looks amazing from top bottom left right
wherever you go and this is how it looks
you know that already it's amazing so
this is the main hero of the story the
scarlett 2i2 there we go and this is one
here no need of that we got a really
nice mount for the mic okay I like that
a pair of headphone and there's fun
stuff about these headphones that look
at this look at this how big this guy is
but luckily it has got this mount so
that this can become a tiny guy but
obviously we'll be using it in this way
so there we go and the next thing that
you get is a nice mic I'm not pretty
sure that I'll be using it or not or
will be upgrading in the future where
there we go
you got your scarlet and it looks nice
feels nice
and there we go whoo it's a long table
it's a really long table with you know
what it's it I hope many of you do and
finally one more wire and come on get
out do we have anything else nope some
paperwork which nobody absolutely cares
about I have absolutely no idea why
everybody shows that there is a
paperwork yes there's a paperwork that's
it then throw it away I really think
that sometimes even the company guys
don't even read that kind of paperwork
so there we go and this is the cable so
by the way in case you're one whoops so
by the way in case you are wondering
this the small cable goes from here to
the computer this gigantic big cable
goes in Mike to the Scarlett and there
you go there you're there your
headphones are how does it look that is
amazing that is amazing it feels really
good but I'm not sure whether I'll be
using it or we'll be switching back to
Audio Technica but anyways this is your
unboxing with the kitchen knife so I
think that's it and that's your
unprofessional unboxing of scarlett 2i2
I hope you enjoyed it if you have
enjoyed it give this video a thumbs up

want to have more fun with the tech
stuff and I'm going to surely catch you
up in the next video
