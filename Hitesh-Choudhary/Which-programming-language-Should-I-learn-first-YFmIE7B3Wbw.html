again on my YouTube channel so I hope
your what you have watched my previous
videos they were pretty good so what
we're going to do today today we are
going to answer another very important
question what should be my first
programming language to be honest this
question is a pretty vague and why so
because most of the curriculums out
there in India teaches about the C
programming language to be their first
programming language but I completely
disagree with the concept so what should
be your first programming language when
you start out to learn the programming
or the coding it depends yes it depends
a lot and I would like to say this that
it really takes a whole scenario to in
order to understand what should be a
first programming language let's say
that you are starting out with the C
programming language just like the
curriculum is saying out to you and you
want to design a web application which
should be a social media oriented now
learning a C programming language in
that scenario is a total waste yes I
would agree with that so what should be
your first programming language okay
let's answer this question by defining
what are the types of things that you
can do with that okay let's get started
with the software development let's say
you want to design the software that
should look good or look good on the
windows or maybe some platform like that
so I would say that just start out by
learning the Java because you can design
some cool desktop application in the
Java now here is the myth you should
learn C C++ and then comes the Java it's
said total myth yes this is the truth
out there you should not spend your time
in C and C++ if you are really
interested in learning the Java you
should directly jump onto the Java there
are no such things as prerequisite for
the Java eventually over the time you
will learn the concepts of variables
classes object-oriented and all such
things so no need to spend time with the
C out there in that particular case okay
let's move ahead on to the next part
let's say you want to design a web
application so what you should learn in
that case now I would say you should
learn JavaScript for that now again
javascript is booming out there and you
should really spend some time in
JavaScript but if you want to learn the
JavaScript
HTML and CSS are going to be the
prerequisite so make sure that you do
first of all that now talking about the
JavaScript the concepts like nodejs
react and flus flux are booming out
there so you should spend a little time
with the JavaScript if you are
interested in the web development or web
design now that's another story now if
you're interested in the Mac development
let's say you want to design an app for
iOS or maybe Mac or Macintosh Apple
watch maybe then spending the time in
PHP or the JavaScript or C or Java is
totally waste of time you should be
learning Swift in that case yes object
the Objective C is almost a dead now and
everyone is recommending to just get
started with the Swift out there okay
that's the another story for the iOS
development but let's say you directly
want to design an Android app in that
case you should be jumping directly onto
the Java basics and then directly onto
the Android app now no need to be a beep
master on all other languages and all of
that again I would say that if you know
a couple of languages that will surely
help but no need to spend you a lot of
time in this and that jargons okay so
web development is covered in droid
discovered and then we have covered the
iOS as well what else you can do of
course you can jump into the game
development with the unity for that you
need to stay time on to the c-sharp
development as well so that's the whole
story again I would say don't go with
the curriculum
if the curriculum says that learn C and
C++ that's another story just try to
focus on what you want to do let's say
you want to design an Android app go for
Java you want to design an iOS app go
with the Swift if you want to design
some web applications or websites widths
and logics and all of that go for the
JavaScript and all of that now again
here's a little twist you might be
saying when should I learn the PHP it
was a long time ago now I would say you
don't need much of the PHP of course if
you learn that would be great but now
the technology can be done quietly well
with the JavaScript so you should be
spending time on the node react flux and
all of such things like that and if you
want to be into the game development C
sharp unity
pretty great idea but I would say that's
not all the idea but you should get with
that okay some of the people asked me
this question as well which language
should have I started my programming
career now that's a complete not at all
a good question I would say because the
time when I started the programming was
a very different time and now it's a
different time so you should choose
according to you I would say I started
with the COBOL or something like that
and if you want to learn the COBOL in
nowadays everyone is going to say are
you crazy or are you nuts out there so
definitely don't do that don't just rely
on me which language I started out there
now again these all domains are pretty
good pretty enough good but you can also
choose one more path out there there is
a path for the web development and
desktop or software development with the
Python now if you are a complete
beginner and just want to start with the
programming I would say try to start
with the Python and now you might be
looking at me hey Python it's such a
great language it's so much experience
requirement of the languages no it's not
it's really the simplest and a lot of
universities out there like Texas
University the Harvard University
all of them are teaching Python as a
beginner language just like what we are
doing in India as a C programming these
are very tough I would like to say that
but again go ahead and try out with the
Python it's a really simplest language
or if you are a Mac oriented you have a
Macintosh OS X or something
start with the Swift so that's up to me
now the decision is definitely going to
be yours so final decision is in your
hand but please notify me in the comment
below which language are you getting
started with and with that I would like
to say like comment and subscribe to my
channel and see you out there in the
next movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
