channel again so as you can notice I got
new office here this is pretty exciting
as you can tell it from my face it's
really really exciting having in the
office it's much more cool to record
videos much more comfortable ok let's
not stay comfortable because this is
just a table and suggest a chair but
again I'm really excited about the new
office center that I have here and the
reason why I'm having in the office is
because I'm getting much more serious
about YouTube it's simply because the
response that I'm getting a lot of
people asked me to move into the
professionally into it so here I am the
lighting upgrades they're there to my is
just out of the frame
it's really so cool to be on the YouTube
and having so many subscribers out there
in case you haven't subscribed yet
please hit the subscribe button now why
should you subscribe to me so I have
expanded my content in my channel first
of all there was only technical talks so
I would be expanding the technical talks
a little bit it wouldn't be just about
how to learn programming and coding and
about that it will also include the
technical news so now I won't be reading
the solution kind of in news out there I
would be doing a little bit more I'll be
talking about the technical news who has
been hard to recently what's happening
in the hacking news hacking would what's
happening in the technical stuff for
example the link disposal intercom the
Microsoft biased lynda.com what's the
race they are behind what's they're
paying what's the endgame that's
happening behind that there's gonna be
pure technical stuff the two poor
playlists that I'll be adding on my
channel will be the app reviews so I'll
be getting the new apps and I'll tell
you what I think about them as a simple
user perspective it may be a new game a
Productivity app or a recent launch out
there in case you have an app which you
have their own the Android store or the
iris stone do post merely I'll make a
review for that I'll tell you very
clearly if it is a good or just a crap
so that's gonna be about it and
perfectly is that I'm gonna be adding is
gonna be very different it's gonna say
the startup reviews so there are tons of
startup that are going ahead my target
would be majorly based on the Indian
startup but definitely the worldwide
stalker which are catching the eye I
will for sure include be including that
now this will help you quite a lot in
updating your products your services
because lets us say for example you are
not aware about the a page cloud which
is fairly a new startup it helps you to
create the websites in a flash of time
it's really quick very fantastic a lot
of people doesn't know about what's
happening what's not happening about all
such things so I'll be doing all the
startups maybe they they might be in the
seed phase or the face perm or whatever
it is I don't care about that stuff all
I care about is the product good and
should you try it or not so this is
going to be all about it and again
subscribe I would be much more serious
there will be videos every week apart
from when I'll be traveling but whenever
we whenever I will be back from the
traveling I'll share my experience too
because I travel a lot I have seen a lot
of part of the world and it's a lot of
things that I can share with you whether
you should go to China Paris with the
land New York maybe Las Vegas already
thing else so tons of things are gonna
come up on this channel and again yeah
I'm excited about my new office setup so
there's gonna be a lot of fun here so go
ahead and subscribe the channel and see
you out there in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
