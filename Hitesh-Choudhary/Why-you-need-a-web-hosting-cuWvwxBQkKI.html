again with another video now in this
video I would like to explain why you
need a web hosting now you have purchase
your domain and somebody asked you hey
you need to buy a web hosting as well so
your client might be asking or you might
be asking why you needed an hosting now
in this video I'll explain you and walk
you through why I have actually created
this video and why you need a web
hosting so let's get started here now I
do take a lot of web projects now why
because it's really fun it's about
creativity whenever you do a web project
it's about increasing your creativity
and of course I do it for money as well
of course everybody has to pay the bills
now web project for me is really fun
because I can just take the project and
can design a web based application maybe
some back-end or just a plain old
website on an airport and can earn like
200 or 300 dollars on the go now this is
really fun and exciting because it gives
me creativity freedom as well as I can
earn some money on the goat that can pay
my bills now okay now I have got into
this situation quite a number of times
now in the previous days also an a
recently I got a client who was saying
hey I have bought a domain why I need to
buy a web hosting now this video is
going to refer this answer and even if
you are a web developer refer to this
video a number of times to your clients
and even I'm gonna use it quite a number
of times with my future clients so let
me explain you all this stuff and why
you need a web hosting as well now with
the recent advancement in the
advertisement by the spacially by the
GoDaddy
you might have seen the GoDaddy saying
that hey you can just cheaply get a
domain name and can start your website
yes that's completely true but let me
explain you with another concept let's
just say you want to start an office for
your company what do you know what you
do in that you first decide the name of
your company that you're going to set an
office then you get a board for your
office okay this is gonna be my name and
this is gonna be my bowl but wait a
minute you have just missed the key
point where is you're gonna be office
where you can put that board so
similarly when you buy a domain name you
actually are getting a company name now
you need to put
that board somewhere that's exactly what
is hosting about you need some space
where you can actually put your files so
your website might be designed in PHP
ASP node.js plain HTML simple CSS but we
need to put that file somewhere for that
web hosting is required so you need to
purchase web hosting as well with your
domain name and once you have got the
domain name that means your name is
fixed once you have got your hosting as
well now you can put your domain name
and hosting together but wait a minute
there is one more criteria there that is
known as the main name system or DNS
some call that domain name server domain
name system but you don't need to get
technicality of that it's somewhat geeky
stuff but what it's saying hey these two
needs to be linked and need to be
associated now usually with the recent
advancement of the technology and server
it doesn't take much time in the
previous days it used to take 24 hours
to link your DNS with your name and your
hosting now it's just a matter of within
three or maximum five hours that you can
connect these things now your developer
is going to do all the stuff but again
you have to give him like something like
FTP or the cPanel whatever he is asking
for he may give a good reason for that
but again really it's my advice to all
of you whenever you buy domain name buy
a hosting as well it's gonna improve
your process of giving your project to
some designer I'm gonna keep this video
always with me and I'll be referring it
to all of my clients whenever I need to
say them hey you need to buy a hosting
in case you are a developer make sure
that you check out this video and you
can refer this video to your clients as
well this is gonna be a great example
here now with this I'll catch you up in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
