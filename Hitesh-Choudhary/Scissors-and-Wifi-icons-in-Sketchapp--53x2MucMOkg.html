again with another video and in this
video we'll be designing two more icons
but the whole point of this video is to
get you know about one more tool which
is rarely used in the sketch I have seen
only a few people who actually works on
this particular tool so I just wanted to
talk about it and that's why especially
this video is created and that tool is
known as scissors tool okay so in order
to get your scissors tool first of all
right click on here click on customize
toolbar and you have to maybe look up a
little bit to find the scissors it's
really hard to find click and drag it on
the top here and that's it so there we
go our scissors tools is available ok in
order to use the scissor tool will be
creating these two icons one for Wi-Fi
and one for volume and that is actually
pretty easy to do so hold on your o so
press o on your keyboard and then we're
gonna just start from something like
Center ish hold on your option and shift
key to start building your circle just
like from here probably like big and
usually we remove border but this time
we're gonna be removing the fill and
we're gonna bump it up to something like
probably 10 is okay or 15 you can also
go for that click and hold on your
option key click and drag so that we can
have it hold down your Shift key so that
you can just shape it like that and
we're gonna have it Center now I'm gonna
be moving a little bit or option command
Z first of all hold down your option and
shift so that you can shift it at
exactly the same point I think this is
enough so my outer circle is off with
176 by 176 inner one is 124 by 124 now
comes the interesting part how we can
have it so hold down your R or press
your R key and have a rectangle we want
a rectangle which actually goes right at
the dead center of this okay so we want
a rectangle just right from here make
sure that no matter what happens it goes
exactly from the center point of the
circle okay that that's it now what we
can do is we can select this outer
circle and the rectangle notice I
haven't selected the inner one and I can
just hit subtract
and there we go it's subtracted but you
might be wondering how we are going to
get rid of these lines which are
unwanted and also this particular line
and this particular line and this
particular line still I want to keep the
dis part of it okay so the quick and
easy part is to select first of all
let's just say select the circle and
we're gonna select the scissors and
we're gonna be just notice you can just
cut any particular point between the
anchors so we're gonna cut that and we
are gonna cut that one so that was
pretty easy and simple hit enter and
there we go now we can select this outer
one and hit on scissors and now you can
just delete this part and that's it hit
enter so this is actually pretty fun and
cool tool to play around with so if you
can just have scissors like that and the
rest part is actually pretty easy and I
don't think so anybody should have any
problem in having rest of the part like
we can just have it smaller one just
like that hold on option key and just
have the bigger one here like that a
little bit and we can just click on
transform tool to transform it like
speakers and hit enter probably this is
too big I want to go a little bit
shorter one just like that and obviously
you want to reduce the size of this guy
as well so just almost like this exact
height or I can have even the grids to
make sure that they align that so if you
want to have a like grid precise
precision that is always appreciated so
we want to remove like border from both
of them and there is a quick trick here
hold down your ctrl + C to pick up
quickly or color grabber and you can
just change that like that and there we
go ctrl C to grab a color and there we
go your volume icon is nice nice and
sleek quick trick with the scissors here
ok now the next step is Wi-Fi and I
don't want my alignments to be based on
this guy so for a moment I'm gonna just
group them together and here's a quick
trick as well if you want like the
smaller one always use the scale once
you have grabbed it for example you want
a 50% of it just hit enter and there you
go probably we can have like 1
or circle in here and that will make
much more awesome but anyways I will
just remove it on to the other artboard
for a moment because I want to create
this Wi-Fi one as well so oh and hold
down your option and shift and we're
gonna have a nice big outer circle and
we want to remove the fill bump up it to
like probably 10 previously I used a 15
here but I think this is okay and then
we need option key and click and drag
hold down your Shift key and we're gonna
have something like this okay like that
and we're gonna hold down our R and we
are gonna have not the R we need to
press o escape and then o to get an oval
and we're gonna start right from dead
center hold down your option key and
Shift key and we're gonna just drag and
drop like that okay so it's almost dead
center remove the fill now this time I
want to keep the fill and I'll just
remove the border hold on this ctrl C
for quick color grabber there we go it's
a nice looking and now what I want to do
is hit R to get a rectangle and I want a
rectangle to be exactly at the dead
center and not a rectangle precisely I
need a square so I'm gonna hit shift key
so that I can have it exactly okay and
make sure it's at the right dead center
now select both of them and notice it's
not selecting the things here which I
want to select if you're feeling the
same problem go ahead and select from
the layers panel by the way my layers
panel is a mess I haven't just walked
through it now usually what people says
is I want to do is subtract here but you
don't want to do subtract here because
if you will be doing a subtract you will
be getting exactly opposite of what we
need so hit command Z and we want an
intersect this time so there we go your
Wi-Fi icon is now available now what we
want to do is do exactly same thing with
this guy and this guy as well but there
are some neat tricks so hit R on your
keyboard and hold down Shift key and now
we want a circle like that
okay and I want it to be like dead
center from this guy okay
since the circle is coinciding so this
shouldn't be a problem select this guy
and this guy and we can say intersect
there we go
and finally the last one so hit R and
again hold down your Shift key so that
you can have like a dead center ish
thing and I think okay I want it to be
from here dead center
okay so I can just select this guy and
this guy and then I can say something
like oops not like this I thought I can
make it a little bit work like that but
now it's a mess so just go back here
okay and we are gonna be coinciding that
with this guy I had to use my keyboard
shortcuts to have it like precisely and
then I can select these two guys and hit
intersect and there we go my Wi-Fi icon
is almost ready not precisely and
perfectly so what you can do is select
the outer one hit the scissors and then
you can chop down a few things and that
is actually pretty easy to work on with
it enter once it's done select the inner
one hit the scissors chop down this guy
and this guy hit enter and there we go
our nice precise awesome Wi-Fi icon is
ready if you want to beef it up a little
bit like this guy come on doing to that
you can always like improve the
thickness of it something like that and
we can do the same thing for this guy
improve the thickness too little bit or
however you want okay and that's pretty
much it what you have to do is select
all of that now here's a trick part
some people just select this at this
point and just try to hit rotate it's
not going to work there we go although
it's a nice cool design but it's not
working so command Z so before even
selecting your transform tool make sure
you select the shape and group them
together you don't want to do any union
or anything because it's gonna make a
mess this time what we want to do is
just press command G to make a group
and then you can select your rotate and
there we go we want to rotate it to
exactly like 45 degrees hit enter and
there we go
your nice beautiful icon is ready here
you can always go back here ctrl C to
grab a nice color like that and I can go
back here ctrl C to grab it like that
control C and grab it there we go
so our two icons are ready completely
and you have also learned about two
important tools not one not two just one
important tool which is scissors it was
so much fun to play around with so I
hope you have enjoyed this video and
have learned something amazing and cool
tricks about the sketch especially the
scissor part I'm really happy to have
this city that's so fun to even create
these videos so that's it for this video
