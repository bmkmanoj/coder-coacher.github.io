the WordPress series so in this video
we're gonna talk about the content and I
hope everybody is now familiar with the
installation thing and just kind of a
basic setup of the wordpress of course
on the localhost now let's go ahead and
proceed on the content that you can put
on the WordPress website now at the
initial days WordPress was only meant to
publish posts and that's it but now
things have changed and entire WordPress
website can act as a full-fledged
website or maybe a mixer website and
blog post as well now on this page you
can see we have got four types of
content that you can publish onto a
WordPress website and that is post media
pages and comments now of course
obviously the comments are dependent on
the third-party readers who are reading
your content on your pages but rest of
the other three things which is post
media and pages is totally dependent on
you how you want to publish them and
obviously the question that arises here
is should I be using a post or should I
be using your pages now for any kind of
WordPress developer or WordPress setup
kind of a person understanding the
difference between the two things is
super important and you should always
keep that in mind whether you should
publish a post or a pages now I always
give the simple question to you that
will help you to answer the question
thing that whether you should have pages
are post and the cancer is the question
is actually should you be uploading the
link of that page or post in your
navigation menu bar it is really as
simple as that
now just try to assume that you are
about to hit something known as about us
of a website now about us yes definitely
it needs to go into your menu bar or the
navigation bar that means it should be
pages now obviously the major difference
here is that the post actually is
time-based
just like your Facebook post or your
Twitter post they keeps on going at the
down as the time progress but something
known as the about Us page terms and
condition pays or the legal pages or
contact us pages these pages don't go
down with the time they don't just
disappear by the time they are always
meant to be there on the website so that
is why these kind of
should always be they be created as a
pages on the other hand rest of the
things your all articles like the iPhone
launch or an Android n launch or Android
o launch whatever there is it should
usually go in the in the post now
technically on the background side
everything is usually like a post but
yes there are subtle differences but
most of the time most of the things are
equivalent to the post okay so I hope
this clears up your query that whether
should I be creating a page or a post
now again both of your pages and post
can consist of any kind of data there it
can be a text it can be an image it can
be a video or it can be an embedded
video like YouTube's and other stuff so
let's get started first of all and talk
a little bit about these posts so on the
home page of the dashboard you can see
there is a quick draft here where it
says title and what's on your mind and
you can save it a draft now yes you can
write your drafts here and can publish
them later on as a post but I don't
recommend that recommend them much to
the big nurse here all I recommend is
you can go to the post and you can check
all of your posts here you can add a new
post you can add a new category and tags
we will talk about the categories and
tags a little bit later right now let's
just click on the add new and we are
going to add a new post now you might be
seeing that there is something here
which says add a post of it says enter
your title here and you can add your
content here yes it's a good place to
get started but before that I would
recommend you to go ahead and do one
setting here and also I will tell you
one of the interesting thing so let's
just call this as test post there we go
and I'm not gonna save that as a draft
I'm not gonna publish it as of now I'm
gonna just move back on to my dashboard
and notice it says do you want to leave
the site yes I want to leave this site
and now let me show you that going to
the post and all posts the great thing
about this WordPress is it saves all of
your data so test post notice it has
automatically saved it as a draft a very
very good lifesaver there that in case
accidentally you moved away from the
page or something happen and you close
your browser your browser it
automatically saves your draft it saves
a lady really good
there now before you start writing any
post or pages go into your appearance
and not in the parents go into your
settings and go to your permalinks again
go to your settings and go to permalinks
okay and here you'll see some of the
common settings for your blog post now
depends on what is your preferences you
may want to select different things here
now right now it says custom structure
which has year-month-day and then the
post name I usually don't like this I
like the post name which is something
like this you can have your website name
and then after you have sample post name
now from the SEO perspective this is the
book the best setting you can have but
again there are different perspective
and different scenarios where you might
want to select that but this is one of
the best I can suggest you now at the
learned code online website if you'll go
on to this link or any link you'll
notice we are following the same
structure here of the every page so
whatever the title name is we usually
like to keep the URL as same as it is so
here also we are gonna select the post
name and we are gonna hit Save Changes
there we go okay and basically what this
link is doing at this permalink thing is
making some edits and changes in your
htaccess file now htaccess file is
always there on to your website it's
usually hidden I will be talking about
these htaccess file later on in the
series itself but it's a good point of
editing these things if you are already
aware about the htaccess you can always
write your own rule but I don't think so
that's a needed okay so let's go back
into your post and hit on all post and
we're gonna go into the test post now
now what you'll notice that now your
permalink is completely on dependent on
use so for example it was a test post
now but you can always change it for
example let's go on to the learn code
online web site and let's go for the ten
qualities for a perfect programmer a
very great post if you want to read that
out so let's just look out for this
title here so I'm gonna copy this and
I'm gonna paste this here now it's not
going to change it as soon as you edit
your title here it just changes it for
the very first time but since you get an
edit button here you can always change
this now the interest
part here is that whenever you add these
things please don't add the spaces there
it is not at all recommended in the
previous days people used to use these
underscore as well but the latest
guideline says of the SEO that you
should use a hyphens instead of
underscore so replace all of your spaces
with the underscore case sensitivity
doesn't really matter in case of SEO
perspective but it's it's okay it
depends on you how you really want to go
with that oops so I'm gonna change that
to all the dashes and there we go
so this is now our URL which is much
better make sure you hit the okay to
save it and now URL is completely set
now how you want to add content on your
website is totally on you and obviously
there is a saying that content is always
King so make sure you write really good
it doesn't really matter that it should
be absolutely good in in case of
grammars and all those punctuation x'
yes it really matters a little bit but
on the end of the day it's the content
that you really want to serve and it
should be original so what we're gonna
do as of now we are gonna just take some
of the content from here and we have
some great images some of the paragraphs
and headings I will show you the links
where you can have those awesome images
without having the knowledge of
Photoshop and other things shortly we
are going to do that as of now let's
just have some of the headlines here so
we're gonna just take some of the bar of
some of the things he had traits of a
great programmer let's just copy that
and paste that it doesn't look good so
what you get with the wordpress post is
this top menu bar and if I'll toggle
this you have a lot more options to
explore now as a simple exercise I will
give you the option to explore all of
these buttons what they do and how you
can edit that so for example I can
select this and can change this to
heading 1 and it will become a heading 1
and obviously if I just add a little bit
more content let's just say a couple of
paragraph there just like that and I'll
add one more there ok and what you'll
notice that right now this says as
paragraph now obviously depends on your
situation how you want to edit that most
of the editing had its and everything
are being mentioned to you for
example this is a programmatically thing
that you can have pre-formatted or you
can have like heading six there or if
you want to have just a paragraph it is
also there you can just change it back
to paragraph there are also a bility of
different fonts and everything right now
let's not go into the depth of that but
one more thing I would like to mention
here is that as soon as you move on to
the text part everything will be shown
to you as kind of a code perspective so
if you are good in HTML or a little bit
CSS you can actually manipulate all of
your posts just directly here that's a
good way but most of the people used
WordPress because they won't don't want
to code everything just like that so
it's okay if you want to just use that
so as of now we're gonna save our draft
and notice we are not adding any
categories any format any tags or any
featured image as of now so that's why
we are not publishing it shortly in the
future we are going to add more things
into this blog post and I'll show you
all the ins and outs of these things I
think this is more than enough for just
one video so now you have knowledge
about pages and post and which one you
should be using which one you should not
be using just onto one more note that I
want to give to you in this that most of
the posts have an option to have
comments at the bottom of the post so
that user can interact with you but by
default all of your pages the comments
and the author section will be disabled
there and it really makes sense you
don't want some comments on your about
Us page or contact us page you want all
of your comments on to some kind of
iPhone release or Android and release
all such kind of post so make sure you
also keep that in mind that's it for
this video and I will surely catch you
up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
