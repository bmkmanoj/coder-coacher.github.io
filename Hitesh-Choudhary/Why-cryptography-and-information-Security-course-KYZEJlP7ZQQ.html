now first of all let me welcome to the
all of you community out there who are
watching my videos and have posted some
previous comments on my CDs and quite
others
now let's directly jump into our cities
what this topic is what is going to be
about in this series and a lot more
stuff and you can expect lots of maps
from me as well so first of all let's
talk about the course now before I jump
and go out about the definitions of the
cryptography and lots of such things I
would like to share experience that
would help us to understand one very
major question that is why cryptography
and InfoSec course now first of all the
word InfoSec means here the information
security now before targeting my
audience I would like to skip with two
kinds of people are two communities of
the people in this course category so
the very two interested interested
people for which I'm not at all bothered
and I would expect not to be in this
cities are the first which are not at
all bothered about the information
security or any kind of security stuff
should not actually be watching this
course because this contains a lots and
lots of security talks a lots of
breakage of algorithms lots of designing
of algorithm a lots of attacks and all
such things
the second types of people which are
true computer professionals and by true
computer professional means you are
already a great designer of algorithm
the our algorithm might be used all over
the world or you are a very famous
cryptographer kept analyst who is
working with some great organizations
trying to break some algorithms which
are newly designed or trying to do some
security in research stuff by this
community I don't mean those types of
persons who are really not into the
professional and very extensively the
persons for which I am interested in
this entire course are first of all the
university students who are having the
cryptography in their course labors
although you will find lots of people
about the cryptography topic talking a
lot on to the
lectures and videos you have got this
cryptography in your semester exam or
maybe such other exams but you find that
all of the peoples are just jargon and
jargon and jargon boring old lectures of
one and a half hour or maybe two hour
Cantonese talking and not just putting
the things according to you so that is
them first of all my target the second
target is the hackers now the hackers I
have divided them according to me the
two categories the fractals and the
fractals the factors are the freshers
into the hacking community they are
trying to jump into this a great
research line our grade in full sex
education or such lines they are just
moving into that but they don't know how
to start the things even with the ABC to
intuit the facts second one is the
practice the practical guides when I
move into a lots of universities out
there lecturing on information security
usually students ask me a very important
question said how to hack into the
Facebook how to hack into the gmail
account these guys are really curious
about the information security later on
the face they try to learn the things by
themselves or some video courses or some
life courses going out their institution
they learn the things by doing the
things practicals once this is really a
good stuff but think about yourself that
you are a great hacker you know quite
the things like hacking into the
accounts hacking into the applications
or maybe even some good ones like
designing your own exploits and things
but hey ask yourself a question do you
know what is DES algorithm how the
function it works do you know about the
md5 algorithm do you know about these
basic stuffs but let's say you don't
know about anything of that so what's
the point of being such a hacker who can
actually know a couple of tools and can
do workout into them but don't know the
basics of the cryptography and
information security at such a great
extent so my course is going to be
target all about such thing I hope I was
pretty much clear about the basic
targets of my course and one more great
news is out there feel
free to share my videos of this course
as much as you can on YouTube on Twitter
on your Facebook account or your on your
blogs maybe there will be no licensing
issue on these courses there will be no
pricing on this course as well so I'll
be dedicating all of my time to the
community for the upgradation of the
community so without wasting any more
time let's jump and create some more
cool videos so that you can learn a lot
more about the cryptography algorithms
and of course a lots of maths that's all
for this video and thank you so much for
watching
