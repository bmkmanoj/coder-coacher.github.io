with another video and in this video I
have a lot of update to give you guys
and yes by a lot I mean a lot of updates
are coming up first and foremost update
you might have already read that in the
title of the video we finally got an app
for learn code online now recently I
have been busy in making this app and
that is why some of my work and YouTube
videos did suffered a little bit not
much not much a little bit but yes
finally we have got an app here now the
app is right now being rolled out only
for the Android and yes the app for iOS
is also almost ready but right now I
have to figure out some ways to skip the
in-app purchase because when you make
any transaction from Google store or
Apple Store in case you don't know that
you have to give a 30% to those guys so
20% for just a small amount that I'm
taking for other courses is really a big
deal for me because I'm not being funded
by a huge ventures I don't have any kind
of that much funding all I'm trying to
do is make a difference on my own and
trying to teach people how the actually
programming codes and everything works
on so I'm on my own and still trying to
do a lot of things but whole story short
we finally got an awesome app for
Android that you can get yup now I'll
put the link of the Android app right on
the screen as well as in the description
section below here as well so go ahead
the love that you have been showing on
my channel please show some love on the
app as well I would be really really
thankful for all of you if you give can
give some amazing rating to the app as
well as some stars I would be really
happy if you can do so now that's not
just the update I have a couple of more
news for you as well as some tips that
is going to increase your productivity
and the speed of learning code as well
now the very first thing that I would
like to share is the tip tip to enhance
the productivity and speed of learning
the programming now programming is
almost similar to mat now I don't mean
by that that you have to do some kind of
linear equation or algebra
equation now that's the different part
what I mean by that it's similar to the
math just like when you used to be in
the school and everybody used to say
something like that you don't learn math
by seeing how the problem is being
solved you learn the math by actually
taking the pen and paper and writing
that solution and that's exactly how we
learn programming as well you don't
learn programming by simply just
watching the videos that I do in front
of you and that's it no you are not
going to learn it probably some of you
are going to learn it by that way but
majority of the people are going to
learn by writing that code now what I
recommend to all of you is download the
Android app on your mobile phone
keep that mobile phone on the side and
keep your laptop screen in front of you
whatever I do that in the code just try
to replicate that exactly on your screen
you will realize that your learning
speed or learning productivity speed is
going to increase at least by 50% and
that's a big number and you you will be
really surprised that you don't have to
re-watch the video if you do that one
and that is amazing so that's my number
one tip to all of you guys for
increasing your productivity and
basically that's the role of this app
what are the course you are going to get
there you can simply just watch them on
the go and can do in your laptop so
that's the number one goal of this app
update number two which I have already
discussed in one of the previous video
that now everything has moved to HTTPS
now at first when we launched the thing
things were not on the HTTPS because hey
version 1 is always not so amazing and
things and get increased and get more
amazing as they progress and so we are
doing it so right now as you can see on
the website now the entire website is on
HTTPS version now in case you are not
able to see that on HTTPS version
because probably your cache are not
clear or your browser history is forcing
it to move on HTTP I highly recommend to
move everything on HTTPS and if your
browser is not helping you out just make
sure you're forcefully type their HTTPS
and the entire website should be running
on HTTPS now so to all those people who
were complaining me hey HTTPS is not
there on your website hey you're my
browser phase
DPS is not there and it says the website
is not secure it's kind of a browser
thing but we finally got rid of that
problem and I am proud of that
update number three and this is really
an amazing update now we are writing
blogs at learned code online dot in
slash blog constantly now at least five
times a week and maybe more sometimes
eight or nine times in a week but at
least five times in a week we are
writing blog so that you can consider as
almost every single day and these are
not just the blog being written for SEO
purposes these are the blog written to
enhance the knowledge giving you special
tips about new technology like for
example wire framing or installing SSL
certificate or what is the data
structure importance of data structure
all these things are sometimes easier to
discuss in the blogs so what I recommend
you is to check out the blog almost
every single day we do update it
regularly and what you can do is we have
integrated the blog in our Android app
as well so you can just keep that
Android app in your phone and when you
wake up in the morning or maybe before
hitting gym or might be just commuting
through your college or university or to
your office you can just check that blog
in your app and you can just read one
article and within I would say within
just five or six minutes you can learn a
new topic or can learn at least about it
later on you can explore that a little
bit more but that's a good point of
getting updated in the world of
technology so these are basically the
most important updates I wanted to share
with you about the app about HTTP
transformation that we are doing as well
as updates on the blog now for the blog
I would like to thank Edward because he
has been helping me in writing all of
those blogs he is basically our very
first intern of course paid intern for
writing that blog and he is doing an
amazing job in writing that useful
articles he's doing a lot of research in
that so I would highly recommend if you
can share our pets work at learned code
online share it on your Facebook show
some love to our pit as well he's been
working really hard for you guys so show
some love for him as well I would be
really I would really appreciate that
cool story short we finally have got
updated blog and we have got an end
