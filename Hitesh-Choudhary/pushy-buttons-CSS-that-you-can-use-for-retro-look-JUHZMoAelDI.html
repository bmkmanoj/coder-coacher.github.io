again with another video in this video I
want to talk about an amazing library or
just a CSS file I would not call this as
an amazing library but CSS and some of
you might be wondering why such videos
now recently I was in Bangalore which is
like a Silicon Valley of India and I got
surprised that when I talked about the
few libraries that I was using for my
clients with some experienced developers
they got amazed by it and they said hey
we can also use these libraries and
instead of reinventing the wheel we
would like to use them so it made me
realize that there is so much that I can
share with all of you guys that there
are so much internet is full of amazing
libraries and NPM packages and Android
libraries that you can use in your
project and can make a project much more
awesome so in this year you're gonna see
a lot of such videos we're all gonna be
talking about my favorite libraries CSS
stuff that is already there on the
Internet
Internet has got some amazing things I'm
not talking about the YouTube comments
but yes there is lot of amazing things
that you can use so without wasting any
more time let's start with today's one
today's one is an awesome clicky button
and not I'll be just talking about it
I'll open up my editor and we'll show
you how basically you can use them it's
so simple so retro look and it looks
just awesome so let's go back on to my
computer and talk about this awesome
clicky button there are so many amazing
thing on the github that sometimes we
don't realize that they are available
for free to use and recently I use this
in one of my clients project it looks
showed oh because it was kind of a retro
look ish thing and these all buttons are
so easy to quit now yes you can do that
already in the CSS but why to just
reinvent the wheel when there is such
thing available so what I can do is show
you quickly by firing up my atom and
just load up a new folder here which is
empty don't worry about this dear store
this is kind of a Mac ish thing so I'm
going to create a new file and I'm gonna
save that here I'm gonna say that in my
video and I'm gonna call this as index
dot HTML and there we go looks pretty
good and let's just have a boilerplate
code there we go and we need one more
file here so come add new and
command s and this is gonna be simply
CSS so I'm gonna call this as pushy dot
CSS because all the push-button code is
gonna go here now the first thing is to
link it up here and that's gonna be
super easy so link columns CSS and in
case you are wondering how this is all
magically happening go ahead and take my
free course on Emmet by which all of
these things are happening so quickly I
love it so pushy okay now these things
are good but we need to just have a
division to just walk through with the
things so they've dot container and I'm
not using any bootstrap but still I'm
gonna be aligning things a little bit
here and I'm gonna have it just h1 for
here for the time I'm gonna say hey just
like that okay so save that and it's
time to just open up I could have used a
live reload but you know what oh this is
how it looks so we need a customized CSS
obviously so command N and we're gonna
save that I'm gonna call this as style
dot CSS there we go time to link this
baby up and weight is about index file
why are you opening up okay and after
this bushy I would like to have my CSS
files so if I make any changes these
also do appear otherwise pushy we'll
just override them so make sense so link
call them CSS and there we go and
obviously we are gonna call that style
dot CSS so let's just grab this
container and edit a few things into it
so we're gonna go into style dot CSS and
dot there we go katia and now we can
just have a few things first thing that
I would like to have is background color
I would like to pick the color I'm
always worried about the color so I've
got this one I'll choose this guy in
case you're wondering this is the
project that I did on fun stuff learned
code on line dot and slash flat color
picker so go ahead and grab this guy and
paste a color it should look pretty good
and there we go not so awesome it will
look awesome just trust me
now first of all I'm gonna change the
color to be awesome and it's gonna look
awesome on white save that go back here
looks pretty good now we want to change
the height of this guy as well so let's
just grab a 500 pixel for this demo and
looks pretty good now I want to align
that so I'm gonna say
a display of flex big fan of flex
because it's so easy let me tell you why
and this is because I can have some
things like justify content at center
and you know what automatically just
shifted to the center I can also give it
one more guy a line-item to Center and
it's so much pain to align these things
at Center he's just like that but flex
just did that okay now let us go back
into index dot HTML and we don't need
this hey we just need a button so we're
gonna call this button here there we go
and nice button we're gonna say click or
I can say my name that's not bad or I
can just do a simple learn code online
if I can type that correct dot in of
course and if I reload that doesn't look
that good but you know what what you can
do is you can just go grab it here some
CSS files here so go into the CSS folder
directly you can either grab CSS from
this if you want to do some
customization further into the buttons
you can just grab this file just click
on the raw and grab this one make sense
if you want to make some changes so I'm
gonna grab this but in case you are not
looking for any changes further into
this existing library you can always
grab this minified one and just works
like that so let's just go ahead and
grab this pushy one so there we go so
now push each style of CSS not need to
worry about anything here go into the
index dot HTML nothing's gonna change
because we haven't implemented that
pushy thing now how you can implement is
already being it's so simple you have to
just add these classes so there are a
couple of classes and a couple of
buttons being available here for example
the buttons are available for blue green
and red obviously you can override the
color no big deal and the default
classes is BTN and bdn - - def or LG
based because there are so many like
size of the buttons available let's just
go ahead and grab this class and there
we go that's it that's it and you have
got a nice retro look for you so if I
just hit a reload notice how it looks
the clicky clicky button
I like the CS as this clicky clicky now
yes we can do that pretty quickly and
easily in the CSS but I believe I firmly
believe if there's already a real
to reinvent that invest your time in
making this much more more awesome than
what it Act already exists here so go
ahead just grab the CSS not a big deal
anyone can write this small CSS and in
case you have taken my a complete
front-end developer course at learned
code online or somewhere else obviously
can do that no big deal here but I like
this and there are so many such
libraries that I really want to share
and obviously one more thing I won't be
sharing you the files exercise files of
this such small project there is no
sense of sharing such small files so
please don't ask me for that you can
just pause the video anywhere you like
and just can copy and paste that all of
my videos are always in one zero eight
zero HD so that's it and I'll surely
catch you up with another some awesome
libraries that I really want to share
with you guys that's it I'll catch you
up n yes by the way in case you haven't
just watched my complete front-end
developer course link is in the
description as well as here on the
screen go ahead watch that and subscribe
to the channel I'll catch you up later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
