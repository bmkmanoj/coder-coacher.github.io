JavaScript if yes do let me know and yes
hey they share back again from learn
code online dot and make sure you visit
the website and now let's continue on to
our scope I hope you have watched the
previous video otherwise this is not
going to make much sense so there is a
classic problem in JavaScript which is
known as the King's territory problem
now I have named it as King's territory
everybody names it like something else I
always in my bootcamp and courses
recommend that always remember this
problem as a Kings territory problem so
what is this problem actually so now
that we understand what is our global
scope let and war and all of the keyword
now I'm going to comment all of that I
can use my shortcut of command and slash
in case you're on Windows it's control
and slash ok so let's just call this as
Kings problem Kings territory problem
however you like it so let's just define
a couple of things here and this is a
classic example I always always keep so
let's just say there is a king which is
a global king obviously we are declaring
it on to a global Scoob so this is going
to be a global king and we're gonna call
this global king as John our favorite
name in the programming environment John
Doe and Jane Doe ok
we know it's a global king now let's
just say we have another territory here
and we're gonna go inside that obviously
so now here also we're gonna declare one
more thing let's just say the king of
this territory is somebody else so we
should name him as Sam let's just say
and now if I want to have in here let's
just say we have declared it the king is
inside in here now we have further a
territory being decided inside and we're
gonna have a true statement here and
let's also define a king in here and
obviously let's just go and say that
king is gonna be let's just say I'm
running out of the name here so let's
just go for the classic Indian name Aram
and or also known as ROM so there we go
and let's just say we want to print out
here who is the king okay now this comes
up with a very very classic issue of the
problem now also let's just say this is
like one territory being decided and
there
another one and we're gonna say true and
we want to have a log here and we are
just gonna be printed in King here okay
so what is expected here so there we go
we have a classic King's Territory
problem the global King is here and he
has decided that hey you know what I
have two kids this is my one kid and
this is my another kid this kid is not
much interested so I'm gonna be handling
his territory and it is obviously clear
that since no King is yet defined in
this particular territory so the king
the global king is ruling here so if we
want to print out this King here this is
kind of a global King here acting so we
can even add one line here saying
something like this that I am second
part and this is the part one here okay
so there we go no problem at all if I
run this there shouldn't be any issue at
all so let me just clear that up and
we're gonna say node and let's just run
scope geus and come on you can run this
so we got a ram and we got I am second
part John so there we go no issues at
all okay there we go
so we have got a king which is defined
in here okay that's okay but let's just
say if we don't have this king being
defined here what is going to happen now
since these scope actually works on to
just upper-level it is going to and look
for King into its own scope it is not
going to find it there so it's gonna
move a one level up it's gonna ask hey
who is my parent and it's gonna say hey
King is defined here just take the King
from here Sam is gonna be your next
ruler who is going to manage all the
things you know when the edge hoodies
are not there the worst show that juries
are there so this is like all the same
hierarchies going on here
so what do you think what is going to
happen now what is going to be printed
in here as a king obviously sam is the
next king so sam should be taking part
in here so let's just say control and
slash there and oops control l to clear
that and we're gonna run that again so
notice here i forgot to save this and
run that again okay there we go so
obviously as expected Sam is the new
king and still John is ruling the next
territory now what happens if even I
don't have Sam since I don't have any
King and I'm looking for the king I'm
gonna go for John that's cool and let's
just say I run this file again hope I
have saved it - nope
save that again and run this file again
so obviously John is ruling now both the
territories okay that's good
but things actually get tricky here when
something amazing happened let's just
say we don't even have a definition of
the king in here as well so now who is
the king actually obviously in here we
will talk about this one later on for
right now I just would like to comment
that and we'll only talk about this part
so what do you think on this line 24
what is going to be printed here let's
just first look at the thing and see
what is going to be printed ctrl L and
there we go as expected error no issues
errors are always fine if you get an
error that's completely okay okay now
what is going to happen if I get this
obviously now Ram is going to be printed
what happened if I don't even declare
and try to access it now this is
something very very dangerous in
JavaScript and can cripple your program
can leak out a variety of things outside
the scope as well notice there is no
such variable which is being declared as
king and still we are trying to declare
it inside the scope and trying to access
that okay now what do you think what is
going to happen here let's just find it
out there just not waste more time let's
just run that okay no issues at all but
should I be able to access this King
here as well so far we have learned that
once a variable is being declared inside
it has nothing to do outside but so far
we have learned that we are declaring
the variable using let or war or Const
and this is something strange we are not
even declaring it we are just using it
so what is going to happen in this case
especially about this part of the curve
now let's just run that and let me show
you what is happening here notice you
are able to access this RAM here which
is the most dangerous part about the
JavaScript so notice you haven't
declared it you're just accessing it and
there we go now this is something has to
do with JavaScript design part here now
in the JavaScript it is written that if
you don't have a declaration of a
variable and still you want to access it
you will be declaring a global variable
there until unless you explicitly
mention there that either you are
declaring a ver which has already almost
a global or you explicitly say a lip now
as soon as you put a let here things get
fixed and you're gonna get an error
errors are amazing they are good they
are good in this case because King is
not defined and we are happy with that
because we know that we don't have an
access of this King which is not a
global so make sure you always in always
declare your variables either using wall
or LED because in that particular case
you actually know what you are doing
even in case you are getting an error
that's completely fine
we completely are aware about this
problem so make sure you always remember
this Kings territory problem it can be a
really big issue in JavaScript and make
sure you always use either a letter or
var or constant whatever you have you
never ever ever say something like this
this is really a bad habit so remember
this Kings problem it is my classic
example in all of my boot camps and
people actually love that let me know in
the comments section do you love it or
not and don't forget to visit learn code
online dot n and I'm gonna surely catch
you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
