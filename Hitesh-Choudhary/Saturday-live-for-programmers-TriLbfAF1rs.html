again with another Saturday light this
is a life for programmers by a
programmers so that we can talk have a
chitchat and can talk about world and
hello world so welcome back
so hey Master Tech hates at the inner
hey JP hey a pratik potatoes
ragweed hey hey hey how are you guys
hope you're doing good hey JP Akash
how's it going on a kundan Pandey and
hey Deepa
hey guru hey Dell hey Salman Khan Salman
Khan that's a good name so hello from
Kolkata hello from my hometown Jaipur as
well so we're talking about all the
random stuff that you can ask me this is
mode over a weekly Q&amp;amp;A session that we
do and first of all thank you so much
for the love that you are showing to the
current Python series that is running up
I got really an amazing response for the
Python series I absolutely love it and
I'm planning to make more videos in that
cities as well since you guys loved it
and yes I watched black panther as well
amazing movie if you haven't watched
this masterpiece go ahead and watch that
so hey - back again on a new set of the
live yes shabam I am back on a Saturday
life with a bad throat yes my throat is
in a pathetic condition right now
okay so Sahil Siddiqui says I don't
understand the difference between the
bubble sort and the heapsort and stuff
like that so in case you have no idea
about that I have discussed them in a
lot more detail in my Java bootcamp so I
think that would be good but I'm
planning to make some videos about these
sorting algorithms and stuff and their
code as well of course so we are
planning to do something that on this
channel so hope that will work as well
so
hi from Delhi hi uh where is the bull
tattoo it is there it is there it is
here there we go
I hope you can see that it is here it is
here it's it's here for permanent it is
going to stay you're not going anywhere
okay when will you introduce the course
on tensorflow probably after this
project we are having a current project
running on machine learning and we have
to study quite a lot for that so once we
get free from that and of course
upcoming travels as well just to give
you some more updates I will not be
available in the country from 19th to
2nd of March so I will be out from the
country and I probably will not make
much of the YouTube video stealing this
period of time after that we will get
back nobodies okay so hi there from
Bangalore I really want to visit
Mangalore I have been so many times to
Bangalore but I really want to visit
that I love from Goa of ICH gosh you
live in Goa
come on that is like the most amazing
and peaceful place on India there really
it's it's amazing place I really feel
jealous that you live and go ah it's a
good Django or flask for a web
development now I would prefer Django
honestly because flask is also good but
Django comes up with a variety of more
features as compared to the flask so I
would say go for Django it's a little
bit good can you make a series on PHP
already did I've learned code online dot
him so that's what we are saying so I
think there are some issues going on
with my chatbox here because it's it
usually keep rolling fast but I don't
know why it is not happening right now
so I'll let's just try that okay so my
chat looks like a little bit frozen here
and let me try to type something hey and
yep looks like my chat is suddenly
frozen hey YouTube guys if you're
listening to this your chat is not
working and I'm not getting any
questions so the whole agenda of this
live is so that I can talk to you you
can discuss your questions and stuff
like that but since you have decided to
just
I'm not gonna work today it's Saturday
and the chat is absolutely frozen sorry
guys I cannot take then any messages or
stuff like that so it's it's not working
let me try to hit a reload on my chat
box this is really terrible terrible
terrible
come on Facebook don't do that
okay it says 500 internal server error
come on Facebook okay now it says
started going on now I'm getting I love
the web scrubbing series after that
please make cities on progressive web
apps yes we are planning something for
progressive web apps as well but as of
now we are going to focus a little bit
on Python not much a little bit so that
we can have like get you guys ready for
like small basic programming stuff
explain to loud flare clock fear is a
hosting it is pretty good and we hosted
quite a lot of things on cloud fair as
well
yeah I love your accent it's not accent
it's how the English is meant to be
broken because every language has a way
of speaking it like Hindi has its own
era how you should speak it Marwadi has
its go on era that aura that you should
speak it similarly it's English a lot of
people just ping you with I you got an
accent don't worry this is how it is
meant to be spoken
Ranjan girls say shout out hey Ranjit
girl shout out to you lovely meeting you
said in Kolkata same here oh such and
such an is here I'm at you in Kolkata I
remember you so any blockchain course is
now as of now no plans for blockchain
courses love you sir your motivation
thank you so much keep writing amazing
codes you people are doing better than
me you are amazing guys someone might
have sent to you the character he has
the actually a couple of my friends from
the South are still sending me did
character and I'm not opening that on my
iPad or anything perhaps they don't know
that I used 1 + 5 t so that's why they
are saying it so but again some of them
mailed me as well and it affected my
iPad as well luckily didn't affected my
iMac or any of the Mac OS so lucky there
lucky we say is what is igneous
technologies igneous technologies is a
private limited registered companies
since five or six or seven six or seven
years ago it's a private limited company
just like any other company you see like
Flipkart or snapdeal it's just like a
company what's what's the big deal in
that
okay explain 5g I cannot I cannot I
didn't read much of the papers or
anything on that so no I cannot do that
any course on django web development
please hey Ranga I hope you haven't
noticed there is a brand new course on
Django right now it's there on learn
code online dot in so go ahead
it says no gray I believe this is gray
ish and this is exact same t-shirt
sometimes the colors are like not that
much good actually my software got
recently updated now it's showing me all
saturated colors so that is why it is
having a different stuff here
I am having an absolute bad throat today
so did freelancing pay for hosting or
how hosting no freelancing don't pay you
for hosting you have to manage your
hosting on your own AWS or as you are
aware to start our pratik I would say go
for a nap Luis don't look for as your a
personal opinion again and don't bash me
for saying this but again my opinion is
go for AWS there's a huge demand in
Bangalore and in fact in all of the
places for AWS it's kind of a different
thing it's not about programming it's
all about managing servers and stuff
it's not related to programming of
course first thing that you should know
but if I would be saying azrael AWS go
for AWS
okay best hacker
to me is digital Oceania digital oceans
do provide you a lot of that but
honestly they are on a steep side of the
price they're they're pricey that's why
I don't use digital oceans but they're
good honestly
what you pay you get for that they are
pricey they should do something about it
which is better for web development PHP
or Python if you're a big nutter
I would say Python is actually
comparatively easy to get started with
that but again PHP is also easy but I
would say regardless so if you go with
the Python on anything with that PHP is
something which everybody should know
like not everything but basic stuff
because you know having a scalable
website and just got a small stuff of
that anybody usually prefers PHP so PHP
something that everybody should have but
for beginners it's easy for other stuff
your videos are really amazing what will
be the next course in lco in case you
don't know I don't reveal my courses
until and unless they are all done and
after that only I reveal what kind of
courses we're done because it's not
about promising and then he sometimes
you're not able to deliver I don't want
to do that honestly the approach is
simply always present once you are done
this is kind of a pro Stella - somebody
say is a Shubham budget say his various
section sir
section sir is busy in preparing
something really amazing and really
great for you guys he does a lot of job
that compared to me how to do that much
of the work he he manages all the things
heavy duty stuff like offline events and
management talking to the university
guys he manages a lot compared to what I
do so I shout out to him he manages
single-handedly a lot of them you got
YouTube play button yes I got YouTube
play button I haven't made a video or
anything and I even haven't just a kind
of a shelf dad on a wall or something I
will do that I am NOT getting time to do
all these things sketch for app design
absolutely absolutely absolutely
if you are looking anything for design I
don't think so there is anything that
can match the quality of sketch yes I am
aware that there is an Adobe XD there
but compared to the pricing system and
open source packages available for the
sketch sketch fan again so if you are
looking for designing anything go for a
sketch
it's amazing the only downside is it's
available only for Mac but anyways uh
most of the design that due to the true
color of the Mac he uses Mac and if
you're a designer definitely you should
look for something which tells you the
actual color because the red on most
screen and red on Apple screen is is far
more different so definitely check out
Mac for that for screens are like there
is no comparison for iOS screens iMac or
maybe laptop or something like that okay
Ron kept Jesse's we had met in Kolkata
hi Rocco how are you I hope you enjoyed
my talk in Kolkata as well it was like I
didn't posted it but it was totally like
seven or six or seven or eight maybe I
don't remember I think it was seven
seven university talk in the last like
week or so absolutely tidy work and so
much tired I was just moving in and out
on the same day from the home moving
onto a call as coming back then moving
to different colors and on one day I
took talked in to colleges on the same
day and my throat is in a such a bad
condition you have absolutely no idea
how bad it is so how do you have learned
a language first get through the syntax
and then make project and create
yourself a lots of problem that's how
you learn okay I don't understand
anything in college okay who does
I don't know anybody does and I have
examined one day onwards just use a lot
of pens and make a lot of diagrams
that's how engineering courses works in
India
and that's all so let's pick up more
questions
so now Jas please yes we are planning to
update the no GS course or something so
we'll be working on no GS very soon
we in fact to use no GS almost every
single day now but
you know we'll be working on that
Salesforce it's amazing I'm not an
expert on Salesforce but let me tell you
it is good it is rock-solid tech and if
you are looking forward to go into
Salesforce don't hesitate and also don't
wait for my courses I don't think they
are not gonna come on Salesforce not at
all an expert here on Salesforce oh but
yes of course it's a good tech I like it
okay mobile app learnings you know what
what I personally believe that if you
want to build something you should have
a laptop or desktop you should work on
that it's not like mobile apps are not
helpful in all these things but I
personally believe that if want to
really create something go for the big
fledged laptops or the desktop you can
learn on there but programming is like a
math you will look on to a mobile app
that hey all these things are great or
maybe you're looking for a
multiple-choice questions you are
answering all of them but you'll never
get it you'll never understand the
programming until unless it's just like
math it looks really easy when somebody
else is doing or you just read a paper
it is very more tough when you do it so
again my advice is perhaps are okay I do
even have my couple of apps but still I
would advise you get this piece get a
piece of keyboard for yourself and write
onto it just type your finger on that
that's how everybody learns programming
so don't skip that there is no path
apart from that just write some code
don't just read them on a mobile apps
okay so this is what I want to say here
okay
materialised CSS bootstrap or foundation
bootstrap easier one and go with that
and it's the kind of industry standard
it's being used quite a lot can you
explain a graph QL yes in fact I am
planning to make video on graph QL it's
amazing how the first time I saw it so
it's really good won't you work want to
work with you please why don't you work
on spring hey Auditor thank you so much
for the support of what do you call that
super chat yes super Chad no I don't
work on spring honestly because my
client base is mostly out of India and
mostly they don't work on spring or
maybe I don't have a client on spring
that's honestly here and they work like
the most only on stuff like nodejs react
angular maybe code Android and core iOS
using Swift and some of the bridges in
objective-c still so I don't have much
work on spring it's really amazing that
you really want to work with me in fact
a very soon we are planning to hire
interns and all of that but as of now I
don't have any work for spring and even
I am NOT an expert on spring I work
mostly but it's not a tough thing
because once you have coded in PHP
node.js and all these stuff learning
spring I don't think so it's gonna be
tough already I know Java quite a lot
I do code in Android a lot so it
shouldn't be really hard oh and a handy
ways the concepts are always saying that
how you protect your page is your
authorization your logins and all these
stuff so shouldn't be a big deal
okay what is your favorite programming
language I don't have any favorite
programming language just give me the
project just pay me I'll do it sir this
is what I work on so this is how I get
it there is a question doing your iOS
app dev course from LCA what are the
others that I can do additionally uh
that's really good I guess I I don't
want to reveal this but hey Bank it
there are a couple of things coming up
for iOS as well as of now that is the
only course that we have but there is a
special demand from one of the company
who which this LCU has got a package
deal with that they have demanded
something for iOS and I'm gonna be
building that up very soon after the
trip in case you still don't remember
that I will be gone from maybe tomorrow
or day after tomorrow till the 2nd of
March I will not be in the country so
things are gonna be little bit low have
you ever visited thon bod and gherkin no
but one of my very close friend from my
childhood lives in done bad now he has
got a mining job there I really want to
see and visit him one day but now I
haven't visited it so far react or
native both both why not both working on
Express node G has any suggestion I
would say just take care of those
brackets when you don't put handing
brackets it's the the error tracing is
really tough but you'll be ok
so let me know what they are using
mustache or anything else it's good
check out the moustache as well if
you're working on the rear node and all
these stuffs it's good
check out definitely ok
so will you make video when on trip no I
cannot make trip I have a strict
guideline already being told away that
no vlogs and no shooting inside the
campus as well so have wouldn't be
posting any videos
how clients reach to you first time in
the client didn't reach me for the first
time at the starting of the things I was
reaching to the clients making a lot of
networks opening up every single door
Facebook through networking friends of
friends of friends all of that oh yeah
and after that now thanks to the YouTube
and thanks to some of my previous
projects and previous clients now
clients are approaching me and the good
thing is now I can put up my price which
is obviously reasonable it's not like
I'm making a hype of my work I put a
reasonable price and I just say this is
gonna be my price because I do have a
tons of projects if you want it take it
or leave it so that's how I am working
right now so there we go
PHP future 2018 I'm a big nerd yeah PHP
is not going anywhere dude so don't
worry stick with it and it's a good
thing if you have already started it and
it shows that you have already interest
in it so don't worry it is gonna stay
here that's here enterpreneur vs
freelancer kind of the same entrepreneur
call it entrepreneur called a freelancer
we just make like to make our own money
so that's we don't like to do a job on a
full-time basis but on the end of the
day every freelancer entrepreneur they
are also working on some clients for
some projects so everybody's just
working for somebody that's how the
thing goes on ok so cold coffee missing
sir come on it was iced tea first of all
and yes it's missing because a terrible
condition
somebody says Java or JavaScript buddy
if you're asking still this question
that should I go for Java or JavaScript
we need to do a lot of research because
they have completely different language
different approach different
implementation so it's it's a lot of
reading work that you have to do lots of
things to catch up okay create our FB
group there are so many people I have
like a hundred and fifty thousand
subscriber and creating and have big
group would be nightmare all the time it
would be like ding ding ding ding ding
ding going on for me I will not be able
to sleep and stuff I think let's keep it
on YouTube and on my Facebook page so
that's what we are gonna be doing you
are a lovely guy thank you so much such
an I love you too
suggest some best book for Java and
JavaScript hey you can check out my
courses you don't need book after that
saying ok
there are a lot of who guided you
throughout your journey in programming
Stack Overflow mostly and a lot of bad
words from the client that was like the
motivation thing and every programmer is
the number one motivation or the
guidance path is Stack Overflow I am not
even for you as well you are thinking
for that when you will be actually
making the projects it will be the Stack
Overflow who will be guiding you through
ins and outs
how can electronics can make career in
CSE I did it
I am from code electronics I am from
electronics and communication
engineering did my each layer of
technology also known as BTech in that
and then moved into computer so you can
also do that
LTO courses are very cheap why
it is that it is if you wish you can
just buy two three times if you think
you want to pay more I would accept that
I would respect that even so if you want
to pay a little bit more do notify me
I'm always ready to take that it helps
me to buy more gadgets and all awesome
things so that I can make more awesome
videos and this life should look much
more better right now it's in a terrible
condition I know that but surely we'll
be working on that something so if you
want to support me or get me on that
shortly I always welcome money I always
you will all say let's just be on ground
reality who just says no to money
everybody wants to earn you are learning
programming to make your life better
learn programming and make some money
and so do I sort of every other
countries and all the companies this
this is all the money game people let's
be on reality okay tips for gate
that's it I don't know accepting money
yes I do
116 viewers let me check out how many
viewers are there yeah it's almost like
four hundred and sixteen seventeen
something oh go ahead and hit the like
button for this video as well if you're
enjoying these live sessions and want me
to do keep doing these live as well hit
that like button as well I appreciate
that guys I want to learn photography
suggest me some best website first thing
is just take a look at the variety of
YouTube videos there's a channel known
as DSLR guide he's a very young guy I
believe he's from London or maybe some
of the Barthe inside his accent tells it
and he's amazing amazing he'll give you
a lot of tips and all these things about
that I learned quite a lot from him he's
basically a moviemaker
but you can learn a lot about
photography tips as well and the first
tip that I can personally give you and
don't touch the Photoshop because you
want to just take all the things out of
your camera first of all and then move
on to the Photoshop and Lightroom and
all these stuffs first just explore your
camera
how many programming language do you
know completely yeah not even a single
one because to learn a programming
language completely and all the
possibilities would require like 10 or
15 years of the study and thesis on that
programming language and I just keep on
learning whenever I need to implement
certain things I do read the
documentation specifically for that mold
the code according to that and that's it
that's how I do this stuff so logic
building please I have talked a lot
about the logic building in my java
bootcamp and probably will discuss a
little bit more in my upcoming Python
videos because I'm getting lots of love
for these Python videos I didn't know
that you guys love Python so much I
could have started that earlier but
anyways will it be beneficial coding
Java language in notepad if you're
preparing for interview that's good
because you don't write perfect coding
for coding interviews but about from
that it's not helpful not at all and if
you're talking about the notepad I'm
talking about these actual notepads okay
if you're talking about the notepad
software you're in a terrible condition
your Twitter account I do have a Twitter
account its handle is at the rate hit
age comm like do TC om but I'm not
active there honestly not even I I don't
even have my app install on my phone for
Twitter I don't like it stuff like that
so there we go how to read documentation
I have talked about reading the
documentation quite a lot in all of my
courses and in fact probably I'll make a
video on that so you guys can have it
and okay some people are promoting their
channels as well don't do that you'll
automatically get banned and spammed on
the YouTube so don't just do cross
promoting and stuff it is not allowed by
YouTube some people are asking do you
have girlfriend was that an invitation
a girls
so it's going really fast now okay its
degree okay where is it going on I don't
man helmet can we create okay
people are getting getting really
fantasizing there is Udacity nano degree
worth depends on how much you are
practicing but again do make sure you
understand it's a certificate it's not a
degree that's why they have called it as
a nano degree and you everybody should
be aware of this degree can only be
granted by institutions registered under
a ICT and UGC all of that any company
like a Udacity is just a company like
flip kart snap deal learn code online
these are all companies they cannot
provide you degrees just be absolutely
very clear that they have played an
amazing marketing strategy there by
calling their certificate as nano degree
and they got registered trademark for
that to be aware of that apart from that
courses it's a completely different talk
that how valuable these courses are how
much you're going to be learning all of
that so that's a complete different talk
I'm talking all about the marketing game
that they have played it was really
smart I liked it but it's somewhere
somewhat like fooling the people on the
name of degree so I didn't like that
that was not a good approach so yeah
okay my throat is itching quite a lot he
said loved your target coltd I remember
me hey some bread how are you yes I do
remember we talked quite a lot outside
the auditorium I remember you
you
Knapp teller just go ahead watch any
subject on nap tile and you'll realize
that the amount of money that they got
for the nap tell you be surprises try to
read on online documentation that how
much money they get for the nap tell and
what kind of quality they are
maintaining for that a professor just
walks into the room and just reads a
book that is what they call online
teaching I don't know yes they are well
repeated a teacher to be surprised to my
surprise like they're from IITs one of
the most repetitious all over the globe
and yet them are the quality of the
courses just not just don't believe me
just go ahead watch the NAP tale channel
and you'll realize the videos are one
hour long two hour-long faculty just
comes up and just keeps on writing the
stuff didn't even bother about
explaining the stuff there are two
things once you just show the stuff and
once you explain the stuff so go ahead
watch it in have tell you will realize
that what's what's the terrible
condition visit Tirupati ah I will I
will surely because I am planning to
come to Chennai there is one Rajnikanth
movie going on
I guess robot - and probably this is my
last chance to see the Rajini Festival
in Chennai so I will try my best to
visit Rajinikanth festival in Chennai so
I will be coming there schway thanks
says inept ale is very boring is exactly
what I'm saying is it it doesn't it is
not online teaching if I just open a
book and start reading reading reading
without even looking at the camera I
have seen those lectures so you'll start
crying literally after watching those
videos what's the sense because it's not
about your having a knowledge that's it
no teaching is a completely different
art oh yeah there are you interested in
visiting Manipal University Jaipur for a
talk I I can it's really nearby so
surely if I'll get an invite I can try
but again invite should be after March
20 because all the dates are packed till
now
so let's pick up a couple of more
questions okay
SEO tips SEO content is absolutely Rock
inking first of all don't try to fool
anything and just put content in the
meta tags and the titles in the content
body everywhere because it's not about
getting mole traffic it's never about
getting more traffic it is always about
getting quality traffic because let's
just say this is my channel I talk all
the time about programming and if
suddenly the crowd comes in on my
channel who are interested in mobile
phone reviews then my channel is not
gonna get benefit from that what I talk
will not make sense to them so
definitely having quality audience is is
the topmost priority for SEO a lot of
people don't understand that a lot of
people just say traffic traffic traffic
it's not about that
have quality traffic the audience that
you really want to see it will take time
to get those traffic but I think that's
that should be really good okay so again
hey YouTube guys what you are doing up
you're making a lot of mess my my
channel chat again got freezed up come
on YouTube you can do better than this
okay this is really bad situation the
stream is continuing but my chat is not
getting loaded I had to hit reload okay
Shaheed shake says love your effort
thank you so much Shahid and that's a
good name Shahid okay
1258 here reading cracking the code
interview that that's a good book that's
a good book it's really tough but it's
really good
why competitive programmer hate
developer I don't know
heard it first time
that even in the programming community
somebody hates somebody I haven't seen
that
a there is one midnight he
cracking the coding interview watching
your life i've watched i ira here in
Malaysia okay that's an even know movie
where are you flying it's YouTube live
not have be live yeah it's it's YouTube
live I messed up there
