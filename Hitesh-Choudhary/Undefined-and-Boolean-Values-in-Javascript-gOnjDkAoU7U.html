code online dot n if you haven't visited
my website go ahead visit their their
plethora of video content there anyways
let's go ahead and move on to the
JavaScript content again
now this video is your last video in
your basic stuff after that we will be
moving on to a little bit more advanced
stuff now it's not gonna be like too
much of the advanced we will always be
proceeding gradually step by step
process so that you don't even fail any
pain so this is your like level zero
running out and this is your last video
in level zero okay so the last thing
that I want to talk about is pretty
important and you should pay really good
attention here it is gonna build up your
base foundation about using your numbers
and your all the things like that so I
think we should create a new file for
that and I'm gonna call this as simply
null and bool dot jas okay so there we
go and let's just have it so now we want
to talk about this guy so first of all
let me close all of that so there we go
okay so first and foremost there is an
important subject here which is known as
null values okay and I'm gonna give you
a perfect example so that you never ever
ever forget about these null values okay
so let's just say I want I'm preparing a
temperature app again and this app is
for maybe just Android or JavaScript or
whatever you are using for that and I'm
gonna be calling it as temp for
temperature I know some people call it
as for temporary variable as well but
regardless of that let's just declare my
weight my temperature is having a value
of zero okay zero degree Celsius pretty
freezing and now I just want to have a
print of it so I'm gonna simply say
console oops
console dot log and I'm gonna be simply
saying something like this current
temperature oops temperature is and then
I'm gonna be concatenating it with the
temp okay there we go so what do we
expect to run from this file it should
not be a really surprising one we know
what is going to be the outcome of it so
we're gonna be saying simply node
and we'll be saying null bouge s and
there we go
took a little bit while but it says
temperature is zero okay that is great
let us assume that this temp is coming
from a website API okay it is coming
from a website API regardless of whether
you understand API or not just assume
it's coming up from a website and gives
you a temperature of zero so it becomes
a zero temperature but what happens when
you don't get any value from that
website
yes that's completely possible and you
have initialized your temperature with
zero and maybe here you have done some
calculation and then finally you have
said you know what temperature is now
equal to probably two degrees and you
know what is going to happen now it's
going to show us the temperature is now
two degrees that's okay that's fine but
let's just assume this doesn't happen
and you are getting a value here zero
that's completely okay because zero is a
valid temperature what happens when you
don't get any value let's just say this
temperature is completely empty now what
is going to happen in that particular
case is you will have no value at all
and it is going to give you an undefined
value here now undefined and null almost
kind of a same concept but a little bit
different but just get the feel here
that zero and undefined or null are
completely different concept when I say
temperature is zero and when I say
temperature is undefined means I don't
know what the temperature is are two
completely different temperature you
cannot replace undefined a null with
zero that is completely a wrong concept
and always always remember this example
here for temperature because temperature
really makes sense here because zero is
a valid temperature and when you don't
get any temperature it's undefined that
is completely a different situation okay
so always and always keep in mind that
your null and undefined are completely
different from zero okay so that is like
pretty easy concept now let me also walk
you through with one more concept
because based on this we will be able to
write condition
programming conditional programming is a
smart programming on which you decide
which code to execute based on some
events okay so what are these events so
for example let's just say you are
building something like a great system
for a school and you have seen this
example quite a lot in various other
programming languages as well like for
example if this code is like 10 it's
like great job great job and if it is
something like 5 and it says something
like word harder something like that and
if somebody has got like 2 it can be
poor and if it is something like 0 that
is gonna be fail so this whole thing is
possible based on conditional
programming and in order to learn
conditional programming we need to learn
something known as boolean operations so
what are these boolean operation now
billions are really really simple to
learn they are just two it just says
true or false so it can be either true
or it can be simply false here ok so
let's just assume how we can do that now
let me just show you what it mean by
that now let's just say you are doing a
comparison here and you are having grade
here oops
there we go so great and let's just
declare that as let and there we go so
we do have our grade here now that's all
so that is totally fine and we want to
set this grade is something like a
boolean value so we have to mention that
is it can be a true or false values so
there we go
and notice we do have a true value here
in the grade first and foremost let's
just print that here console dot log and
we're gonna be saying grade ok there we
go just bear with me for a moment you'll
understand everything about it and let's
just run that again and we are getting
it true here
so this boolean items can only have two
values either it can be true or it can
be false and if I have to write
precisely it can be something like true
and the lower case Falls okay now how
does this true and false can be helpful
now it is helpful when you are comparing
your actual school to this grade values
or something like that okay now we will
work on this example later on let's just
say right now you have a let actual
actual score or maybe actual marks or
something like seven and you want to
compare it with something like that so
you will be writing something like let
my grade he is gonna be equal to now
this grade and what is your gonna be
storing in that value it's gonna be
totally dependent on how you want to
store this low let me just give you a
simple example let's just say your
actual marks is here and you want to say
a true or false based on the result like
is my marks less than ten or not okay so
this is going to give you either a true
value or a false value okay so this is
it now let's just save this code and run
that and figure it out whether that's a
true statement or not and I forgot to
mention that it's not great anymore it's
my grade page that problems are always
going to be there in programs you need
to learn how you can solve them so there
we go true and we ask that hey my actual
marks is less than ten so it says yeah
it's true
and that means you have to run a
something like this code work harder
because it's less than ten so this is
going all we are going to be learning
later on in the if and else block but
just to give you a brief example here we
do have other like this is less than we
do have greater than we do have less
than or equal to that there are two two
cases that you are checking here maybe
your marks were something like ten so it
can be ten maybe less than 10 or maybe
equal to then and then it's a little bit
confusing but don't worry you'll get
that so we do have less than we do have
something greater than we do have equal
equal sign now this is the most
confusing one now in programming we use
one equal to assign
right-hand side values in to the left
hand side but when you use two equal
sign that sounds a little bit
odd for new beginners but yeah this is
how programmers do this stuff when you
want to check comparison if this is
equal to this then we use two equal sign
and there is even the three equal sign
which probably will explode later on
right now I know even the two signs are
too much for you okay so this is
basically your operations about billions
and everything don't worry too much
about these equal signs and all of that
later on when we will be moving on if
and else conditional programming we will
be exploding that later on okay right
now on to a quick summary your 0 is not
equal to your null or undefined that's
the probably the most important constant
here and then we have boolean data type
a special variable that can hold only
two values either can true or can be
false and you can compare it with the
various other numbers or string or
anything at all and you can simply say
hey is it less than 10 maybe less than
200 maybe it's less the score than
highest score and all these things so
you'll be doing comparison a lot and
we'll be looking forward for a variety
of such examples as well so that's
pretty much it for this video and
congratulations your basics of
JavaScript is done now we can move
forward for the level 1 and can write
some great programs in code in
JavaScript and I'm gonna surely catch
you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
