with another video in this video I want
to talk about how you can use your
existing web development skills and can
produce native iOS and Android app using
those skills and yes it's completely
possible to utilize your HTML CSS and
JavaScript skills and can design native
Android and iOS app and again I'm not
talking about the hybrid apps or just a
wrapper in a website it's native apps
now first and foremost before we get
started and talk in this video about the
tech let me just be clear that in this
video we are going to talk about the
react native now there are a lot of
other players in the market that can
produce native Android and iOS app using
your web development skill but it's not
possible to talk all of them about all
of them in just one video so we're gonna
take a lot of videos in covering all of
them up in the first one we are getting
started with the react native now first
and foremost let's be clear here that
I'm not talking about the highbreed apps
or the web apps that are being wrapped
around in a browser or something like
that
it's not it's a complete and pure native
apps that you design in iOS using Swift
or in Android using Java or Cortland
they are pure apps and they are
completely being designed using the web
skills that is HTML CSS and JavaScript
and obviously the very first question is
what is react native and in order to
understand the react native I have to
touch up a little bit on the react as
well now in case you are not aware with
the project react it is a project being
designed by Facebook and in case you are
not aware and still don't believe me
that these apps can be really awesome
just stick out your phone and have a
look on the apps like Facebook your
messenger of the Facebook and Instagram
they are completely being designed and
are almost switched into the react
native again coming back to our question
what is react and react native so
Facebook recently was facing a lot of
problems about redesigning their apps
and everything and basically what I
believe the problem was handling a lot
of users
to just roll out new features as well
now just onto a side note just try to
imagine if I give you a small chunk of
the Facebook app which is humongous
which is very big and you have to just
recompile that up it just ctrl be your
command be just rebuild that up it's
gonna take a lot of time you can have
probably a coffee or can have a nap and
still that is that app is going to be
compiled so Facebook needed something
more robust more fast that can handle a
lot of traffic as well as can be
designed really quickly and the team at
the Facebook got started by designing a
new completely fresh project which is
react now the good part about the react
is it's virtual DOM and we are not going
to go into the much more technical
details about the virtual Dom and
everything maybe in later on videos but
all you need to understand that it's
really fast and although it's a library
but it's kind of a very lightweight
component that can be injected anywhere
you can use react with PHP with MySQL
with firebase with MongoDB or maybe any
other kind of database that you are
using it's really awesome and everybody
is liking it in the community and now
comes up the point that hey this is
react and that is used for designing web
applications so what it has to do with
the react native now the successor or
so-called successor of the react is
react native now all the things that you
learn in the react like components props
States and other things are used in the
react native as well now I will later on
go in the inside details how the react
native works what are the native API is
and everything but right now all you
need to understand is all the things
that you're going to learn in the react
can be applied in react native and it's
almost same workflow those components
props and states are all being used in
the react native and thus you got your
native application and the best part
about the react native is - first of all
you don't ever compile your app you just
hit a reload just like in your website
and that's it you are done making your
app and the second part is you don't
have to maintain two separate code base
for your application for example let's
just say I have an application and I
have to launch two separate versions of
it obviously in an iOS version and an
Android version it requires two teams to
be out there
because simply one team is going to
maintain Android application and one
team is going to maintain iOS
application and on to the side note if
you are not aware of that implying the
same exact feature in iOS Android does
require a lot of combination of those
teams lot of talks in between them but
in the react native you just have to
maintain one single code and that code
will produce native Android app as well
as iOS app so it's one of the many new
projects that are around and there are a
lot of other players in the market like
ionic and maybe we will talk about them
later on in some videos right now let's
just keep our focus on react and react
native so react native is getting a lot
of attention nowadays and people are
loving how the things are shaping for
the react native and the community is
growing ok so now that you understand
what is react and react native I know
many of you are jumping from the couch
and saying hey finally I can use my web
development skills and can design native
Android and iOS app using those skills
no need to learn Java Kotlin or Swift
and you might be thinking how can I get
started in that now before you ask this
question let me be clear in order to get
started with react and react native I
have two approaches here first of all
this is unavoidable you need to be
really really good in HTML CSS
JavaScript and a little bit on the Flex
box and the good news about that is that
flexbox series is already out are freely
on my youtube channel you can have a
look on there it's really helping there
but Before we jump on there your HTML
CSS and JavaScript scales Rd essentially
you cannot skip that and it's not a
vanilla JavaScript skills you need to
require a little bit more than that and
simply saying the es6 version the latest
syntax of the es6
is required and there is no skip for
that once you are comfortable with the
HTML CSS and JavaScript part then comes
the second approach and it's completely
on you how you want to get started I
recommend all the people to get started
with react first because all the skills
that you learn in the react again the
components props and States and
everything is going to be helpful in
react native as well but it is not
compulsion a lot of people directly jump
into react native and learn all the
concepts just right there and it's
completely ok as well but if you already
we are having skills of react it's
really helpful and all those persons who
are having react skills can probably in
a week or two week can start building
basic app in react native again a big
big big sidebar here all those people
who are enrolled in my react.js course
at learned code online I have just
released out three big sections on react
native and it's a free update for all
the learn code online users to enjoy in
the react course and they will be
learning that we act just like usually
they were doing in that course and I
will also be demonstrating how you can
build up native application using the
act native as well again this is not at
all a full-fledged course on react
native that has been included but it's
really good enough to get you started
and quickly up and running now I know as
soon as I'll be uploading this video on
YouTube people will be saying hey this
means that the native apps are going
somewhere or people will not be learning
the native apps like Swift Java and
Kotlin are going somewhere no it's not
like that try to assume it like that
that if the node GS is coming in the
market does it means that the PHP is
going somewhere no not at all
there are always side by side
technologies and for some business this
is good for some business that is good
for example there are still apps that
are being designed in Ruby on Rails as
well as on Django as well as on PHP and
node.js so it's always good to have a
lot of options and it's technology it's
going to be wide variety and it's going
to be changing all the time
so there are options now in front of it
you can go with the Android development
using Java as well or maybe Cortland as
well and you can go similarly for the
iOS development using Swift as well but
now you have more options simply saying
you don't want to learn those languages
like Swift or Java or Catalan you can
directly get started with react native
and enjoy your other few skills of
JavaScript HTML and CSS and build native
apps so whole story short
none of the technology is going anywhere
but luckily we have now more options and
it's going to be a lot of business who
is going to say that hey for my business
the react native is awesome and some are
going to say that hey for my business
hybrid apps are awesome for some
business it's going to say hey I need
just java application in
Android so lot of technologies are going
to come up that means a lot of more
options lot of new job opportunities and
it's all win-win situation for everybody
now I see a lot of good feature in the
react and react native and others such
technologies that are coming up around
and I always keep an eye on those things
which are just around in the market and
react has produced really some good
results and even I have tried to compare
some of the react native apps with the
actual native apps being designed in the
Swift and they all are performing really
absolutely fine so onto it just quick
sidebar if you haven't talked or haven't
looked at the react.js course go ahead
check that out it now includes the react
native course as well not a full-fledged
code but enough to get you started link
is in the description section so that
you can have a look now all those people
who want to think that hey I'm gonna
just directly look at on my own
you are welcome as well I'll leave down
a link in the description as well as on
the screen as well for the direct
documentation of react native as well I
highly recommend all of you to at least
check out the documentation of react
native and be aware what is happening
currently in the world of technology I
hope you have enjoyed this video and
maybe in later some of the videos where
we just use the screencast and
everything I'll try to make a simple
basic app in react native in front of
you so that you can get much more idea
how the things are working so I hope you
have enjoyed this video if you have
liked this video give it a thumbs up
