regular expression now regex or regular
expression before we even start talking
about then let me say one more time I
know you have heard it quite many time
but one more time regex
is not at all a property of Java or.net
PHP or Python they are used by everyone
and they are especially liked in itself
entity and you can use them with pretty
much anything and everything there are
subtle changes a little bit here and
there but there are no changes at all in
patterns what the dot means in PHP
exactly same the dot means in dotnet
what the little caret sign means in
python it means exactly same in Java
so there's no exception there so let me
just prove my point here by opening up
my web browser so this is here you can
see we have got two things PHP and pipe
and python there are official manuals of
them now here we can see in the PHP
there is a thing known as preg
underscore match where you can pass on a
pattern and a string where you want to
match anything now this pattern thing
this is known as regular expression and
we are going to be talking about that
similarly in Python we have got this
import re regular expression and you can
just search for anything now this here
the starting point is a regular
expression or pattern and here it is
where it is searching for the things and
this is what exactly we are talking
about this mumbo-jumbo
whatever the hat is written it's gonna
make all of the sense after the CDs of
course so yes let's first get it out of
the picture that yes they are not
dependent on any language also this
series is not gonna be dependent on any
language at all we'll be using so the
next question is what are the tools that
you can use to learn regular expression
now there is no shortage of such tools
they are available online offline in
fact every language supported so let's
talk about some of them which are my
favorite I'll be using in this series
but you have variety of other options as
well now the number one reason that I'm
choosing an online tool for this entire
series is because a lot of people are on
Ubuntu on Windows or a Mac and I wanted
something where I can focus directly on
regular expression and you can just fire
up your browser can type a URL and can
start working on that that is the reason
I'm choosing online browsers but again
there's no shortage you can use any two
here so let me just reload this regex
are now regex are is one of my favorite
tools to deliver sessions for regex or
regular expression now again there are
certain reasons why I love it but there
is no such compulsion that you have to
use it now at first it looks little bit
cumbersome but what you can do is close
down this bottom panel you can just
shrink down this left hand side panel
and there we go and there are a couple
of other options as well first let's
talk about them and the second one is
regex 101 regex 101 is the really most
popular if you have gone through with
any kind of industry training and
everything these are the things which
are stable and has been here for a long
time a lot of people love to use them
but certainly there is no difference
here you can use it here or here they
are gonna work exactly and you can just
write for PHP JavaScript Python or
golang the only difference that it is
getting here is some time it takes a raw
input if you are using for Python for
JavaScript it's mostly two slashes we
will be sticking most of the time with
JavaScript because that's the simplest
one
but that exact pattern can be
transformed into Python as well no big
deal
there are a couple of others as well
regex Paul it's really one of the old
one guy here but again still very
popular so you can use them also you can
just search for regex tools and can find
variety of others my favorite happened
to be regex are.com and we'll be using
it throughout the course again let me
give you that simple example here here
at the top in the JavaScript you can see
there is a JavaScript or PHP version if
you want to run it like that way and all
these website that I have told you here
do support the flags we will talk about
later on what are these flags but they
all support global case insensitivity
multi-line and all of that also rejects
101 do support all these flags like
global multi-line case insensitivity and
all of that so no big deal my
recommendation is just use these two
regex 101.com or regex are okay then how
this is set it if you want to use some
other tools as well no problem at all
you'll be able to do all the things that
I'm doing here on that tool as well so
these are the tools that we'll be using
and now it is clear that by and very we
are using it in here it is really great
so that's it for this video and in the
upcoming videos we'll learn a little bit
more about step by step processing about
regex so that's it for this video and
I'll catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
