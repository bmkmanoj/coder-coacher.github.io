with another video in this video we are
going to ask two very important question
and in fact the most asked question to
me in the emails in the Facebook in the
usual oops it's everywhere and the
question number one is is it easy to
learn programming and second is how much
stuff are programming jobs so very
important question and what I'll be the
sitting is the pure truth actual real
life no magic not scaling no selling and
no anything else just your truth that's
how much easy is it to learn programming
and how much are the jobs there so let's
get started for that in this channel we
talk about programming web apps mobile
apps and pretty much everything related
to programming and technology in case
you are new here consider subscribing
there now let's just start it with our
first question
is programming easy now before I go here
that let me also clear up one thing you
might be already distinct Lehrer but let
me tell you that yes programmers do make
a lot of money and this is actually true
thing in here I'm not upscaling or doing
anything you are you must already be
familiar whether it's a freelancing or
whether it's might depend testing jobs
designing apps for iOS or Android or
maybe anything freelancing PhD anything
programmers dooming a lot of money if
not a lot it's easy to survive with the
programming skills so that is the truth
and a lot of people might want to switch
into the carriers of programming simply
because it's a good job in but what
people don't understand that it's not
that much easy - now let me clear up and
put a ground in here with a different
example in here so for example let's
just say I can run 100 meters okay that
let us another packet here so I can run
hundred meter if this is somebody who is
going to pay me a lot of money for
running hundred meters of course nobody
is going to pay me that much of amount
of money if I can just 100 meters but if
I am able to run 100 meters fastest on
the sanest maybe and the fastest runner
on
who can complete 100 meter race is now
there is going to be someone who can pay
me quite good of course there will be
hundreds of people ready to pay me
millions of dollars
Nike editors everybody will be after me
if I'm best in what I did ok so I hope
you get it clear of that now taking this
analog into the programming as well
now how much easy is it to program it's
fairly easy but is it going to someone
going to pay you quite a lot if you know
HTML and CSS probably not not that much
at least what you can actually end so
that's tough the thing is the more
chances of making money without is PHP
it's little bit tough obviously people
are going to pay you a lot of them if
you can do exceptionally well in the PHP
people aren't going to pay you a lot so
trust me programming is not that much
easy what you are thinking of course I'm
not saying it's either toppers one on
the planet but yes it does require some
amount of time it requires a lot of
practice it requires a lot of discipline
and it's required a lot of regularity of
the world make sure you keep these three
things always in mind it's not that much
the taste
someday I'm going to buy a book or maybe
I'll take an online course and I will be
through of the programming it doesn't
work like that I hope you understand
that now saying that it's not completely
like that you cannot even learn that of
course it's going to take some time but
with a proper trainer there who can
train you guide you properly and with
some good amount of books good amount of
online courses you can definitely master
and of course when you learn everything
implementing that knowledge comes on to
the top now let's also come on to our
question number two which is our
programming jobs always like that it's
because when you look at the newspapers
or magazines you see the tool is saying
that much that much amount of money or
Facebook is paying that much of amount
of money like is so cool there they
gives you Playstations to hang out or
beanbags or cool environment three foods
and everything so try to imagine this if
the job of the programmer would be so
much easier so much relaxing why these
companies are paying so much for just
the entertainment of the programmers
simply because it's not easy in the job
field in the
now just take any of the programmer who
lives near value and ask him that what
he's thinking right now and probably
he's actually thinking let me tell you
what he is thinking he might be thinking
about the problem of the office that he
couldn't solve there now company's not
forcing him to just take that problem
but it's it's kind of a programmer thing
you cannot get rid of those problems
that you are not being able to solve in
the office and that kind of mental
pressure is quite high in the
programming environments and I'm not
saying this is the environment in Google
or Facebook
it's a programmer thing even I get
sometimes tensed over the things when
I'm not able to solve some problem so
it's okay and since the problem and the
at the kind of a pressure that is high
in the in the places like Google and
Facebook that is why they are paying you
such a good amount of money you're
getting all those entertainment things
like Playstations and people who'd send
ping bags and whatever you call that so
all I'm saying that it's not an easy job
that you are getting lucrative in here
the conditions are tough of course it's
very more comfortable job from from a
point of construction worker view
because the construction worker has to
do a lot of hard work and we should all
respect that but sitting in an AC office
is comparatively easier job of course
there is a lot of pressure in there and
if you're just getting started
programming because you think that this
easy job I'll make quick money it
doesn't work like that ok stay on the
real ground programming definitely can
be learned by anybody there are no
pretty good prerequisite there but of
course it's not the easiest job on the
planet so think twice we are going there
now you might consider this movie
intarsia say it is guys demotivating
there no I'm not be evaluating anybody
I'm just trying to stay there that
actual ground on which everybody should
be standing it's a dedicated job it's a
hard-working job so you should be
hard-working and you should be
disciplined you should be a person who
can practice a lot ok so with this I'll
say that if this video was good you
think that this is good make sure that
you give it a thumbs up there and if it
that this video can be helpful for
somebody make sure you share it and I'll
surely catch you up in the next video
but this is a quick announcement as well
now you can post up your questions in
the comment section below I check out
all of them so in case there is some
question that is bothering you make sure
you post it down there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
