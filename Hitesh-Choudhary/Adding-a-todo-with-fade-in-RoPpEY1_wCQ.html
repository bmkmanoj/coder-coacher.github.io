friend from YouTube and learned code
online he - back with another video and
today we're gonna be talking about this
add item button so if we go back in here
we can see that our application hit a
quick reload there has all these add
items and all of these things now what
is the plan the plan of action is really
simple we want to first of all grab the
input from this input field and then as
soon as I click on add button we want to
grab it add it onto this particular list
so there will be add it will be added up
to at the top and of course if you
remember it will be added with the
opacity 0 then we'll be learning about a
simple set timeout function in
JavaScript which can be called after
given amount of time probably one second
two second one millisecond and however
you really want to go ahead with that so
if I just on to Google and look for the
function which is set timeout and J s of
course MD N and we can look for this
resource set timeout and this is a
pretty good function and notice it just
if I can have a simple example of it
that would be better and yeah there we
go so we can just pass on any time in
here simply based on that you can read
more about it you can just mention a
piece of time and I guess it is on
milliseconds I believe so
if I'm wrong please correct me - here
it's being long that I've read this
documentation I'm pretty sure it's in
the millisecond so we can just assign
some other time there and if I can find
it out a little bit and let me just
search that yes it is in the
milliseconds okay so there we go so
pretty good so we're gonna be using this
set timeout function to just simply
assign a new property which is going to
be our this property let me show you
that so in the CSS we do have this
bottom property which says visual so
we'll be assigning that so that opacity
becomes 1 make sure you have used this
important otherwise it may work may not
work okay
in order to avoid further confusion let
me also walk you through that how our
list item is being designed so if I
click on to this notice first and
foremost we do
have a ul inside this ul we have to
create a list item okay that's the first
tab inside the list item I do have
couple of things first of all we have an
input tag which has a type of checkbox
and IDs check and then we have a label
which is go to Jim yes I know some
people like to put label around this
input so that when user click even on
the go to Jim it just gets check mark
but that's not how we have designed it
we could have do that we could have done
that
no big deal notice again as I mentioned
first of all we have to create this list
item then to item inside it which is
input and label and then put it just in
the UL okay and what we can do is how he
can just use a method which is inside
this ul we can use insert be for yes we
there is a method call and said before
and we can command it to insert before
Li and especially we can mention that ul
and we can mention that your child node
which is number 0 always era starts from
0 so before this child are 0 you can add
it there if you want to use a pen that's
fine too but it's gonna add it at the
bottom so no big deal there as well
use it however you like no big deal ok
we can remove this console.log we don't
need it at all first and foremost how
we're gonna take it down first of all I
need input so I'll be grabbing the input
I wrote it correctly as input from
document dot get element by ID and I
will be using input now I highly
recommend you to use the query selector
if you want to him just do it here it's
I'm not gonna make much difference in
here okay and so there we go and the
second thing that we need is we need to
grab this value from it so we're gonna
say var we can call it as item or maybe
my value or whatever you like this is
gonna come up from input dot value so
there we go
value there we go that's it that's all
what we need so now we do have value of
it we will also need to get the list as
well so we're gonna call this as
unordered list it would be great if we
would have grabbed this
at the top we have actually grabbed it
all all the way at the top but actually
we can grab it again
or probably can use that for one I'm
really confused here so let's just grab
it again we will figure it out later on
on the go so get element by ID and we
are gonna grab the list I'm pretty sure
we are undoing it unnecessarily we have
used it about we could have just called
it and also what we want to do is we
want to create a simply text text node
there and this text node is going to be
created by document dot create text node
and this text node will have a simple
variable which is gonna be item whatever
you have called this value in here okay
so what we have done is we have created
a text node which is having the item so
whatever the user has input we have
actually grabbed that into this text
node so whenever we will be creating a
new input box in here just like this one
Li and inside the label we are gonna
just put it there okay so pretty easy
stuff this is the exact plan we are
going through okay enough of this we
have created almost everything what we
need now first and foremost let's just
make a check and an assignment for you
we are going to use if statement here so
we're gonna say if the item which is the
value I've grabbed from the input text
is actually equals to empty string then
we simply want to return we simply want
to return come on I can write return
return false so when we return false it
actually doesn't really work anything so
here's the quick assignment add P tag
and assign a value of enter your to do
so what you have to do you have to
create to do you have to create a P
element on the go and just below this
input tag you have to insert that P tag
and should have a value of this enter to
do okay so really no big deal and once
we learn how after some time we can
just set an opacity to 0 or 1 we are
gonna add that property or you can write
in your CSS to just remove that okay so
this is the plan and this is a small
assignment for you and we'll be working
on the else case okay so if it is not
empty what I really want to do is I want
to create an ally so I'll be holding
that in a variable I will be calling
this as document document dot create
element there we go and I want to create
an element which is of type input in
case you are wondering why we are
creating an input type notice we do have
input so we are creating this input
which is but I haven't mentioned that
what type of it should be so what I can
do is you can mention on to this that
what kind of checkbox and everything you
want I just did the mistake yes I want
to create an L I come on how can I do
that so we have created a li in case you
got confused just a bit there first and
foremost we need to create this li then
we'll be creating an input and then
label okay I hope I didn't may meet him
as much there so this is being created
al is being created now we want to
create a check box so we're gonna be
creating a check box and notice I have
actually used an ally directly here
because I have already declared my li
Abell since i forgot to declare the
check box that's why I declared it on
the go you can declared it at the top as
well in case you are planning to use it
much like that okay now we want to
create an input of type check box so
really simple we're gonna use document
dot create element and this time I want
to create an input there we go
now this input should have some
properties it should have a type of
check box and should have a name of item
okay just like what we are having in
here we don't have a name actually so we
can just ignore that but surely we need
to assign a type in here and also we
need to assign an ID of check this is
gonna be a new stuff that you will be
learning here okay first of all this
check box can be assigned this type
by calling the property type okay and
you can simply say that you should be a
check box there we go so no big deal
this is all being done now the thing is
the interesting one is how we can assign
ID or a class to any kind of this check
box or maybe a paragraph tag or maybe an
h1 tag it is really simple just name
your element in this case your check box
and then you can use a property known as
not properly a method which says set
attribute now this set attribute takes
two parameter a string kind of a key
value pairs so my key is ID and the
value that I want to assign to it is
check and I believe I called it as
checked let me just show you that yes ID
equals chicks so I'm just having it so
as many as you wish you want to have it
you can have it sadly it cannot take
more than these two parameters there are
some great solutions on the Stack
Overflow like creating a helper function
which you can pass on an object and it
will assign that but these are like
going around with them ultimately we
have to run this function again again
okay so now this attribute is being
created this is all first type we have
created a check box that's done and let
me just write some comments for use that
would be helpful
create a lie so we have created that and
now in here we have done is create check
box that's the second thing we have done
and the third thing that we are gonna be
doing is create label okay so now it's
time to create a label shouldn't be a
big deal we are gonna call for label and
this label is gonna be created by
document dot create element and we want
simply a label no big deal
okay so label is being created and this
label does it have any properties we
don't have any properties for it
although we can add some of these
properties we don't need it okay we just
need a property for this Ally check
which is my check but we can add that a
little bit later probably and we can I'm
just looking forward if I can check all
of that we can add property to this Ally
in a big deal okay now in this label I
want to add a couple of properties so
that you can just get to know about them
later on we can surely delete that this
is just a repetitive purpose so label if
I want to add any just use that set
attribute and you can assign any
property now you might want to use a
four here and check not the check for
and item okay now this is totally
dependent on you it has nothing to do
and I can just write a line this is
optional I just wanted to repeat this
kind of stuff to show you this stuff if
you want to leave this line that's
totally okay so we have created our
label now it's the fun time is add these
elements on web page okay so how we can
do that that should be absolutely simple
first and foremost we need to use our
unordered list and in this unordered
list we need to append a child which is
known as simply a label and then we will
also append in the Li let me just show
you first and foremost these things so
first and foremost in this unordered
list we are going to append a child
which is gonna be label okay that's one
job done and in this Li what we have
created we are gonna append child in
this list element which is gonna be
check box okay and in this label we want
to insert some things so label dot
append child inside this label I want to
insert a child which is text node so
that is also done and sorted now comes
of the interesting part which is Li dot
up
and child and inside that I want to put
this label okay there we go
that is all sorted out now everything is
being sorted we haven't placed anywhere
it so what I want to do is I want to say
unordered list insert before and insert
before actually takes two parameters
which is what is the child that you want
to add I want to add a list item which
is Li where you want to insert it I want
to insert is it into you l dot child or
you Eldar child nodes and at the very
first so it will add it before that okay
there we go
okay so quite a lot of stuff that we
have done but we haven't done one good
thing although I can show you that right
now doing by something like this
Li dot class name and I can just assign
a class name off visual okay let's just
save that and see if we are able to make
some progress or we need to do some kind
of maybe stuff like that so let's just
add an element we are gonna call this as
test to do and there we go our test is
being added okay and I know a lot of
people get confused in these lines so
don't get confused I cleared an example
in the previous video just for this part
so make sure you go through with them
till the line this year we are not doing
anything we are just generating the
elements then we are putting some text
node inside the label and so notice here
what we are doing inside the UL we are
creating a label and this label we are
holding as an ally so li dot append
child is checkbox inside the label we
are getting a checkbox
we are just append child actually
doesn't really get Li into inside that
it just append to it so it just will add
a later on what I mean by that is when I
select this guy this test actually
notice inside the Li there is an input
and then we have labels append child
doesn't insert inside the input element
it just insert after that element okay
so I might have
miss chosen some of the words so that's
what we are doing okay now so far what
is doing is we are not actually clearing
the input that's the one thing we should
be doing so let's just do that here how
we can do that we can simply say input
dot value is gonna be equal to empty
string that's it now say that and let's
just see if we have a test and to do it
cleans it up gets here
it just gets added just right here I
want to give some other visual effects
in here as well and a video is long but
let me get that so we're gonna cut that
out and we will be doing something with
set timeout now this set timeout can be
a little bit tricky because it uses a
couple of things first thing that uses
is the timeout so how many time you want
to spend based like it's usually in the
millisecond so I want to just get like
one millisecond or two millisecond I'm
gonna go for one and I can paste my code
in here so it will execute after one
millisecond this guy in here is it
really second I'm I'm pretty confused in
here I have to look into documentation
so when I say test add that notice it
gives you a nice feeling probably one is
like too much early I want to go for two
at least so getting back here test and
add to do and notice it gets it smoothly
not much smoothly I wanted to be like
bold faded out okay so there we go we
have done this my awesome to do and we
have added some visual effects onto it
with just said timer now here's a quick
assignment for you now we have learned
that how you can set the timer
assignment I hope you have done with
this assignment as well so now add this
effect on your P tag as well and after
some time what you have to do initially
it should have opacity of 1 and after
like 2 or 3 second the past 30 should
become 0 so that's your simple
assignment I know this video is too long
but sometimes you know stuff need to be
done in the same video otherwise it can
become much more confusing there we go
let's clean up the code I know I have
really cleared some of the variables
many time that's not a good thing I
should not be doing that but anyways we
can now do some kind of refactoring or I
can add a video for refracting of the
where we can make much more sense on
Twitter's probably this a lie I can move
it inside some part in here I would like
to always keep my global variables as
less as possible but in this case I
haven't followed any of the best
practice in here probably in the
upcoming videos I'll try to use that so
that's it for this video and let's catch
up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
