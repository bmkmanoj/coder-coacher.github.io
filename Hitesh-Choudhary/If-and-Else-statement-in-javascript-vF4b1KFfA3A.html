learn code online dot n check website
learn code online dot in for more
amazing such videos even more awesome
than this so let's get started and talk
about further stuff now you are at a
position right now if you have watched
all the previous videos and I worked
through me that you cannot call yourself
as complete naive or totally ignorant
programming you don't have some
understanding even you have created a
basic program like Celsius and stuff
like this okay that's amazing now how we
can proceed further and move from that
now the next goal is to learn how we can
write some condition based on
programming for example let's just say
you don't have an account on a website
and is still trying to log in obviously
there is there should be some code who
can decide whether to allow this user to
log in or not whether you are hitting a
subscriber than the you're actually
tapping it or not and decide based on
that
should you be subscribed or not so you
got the point there should be obviously
things on which there should be some
trigger and based on a trigger we can
selectively run some code so far if I
look at the Celsius or GS it's always
going to run there is no such thing in
this code which can stop even a single
line of code to be executing apart from
these comments comments don't run okay
so how we can learn and can have this
now this is all done using if and else
statement first of all we are going to
be walking through with the very basic
if and else statement then we'll be
designing a simple application is kind
of a thing for my own website as well a
kind of a base logic for that so first
of all how does it work it usually goes
with the if statement here and this is
how it looks you write your if statement
or if keyword here and then in the pair
of parentheses you write conditions and
this condition should either boil down
to true or false no exception here it
should always come down as true and
false now you don't usually literally
right here true or false you sometimes
ask conditions like probably three is
greater than seven which obviously is
not so it will obviously come as a false
or maybe five is less than eight which
is true so it's gonna come down as true
so the whole goal or the idea is to
somehow drill it down to eat
true or false okay so that's the step
one now even if in the pair of
parentheses there is a true statement
then only the code flow will go inside
these parentheses and we'll execute the
code whatever you are writing here so
let's just say you're writing console
dot log and you are saying something
like I am inside if block there we go
and that's it now you can have multiple
line as well and you can say I am still
inside the code block so as many lines
as you wish you can have it here as long
as the statements will bring down the
condition to true this is going to
execute so let's just run this and
notice I'm into a new file into the zero
to basics and there we go let's just run
that and learn that and there we go so
it says I am still I am inside the if
block I am still inside the if block so
that's nice now what happens if this
condition doesn't comes out as true it
if it has come coming out as a false now
that's also good there is nothing to be
much worried about we can simply write
an else keyword and we can have a code
block so what is a code block now
usually in most of the languages
whenever there is a curly brace that
means it's a code block now in some
languages it is little bit different
like Python in that you don't have curly
braces you just have to rely on these
indentation but anything inside these
curly braces are similar to like that
it's like a code block okay and now we
can have another code block so I can
just copy that here paste that here and
I can simply say I am inside not the F
this time else block so let's just say
it is coming up as a false and there we
go so let's just run this and that there
we go it says I'm inside the else block
now there can be another situation here
based on this what he can do there can
be multiple checks off like this and we
can check further here like for example
if you want to check something like if
and then you can have a code block and
then you can have your else here so what
you can do is you can just go back here
and there
so what we are checking here is if this
is true check this if this is not true
also check this and if nothing just goes
inside the a flaw hey this is our like
fallback situation and it will go just
like that so let's just say this is
false but this is true then what is
going to happen now I'm gonna say notice
this part okay because this is important
and we're gonna just copy this paste
that here and we are gonna be writing
something like I am inside something
like I am inside if in caps lock okay so
that we can identify that quite clearly
and easily so let's just quickly run
this and we're gonna see I am inside if
in caps lock now notice a very very
clear situation here now if anything
inside the if block executes we are not
executing the else block this is the
core foundation keep that in always in
mind that if you want to check for
multiple conditions you have to write
multiple if blocks here else only runs
when everything falls apart from the if
okay so we're gonna simply say let's
just say false here then we are gonna
fall into this block so I hope you are
trying to understand the code structure
here it's very simple so let's just run
that there we go notice this part okay
so this is all good this is all like
basics now let's just go ahead and move
on and try to understand the situation
here okay so this is a situation from my
website learned code online now what do
we do on our website is once a user sign
up on our website and if he verifies his
account immediately then we allow him or
assign him as a user or student or
whatever that is but if the user doesn't
verify his email for three days we just
plug him put him onto a blocked access
so that he cannot access any of the
content and we asked him to verify his
email first and then only proceed but
also let's just say on our website we do
have some teachers and teachers might
want to access their own courses so
there are a couple of conditions being
working out here so based on that we
have to write a simple code in which we
can design all of the
these features so it's gonna be simple
easy right now we will not be working on
the core features yet but still we can
actually design a simple flow for this
program to work on with so first of all
usually if it is a boolean I usually
like to start with something like is
active is user or is disabled something
like that but in this case I want to
first know who is coming on my website
so I'm gonna be saying who is here okay
now he can be anything now I do have
three options here it can be a user it
can be a teacher or it can be a
unverified user so I will simply leave
it as a blank or maybe say kind of a
spam user it may be spam it may not be
spam or not active user something like
that okay so you got the point so we're
gonna be working on that in a minute
whoo right now let's just assume he is a
user okay
now how we can write if block code for
that really simple we are gonna be
checking a condition and we are gonna be
checking first of all if who is here is
equals to no notice here is a classic
mistake let me do that first if user is
equals to e user now this is always
going to run true because remember I
told you that this is an assignment
operator
you are not checking anything when you
want to check anything you use the
double equal or maybe triple equal in
this case we're gonna be using triple
equal in the later on videos we are
gonna have a discussion about this
double equal and triple equal but
remember when you are checking for
exactly like it's the same object as
well as same string that you want to
check you might want to use the triple
equal in most of the cases okay we will
have a discussion on it later on so
let's just go back here and what we want
to do if it is a user we simply want to
go into console dot log and we want to
say something like a greeting message so
something like greeting message for user
and also we're gonna say console dot log
and we're gonna be saying allow
access to view all courses because we
have to include one more condition of
payments as well later on but that's
enough for now
now this is for a user that's gonna work
fine but what about if he is a teacher
ok that's also interesting so how we can
do that we have to first write else then
we have to use our if block statement a
code block there we go so what should be
in the condition it can be exactly same
like this copy this and paste that here
so it can be something like for teacher
and then we can simply copy this and we
can have like greeting message for
teacher and we can allow allow access to
allow access to his courses there we go
now here's a quick thing now if he is a
teacher if he is a user that's all good
but for all the other condition no
matter how the user is coming up I want
to do some other things I want to send a
message let me just copy that and paste
that here I want to send a message that
or something like this message please
verify your email or probably let's just
hit command shift D I want to say
further or maybe I want to perform an
action which you say is something like
this send user and email for
verification there we go so notice how
clearly we have now understood the
programming and basing and all of that
now let's just say user is first of all
the teacher let's just run this code and
notice it says greeting message for
teacher and allow access to his course
ok what about if we have set the user
variable to a user
let's just see what we are doing here we
are only allowing him to greet message
for the user and allow access to view
all courses that is absolutely amazing
now what if a user is neither a teacher
or neither a user he's just maybe blank
or anything else so what happens here is
if we run this please verify your emails
and user a verification Oh
so if you just type something random
here which doesn't match to any cases
still we are gonna get something like
this so please verify your email send
user verification so I always prefer
that handle as many cases as possible
but in case there is nothing to handle
you can always lead and down to the else
block so I hope you are now getting a
feel of how applications are being built
up how these logics can build really
huge scale application it's a matter of
sitting down and writing tons of such
code but yes there are better ways of
doing these situations as well okay so
this is all about if and else now here's
a simple assignment for you and that is
a very classic problem which is a grade
grade problem okay so what is the great
problem you have to match a student's
marks students marks and the marks range
is gonna be something like this if the
marks are like 10 you have to say
something like amazing amazing and if
the marks are like 5 now right now we're
gonna be going exactly we are not gonna
be covering range if you can cover that
up that's gonna be awesome but if not
don't worry too much we will be handling
that so we're gonna be saying good if
the marks are exactly like 3 this is
gonna be poor and if the marks are like
0 then we're gonna send a message which
is fail so handle exactly the same cases
here don't worry we are not covering the
range like 5 to 10 or 10 to that we can
do that later on right now we just want
to handle specific cases so this is a
simple challenge for all of you I hope
everybody will be able to do it based on
what we have learned here and shouldn't
be a big deal so that's it for this
video I hope everybody is now
comfortable with writing simple f &amp;amp; L's
code that's it for this video keep
visiting learn code online dot in and
I'm gonna surely catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
