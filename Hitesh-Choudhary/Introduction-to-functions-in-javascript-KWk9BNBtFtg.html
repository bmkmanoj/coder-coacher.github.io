learn code online dot n now let's go
ahead and talk about some of the stuff
which is little bit advanced than the
basics one now we can call yourself as
complete beginner you now have
understanding of arrays some of the data
types and how we can write if an LS
basic code now we cannot call ourself as
just basic programmer so we are now
moving into the stage where we are
calling ourself as intermediate program
and the first step that we will be
learning here is gonna be functions and
believe it or not from the day one you
have been using functions in this entire
course just to give you prove an example
we are gonna say console dot log we have
been using this for a long time this is
exactly a function now notice very
closely how this function is working we
just say something like this and we are
saying John here so we are passing
anything in this function and whenever
we run this function let me just try to
run that and I'm already into this
intermediate file I'm gonna say node 0
when function G is run that and it
prints a John very very closely observe
this because we are gonna be making an
error here and we're gonna be fixing
them up okay so this is all good let me
clear the screen here and now so far we
have learned that we can use these
functions now let's learn how we can
define our own function first and
foremost how do we define a variable we
simply say let name is gonna be simply
like that John so this is how we define
a simple variable okay what if I have to
put something numbers in it that's also
good we can do that now what if I want
to define a function it is almost like
that so we're gonna say something like
this say hello and that is gonna be
saying something like this function and
then you simply use a pair of
parentheses and then your block of code
is this the only way to write the
function no not at all there are many
other ways that we will be exploding as
the things will progress in this course
but this is one of the many ways by
which you can write the functions okay
awesome so what we can do in this
function you can do whatever you like
let's just say this is a function for my
website learn code online and here we're
gonna write something so let me just
write a log here so we're gonna be
saying something like this
a greeting message oops
message come on greeting message for a
user and we're gonna duplicate that and
come on click in here and we're gonna be
saying something like this hey
user okay that's it so we have learned
how we can define our function so what
is going to happen when we run this file
let me try and run this and you'll
notice nothing is going to happen there
we go
nothing happened why is it so it is
almost similar to something when you say
let name is gonna be equal to something
like John is it going to happen anything
no not at all until and unless you use
this name variable either somewhere here
like name until and unless it is not
going to happen anything nothing is
going to happen here okay so this is
what we have to learn that whenever you
are declaring your function there are
three keep a couple of important aspects
here first of all is the Declaration and
the name of the function in this case
the name of the function is simply say
hello okay then the function itself this
part is also important and then the
block of code what you want to do with
this function and finally you have to
call this function I repeat that again
first of all this name part is important
the second thing is this part is
important we will figure it out later on
why this part is more important right
now name is important this part is
important and then block of code okay
and finally you have to call this so how
do we call our function again reminding
you the example of console dot log and
you call this so this is actually your
function you are saying log and then
pair of parentheses don't worry about
what is console we are not talking about
it right now
this is the log which is how we are
doing the things so how we can call this
say hello exactly the same manner we're
gonna say say hello and pair of
parentheses and that's it this is how
you call your function so let's just say
we run that clear the screen and run
that again there we go and oops I forgot
to save the file and here we go nothing
happened
so run
that again and there we go greeting
message for user say hey user okay that
is nice and what about if I don't like
it yes obviously who likes this kind of
function I want to have a customized
message for my user whoever the user is
who is creating an account let's just
say John is creating an account now
notice closely here we are about to make
a mistake okay
so the first thing is you need to pass
on a parameter from this let's just say
John is here okay now what you have to
do your function also should expect that
somebody then calling the function is
gonna pass something into the parameter
just like console dot log expected okay
and here also you have to take that
parameter you can usually will call
something people call this as param 1
comma param 2 something like this it's
completely totally on you what you want
to call them I just want to call it as
name because it makes more sense and
instead of hey user I want to say hey
and whatever it is being passed on from
here okay so I'll be using my back ticks
and I'm gonna be saying hey then again
of course dollar sign and these pair of
curly braces and I'm gonna say name ok
now we have done a classic mistake can
you figure it out what is the mistake
that we have done probably not let me
show you by running this particular file
and then I hope everybody is going to
figure out what the wrong we have done
okay there we go and let's look at the
error it says John is not defined why is
it so yes exactly let me tell you why is
it happening when you run something like
console dot log and you say something
like this John obviously you're gonna
get error because what it is expecting
is to have you the strings so string
need to be passed on and here also we
are expecting a string to be there so
exactly in a similar manner you have to
either pass on it into the codes or have
to define this variable in advance so
that you can run it I hope you enjoyed
these small sessions where I
deliberately make a mistake because
mistakes actually teaches us a lot of
our programming okay now if I run this
it says a greeting message for user hey
John
now here's a simple quick assignment for
all of you just remove this
user and instead of that just go ahead
and we should be utilizing this name
here as well so I hope everybody did
that and pause the video when I got
stopped there if not go ahead pause the
video and do that quickly okay so now
let's move forward and just explore one
more stuff about the function it is
almost reputation what we have done so
far okay so we're gonna be defining one
more function here and we're gonna say
let and this is gonna be full name maker
okay and how do you define function we
just write literally function pair of
parentheses then the code block okay now
my function this time is expecting two
things the first thing is gonna be first
name then comma and we're gonna have
last name so you need to pass on two
things first name and last name and once
you have passed on we're gonna be doing
something like this so we're gonna say
something like this log and we're gonna
say welcome
oops not like this welcome to LC oh and
let's just hit command shift D to
duplicate that and now we are gonna be
combining this first name and last name
and we're gonna be sending a message so
use the back text and we're gonna be
saying something like happy to have you
and then we will be using these dollar
signs couple of curly braces and again
with a plus sign
just like this and we'll be using that
again dollar curly braces like that okay
so come on get rid and here we can
simply say first name and we can even
paste that copy and paste that okay
so what we are saying whenever somebody
calls this full name maker he has to say
welcome to LC oh happy to have you then
first name and last name okay now notice
we have to pass on this first name and
last name separated by a comma so learn
something new about these functions so
we are gonna call this here we are gonna
simply say full name maker there we go
so let's just say the full name is John
Doe so again John oops John
, doh I hope everybody this time caught
the mistake that we are expecting to
pass on string there if I gonna be
calling it like that it's gonna give you
an error I hope many of you did caught
that error so first of all is gonna be
John something like this and then
separated by a comma we are gonna have
doe there we go and we can even just
comment out this one line so that our
say hello doesn't work we can have the
definition but we don't want to use it
so let's just save this clear the output
and run that so it says happy to have
you John Doe okay now what happens when
you just interchange these things now
these parameters always expect you to
pass on the things as they have declared
in the function if you're gonna reverse
something like this like Doe and you're
gonna say John then obviously repeat of
that would give you different results
this time you're gonna get you have
reversed the order basically what I'm
saying is Doge on we don't want to do
that lets me just fix that up there we
go okay so these are like the basic
environments of function okay pretty
easy stuff and pretty cool stuff now I'm
gonna get just one more and we'll give
you one more assignment as simply to
explore so this is gonna be adder so
we're gonna say let my adder just to
prove my point that yes it's not always
about string you can have numbers in
here as well and this is gonna be
function and command Z function pair of
parentheses and then there we go now
this time I'm expecting to pass on a
number here so what do we do when you
have to pass on a number now nothing at
all you just simply say I'm expecting a
number or simply say num1 comma num2
that is better and whatever you want to
do in here you can just go ahead give
that now so far in this entire code
entire video we have been just logging
the things now we will learn one more
thing in here which is to return the
value and there's a huge difference
between returning the value and
console.log okay now usually we don't do
console.log usually we just return the
okay so what we can do is we can simply
say something like this let added is
gonna be equal to and we're gonna now
simply say num1 plus num2
there we go you have added those values
now you want to return that so we're
gonna say returned added so what your
function does is actually adding these
two numbers whenever they are calling
and just adds that okay it doesn't put
it on to the console so what you can do
is whenever you call my adder you can
just pass on in numbers and of course
you have to pass on to number let's just
say 3 comma 5 and previously we were
expecting that whenever we calling the
function it just prints on to the screen
now we don't okay so let's just go up
here open up our terminal and let's just
have it so what we are seeing this time
nothing how do we do it exactly the same
thing but previously we were just doing
console.log here we don't so what you
can do there are a couple of options in
here the first one easy one is you can
just log and inside this log you can
call this entire thing so I'm gonna cut
that and I'm gonna paste that and now if
I run this obviously we're gonna see
eight that's one way of handling the
thing probably you want to handle it
somewhere sometimes else so let's just
say you declare something like result
and then you hold it like that
and then you can simply have it like
this you can say result there we go
so both are exactly the same and that's
why I always say there are hundreds of
ways in dealing up with the programming
and all of them are almost correct here
we are using an additional variable
which is like not so good thing for
these kinds of small stuff so better
idea would be to just have this directly
in here if you want to print it okay so
quite in just video in just one video
you have learned quite a lot of things
about function and still I can talk a
lot about functions they're amazing and
they are being used in almost every
where in JavaScript so I hope you're
enjoying this series that's it for this
video with it learned code online dot in
and I'm going to surely catch you up in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
