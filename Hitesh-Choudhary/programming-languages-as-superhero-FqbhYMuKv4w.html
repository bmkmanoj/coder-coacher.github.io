letter app which does have some ruling
dices and it looks pretty amazing and
you can see that we do have some of the
amazing things at the bottom as well
some of the dices that I've created so
these are the graphic assets and years
this is exactly how the app is going to
look like and it's going to be
completely in Java and Android but what
the point is just when I was designing
this something just stuck to my mind and
that is amazing let's talk about it
so I thought that what if the
programming language would have to play
a character of superhero what did that
would be and who would be playing which
character now just before we move on let
me state that I'm not going to be
sticking to any one universe the Marvel
Universe or DC let's call them all and
think about what if programming language
would be playing a character of
superhero which language would be
suitable for which characters so I came
up with a with the many shortlist
because I wrote that down I just for her
like for a reference point but again
your inputs are really required to
enhance this list and maybe we can do a
part two of the same video so who would
be playing for Stanley now I would call
up the C programming language for the
Stanley because they share a lot of
theme characteristics like they are both
to the creator of many in fact all of
the things which are lying around in the
universe every superhero both are very
powerful yet not in powerful in the case
of just like other superheroes are doing
but still both are powerful and creating
anything or utilizing and everybody
respects him and yet he is serving the
purpose which nobody else can serve
still not being used everywhere it's not
like a superhero who is doing a web
application development or a mobile
phone development but you're still it's
the base of everything so I would call
Stanley as C programming language or if
C would have to play a character it
would be just something like Stanley
talking about the superheroes how can I
miss Batman because there should be a
language who can play the role of Batman
I would call a Python for this job
because both stays in a little bit dark
both are simplistic when they do the job
in their style it's absolutely simple
and to the point and also both are rich
and powerful rich in features are rich
in money or powerful as the holder
dominance as well as powerful in
completing any job they have a lot of
modules available or I would say lot of
bells lying around and surprisingly when
it comes to the saving of the day it
just a Python and also both like to live
sit in the cave with the simplicity and
blackish kind of environment which is
good for Python and also as well as for
hackers or Batman just like a scenarios
I would call Python as Batman now who
would be Hulk now that was a difficult
choice to make but I would call C++ as
to perform for the Hulk because because
of a few reasons when they are into this
simplistic form they are very powerful
just like the Bruce Banner is a very
calm scientist and have a lot of
knowledge is capable of doing a lot of
things but does a lot of lot of powerful
some people call that as a destructive
job but when it is in the form of Hulk
it performs amazingly and just crush out
whatever the job is being given and same
goes for the C++ when it's just normally
being used it's just okay and does the
job pretty well but it becomes when it
becomes try to become powerful like how
it can accomplish some surprising job
like Microsoft Office and there are tons
of software which are being designed in
the C++ so yes when it comes to its own
original form it's very powerful and can
crush the job within few minutes
now one character that is one of my
favorite but a lot of people just hate
it is going to be JavaScript and is
going to play a role of Deadpool now
just like initially JavaScript was not
meant to be designed of the things that
it is performing right now Deadpool was
also not being designed of doing a lot
of jobs which it does still poking
around everywhere that pulls us folks in
everywhere in the x-men universe or
maybe sometimes into other universes its
own any words as well so just like
javascript is poking around in the
server side with the node.js or maybe in
the mobile development environment with
react and react native so both are crazy
a little bit hard to have it sometime
but they when they perform they perform
extraordinarily and some people just
love the offensive nature of Deadpool
and JavaScript some people just hate it
completely hated so I would call the
JavaScript as Deadpool or maybe Deadpool
as JavaScript whatever you got the point
now comes to the Captain America who
would be playing Captain America and I
thought Captain America would be played
by Java a little bit old yet fitting
into the modern environment and modern
world a very reliable does perform the
job in its own way own ethics and own
manners very verbose always try to blah
blah blah stuff so just throw the code
everywhere in the verbals manner but
still they does the job I handles the
situation pretty nicely and it is a huge
fan list of Java as well as Captain
America so I would call mr. reliable
Captain America to be performed by Java
so that is that is what I think actually
welcomes to demand the iron man and both
loves red obviously and both are pretty
insanely powerful very very fantastic
and they both like to create prototype
as quickly as possible and and scale
them to a full-fledged project and I
would call Ruby for that both are both
loves red first of all that's one hint
there and after that a lot of prototypes
are being created in the Ruby and then
scaled to a full-fledged project itself
and both are rich rich in features
powerful not extremely we're both just
insanely doing their job and doesn't
care about the world thing or whatever
that means and simply doing their job so
I would call Iron Man to be performed by
Ruby now comes to the Spider Man now
Spider Man is a new kid in the town and
is capable of doing a lot of things end
of the date always saves the world it's
always fun to watch spider-man but
sometime due to its not so mature nature
it just makes things little bit quirky
there and doesn't really fit there
sometimes and people sometimes makes fun
of it as well I would call Swift for it
now Swift is a new kid in the town the
producer objective-c was much more
respectable and obviously much more
mature but it's fun to work in the Swift
it's very exciting to work in the Swift
and it saves the day end of the day it
always saves the game a lot of people
are orienting towards the suit but still
it has to mature a little bit just like
you'll see that in the fifth
I think version one they forgot to
include try and catch and in the version
two they actually included the try and
cast so it's upgrading every single day
they are getting mature every single day
but yes it's always fun to work with
them and love to watch it
they're always awesome so I would call
spider-man to be performed by swim
now there is also one rule that I would
like to assign somebody that rule would
be of black widow now the job of the
black widow is not to lift up heavy
objects or perform like it's by
spider-man or iron man the job of Black
Widow mainly is to pick up some
information insider information that is
useful and can pass them to some
superhero I would call reg X for that
now there are a couple of reasons behind
that because reg X in itself is another
programming language just like super the
black video is not a superhero in itself
she's just doing the job of getting the
information valuable information from a
lot of information and just passing them
to some superhero and just like that
regular expression is the thing which
just takes the information from a dump
of data and pass that to some superhero
maybe JavaScript maybe Java maybe Python
or other superhero what you call that so
this is the quick list that I have
compiled up for programming language as
superhero now what I want you to do is
go ahead in the comment section and
notify how do you like this video and do
you agree with my list and if there is
some superhero that is missing and you
think that this programming language can
play the role of this superhero notify
me in the comment section along with
some some thoughts that why you think so
and probably we can do a part two of
this video because this is super fun
super fun to even think about that how
the things can be molded into
programming and superhero and that's it
for this video and I will catch you up
in the next one of course I'll be
looking down in the comment section
