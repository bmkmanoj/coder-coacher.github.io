Stacy there okay looks good
waiting for the people to show up and
I'm live again and this is not a random
live I throwed up the email early in the
morning but I'll be going live again and
I hope many of you just waited in here
so in case some of you are thinking that
hey this guy goes live every time
without any information or just goes
live
now it's not like that I usually throw
up email in your inbox so in case you
haven't yet subscribed to my email list
there
go ahead go to my Facebook page it is
show three page and look out for life
code and there you can submit your email
okay so a lot of people are saying so
hey such in a Akash a be Akash pal cache
rude rape hey a lot of people somewhat
blurry yeah I can understand the
starting part was little bit bloody
because it was a little bit on the low
end connection but it's it's it should
be good now and stylish Raghu I like
your name stylish pretty good stylish
there so please suggest Java project say
you can build up billing systems in Java
that would be good our media players
would be good and building of media
players is always a good idea as a get
started project in Java
okay so hello hello hello everybody
and the Veen says hello I met hello
shake hello Sachin where do you stay I
as I told you in the previous live Q&amp;amp;A
session I live in a beautiful city of
Jaipur so that's it
why don't you update the timing on
community page I should have been doing
that but this is actually that this is
the question by ion I would shortly do
that from the next time on the community
page but rather I like to go from the
emails because these are the test runs
then
want to do before I start up live coding
session so I'm planning to do a lot of
live coding sessions on things like Java
making Android apps making iOS apps and
bootstrap and firebase and a lot of
things so what I'm doing is trying in
here is to make sure that the setup
looks good and then further I can show
up on to the live code session where you
can open up your editor at your home and
I can just open up my editor and we can
together do some like coding session so
that would be pretty awesome I think so
okay so taxi is hey sir hey there
everyone please mail me opencart project
demo so hey pal case I don't do these
kinds of things I don't send usually
projects that I make I put up them in my
courses or on the github I don't make
special projects just to send people in
case you need something then you're
looking for up you can always show me up
there I can put your code there and we
can talk about that but again I don't
have every project in the earth so I
make them okay so let's go the quality
is okay now but hey stream paused okay
swimming sometimes does pause because of
the low connections in here I'm trying
my best to get out there and it's a is
for connections sometime I don't know
why but sometime it just does the things
so let me just go there okay so now it
should should look good and sir I'm a
big fan of your technical content thank
you so much grunty it's it's awesome
there to have people who actually
understand what the technical things are
actually and what programming is all
about so I call people technical only
they never programming some stuff that
they can code and that that's
programming definition for me so I
recently faced trouble in constant
layouts what can I do okay this is a
very interesting question actually
because having constant layers ok there
are some okay where is that a constant
is something that bugs you off in
everywhere whether it's an iOS developer
remember still my early days in iOS
development when constraints actually
bug me off really really annoying things
in here but uh it is something that you
learn on the go there's no such tutorial
or anything that can get you there
but one thing I would say just pack
everything into a bigger container and
try to move things there so that that
can be helpful but again in the recent
days with the react native things have
been solved because now flexbox is in
there and with the flexbox arranging the
things on any screen size is much much
more easier I'll show you what I mean by
react native and flexbox things there
maybe soon soon in the video we'll do
that ok is there any point of learning
which will be 6 6 in 2k 17 hey and kit
are not that familiar with the
windows-based technology I like to be
stay in the open servers and what's
currently in demand perhaps perhaps I'm
not saying it's not in demand perhaps it
might be but I haven't got into any big
or high value high money project in the
Visual Basic 6 maybe in that so that's
why I'm not fully aware of it I usually
like to go into technology which are
tougher because tougher things gets you
more money and it's far more competitive
and challenging so that's why I go with
that so III have no planning to go with
the Visual Basic 6 if you'll ask me
whether I would like to go for it
absolutely now and we'll say hi so
thanks for giving your valuable time
hey and mood I have just caught up your
request in the last video and I have
made a video that I've just published so
you can watch that after this live ok so
make sure you post down your comments as
well because I look out for each and
every one of them pick up a few of them
which are which I think that can be used
for the next video ok so post these
things and what are the uses of Python
programming now this is interesting
Python can be used for I guess pretty
much everything it can be used for
scripting you might want to use in
Django for web development there is a TK
intern which can be used for GUI
development for for anything so I would
say starting from the big data analysis
to artificial intelligence see it can be
used pretty much everywhere so it's a
very versatile language and Arjun says
is w3s is enough for learning
programming
I'm not a big fan of w3 schools because
of their syntax and explanation of the
things they just try to just catch up
the things very quickly and just present
demos there I prefer Mozilla developer
Network because it's very more
expressive than w3 schools so my
preferred choice is go for Mozilla
developer Network for learning
programming like HTML or JavaScript just
like that ok how will be the career
growth of an iOS developer please please
suggest me I guess Development is always
been in demand
it's nowhere going on off in the future
as well so I would say yep it's it's
gonna be full in demand but you need to
go a little bit deeper in the iOS like
simple to do the app will not work you
need to go deep into the firebase some
of the social apps that you need to
build up or maybe app like uber clone
and everything so that you can prove
that yes you can work very versatile on
everything so that's what I would say
and I want your opinion if if anybody
want help relate it to Java
I'm not getting what you are trying to
say but maybe you can be little bit more
X expressive there convert convert I'm
not getting you sorry for that I'll try
my best
maths portion in programming that's
that's very little little tiny tiny I
believe a lot of people get confusion
that only with only with the maths I can
be a programmer I think that was because
there was a video by co.org which you
got popular viral and and that has got
one word that you need to be good at
maths and people just took it literally
and just God the day I need to learn Mac
but it's not like that yes in some cases
math is very very necessary for example
the suggestions that you see in IMDB
ratings
things that shows up you thinks you
might like to buy when you visit flip
cards and all these things do require
very regressive amount of mathematics
like your 48 equations for your
transforms and everything but apart from
that it doesn't require for a day-to-day
programmer it's it's a very high skilled
job so don't don't do the absolute math
is not that much important and neither
it's not that much light I would say
that okay
hater sir you look really like a hero
that that's funny no I'm not a taller
hue I'm just a programmer who like to
code and I like to share my knowledge on
YouTube and other stuff so that that's
all about it
Kelvin say hi from Kerala hey Kelvin
akela is very nice place maybe maybe I
can visit up in this August or maybe
July I'm planning a trip for Kerala
because it's lovely there okay and well
he says okay Mohini mow him say his
hi-hi always pronounce your name bad or
bad of me okay so how to store big data
how to store big data how you store the
rest of the everything's it just it's
just the same thing come on
okay can I take web to the print course
without graduation of course you can
take anybody who is able to handle the
computers like installing the stuff and
walking through with a browser and can
save some file can take any web
development course in fact I do have a
very awesome course complete front and
back and back-end development as well
you might want to check that out because
it's one heavy project-based course do
you work for some firm are you an
independent of the / hey I on I work
mostly as a contractor base I manage a
few apps for big giants which develops
hundreds of dollars every month so I do
that as well
I generally take some of the online
bootcamp sessions as well and also
sometimes when I do get invite from
colleges and university I visit them but
I try to keep that as low as possible
because I usually don't charge
universities for my visits I just ask
them for my travel and my stay and that
cost me a lot because I'm spending time
there and
the same amount of time I can spend in
here designing something cool so I try
to take that minimum but yes I do visit
colleges as well and peace from Italy
okay thank you so much for watching from
Italy as well I do have a lot of
students from Italy as well in fact
Italians are so much so much impressive
in in their JavaScript scale recent one
of my courses has got a batch of five
students from Italy they're really
awesome they like to study in a group
and all these they they host they like
to get up with me quite a lot so hey
from India as well so which one is the
best at now Ruby or Python there is no
such thing as best or worst they just
serve a purpose there so saying that
Python is top and Ruby or Ruby's top and
Python would be would be wrong it
actually okay so which technology is
good to start PHP or jeaious now again
it's a debatable topic but I'm little
bit biased toward the JavaScript because
javascript is far more getting advanced
than the PHP and the users and one thing
that that I like is if I'm using a
technology in the front and white why
there is a need to learn another
technology or another programming
language for the backend so I prefer
JavaScript okay but it doesn't means PHP
sucks PHP is good too okay please tell
me about pl/sql career yep pl/sql is is
is in demand and perhaps i can do a full
video and pl/sql and no SQL MongoDB and
all these things I don't use pl/sql and
all these things that much yes I'm aware
of it but I prefer to be on database
like MongoDB or firebase or maybe parse
as well so that's that's I like to do
and it is a set of suggestions for
perfect programming environment okay
that that's actually good Rudra the
Rudra be okay I hope you got that
perfect programming setup
I cannot tell about the perfect but my
setup is pretty decent I use an iMac
with system 64 gigs of ram and for
editor ie
Adam but I do have sublime text as well
for quick edits it's fast but I love to
code on Adam I code pretty much
everything in a time including Python
mostly JavaScript and that's it that's
it I had that that's it all the things I
use yes I do have a couple of simulators
on which I test my apps like iOS
simulator with Xcode and Android studio
is there and couple of virtual machines
are there when I need to do a couple of
set of things and all of that there is a
Windows that I have purchased and it's
still running in one of my virtual
devices they have but I rarely use that
that'sthat's all about it maybe I'll
give you some day a tour of what kind of
computer software that I use I do have a
couple of video editing softwares as
well I have I use Final Cut Pro and
audacity for editing my audios and
everything so that's that's all about it
okay
so video is interrupting okay sometimes
the connection get pores I know some
time it's getting poor connection and
all of these things I don't know why
that is happening for sure make make a
check of that okay Jakob another path
for programmer employee to enter penny
on okay so it's it's a good path
actually you are already stating Jacob
that being a programmer and working
somewhere is actually very very good
because you get the idea of how the apps
are being getting build up in a team as
well now if you ask me look I just
saying just saying that things in here
that when you see things like react
native why it's so much oriented about
components and when you work as an iOS
developer in a team you don't use
storyboards there you just delete the
story would straight from there so there
are a lot of things that you learn when
you work in a corporate environment
everybody just works in a different way
but again once you get familiar ization
with all the technologies and how to
build up the stack and how to create
your own app then being an entrepreneur
is awesome fun because the only thing in
here important is here when the client
says can you do this you should always
say yes and that you will be
to see only when you have a good amount
of knowledge so that's that's the one
good reason and solid reason until
unless you are able to say when the
client says hey I need an e-commerce
system you say yes okay I can do that he
says I need social plugins there you say
okay I can do that he says I need a
messenger bot in Facebook he says just
yes that's the key element of being
enterpreneur okay I hope I was a little
bit clearer there just completed your
hacking bootcamp okay that's good I love
that let me know the feedback as well
how you liked it how we can do much
better collaborations if you have
learned some things from there okay
there is no GSF perfect package solution
of course Calvin it's a completely done
thing
no GS is nearly perfect things fast
robust can handle a lot of users can
handle a lot of bandwidth there so I
would say no chest is almost almost
perfect there I never faced any problem
with an OGS it's it's awesome it's fun
and the course is awesome thank you
thank you for the feedback I love that
thanks for make video on the backend
really I'm appreciate for your efforts
thank you so much it's all for you so
that we can make up some true quality
people there who knows what the
programming is and who knows actually
what technical things are and what does
actually the technical things means okay
so what new technology to try dart or
golang now I think a lot of my friends
are going with a golang as well I don't
have any plan to go with the goal and
and happy with the JavaScript as of now
I'm moving into the react native quite a
lot so I would say I have to look out
for the friends why they are moving with
the goal and never had a discussion with
them but yes a couple of them switched
into golang I can ask them and make a
video later on okay please tell me
future scopes of Android developer
without CS degree high degree degree
doesn't count in I'm basically an
electronic engineer never applied my
degree there that hey I'm an electronic
engineer give me serious projects never
did that okay I had a master's but never
used it so it doesn't matter at all and
is there great future in web development
for sure web does if it is not going
anywhere because all these technologies
are
wallowing around the web so yes it's
always going to be an awesome future for
web and thanks for valuable information
hey you're always welcome it's it's one
thing that I do and I'll be staying in
here for 10 or 15 minutes more so if you
wish you can ask the question as well
and after 10 minutes I have to get back
to work ok and so no problem you can say
only Hersh how's that that that's cool
that's actually harsher than Arc ok I
can say that as well and her sad Bill
Gates okay I'll call you Bill Gates in
college for first year can we choose
JavaScript to do projects yes of course
that's the one myth that everybody
should get rid of because people say hey
you have to do a project and finally I
know that's that's bad you should not be
doing projects and only in file in years
you should be doing projects in every
semester that's one thing you should
keep in mind ok the more projects you
will done you will do the more you'll
get familiar with the harsh life or
programming and you should try that so
it's a project in every semester ok are
not not just once just spend two three
projects and in case you hadn't rolled
in some of my courses you see we do a
lot of projects we never finish up
without at least five projects that's
the minimum for us okay high right now
I'm learning I this testing okay I guess
just think that's that's actually a
little bit tough and I'm I'm stuck at
reverse engineering in hopper so any
YouTube channel books blogs that helped
me to learn from basic to advanced
testing for testing I have to look up I
usually look up for packet publication
because I do have a communication with
the packet publications there so I can
look up for some books for you right now
I don't have anything in mind so as you
know I always try to be honest if I have
something I just give that if I don't I
just say that I don't have right now
okay so pen testing with spirit hey it's
been quite a long time we're have been
busy pen testing with spirit let me know
what are you doing nowadays so tell me
about Android programming development I
what I can tell you about Android
programming development is the next
thing that I'm trying to build up is
building 10 Android apps
that's all I can tap tell you that there
is soon going to be awesome thing coming
up that says build 10 Android apps okay
so that's I can tell you next next in
the list is to-do list is Android so you
can be happy about that so have you
tried machine learning or deep learning
and what is your take on that
okay such it yes I have tried that in
fact during my Master's we do had a
subject about noodle networks and I
tried a lot in them unfortunately the
college was not that much practical
about it so I tried everything on myself
in fact being honest in here some of the
replies that you see of my Facebook page
are actually oriented by AI and I build
up a few scripts there that are hosted
on here Roku and that are connected to
my Facebook page so sometimes you get
reply from my chat bot there so yes I do
use sometimes machine learning and deep
learning all these things I shouldn't do
that because I should be replying by
myself but sometimes the questions are
so much common that I have actually
curated a few replies and you get those
reply automatically so yes I I do use
them and I use them not obviously
sometime okay hello is freighted wolf
okay that's good what was that case in
VIP it was a long time ago I used to
work for a lot of police department and
all these things so let's just say we'll
talk about that some days it was a long
story back and now I don't do that I'm
more into getting into development
creating things helping people and all
these things so tell me about SAP HANA
I have no idea about SAP technologies I
don't work with them being honest being
in here so ang a blue you can check live
Overflow YouTube channel okay that's
that's informative so how are you hey
Haylie Lakeridge hi I'm good I'm fine
how are you J in J Patel you need
jailbroken iOS device I don't recommend
using jail
can devices because Apple don't
recommend it and being a developer of
the iOS I like to follow the guidelines
okay but again completely on to you sir
video quality is decent than before so
that is distance learning is not good oh
come on that is that is a wrong
statement action distance learning is
good but again what you are doing again
it depends like if you are taking up
some boot camps or online courses it's
completely good if you are just getting
a degree enrolled in which you don't
ever take any classes you don't learn
anything that it's completely bad but if
you're taking online boot camps that
build up some projects then you learn
something then it's completely good and
in fact I did I do learn quite a lot in
online learning is like everything's
that you see in my video processing post
productions things about the camera
quality lenses and everything that I've
learned is through online boot camps
okay so how to make app like FB and
YouTube okay it's pretty simple the the
reason I would not call pretty simple
but yes it's completely possible
especially when you have databases like
firebase and everything it's completely
simple to build up the basic basic core
functionality your Facebook and YouTube
it's all about having a user sign up
users post some status and likings all
these things it's it will surely take
some time but it's completely possible
in fact I would recommend to go with the
react so that you can build up on the
web and then further on the react native
along with firebase of course so that
you can do that and jay patel and say
you buy this book practical reverse okay
that's good can i bike macbook air for
programming yes why not I would say if
you're spending that much amount of
money MacBook Air is pretty slim through
a device they go for MacBook Pro or if
you don't want that go for Mac Mini it
will be cheaper and it would be good
so MacBook Air is I personally don't
prefer it because it's expensive and on
top of that it doesn't serve that much
of a purpose but if you are doing just
web-based programming it's it's awesome
it's more than awesome ok I'm freshly
nice development have no jobs as a
fresher and how can I improve my hair
skills I think you haven't heard about
complete iOS development course in which
we are going to build up we have already
build up 14 apps once you have that you
will have solid portfolio there with the
14 apps I think you can drop me a
message I think you have dropped me a
message your name looks familiar maybe I
have missed your email I'll just drop me
another email there and I'll link you up
to the course there
okay okay Microsoft SQL Server 14 is
worth learning I don't work on Microsoft
technologies so I have no idea
absolutely I like to work with the
firebase and openness so no idea about
Microsoft and please tell me what I will
do daily to become a good program in
Java code daily that's that's some
simple but it's not okay so okay okay
that everything is going on so I want to
suggest you to our college for expert
lecture or workshop please tell the
topic which you usually cover in college
okay and kit I go for a lot of things
especially the cybersecurity the pen
testing that the things I go on I also
go for I use development and web
development bootstrap WordPress so there
are a lot of things that I do in here
you can surely discuss with all these
things in the email I also go for
becoming programmer in general as well I
do have an affiliation with a couple of
US states
universities as well for which I
represent them in here so that's what I
do
so you can definitely discuss with the
email and surely we can fix up some time
if that's possible we can surely do that
okay I recently make an Android app
which can download video and audio from
YouTube very easily can I can i upload
this app install yes you will surely
face some of the policy issues because
making app that downloads the YouTube
videos is okay but there are some
restrictive guidelines in downloading
the YouTube videos because this can
promote piracy so YouTube is very strict
about that I think you will surely face
some of the issues with this download
policy is there because the content that
you are downloading from the YouTube is
not your content it's by somebody else
that your
to download so I think you will surely
face some policy issues there but again
YouTube this Apple this Android store is
actually far more lenient in policies
there but Apple is really harsh on that
ok please tell one tip to become good
programmer code everyday and look for
the projects okay that's that's actually
two tip but actually it's it's just one
thing okay code every day no matter what
happens just fix up time like two or
three our code every day and within six
month you will you will become proven
that and yep mr. funny animal is also
suggesting code every day yep that's
what it is
thanks for resource okay I think again
what was the VIP K is okay okay come on
we can discuss that later on shortly
suggest me better way to learn Android
development better ways what are the
current ways that you are not liking it
I'm not sure what what you want to say
that
okay so bro that VIP video is so funny
you look like a spammer I'm not a
spammer come on I have other works to do
can you suggest we some course for big
net for development of app starting
language surely if you are looking for
is definitely I do have something good
for you
get me through email you can find my
email almost everywhere that's on my
website as well it's a shoddy calm
contact me there and I can show the guy
I deal with that and what is the feature
scope of web development pretty awesome
scope okay okay okay we have a lot of
questions in there I'm a big fan of your
looks
thank you so much I try to stay in this
look but recently I got a big beard as
well you can check that on Facebook it
was almost a six month long beard
enjoyed a lot there but I'm not planning
to do that again okay so please take a
glass of water and drinking you are
continuously speaking since 17 minutes I
like your voice very much that's a good
advice actually I do talk I try to
answer a lot of questions in here
because
I don't get that much life so I try to
answer a lot of questions now let's
continue for five minutes more okay is
Digby necessary for good in programming
no it's not necessary at all it all
depends how much honest efforts you are
putting in the programming okay okay
game development
Unreal Engine probably this this should
be a long discussion about unreel or
unity whatever you are looking for I
don't do that much of the game
development probably because I haven't
handled enough of the project so that I
can talk more about it I was just
involved in one and only one project so
far I'm looking for more opportunities
in specially in the unity field but
right now I don't have that much of
experience just one project although it
was a big scale project being developed
in the App Store as well but I'm not in
a good stage to talk about that okay can
you make can you create a video on total
web development guides to happen shortly
I can do that please make sure you post
these things onto the comment section as
well because this live chat is gonna go
away it's not gonna be staying in the
comments section so that's all about it
okay we do have a lot of questions
usually in college they will teach see
first bet can we do projects in Python
and JavaScript or we have to do projects
only in C it's not a compulsion that you
have to go only with the C there are
good other languages as well you can
just try with that idea IntelliJ
ultimate okay I don't know what that is
saying about maybe people are having
other other talks in there from
Bangladesh I like your looks okay I got
that Liaquat okay thanks from India as
well okay that certification really
important for freelancers now it depends
if you are on the website like
freelancer
then surely surely surely it's important
because it's not the regular
certification that you're looking up
it's the oriented certification on the
platform itself it's just a simple proof
that you know English you know HTML you
know basics of WordPress whatever your
