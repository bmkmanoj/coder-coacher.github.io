some of you might already know me and
some of you will eventually know me so
today's topic we are going to discuss
about the offline education versus the
online education quite a controversial
topic and I do completely agree with
that now before we even get started I
would like to say that I have been
teaching for an offline education for
quite a long time and I have taken a
huge workshops out there where the
students like 300 or 400 students in a
single workshop and quite a long boot
camps about three days or maybe for
three months and such like that and from
the last few months I would say last few
years I've been teaching in the online
education so I have the experience and I
think I am a pretty good person to talk
about the offline education versus the
online education the pros and cons for
both of them and which one is going to
suit you best
now before that before we even try to
take a preference over the online or the
offline let's get started with that so
which one do you prefer out there and
most of you might say offline education
but here's the new concept don't be
afraid of the technology online
education is also a great now I'm not
taking the side of any one of them but
yes all that education is pretty much
great let's take an example let's say
Kevin Spacey is a great actor and you
want to take acting classes for him from
him
not at all even possible because he's an
expensive guy you cannot afford him to
learn from him but with the online
education you can just pay around 40 to
50 bucks out there and can learn from
him that's the beauty of the online
education and try to measure the time
which you are spending on an offline
education let's say your class is of one
R and you spend around 30 minutes to
reach out at the Institute then 30
minutes to reach back at the home and
that's all about it so you're spending a
lot of time out there if I compare the
money you are actually paying around
let's say $200 or $300 for a one month
class and for that you get a one month
access out here while on the online
education some of them provides a
lifetime access so you are just paying
almost less than half or I would say
less than 25% you we are only paying
like 50 bucks or a hundred bucks out
there
and you get a lifetime access from that
instructor and some of you might be
saying that we cannot ask questions on
the online now that's a complete myth
you can ask questions in the online
forums your teacher is always out there
with the direct access and all of such
things yes I do agree sometimes offline
education are pretty good if you found a
good teacher out there now believe me
finding out a good teacher is not at all
an easy task
you don't just learn out there for just
one three days or five days by having a
teacher out there you cannot judge him
by three or five days while in the
online education you can take free
preview courses you can have a 30 days
money-back guarantee or some things like
that okay so let's sum up the things
which one is good which one is bad now
if I just say that you want to learn
acting classes or you want to learn the
photography or something like that I
would say start with some offline
education out there and eventually don't
forget to move on to the online
education and since we are here on the
technical talks let's move on to the
technical ones so if I say you want to
learn to code now try to find out a good
instructor near by your area who teaches
out the IUS coding I am pretty sure he
will definitely fail out it's not at all
easy if he is going to teach he is going
to charge really insanely so the whole
point is if you're trying to start on
trying to learn the codings out there or
programming like HTML or maybe say Java
I US development Android development try
out with some online education but here
is the twist now what you'll do most of
you will - will try to open up the
YouTube and try to search out from some
good tutorials I don't agree with that
YouTube's
are pretty good if they are produced at
high quality cameras high Mike's out
there and all of that that's pretty good
but a person is not going to do so
because it takes a lot of time lot of
money and lot of efforts to put out
those courses so those courses are not
at all available on the YouTube maybe in
some later on movies we will discuss
what are the best online platforms and
all such things so my vote is go for
some great websites which are paid so
yes you have to
a little bit to get started with that
okay
so quite a long thing we have been
discussing let's just quickly summarize
all of that offline education pretty
gate pretty great a good point to start
out there find out a good teacher invest
a little time get start with that it's
good and on the online education you
have a lifetime access you have a
complete teacher access all the time you
pay a very very small amount plus you
can re-watch the videos let's say a ten
times or 20 times you cannot ask and
your teacher in the offline world for a
ten times or 20 times plus in case you
forget out you can just rewatch the
video anytime so now you are the one who
can judge which one suits you best it
might be online it might be offline but
one thing I would like to suggest all of
you if you found out any workshops or
maybe a boot camps these are pretty good
in fact I still take the boot camps
where I like to learn I am a student out
there so I like to take the boot camps
in the workshop quite a lot but for a
long-term course that takes a year or
maybe year and a half I always prefer
the online education so with this I
would like to say subscribe to my
channel like and share the videos and
keep rolling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
