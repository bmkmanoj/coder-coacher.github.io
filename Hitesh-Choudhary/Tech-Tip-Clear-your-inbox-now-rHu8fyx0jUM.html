again with another video now you might
be thinking this is a different setup
and this is kind of a different lens I
don't use this lens because this seems
so far away see this this teams this
seems so far away by this girl I got it
it's so close but we need to get a
little bit closer okay this looks this
looks fine okay now I want you to
discuss something today now a lot of
people ask me that how you get these
kinds of opportunities like job works
and the some approach by the students
and invitation to the universities
colleges international trips how do I do
and manage all this now one of those
reasons there are many reasons behind
that I have good contacts and everything
but one of the main reason is I put up
my every word online now some of them
are publicly available some of them are
available only for the corporate some of
them only for the universities that's a
different talk but what I do is I try to
put as much work as online maybe it's
the website I'll put that on my website
or maybe it's a github repo I put that
push that on the github maybe it's a iOS
thing so I'll put that on github as well
maybe on bitbucket or maybe some other
accounts maybe I'll push that on the
Android store just like that
and one of the thing that I do is I make
sure that my contact email and the wave
I by which people reach to me is
publicly available okay because let's
just see you're making a website you are
pretty good at making website but you
haven't showcased your portfolio
anywhere then obviously you will not get
much of the clients there okay this is
super important if you're working online
your work should be posted on online
okay and important thing is people
should know how to contact you like my
email which you can see right now is
available almost everywhere on public so
this is how people contact me now also
also I want you to do something in this
video for me okay open up your inbox
whichever it is Gmail Yahoo Hotmail
whatever you're using open that up and
comment down in the section below how
many unread email does exist in your bit
in your email now I know a lot of you
might be saying hey it says 100 unread
emails
it says thousand unread emails yes this
is this is the situation but what I want
you to do
is clean up your inbox right now yes I
mean by right now right now and you
might be saying hey I do have 100 unread
email there from Facebook from YouTube
notification from some Java Web site
notifications some of them are spams and
just like that I want you to clean them
up because you have no idea how many
opportunities you are missing if your
email is cluttered there I want you to
sort that out because you might have got
an invitation from a client and after
that 100 notification of the Facebook
came up and that email just got buttered
you never actually got that hey this is
opportunity and I need to talk about it
you never thought about that it's
completely gone and you might God have
some client you might have got some good
sale or something that you are looking
for some offer that you are looking for
it's completely gone because you were
not active on your email emails are
super important the opportunities that
you get the thing that you really want
to get is super important and how you
get that if your email is buttered up
with a hundred notification of Facebook
so what I want to do is clean up that
these devices which you call these small
mobile phones the Android the iPhone
these are meant for these kinds of
things on the first hand your Facebook
your whatsapp these are all secondary
things this was firstly designed to have
a good inbox system and everything is
having the Gmail app for the mail system
is really good iPhone itself is having a
great inbox feature with the default
email it's amazing so try to use these
services whatever you like and make sure
your inbox is clear okay
so comment down in the below how many of
your unread emails are there and if in
case you are worried that hey I do have
thousand inbox email how I'm going to do
that select them all and delete them I
know it might be a bad idea because some
of them might be useful but how many of
you are accessing doubles emails
although they are they're completely
junk because they are buttered down
somewhere and you have no idea how to
deal up with them so make sure you clean
up your email today let me know in the
comment section below that how many of
your emails are saying unread email and
how many of you have actually cleaned it
up after this video so just go after
this video and
make sure you clean your inbox this is
super important otherwise field is
missing a lot of opportunities just this
in this video but it is important so go
ahead and clean your inbox now I'll be
doing the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
