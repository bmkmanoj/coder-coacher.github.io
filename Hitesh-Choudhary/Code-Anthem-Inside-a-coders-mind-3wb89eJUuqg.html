the name of coders programmers geek
nerds and some might know us with a name
of a call to God when you need to buy a
new laptop
we are coders we don't have last name to
get reservations we don't have even
first name to judge us based on our
religion we don't have a favorite
politician but we code to bring those
politician close to the people we don't
drive but we code to get you a right at
your home we might not be in the army
but we write code to investigate and get
rid of terrorism our code is not biased
based on white or black editors we might
fight over Linux or Windows or Mac but
we don't use violence to prove our point
we might fight over iOS or Android but
for both we write code so that food can
be delivered at your doorstep
we are coders we might not be scientist
but we write code to help humanity you
might call us non-social but we write
code so that you can get close to your
friends you can talk to them over a post

peace in world if you are coded please
