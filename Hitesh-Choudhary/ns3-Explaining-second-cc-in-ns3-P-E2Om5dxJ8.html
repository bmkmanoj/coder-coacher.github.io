video guide first of all it was really a
great response from your side and really
it helped me a lot in motivation and
creating these videos so let's get
started and before we move on to that
this is actually a second dot CC files
so before we move ahead you should be
aware that what kind of file I'm using
and what I'm explaining so I hope by now
you can open up the second dot CC file
quite easily and here is the simple code
I have opened it up in the G edit and
it's inside the examples inside the
tutorials folder there are a couple of
them like there is a second dot CC third
dot CC and quite a lot of them we are
going to discuss about the second art CC
files so I have opened up in the G edit
and you can see quite an overwhelming
coders out there quite scare you and
also but believe me it's the simplest
possible code anyone could have right
now before you move on into this video I
would recommend you to please go ahead
and watch my previous video which is
explaining the first dot CC file because
that was actually the basic concept
behind this file or even other files as
well if you understand that pretty much
good that would be really really great
and awesome
in writing other codes understanding the
codes what is going and what is
happening behind the scene now before I
explain what is happening in the second
or cc file let me move back to my
browser it is my website you can join me
up at the Facebook also with this small
beautiful button in the pew now what I
wanted to show you is this slide share
our website and our other colleague mr.
Rahul hada our sir has posted out quite
a number of presentations out here but I
want to show you here is the
presentation here is the link now the
presentation it's having the third slide
which will give you a brief idea what I
was trying to explain in the first movie
so what does it say it's simply
something like try to grab it like
something you want to build up a simple
computer it's something like that so
what is happening first we create a node
means
you just purchase a computer after that
you attach some nad devices and channel
on it now that devices are simply just
like you install a ether device or
wireless device antenna or something
like that
now you specify what channel it is going
to work on if it is a CSMA channel it is
going to be a point-to-point channel
wireless channel and a tons of others
that you want to have now according to
that you have to set the attributes on
it now what is the framerate data rate
and couple of other things as well and
you have to define the channel as well
as well the properties of the channel
now once the second step is being
complete the third step is to install
internet protocols on it now you have to
say that these devices should follow a
particular protocols that you are
interested or that you want to change
out so that's an important step as well
after that you assign the base IP
address of course in order to
communicate over the Internet or over
any kind of network IP address is a base
now it's it is up to you what you want
to do with that IP address it can be IP
V version 4 version 6 or maybe who knows
you want to create some other as well
because that's the research part for all
the PhD guys out there and after that we
install the application now the by the
term application here means you simply
want to put an application over it like
FTP or maybe a client-server application
or could be anything out there so make
sure that you follow up this chart this
is really a beautiful piece to
understand what is actually happening
behind the scene now whenever you are
going to create any kind of topology
Network anything out there this is going
to be the base of pretty much everything
so I hope you have grabbed it so far
now one more interesting thing I hope
many of you have already understood and
known about my web site new Demi com of
course the name is not a great choice
but it's it is pretty good and catchy as
well so you know and nowadays it's hard
to find the domain name so you can join
it into the ns3 course or pretty much
other courses which are also out there
so I'll move to my human to machine
which is the VM fear and let's try to
understand what is happening at the
second dot see see now once you have
grabbed that particular logic from the
flowchart it is simply easy to
understand this now from here these are
simply the header files no need to be
very about that if you are using
something like Eclipse it can import all
the files for you now here is the
topology what we are going to understand
first there is a node n 0 and n 1 now
these nodes are communicating using a
point-to-point channel and they are
having a base address of 10.1.1.10 1 2 n
4 is actually a LAN that is having a
base address of 10 dot one dot 2 dot 0
now so both are having a different
channel and this is actually a CSMA and
this is a point-to-point protocol now
let's come back below it and let's move
on to the main example here I hope log
component is not at all a problem for
you by now I have already explained that
now here are a few things that might get
you into the trouble but these are
simply peaceful now if you have been
creating any kind of code this is
actually the code reusability example
now here we are setting the boolean
value which is verbose you want to see
what is happening verbose is kind of a
thing which allows you to picturization
is what is actually happening as step by
step logs and displays being made so you
can set it true or false but I would
recommend to read let it be true because
it shows you a lot of details now here
is NC SMA that is simply a variable that
is unsigned integer after a little bit
and is having a value of 3 so you can
see 1 2 3 4 so 0 1 2 3 so we are having
4 nodes of NC SMA now this is a cool
reusability you mean you want to make
let's say 30 nodes you can simply make
the change here as 30 and the entire
code will going to be is going to be
work same so that's the code reusability
after that there is simply a log devices
command line CMD you can take the input
of verbose and and CSMA with the
command-line option or you can simply
say at the runtime so that's also pretty
simple to do and then there is if
condition out here that's a pretty
interesting and quite you can say tricky
code now here it says if verbose is on
that means you have to enable the logs
and there is also one more intelligent
condition that says if NC SMA is equals
to 0 then automatically put it into the
1 now why is that because if you want to
make no CSMA nodes why are actually why
actually you are writing a code so
that's a pretty tricky part so if you
don't want any CSMA channels why are you
making so much of trouble so set the NC
s ma channel to at least one after that
let's follow up what are HAP what is
happening out here first of all we are
creating a node container so we are
creating a p2p nodes create two nodes
p2p nodes and out of that what we are
doing here is we are creating a node
container vida CSMA node so we have done
with the p2p nodes now we are creating
the CSMA nodes the CSM a node is being
created and you can see here we have
told that create two nodes but here we
are telling it create NC SMA now this NC
SMA is actually the same as that you
have seen here so that means we are
using the code reusability and making
the code much more independent of each
other so that whenever we want to make a
change we can simply make a change after
that we are creating a point to point
device here so we are setting the device
attributes here you can simply say and
you might have guessed it right after a
point to point device what we need to do
we simply need to install that device
onto our node that's how it works if you
remember from the presentation so what
we are doing the p2p device is now being
put on to the install this is the method
how we do it dot install and we are
installing this device on to the nodes
again the next thing is going to be
again the same but for the CSMA now we
are having a CSM a helper we are
creating a C
SMA from it and we are having a channel
attribute in this case so once the
device is being created the channel is
being we need to pass on these are
simply the channel attributes and
channel properties after that we are
having a CSMA device we are going to
install the CSMA device on it and after
that we are going to install the
internet protocols over it so this line
from here to here is pretty simple we
are installing stag dot install stag dot
install for p2p nodes and for CSMA nodes
pretty simple pretty easy okay let's
move ahead now what we need to do if you
remember from the presentation what you
need to do is the set the base IP
address here so what we are doing we are
using ipv4 address helper we are
creating address from it and just assume
this as simply a class and you are
creating a variable or simply an object
from the class that would be pretty easy
to understand and then we are you
assigning a base IP address which is
going to be this one if you want to put
up the ipv6 then simply create ipv6
address helper and check out what are
the attributes that it takes and simply
pass on the attributes as ipv6 IP
address that's a pretty simple one after
that we are setting the IP address for
CSM interface in this case it was IP to
P interface now it is CS ma interface
okay so far so good so we are moving
step by step into the down and finally
we are on to the last phase that is
install applications on the nodes so
what application do we want in this case
it's simply a client server so it is a
server app being installed here that we
are installing the CSMA nodes and it's
simply a simple example out here now
let's move ahead now here we are having
an echo client also so this client is
also getting installed on CSMA and make
sure that you also remember this port I
have already explained what this nine is
you can change it also it's simply a
port address out here and then we have
got a client here and you can see the
server actually starts at one second and
it stops at ten second while the
client starts at two seconds and the
client stops at ten second and then we
have got enable pcap all and all that
CSMA file now pcap is actually a packet
file from which you can read with the
Wireshark or dozens of other tools of
course I'm not going to be talking about
the pcap I have talked quite a lot about
the PK files and Wireshark in my
security courses so I'm not going to do
that again here and you can simply see
at the end we have got a simulation run
and simulation destroy pretty exhausting
here's it for us but it's pretty simple
it's not that tough it is pretty easy we
the only thing that you need to be very
about is what you are doing now you can
expand this simple example into let's
say 20 nodes of CSMA of course you
cannot do 20 nodes of point-to-point
that is not a point-to-point
point-to-point simply means from one
node getting connected to another node
that's the point-to-point but in the
CSMA you can make a LAN up to let's say
20 or 100 whatever you want to expend
now one thing you can easily do with
this is simply to change the things like
data rates and this one let me just show
you what you can do here it is so
channel attributes and device attribute
try to play around with this leg take a
note of what happens when you change it
to five Mbps to 50 Mbps or let's say
hundred Mbps to five Mbps
does that make a significant difference
in the connections and all of that that
would be a pretty good example to work
out with so I hope it was a pretty
exhausting for you and I am expecting
that you will comment down and reach me
out with your research it's always a
good to know that what you are working
with and to have few words with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
