update on the live coding session and I
thought it would be fun to code along
with you and that is why we are
launching light code session and there
will be a lot of life code session in
some of the sections we are going to
talk about react chairs and some bites
and some of them simple JavaScript some
of them maybe iOS apps android app so
there there will be tons of things now
the best part about the live coding
session is you will be along with me in
the YouTube live and what I'll be doing
is I'll be writing some codes and you
will be writing the codes at your home
with the comfortable home that you have
so this is good and one thing that is
bothering me is when I have to go for
the react like for example the very
first life that we are going for the
code section is going to be a live app
of YouTube will be pulling up some
information using API of the YouTube and
in order to work with the react there
are some couple of things that we need
to or we should already have so the
first one is no GS it's available for
Windows and max doesn't really matter so
just make sure it is already installed
on your system the editor that i will be
using is going to be Adam and again
whenever will be going live there are
some information that I need to pass on
to so I found out a very good way go to
my page and go to my original page only
there isn't a lot of nonsense recently
so it's facebook.com slash it a story
page that's my official page and once
you are on to the page click on this
live code button there and you will find
a lovely quick three boxes so make sure
you just put on your email your first
name your last name subscribe to the
list then there will be a link on to
your email ID and you just click a
verification there as soon as you do
that things are good now I can send you
invite with the useful information that
what you should be ready what's going to
be the next live and it's going to be
super fun there so the very first life
that we will be doing is going to be the
YouTube API and we are going live at
almost around 10pm today that is going
to be the first live there I know this
is a very short notice that I've given
again there will be lots of life that
will be doing and most of the lives will
be project-based so I think you will
learn quite a lot not nothing to be
worried about it in case you haven't
heard about react to you or any
technology at all just code along with
me maybe you'll pick up the technology
on the go or maybe not there is no harm
in that you can just trust me on there
so again don't forget to subscribe on to
this live code on my page and I'll be
throwing up some useful information like
what is going to be next and what
information you need to have what
knowledge you need to have and that's
all about it so tonight at ten p at 10pm
according to indian standard time in
case you are in states or maybe kingdom
or anywhere else just make sure you
convert your timezone accordingly and
that's all about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
