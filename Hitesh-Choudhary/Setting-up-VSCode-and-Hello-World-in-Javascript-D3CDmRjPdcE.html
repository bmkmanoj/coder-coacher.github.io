welcome to the JavaScript section again
so in this video we are gonna be writing
our very first code in JavaScript and
before we even do that let me make this
statement very clear if you're not gonna
be writing code along with me there is
absolutely no chance that you're gonna
be learning code now regardless how easy
the code is or how tough it is you need
to write it along with me just by
watching the code you don't learn
programming similar to maths you don't
learn math by just seeing somebody else
solving your problem so go ahead take up
your keyboard and start writing the code
on actual computers so first and
foremost let's bring up our browser
we're gonna just keep it there for a
moment here and what we'll be doing is
we'll be writing our very first code and
I'll be using my vs code for that Visual
Studio code so it's really damn fast and
opening up ahead and I really like that
and I'm gonna uncheck this because I
don't want to see my welcome page all
the time so I'm gonna just close that
now here from this guy you can open up
your your package controller I guess
what they call it and you can install
few additional packages so you can just
search it in here and can install that
now you don't need to install like
everything but I would recommend you to
install one which is known as babel and
especially the babel es6 now don't worry
what it is you just have to click on it
babel es6 what it does it gives you some
syntax highlighting which is pretty
amazing and it's really fun to see all
of your code when it is color corrected
it's easier to debug your problems so go
ahead and you can see there are a lot of
lots of downloads probably like almost
200,000 downloads here so pretty good in
case you want to use any others as well
feel free to use them there is no such
big deal all we want is a color coding
their variety of other snippets and all
these things feel free to just use
whatever you like okay so we're gonna go
just here now it's asking us to open a
folder now we don't have any folder as
of now so just right-click on your
desktop create new folder and we're
gonna call this as simply Jes now I am
doing it as of now but you're not able
to see it because it's on my other
screen let me just
that for a moment and we're gonna call
this as J s exercise files okay now yes
I have actually created this is the
blank folder nothing in mystery here now
my screen other screen is just five K
resolution so that's why it doesn't
really record there and I have to bring
everything here anyways we are gonna be
just doing this Jes exercise here and
all you can do is you can just drag and
drop your folder in here and it's gonna
just open that up for you or what you
can do is you can just go back here and
can open that folder just right for you
so however you like you can just go
ahead and just do that now my folder
name is pretty long Jes exercise file
that's why it's here so just drag and
drop
I prefer drag and drop okay so this is
exactly what we are having and I'm gonna
create a new folder here which is gonna
say zero one basics so we're gonna be
starting with the basics now this
automatically just fetched up here hey
please don't tell me about the git
repository we can work on it later on
okay so the basics just open that up
notice it's selected and we're gonna
create our very first file and we're
gonna call this as hello world and
without any doubt yes we are gonna start
with the hello world before we even get
started let me also walk you through
with a couple of settings that I have
already done in my vs code so that you
can make the environment exactly same as
mine so go into your code and click on
your preferences and settings for
Windows guys it would be under windows
preferences and settings so what I am
seeing here is these are the user
settings so these are the common
settings so what you can do when we want
to change anything you can just copy
these lines and can just paste them here
make sure you are separated by a comma
and you can just edit whatever you like
and this is exactly how you edit things
in most of the later nowadays including
Adam or your sublime text are these
things not sublime text your Adam and
this guy so what I have done is I have
just made the editor font size to 22 so
that I can have like bigger size of the
fonts so that's easier to see all the
things so when I write things like
anything here it's easier and the colors
are so vibrant well I think on every
screen here
able to see them and that's the main
reason why I picked it up so I changed a
few settings here
I changed the zoom level to 2 and
editors fonts to 22 now you don't need
to have work workbench and all these
things just make sure the editor dot
font size and just copy them by the way
from here it's much more easier just
copy this line and if anything else is
written just place a comma and enter
that and just change it so pretty easy
not at all a big deal so there we go so
we're gonna be writing over very first
code and no we don't need to include any
of the HTML file or CSS file now we can
run them directly here so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna write our very
first hello world so what we're gonna
say is we're gonna say console dot log
and then use pair of parentheses and
inside the single codes we're gonna say
hello world there we go and semicolon
after that so there we go that's it
really simple line of code does nothing
at all but my dear friend you need to
have patience while learning programming
these simple things eventually get
complex and you need to just get started
from here save that line now the problem
is how we can how we can run this file
now if it would be attached with an HTML
we can just load that HTML it would have
run but that would like deviate our
purpose of learning the pure JavaScript
syntax here okay so let me just do walk
you through how we can run that now open
up your terminal there we go this is my
terminal open your command prompt if
you're on Windows I hope everybody knows
how to navigate them I like using the
command like CD and CD space dot dot and
all of that so I'm gonna go on my
desktop and in there there's a folder
known as Jas exercise files and inside
that I have a folder named as zero one
basic so I'm gonna go CD 0 1 basics
there we go and if I do a quick LS on my
system I can see hello world or Jas if
you are in the Windows you might need to
do dir to list the directories here so
how we're gonna run that now make sure
you have installed watch the previous
video and have installed a node here
just run the node - V and you should
have a number that's it no worries
about what the number or the version of
the node you have installed and once you
have that what you need to do simply is
node space and then simply the name of
the file make sure it's a case sensitive
thing so however you have named the file
you should name it exactly the same and
hit enter and there we go super excited
I know this is not really the best in
the world but still we are able to run
our very first program so we'll be doing
things like this okay
so this is all good in case you'll
notice not installed go ahead watch the
previous video and install the node
first of all now let me also walk you
through a couple of steps probably I
would highly recommend this approach
only because eventually things will get
complex and this is the best approach
but for some reasons maybe you want to
run that on a browser there is a website
jsbin which we discussed in the previous
video and we can utilize that as well
we won't be working on HTML we won't be
working on CSS just javascript and
console so just enable your JavaScript
let's disable the HTML you can just
click on them get the console we don't
need the output at all so what you can
do is you can type your console dot log
and just exact same thing and we can
simply say oops hello world there we go
and of course semicolon and there we go
once you have done that you can click on
this run and it's gonna say exactly same
thing so yes for some basic and easy
stuff you can just use this but my
approach always says go with the hard
way the actual way of writing the code
using the text editor and running that
so there we go finally our environment
is perfectly set for writing the very
first code from the next movie onwards
we are gonna be working on the basic
data type and exploding how Java Script
works and all these things so that's it
for this video I hope you are enjoying
this series keep watching and I'm gonna
surely catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
